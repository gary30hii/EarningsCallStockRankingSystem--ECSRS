All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker\u2019s remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Andrew Markwick, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasury. Mr. Markwick, please begin your conference.\nAndrew Markwick: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our fourth quarter and full year 2020 earnings call. With me today are Ari Bousbib, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Ron Bruehlman, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Eric Sherbet, Executive Vice President and General Counsel; and Nick Childs, Senior Vice President, Financial Planning and Analysis. Today, we will be referencing a presentation that e -- that will be visible during this call for those of you on our webcast. This presentation will also be available on the Events and Presentations section of our IQVIA Investor Relations website at ir.iqvia.com. Now, you may have noticed that when we issued our press release this morning, we inadvertently missed the quarterly P&L due to an administrative issue. We apologize for this error. This P&L will be made available in our slide presentation and that will be posted to our website momentarily. Before we begin, I would like to caution listeners that certain information discussed by management during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those stated or implied by forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties associated with the company\u2019s business, which are discussed in the company\u2019s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings. In addition, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures on this call, which should be considered a supplement to and not a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the comparable GAAP measures is included in the press release and conference call presentation. I would now like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Ari Bousbib.\nAri Bousbib: Thank you, Andrew, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining our fourth quarter and full year 2020 earnings call. We will review how we close 2020 and discuss 2021 financial guidance. I\u2019m pleased to report we finished the year with a very strong quarter. We delivered double-digit growth in all key financial metrics and once again reported results above our financial targets. This is although more remarkable since last year\u2019s fourth quarter was so strong. As you know, through all these difficulties here and as we navigated through the pandemic, we try to be as transparent as possible and provide visibility to our expected financial performance. In such highly unusual circumstances, the default reaction would normally be to withdraw guidance and watch from the sidelines, but as you know, we tried our best to share with you what we saw. We did the same at the end of the third quarter when we decided to provide our 2021 outlook as soon as we had some visibility, which was a full quarter earlier than usual. Today, this outlook has become clearer and we\u2019ve decided to update and raise that guidance. Let\u2019s start by reviewing our fourth quarter results. Revenue for the fourth quarter came in at $3,298 million which was $108 million above the high end of our guidance range. A little over 70% of these beats came from strong organic performance, less than 30% from favorable foreign exchange. Revenue growth was 13.9% on a reported basis and 12.2% at constant currency. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA of $735 million grew 14.5%, reflecting our revenue growth and productivity measures. The $25 million beat above the high end of our guidance range was entirely due to the stronger organic revenue performance. Fourth quarter adjusted diluted EPS of $2.11 grew 21.3%. The beat here entirely reflects the adjusted EBITDA dropped through. Our strong fourth quarter financial results were driven by numerous operating achievements during 2020. A little bit more color on those achievements starting with technology. Demand for our technology offerings remained strong in 2020. 60 new clients decided to deploy OCE last year, bringing our total number of OCE client wins to 140 since launch. As you know, at the beginning of 2020, a top 15 global pharma client began deployment of OCE in the U.S. This client has now decided to begin global OCE deployment for their medical teams, namely, there are almost 2,000 medical science liaisons worldwide. This same client is also expanding its use of IQVIA technologies through our HCP engagement management platform. We launched this platform during 2020. HCP engagement management works in conjunction with OCE to ensure global commercial activities are executed in compliance with all global regulations. In addition to HCP engagement management, you will have seen that during 2020 we also launched OCE Optimizer. OCE Optimizer is a real-time map-based territory and sales rep alignment solution, which helps our clients plan their sales rep activity and improve their marketing plans. Switching to our real world business, our real world business has been relatively well-insulated from the impact of the virus and it has strong growth for the year. The business is advanced in the use of secondary data, remote monitoring and virtual research approaches, which help the team pivot quickly to working in the new remote world at the onset of the pandemic. Our rich clinical data assets are key to our real world differentiation. The team has continued to invest in these rich clinical data assets and these assets now include over 1 billion active non-identified patients globally, and the team is busy integrating this rich clinical data into research. In 2020, we launched CARE, our COVID active research experience registry to help communities and public health authorities better understand the impact of COVID-19 on the population. We are leveraging this platform along with our vast experience of registries and analytics to partner with the FDA to support a better understanding of how people are affected by exposure to COVID. This work will help identify with symptoms individuals experience, the length and severity of symptoms and whether any medications or supplements they are taking affect the severity of those symptoms. It\u2019s a perfect application of our real world capabilities. Similarly, we have become the partner of choice around the world to assist various governments and healthcare authorities with large scale diagnostic testing and monitoring of COVID patients. This new series of offerings, which leverages our connected capabilities contributed incrementally to the strong sequential growth in our TAS segment. Moving to R&DS. As you know, the R&DS team responded quickly in 2020 to support our clients with the development of vaccines and therapies for COVID-19. We\u2019ve been involved in more than 300 clinical trials and studies for the virus, including four of the five vaccine trials that made it through Phase 3 and were funded by the U.S. Government in operational work speed. To help speed recruitment, we leveraged our direct-to-patient solutions, which include the use of patient registries and IQVIA sponsored advertisements. To-date, we\u2019ve recruited over 100,000 patients to COVID trials. The pandemic has accelerated the need for remote and risk-based monitoring and clinical research, which in turn has accelerated the adoption of our virtual trial technology. In total, we\u2019ve won over 60 new studies using our virtual trials solutions across 10 therapeutic areas, including awards with five top 10 pharma clients. The technology suite combines e-consent, telemedicine, eCOA and digital communication and in platform on health cloud, the sales force platform that is purpose built for healthcare and life sciences. This technology is being deployed to speed vaccine development and was an important factor in helping the team secure the two Phase 3 full service COVID trials that we are working on. The environment for R&D and outsourcing remains very healthy. Biotech funding remains strong, with the National Venture Capital Association reporting a record number of deals for the year. The pipeline of late-stage molecules continues to expand and is at an all time high. It is these healthy environments combined with our differentiated capabilities, that has resulted in strong new business awards for the R&DS team. Our contracted backlog including pass-throughs grew 18.5% year-over-year to $22.6 billion at December 31, 2020. As a result, our next 12 months revenue from backlog increased to $5.9 billion, up 13.5% year-over-year. We continue to build on our strong momentum in the fourth quarter, with the team delivering a contracted net book-to-bill ratio of 1.41 including pass-throughs and 1.42 excluding pass-throughs. We exited the year with an LTM contracted book-to-bill ratio of 1.63 including pass-throughs and 1.44 excluding pass-throughs. We expect continued strong activity going forward as our pipeline of R&DS opportunities is growing double-digit in both volume and dollars across a very wide range of therapies. I\u2019ll now turn it over to Ron for more details on our financial performance.\nRon Bruehlman: Thanks, Ari, and good morning, everyone. As Ari mentioned, this was a strong quarter to close the year. Let\u2019s start by reviewing revenue. Fourth quarter revenue of $3,298 million grew 13.9% on a reported basis and 12.2% at constant currency. Revenue for the full year was $11,359 million, which was up 2.4% reported and 2.3% at constant currency. Technology & Analytics Solutions revenue for the fourth quarter of $1,425 million increased 17.4% reported and 15.1% at constant currency. The sequential bump in growth this quarter versus the 9.2% growth in the third quarter was due to the COVID-related work that Ari mentioned. Full year Technology & Analytics Solutions revenue was $4,858 million, up 8.3% reported and 8.1% at constant currency. R&D Solutions fourth quarter revenue of $1,684 million was up 14.5% at actual FX rates and 13.2% at constant currency. Pass-throughs were a tailwind of 220 basis points to fourth quarter R&DS revenue growth, due entirely to COVID work. But you should note that R&DS delivered double-digit organic growth on both the services and 606 basis, again strong performance, especially considering the tough comparison to the fourth quarter of 2019, when organic service revenue also grew at a double-digit rate. For the full year R&D Solutions revenue was $5,760 million, essentially flat on both the reported and constant currency basis. Excluding the impact of pass-throughs R&D Solutions full year reported revenue grew 2.2%. CSMS revenue of $189 million was down 10% reported and 11.9% on a constant currency basis in the fourth quarter. For the full year CSMS revenue of $741 million was down 9% at actual FX rates and 9.2% at constant currency. Demand for field reps continues to be soft in the current environment. As a result, business development activity is slowed. But the businesses performed modestly better than we expected as our clients have largely retained existing field reps. Now moving down the P&L, adjusted EBITDA was $735 million for the fourth quarter, which was growth of 14.5%. For the full year, adjusted EBITDA was $2,384 million. Fourth quarter GAAP net income was $119 million and GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.61. For the full year, GAAP net income was $279 million and GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.43. Adjusted net income was $411 million for the fourth quarter and $1,252 million for the full year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 21.3% in the fourth quarter to $2.11. Full year adjusted diluted earnings per share was $6.42. Now as Ari highlighted, R&DS new business activity remains strong, backlog group 18.5% year-over-year to close 2020 at $22.6 billion. We expect $5.9 billion of this backlog to convert to revenue over the next 12 months, which represents a year-over-year increase of 13.5% and this provides a basis for our 2021 guidance, which I will be discussing shortly. Now let\u2019s go to the balance sheet. At December 31, cash and cash equivalents totaled $1.8 billion and debt was $12.5 billion. So our net debt was $10.7 billion. Our net leverage ratio at December 31 improved to 4.5 times trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA and that compares to a peak of 4.8 times at the end of the second quarter and 4.7 times at the end of the third quarter. And you\u2019ll recall that we\u2019ve committed to deleveraging between 3.5 times and 4 times net leverage as we exit 2022. You can expect that we\u2019ll make good progress towards this target in 2021 due to our double-digit adjusted EBITDA growth and improved free cash flow conversion. The cash flow continues to be a bright spot. Cash flow from operations was $750 million in the fourth quarter, up 29% year-over-year. CapEx was $176 million, resulting in free cash flow of $574 million. For the full year, free cash flow was $1.34 billion, up 61% year-over-year. We resumed share repurchase activity during the fourth quarter, repurchasing $110 billion of our shares. Full year share repurchases were $423 million. We ended the year at 194.8 million diluted shares outstanding and currently have $918 million of share repurchase authorization remaining under our program. As a result of our strong free cash flow performance, actions we took at the onset of the pandemic to access capital markets and capital allocation decisions during the year, we now have $3.3 billion of dried powder on our balance sheet between the undrawn revolver of $1.5 billion and the cash balance of $1.8 billion. We will continue to be judicious in how we use this liquidity consistent with our goal of reducing net leverage. Okay, let\u2019s turn to guidance now. We are raising our full year guidance by $250 million for revenue at the low end of the range and by $300 million at the high end of the range. The new revenue guidance is $12,550 million to $12,900 million. A little under half of this increase is driven by a stronger outlook for the business and the remainder is from favorable FX movements versus a guidance we provided on our third quarter call. I note that the revised guidance includes about 200 basis points of FX tailwind versus the prior year. We are also raising our full year profit guidance, we\u2019ve increased your adjusted EBITDA by $35 million at the low end of the range and by $40 million at the high end of the range, resulting in full year guidance of $2,760 million to $2,840 million. The change in FX versus our prior guidance actually had a slightly negative impact on profit due to the unusual mix of currency fluctuations versus the historic norm. So the adjusted EBITDA increase that you see in our guidance is more than entirely the result of a stronger organic revenue output. We\u2019re raising our adjusted diluted EPS guidance by $0.12 at the low end of the range and by $0.13 at the high end of the range to $7.77 to $8.08. This represents year-over-year growth of 21% to 25.9%. And let me go a little deeper to provide you with some color to help you with your models. First, when you\u2019re modeling quarterly revenue, keep in mind that the second quarter will be easiest comparison and the fourth quarter will be the toughest comparison. And within our adjusted diluted EPS guidance, we\u2019ve assumed interest expense of approximately $415 million, operational depreciation and amortization of slightly over $400 million, other below the line expense items such as minority interest of approximately $50 million and a continuation of share repurchase activity. Our guidance also assumes that the effective tax rate will remain largely in line with 2020. Our full year 2021 guidance assumes that current foreign exchange rates remain in effect for the balance of the year. Now before turning to first quarter guidance, let me give you a look at the segment growth rates for 2021. We currently expect Tech & Analytics Solutions reported revenue growth to be between 9% and 12%. R&D Solutions reported revenue growth to be between 14% and 17%, which includes 100-basis-point headwind from pass-throughs. And CSMS reported revenue growth is expected to be down about 2%, weaker earlier in the year and recovering later in the year. Now as in the past, we\u2019re also providing guidance for the coming quarter and this assumes that FX rates remain constant through the end of the quarter. On that basis, first quarter revenue is expected to be between $3,150 million and $3,200 million, representing reported growth of 14.4% to 16.2%. All three segments should deliver similar constant currency growth rates to what we saw in the fourth quarter. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $660 million and $675 million, representing reported growth at 17.4% to 20.1%. And finally, adjusted diluted EPS is expected to be between $1.81 and $1.87, up 20.7% to 24.7%. So to summarize, we delivered strong fourth quarter results with double-digit growth in all key financial metrics and that\u2019s on top of a strong fourth quarter in 2019. We posted mid-teens revenue growth for both our TAS and R&DS segments. Our R&DS backlog improved to $22.6 billion, up 18.5% year-over-year. We posted a strong free cash flow for the fourth quarter and full year, a $574 million for the quarter and $1.34 billion for the year. We closed 2020 with net leverage of 4.5 times trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA and a very healthy liquidity position, including an undrawn revolver and $1.8 billion of cash. And as we look to 2021, we see double-digit revenue growth, margin expansion, adjusted diluted EPS growth of over 20%, continued robust R&DS bookings activity and a further reduction in our net leverage ratio. And with that, let me hand it back over to our Operator for the Q&A session.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nRobert Jones: Great. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess maybe just on TAS, it seems like record constant currency growth in the quarter from the segment, despite the advanced management business, I\u2019m assuming, not really coming fully back. And if I heard you correctly, Ari, it sounded like a good portion of the acceleration was driven by real world evidence for the government. I\u2019m just curious how sustainable some of that work might be into 2021 kind of what\u2019s assumed in this healthy guidance of 9% to 12% in TAS? And then just any thoughts on the other pieces of TAS outside of real world evidence and the guidance would be helpful?\nAri Bousbib: Yeah. Thank you. Look, TAS, in general, has been more insulated from the impacts of COVID during 2020 than R&D or CSMS, right? So, all data, analytics, consulting, real world business were pretty much unaffected, and as you know noted, the only pockets there that we had -- where we had issues were the events management business, which essentially came to a halt. Now, in the fourth quarter the underlying TAS business return to normal growth rate. It had already returned to normal growth rates in the third quarter, I think, we posted 9.2% a constant currency growth in the third quarter. The sequential increase in that growth rate in the fourth quarter, which is about, let\u2019s call it, 600 basis points was entirely due, as you know noted, to the incremental work from COVID-related activities. So we expect this incremental contribution to continue about the same pace into the first quarter. Now, similar to R&DS, the COVID work in TAS has been faster execution and the guidance that we give you for 2021 does include the COVID work that we have visibility to, but I can tell you, there is no COVID work in the second half of 2021 that\u2019s built into our guidance. It\u2019s still early in the year, so this could change, right? It\u2019s not going to stop abruptly. But right now, the bulk of what we see in terms of COVID work in TAS for 2021 is in the first quarter, similar as in the fourth quarter and a little bit of sales in the second quarter and that\u2019s it. What is that COVID work, by the way? It\u2019s mainly related to projects for governments, essentially using our people and analytics to support authorities in the management of the crisis. The real work -- real world work for the FDA that I described in my introductory remarks. We also performing large scale diagnostic testing and monitoring of COVID patience for other governments, Europe and Asia, around the world. And we\u2019re assuming that\u2019s going to go away certainly by the middle of the year in our guidance. But again, that\u2019s -- that could be -- that could prove to be and I have an expectation -- again, it\u2019s not built in the guidance, but an expectation that we will continue to have similar type of work as we\u2019ve developed capabilities and really a new set of offerings which we intend to go-to-market going forward.\nRobert Jones: No. That\u2019s helpful, Ari. And if I could just ask one on the R&DS side, similar question. I know that the COVID work in the past or implications has been kind of a moving target, but just similar thoughts would be appreciated on how you\u2019re thinking about COVID versus non-COVID-related work in the R&DS guidance for 2021.\nAri Bousbib: Yes. So, again, just as in TAS, COVID work did contribute significantly to R&DS growth. Obviously, I mean, look, mid double-digit growth in TAS is not the new normal. We\u2019ve said TAS growth accelerated, but it accelerated to the high single-digit growth that we always anticipated pre-pandemic. If you go back to the guidance we gave, the long-term guidance we gave in June of 2019. We did expect TAS to reach high single-digit 8%, 9% and eventually 10%. But that\u2019s the underlying TAS growth business. Now, with R&DS, it also, of course, would be misleading to look at the R&DS business, and say, that\u2019s the normal mid double-digit growth. Obviously, it\u2019s hard to -- it\u2019s harder to determine what would have been without the COVID work, because without the COVID work, there would have been other business that had essentially been pushed to the right, right, in our MDS, as you can understand. But by the way, even absence the large COVID trials that we\u2019ve been a privilege to work on, we would have had very strong underlying R&DS services growth in the fourth quarter as well. Now, we expect COVID work to be with us through 2021 and maybe also into 2022, because there\u2019s a need for vaccines for multiple manufacturers to meet global demand. There are new vaccines that are being developed for variants of the virus. There are alternative vaccines that are needed in case of adverse safety events or quality issues or manufacturing delays. There are novel treatment programs that are targeted at specific populations and conditions. And of course, there are post-approval commitments to regulators, all of which do require continued R&D work. Now, look, we have a large backlog to execute, 22.6 billion at the end of 2020. We are, look, we have got the ability to execute on this existing backlog and that ability will continue to improve. Site startup and patient recruitment continues to improve. The next 12 month revenue from backlog has increase. So, all of this provides the basis for our 2021 R&DS revenue guide guidance. The pipeline of opportunities is very strong. If we exclude COVID opportunities, our pipeline is showing good growth. For example, the oncology pipeline is in the mid double-digit growth. The CNS pipeline is up low-double digits to at least 12%, 13%. Cardiovascular and diabetes pipe is growing strong double digits, very, very strong double digits. So we know if your question is suggesting that what happens post-COVID? We\u2019re not falling off a cliff. We have -- the vast majority of the backlog is not COVID, obviously. If you look at our bookings in 2020, every quarter except for the first quarter, obviously, COVID-related work represented between 15% and 20% of our services bookings. And for the year, I think, it was exactly 15%, 1-5. So we continue to book very, very solid good business across all therapy areas and we expect our strong growth in R&DS to continue even post-COVID. Thank you.\nRobert Jones: Great. Thanks, Ari.\nAndrew Markwick: If we can move to next question in the queue please, Operator?\nOperator: Yeah. Your next question comes from Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nTycho Peterson: Hey. Thanks. Ari, start a follow up on the first question, but I think previously you talked about real world evidence actually picking up as the pandemic lingers, just given that, you need to understand why people have more severe symptoms, a lot of vaccines were rushed to market. So I\u2019m just curious as to why you think that piece will drop off after the first quarter given there seems to be a growing need and most of your peers are talking about it being a pretty strong year for real world evidence?\nAndrew Markwick: Yeah.\nAri Bousbib: Yeah. Go ahead, Andrew. Yeah. Yeah.\nAndrew Markwick: Yeah. I guess, I mean, Tycho, I think, Ari was alluding to earlier. I think he said, look, it\u2019s still early in the year and this could change it. And then we want to get ahead of ourselves and bake anything into our guidance, but we don\u2019t have line of sight into our contracts. It\u2019s obviously a fast moving environment with the COVID work and its fast execution and we saw very good growth in the first quarter and we expect that to repeat in the second quarter of TAS. Ari mentioned in his prepared remarks at the beginning, obviously, we\u2019re doing work with the FDA and we\u2019re looking at how COVID is impacting the population and what kind of treatments and therapies have people been on or drug regimen have people been on, I mean, their symptoms maybe aren\u2019t as severe as other patients. And so we\u2019ve obviously got a seat at the table here. We\u2019re talking to government and I think that means we\u2019re becoming kind of the company of choice with other governments around the world. But I think we just don\u2019t want to get ahead of ourselves here and think of anything else. Ron, if you have?\nRon Bruehlman: Yeah. Yeah. I would just add, Tycho, that we\u2019ve included in our guidance, what we have direct visibility to, but this is a very fast moving environment and things pop up all the time. So it could change.\nAri Bousbib: I mean, look, yeah. It\u2019s just like. We\u2019re delighted to have this COVID work, right? I mean, we are super excited, because the broader picture here strategically is that these crises, as bad as it was, for everyone. In terms of our company, we\u2019ve been talking -- it\u2019s almost like this company existed for situations like this. All of a sudden, the sets of capabilities that we\u2019ve spent so much effort and investment developing, proved to be exactly what was needed to help our clients and to help governments, whether it\u2019s on the commercial side, on the real world side or on the R&DS side. And our relationship with clients has been strengthened. This -- our sets of capabilities have been demonstrated and we expect to continue to capture an ever bigger share of spend going forward into the very long-term in the life sciences industry. And we really are very excited by the pipeline of opportunities, again both on the commercial side and on the R&DS side.\nTycho Peterson: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then just two quick follow ups, I\u2019m just curious on recovery trends, where you stand in terms of site accessibility. I think it was 70% coming out of 3Q. So where does that stand today? And then, separately, I didn\u2019t hear you mentioned OCT. I\u2019m just curious how we should think about that rollout and any potential synergies with OCE? Thanks.\nAri Bousbib: What was your first -- your first -- what was the question.\nAndrew Markwick: First question was on site.\nRon Bruehlman: Yeah. First question was on site access and site access actually remained fairly close to the 70% number.\nAri Bousbib: Right.\nRon Bruehlman: We\u2019ve just learned ways to work around it. Although, we would expect it to improve gradually.\nAri Bousbib: Yeah. I mean, look, in the first -- when the trough in the -- at the worst moment of the crisis, we were like less than 20% of site access and that really created huge headwinds for our R&DS business, as you know. Second quarter earnings call, we told you that we would -- we had gone up to 53% site access. And at the end of the third quarter, we were at about 70% site access. And the kind of bad news good news here that we have not improved that metric, it remained at 70%. However, we\u2019ve learned to work around that and the reason why it hasn\u2019t gone back to 100%, frankly, is because of all these new flare ups, et cetera. But the good news here is that it\u2019s been all right, because the -- it\u2019s not so much we found with the number of sites, but it\u2019s really other metrics. The main metric we looked at the beginning of the pandemic was site access, because again, without that you\u2019ve got nothing. But we found out that there is a critical mass of site access, which again, we think is about the level where we are now, whereby our remote monitoring capabilities then prevent material disruption to the delivery of our services in general. We\u2019ve got site networks, relationships, we can work around sites that are not yet up and running for clinical research and today we can pivot much faster to remote monitoring versus when this pandemic hit. Now, if you look at startup activity, which is another important metric that we were looking at, which had also come to a halt, is now back to baseline levels pre-pandemic and that\u2019s extremely good news. And there hasn\u2019t been any major change from this due to the increases in COVID cases or the new variants of the virus. So startup activity, people have learned to work with the virus and it\u2019s essentially back to pre-pandemic levels and we don\u2019t see that changing. Patient recruitment, another very important metric. Obviously, here we lag site startup, but essentially those trends are very strong and the patients are returning to sites essentially close to pre-pandemic levels. So, again, we\u2019re very encouraged by that. You have another question on\u2026\nTycho Peterson: Orchestrated clinical trials, the OCT rollout and\u2026\nAri Bousbib: OCT.\nTycho Peterson: \u2026 how do you think about that? Yeah.\nAri Bousbib: Yeah. Yeah. Well, I mentioned that, in my prepared remarks that our virtual trials, technology has been really brought to the front here in the context of COVID. If you step back and think about what OCT is, there\u2019s really four blocks. There is the digital site suite, which you don\u2019t focus on the pin -- on the site portal, payments, ETMF. Then there is a digital patient suite with -- what the patient has to go through with e-consent, eCOA, that\u2019s where the virtual trial essentially is the study hub. Then you have the digital trial management suite with the CTMS, risk-based monitoring and then you have the compliance suite with RIM Smart and Vigilant. So the technologies in our site suite, the patient suite and the compliance suite went live during 2020. And the technologies in our trial management suite will be going live shortly, most likely end of the first quarter, beginning of the second quarter of this year. So, again, all these four suites, the site, the patient and the compliance, they are all went live during 2020 and the trial management suite will be live to be probably March, April timeframe this year. And we are seeing very strong interest on clients. We have seen an increase in RFP activity for OCT platform, not just for individual suites or standalone products, but for the whole platform. We are seeing interest on all customer segments large, mid and AVP [ph] and stay tuned. We\u2019ll report more on that. But the answer to your question is, we are live for most of the products and it will be fully live and operational by the beginning of the second quarter.\nTycho Peterson: Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you.\nAri Bousbib: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nRicky Goldwasser: Yeah. Hi. Good morning. So backlog conversion clearly improved even when we back the COVID benefit -- COVID project benefit. So when we think about 2021, when should we expect the backlog conversion to be back to that 7.6% over the pre-COVID level? Should we think about it as sort of second half of 2021 or more kind of like spilled to 2022? And then the second question, when are you talking about patient recruitment and the fact that you\u2019re starting to see patients are coming back to the sites at pre-COVID levels? Are you seeing any impact on how on trial designs, I mean, clearly right now still a relatively low percentage of the population is vaccinated. But as we see more people vaccinated would that impact how you think about trial design and potentially the pace of recruiting new patients to trial.\nRon Bruehlman: So, Ricky, the line was pretty bad there. We were struggling to hear you a little bit. I think your second part of the question was around patient recruitment and are we seeing -- expecting I guess pick up in terms of the population getting back and [Technical Difficulty] and people returning besides. I think, from what we are seeing\u2026\nRicky Goldwasser: So, actually the question is, if we think about it, are -- is individuals are vaccinated. If that sort of change how you guys think about designing trials? If someone has a COVID vaccine, does this mean that they might be compromised and can\u2019t participate in trials?\nRon Bruehlman: No.\nAri Bousbib: I don\u2019t think so. No. No.\nRon Bruehlman: No. I think it\u2019s all part of the general recovery that we\u2019re seeing and\u2026\nAri Bousbib: Yeah. No.\nRon Bruehlman: But the way we are seeing.\nAri Bousbib: It doesn\u2019t change anything to the design of the trials. I mean, it just another element that allows a patient to access offices sites or interact with healthcare professionals. But would be -- would have been the same with a negative test or a -- or somebody with antibodies. I mean, that doesn\u2019t change anything to the design, no. And then the second -- the first...\nRon Bruehlman: What was first part of the question, Ricky, I was -- we were really struggling to hear on our side?\nRicky Goldwasser: So the first one was, if you think about backlog conversion, clearly backlog conversion\u2026\nRon Bruehlman: Oh! Oh! Yeah.\nRicky Goldwasser: \u2026 in the quarter even when we excluding COVID. So when do you expect to return to the pre-COVID levels that 7.6%, is -- should we think about it when we model the second half of 2021 or in early 2022 time -- timeline?\nRon Bruehlman: Look, like, the backlog conversion is a really tough statistic to model out, because it depends on backlog burn, because it depends on how much we\u2019re adding to the backlog in any quarter. So what we\u2019ve tried to do is provide guidance to tell you how much we think it\u2019s going to burn during the course of the year, the next 12 months revenue and allow you to take it from there. Yes, the COVID work does burn quicker than the other work. There\u2019s no question about that. But we don\u2019t guide to a particular backlog conversion rate, because it\u2019s just too difficult to do, because it depends also on how much you happen to be booking, if you\u2019re booking a lot, like, we have been recently than obviously the backlog goes up and the burn rate goes down. But that\u2019s not a bad thing. So, yes, I would expect you would see a faster burn of the COVID-related work, which we mentioned was about 15% of our service bookings in 2020 and a more normal rate of burn on the rest of the backlog. And I think it still remains to be seen how much additional COVID-related work we\u2019re going to book as we go through 2021. That\u2019s still a question mark.\nAndrew Markwick: Thanks. Thanks, Ricky. I think if we can move to the next question in the queue, please.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Eric Coldwell with Baird. Your line is open.\nEric Coldwell: Thanks very much. I have one technical question and then more strategic one. So, first off, I\u2019m getting a couple of inbound asks on the FX update. I\u2019m just curious if you could maybe clarify, be more clear for us people who missed it. The FX guidance for 2021, is it plus 200 bps tailwind for the full year in total or was the update today that that\u2019s an incremental 200 bps since you first gave 2021 guidance a few months ago?\nRon Bruehlman: So when you look at the year-over-year FX impact, when you\u2019re looking at the growth rate, ultimately, if you\u2019re trying to take our reported guidance and get to a constant currency guidance, it\u2019s\u2026\nEric Coldwell: Yeah.\nRon Bruehlman: \u2026 100-basis-point tailwind year-over-year. Similar to that in TAS and CSMS and a little bit lower in R&D, maybe about 100 basis points in R&D.\nAri Bousbib: No. He is asking versus the previous guidance\u2026\nRon Bruehlman: Versus the previous\u2026\nEric Coldwell: Yeah. That would be the follow on is, what was embedded in the guidance a few months back, so we could just see the delta?\nRon Bruehlman: Previous guidance was 150.\nAri Bousbib: Yeah.\nAndrew Markwick: Yeah. So...\nRon Bruehlman: Yeah. Yeah. So, previous guidance on 100 basis points and this will goes to the 200 basis points tailwind.\nEric Coldwell: Perfect. Thank you very much for that. A little more interesting question, really positive trends here in the cash flow and I know it\u2019s been -- Ron, I know, it\u2019s been a big focus for you. We\u2019ve seen some nice improvement here over the last few quarters. I\u2019m just -- I am hoping you can maybe break this into two pieces. First off, could you give us anything a little more specific or precise on what\u2019s really driving the improvement operationally number one? And number two, perhaps parse out from that if maybe some of the timing on the COVID vaccine work and the higher pass-through tailwind that you did finally get here in the fourth quarter, was that -- how much of a contribution was that versus, let\u2019s say, core underlying fundamental improvement?\nRon Bruehlman: Look, it\u2019s good question. The -- as you can see from our cash flow statement, the principal driver, in fact, pretty much the whole driver of our improvement in cash flow -- free cash flow in 2020 was due to improve collections performance. And that\u2019s a combination of collecting quicker, but also billing in a more timely fashion and structuring contracts, so that we built earlier. And part of our collections effort, which we put a lot of focus on was bringing down our overdue receivables. We took our eye off the ball on that a little bit and put a lot of focus on that and we\u2019re able to substantially put a dent in our overdue receivables, which has helped quite a bit. And I think a lot of the processes we put in place, all of them should persist in the 2021. We have to continue to put emphasis on it. But we\u2019ve improved our processes and we expect that to continue. Now you did identify something that\u2019s important, which is that the COVID-related work did bring some benefit in terms of customer advances and being able to bill in advance that helped our 2020 cash flow. I would -- so when you look at our 2020 cash flow, as a percentage of adjusted net income, it was unusually high. We target more in the 80% to 90% free cash flow as a percentage of adjusted net income in a normal year. But cash flow is very lumpy, so it bounces around. We had a very strong year in 2021 amidst as a percentage of net income, excuse me, 2020 as a percentage of net income that probably won\u2019t be quite as strong in 2020. But fundamentally, we\u2019ve improved quite a lot in terms of cash conversion and you should see continued benefit from that going into the future.\nEric Coldwell: That\u2019s very helpful. Thanks, guys.\nAndrew Markwick: Thanks. I think we are coming out close to the hour. But if we can take one more question, please.\nOperator: Absolutely. Your last question comes from Dan Brennan with UBS. Your line is open.\nDan Brennan: Great. Thank you. Thanks for taking the question. I guess a two-part question. One was on OCE. So, obviously, continued progress there. I\u2019m just wondering when do we begin to see OCE show up in revenue and then you talked about the timetable that was discussed deployed and then you begin to generate traction on that with 140 wins to-date, any color about what\u2019s baked in the 2021 guidance and if not kind of when do we see it?\nAri Bousbib: Yeah. So, again, we continue to see very good traction in the marketplace. Obviously it takes time to deploy. We had 60 client wins in 2020 and I should point out, obviously, despite the difficult environment created by the pandemic, we continue to sell. Total 140 clients win since launch. We keep winning two out of three times against competition. We are deploying large clients which we disclose before. We have a global deployment with Roche. We have global deployment with Novo Nordisk International Operations, AstraZeneca U.S. deployment as well. We have another top 15 pharma deployment for a country in Asia and other top 15 pharma companies that\u2019s globally deploying for the medical teams. So we already have, I mean, is -- I\u2019m not sure if we should disclose this number, but we do have tens of thousands of users already. Now that did move the needle on $12.9 billion revenue company, no, not in 2021, but it is providing very significant growth. And certainly, it is an area where we expect strong margin drop through over time as we complete implementations. As you know, it\u2019s a -- the drop through becomes much more attractive when revenue is license driven and we\u2019re starting to see that, but it will continue to increase as we complete deployments and implementation. Now, we continue to sell. So that also will require implementation. And the strategy overall is the same as for any technology company, which is the land and expand model, and as you know, we resolve the HCP engagement management, I mentioned it. We saw the HCP compliance. We are launching additional modules and continue to expand. So it\u2019s not just OCE, OCE was kind of the centerpiece and then it continues to grow. Ron, anything?\nRon Bruehlman: Yeah. Yeah. I just wanted to say, I think, sometimes investors have a tendency to equate our tech business with OCE, because we\u2019ve all talked about it a lot and we have a competitor in that space that talks about it a lot as well. But we have a much broader tech business, as Ari was saying, then just that. I mean, across performance management, compliance, information management, social media, we -- your payer provider and then we have a growing clinical tech segment. So, just want to emphasize that the tech is a lot more than just OCE that for IQVIA.\nAri Bousbib: Yeah. Thank you.\nAndrew Markwick: Thanks very much, Dan. So we\u2019re at the top of the hour now. So thanks, everyone, for taking the time to join us today and we look forward to speaking with you again on our first quarter 2021 earnings call and we\u2019ll be available for the rest of the day to take any follow up questions that you might have. Thank you everyone.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Ron Bruehlman",
            "content": "Thanks, Ari, and good morning, everyone. As Ari mentioned, this was a strong quarter to close the year. Let's start by reviewing revenue. Fourth quarter revenue of $3,298 million grew 13.9% on a reported basis and 12.2% at constant currency. Revenue for the full year was $11,359 million, which was up 2.4% reported and 2.3% at constant currency. Technology & Analytics Solutions revenue for the fourth quarter of $1,425 million increased 17.4% reported and 15.1% at constant currency. The sequential bump in growth this quarter versus the 9.2% growth in the third quarter was due to the COVID-related work that Ari mentioned. Full year Technology & Analytics Solutions revenue was $4,858 million, up 8.3% reported and 8.1% at constant currency. R&D Solutions fourth quarter revenue of $1,684 million was up 14.5% at actual FX rates and 13.2% at constant currency. Pass-throughs were a tailwind of 220 basis points to fourth quarter R&DS revenue growth, due entirely to COVID work. But you should note that R&DS delivered double-digit organic growth on both the services and 606 basis, again strong performance, especially considering the tough comparison to the fourth quarter of 2019, when organic service revenue also grew at a double-digit rate. For the full year R&D Solutions revenue was $5,760 million, essentially flat on both the reported and constant currency basis. Excluding the impact of pass-throughs R&D Solutions full year reported revenue grew 2.2%. CSMS revenue of $189 million was down 10% reported and 11.9% on a constant currency basis in the fourth quarter. For the full year CSMS revenue of $741 million was down 9% at actual FX rates and 9.2% at constant currency. Demand for field reps continues to be soft in the current environment. As a result, business development activity is slowed. But the businesses performed modestly better than we expected as our clients have largely retained existing field reps. Now moving down the P&L, adjusted EBITDA was $735 million for the fourth quarter, which was growth of 14.5%. For the full year, adjusted EBITDA was $2,384 million. Fourth quarter GAAP net income was $119 million and GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.61. For the full year, GAAP net income was $279 million and GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.43. Adjusted net income was $411 million for the fourth quarter and $1,252 million for the full year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 21.3% in the fourth quarter to $2.11. Full year adjusted diluted earnings per share was $6.42. Now as Ari highlighted, R&DS new business activity remains strong, backlog group 18.5% year-over-year to close 2020 at $22.6 billion. We expect $5.9 billion of this backlog to convert to revenue over the next 12 months, which represents a year-over-year increase of 13.5% and this provides a basis for our 2021 guidance, which I will be discussing shortly. Now let's go to the balance sheet. At December 31, cash and cash equivalents totaled $1.8 billion and debt was $12.5 billion. So our net debt was $10.7 billion. Our net leverage ratio at December 31 improved to 4.5 times trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA and that compares to a peak of 4.8 times at the end of the second quarter and 4.7 times at the end of the third quarter. And you'll recall that we've committed to deleveraging between 3.5 times and 4 times net leverage as we exit 2022. You can expect that we'll make good progress towards this target in 2021 due to our double-digit adjusted EBITDA growth and improved free cash flow conversion. The cash flow continues to be a bright spot. Cash flow from operations was $750 million in the fourth quarter, up 29% year-over-year. CapEx was $176 million, resulting in free cash flow of $574 million. For the full year, free cash flow was $1.34 billion, up 61% year-over-year. We resumed share repurchase activity during the fourth quarter, repurchasing $110 billion of our shares. Full year share repurchases were $423 million. We ended the year at 194.8 million diluted shares outstanding and currently have $918 million of share repurchase authorization remaining under our program. As a result of our strong free cash flow performance, actions we took at the onset of the pandemic to access capital markets and capital allocation decisions during the year, we now have $3.3 billion of dried powder on our balance sheet between the undrawn revolver of $1.5 billion and the cash balance of $1.8 billion. We will continue to be judicious in how we use this liquidity consistent with our goal of reducing net leverage. Okay, let's turn to guidance now. We are raising our full year guidance by $250 million for revenue at the low end of the range and by $300 million at the high end of the range. The new revenue guidance is $12,550 million to $12,900 million. A little under half of this increase is driven by a stronger outlook for the business and the remainder is from favorable FX movements versus a guidance we provided on our third quarter call. I note that the revised guidance includes about 200 basis points of FX tailwind versus the prior year. We are also raising our full year profit guidance, we've increased your adjusted EBITDA by $35 million at the low end of the range and by $40 million at the high end of the range, resulting in full year guidance of $2,760 million to $2,840 million. The change in FX versus our prior guidance actually had a slightly negative impact on profit due to the unusual mix of currency fluctuations versus the historic norm. So the adjusted EBITDA increase that you see in our guidance is more than entirely the result of a stronger organic revenue output. We're raising our adjusted diluted EPS guidance by $0.12 at the low end of the range and by $0.13 at the high end of the range to $7.77 to $8.08. This represents year-over-year growth of 21% to 25.9%. And let me go a little deeper to provide you with some color to help you with your models. First, when you're modeling quarterly revenue, keep in mind that the second quarter will be easiest comparison and the fourth quarter will be the toughest comparison. And within our adjusted diluted EPS guidance, we've assumed interest expense of approximately $415 million, operational depreciation and amortization of slightly over $400 million, other below the line expense items such as minority interest of approximately $50 million and a continuation of share repurchase activity. Our guidance also assumes that the effective tax rate will remain largely in line with 2020. Our full year 2021 guidance assumes that current foreign exchange rates remain in effect for the balance of the year. Now before turning to first quarter guidance, let me give you a look at the segment growth rates for 2021. We currently expect Tech & Analytics Solutions reported revenue growth to be between 9% and 12%. R&D Solutions reported revenue growth to be between 14% and 17%, which includes 100-basis-point headwind from pass-throughs. And CSMS reported revenue growth is expected to be down about 2%, weaker earlier in the year and recovering later in the year. Now as in the past, we're also providing guidance for the coming quarter and this assumes that FX rates remain constant through the end of the quarter. On that basis, first quarter revenue is expected to be between $3,150 million and $3,200 million, representing reported growth of 14.4% to 16.2%. All three segments should deliver similar constant currency growth rates to what we saw in the fourth quarter. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $660 million and $675 million, representing reported growth at 17.4% to 20.1%. And finally, adjusted diluted EPS is expected to be between $1.81 and $1.87, up 20.7% to 24.7%. So to summarize, we delivered strong fourth quarter results with double-digit growth in all key financial metrics and that's on top of a strong fourth quarter in 2019. We posted mid-teens revenue growth for both our TAS and R&DS segments. Our R&DS backlog improved to $22.6 billion, up 18.5% year-over-year. We posted a strong free cash flow for the fourth quarter and full year, a $574 million for the quarter and $1.34 billion for the year. We closed 2020 with net leverage of 4.5 times trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA and a very healthy liquidity position, including an undrawn revolver and $1.8 billion of cash. And as we look to 2021, we see double-digit revenue growth, margin expansion, adjusted diluted EPS growth of over 20%, continued robust R&DS bookings activity and a further reduction in our net leverage ratio. And with that, let me hand it back over to our Operator for the Q&A session. Yeah. Yeah. I would just add, Tycho, that we've included in our guidance, what we have direct visibility to, but this is a very fast moving environment and things pop up all the time. So it could change. Yeah. First question was on site access and site access actually remained fairly close to the 70% number. We've just learned ways to work around it. Although, we would expect it to improve gradually. So, Ricky, the line was pretty bad there. We were struggling to hear you a little bit. I think your second part of the question was around patient recruitment and are we seeing -- expecting I guess pick up in terms of the population getting back and [Technical Difficulty] and people returning besides. I think, from what we are seeing... No. No. I think it's all part of the general recovery that we're seeing and... But the way we are seeing. What was first part of the question, Ricky, I was -- we were really struggling to hear on our side? Oh! Oh! Yeah. Look, like, the backlog conversion is a really tough statistic to model out, because it depends on backlog burn, because it depends on how much we're adding to the backlog in any quarter. So what we've tried to do is provide guidance to tell you how much we think it's going to burn during the course of the year, the next 12 months revenue and allow you to take it from there. Yes, the COVID work does burn quicker than the other work. There's no question about that. But we don't guide to a particular backlog conversion rate, because it's just too difficult to do, because it depends also on how much you happen to be booking, if you're booking a lot, like, we have been recently than obviously the backlog goes up and the burn rate goes down. But that's not a bad thing. So, yes, I would expect you would see a faster burn of the COVID-related work, which we mentioned was about 15% of our service bookings in 2020 and a more normal rate of burn on the rest of the backlog. And I think it still remains to be seen how much additional COVID-related work we're going to book as we go through 2021. That's still a question mark. So when you look at the year-over-year FX impact, when you're looking at the growth rate, ultimately, if you're trying to take our reported guidance and get to a constant currency guidance, it's... ... 100-basis-point tailwind year-over-year. Similar to that in TAS and CSMS and a little bit lower in R&D, maybe about 100 basis points in R&D. Versus the previous... Previous guidance was 150. Yeah. Yeah. So, previous guidance on 100 basis points and this will goes to the 200 basis points tailwind. Look, it's good question. The -- as you can see from our cash flow statement, the principal driver, in fact, pretty much the whole driver of our improvement in cash flow -- free cash flow in 2020 was due to improve collections performance. And that's a combination of collecting quicker, but also billing in a more timely fashion and structuring contracts, so that we built earlier. And part of our collections effort, which we put a lot of focus on was bringing down our overdue receivables. We took our eye off the ball on that a little bit and put a lot of focus on that and we're able to substantially put a dent in our overdue receivables, which has helped quite a bit. And I think a lot of the processes we put in place, all of them should persist in the 2021. We have to continue to put emphasis on it. But we've improved our processes and we expect that to continue. Now you did identify something that's important, which is that the COVID-related work did bring some benefit in terms of customer advances and being able to bill in advance that helped our 2020 cash flow. I would -- so when you look at our 2020 cash flow, as a percentage of adjusted net income, it was unusually high. We target more in the 80% to 90% free cash flow as a percentage of adjusted net income in a normal year. But cash flow is very lumpy, so it bounces around. We had a very strong year in 2021 amidst as a percentage of net income, excuse me, 2020 as a percentage of net income that probably won't be quite as strong in 2020. But fundamentally, we've improved quite a lot in terms of cash conversion and you should see continued benefit from that going into the future. Yeah. Yeah.

            "name": "Ari Bousbib",
            "content": "Thank you, Andrew, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining our fourth quarter and full year 2020 earnings call. We will review how we close 2020 and discuss 2021 financial guidance. I'm pleased to report we finished the year with a very strong quarter. We delivered double-digit growth in all key financial metrics and once again reported results above our financial targets. This is although more remarkable since last year's fourth quarter was so strong. As you know, through all these difficulties here and as we navigated through the pandemic, we try to be as transparent as possible and provide visibility to our expected financial performance. In such highly unusual circumstances, the default reaction would normally be to withdraw guidance and watch from the sidelines, but as you know, we tried our best to share with you what we saw. We did the same at the end of the third quarter when we decided to provide our 2021 outlook as soon as we had some visibility, which was a full quarter earlier than usual. Today, this outlook has become clearer and we've decided to update and raise that guidance. Let's start by reviewing our fourth quarter results. Revenue for the fourth quarter came in at $3,298 million which was $108 million above the high end of our guidance range. A little over 70% of these beats came from strong organic performance, less than 30% from favorable foreign exchange. Revenue growth was 13.9% on a reported basis and 12.2% at constant currency. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA of $735 million grew 14.5%, reflecting our revenue growth and productivity measures. The $25 million beat above the high end of our guidance range was entirely due to the stronger organic revenue performance. Fourth quarter adjusted diluted EPS of $2.11 grew 21.3%. The beat here entirely reflects the adjusted EBITDA dropped through. Our strong fourth quarter financial results were driven by numerous operating achievements during 2020. A little bit more color on those achievements starting with technology. Demand for our technology offerings remained strong in 2020. 60 new clients decided to deploy OCE last year, bringing our total number of OCE client wins to 140 since launch. As you know, at the beginning of 2020, a top 15 global pharma client began deployment of OCE in the U.S. This client has now decided to begin global OCE deployment for their medical teams, namely, there are almost 2,000 medical science liaisons worldwide. This same client is also expanding its use of IQVIA technologies through our HCP engagement management platform. We launched this platform during 2020. HCP engagement management works in conjunction with OCE to ensure global commercial activities are executed in compliance with all global regulations. In addition to HCP engagement management, you will have seen that during 2020 we also launched OCE Optimizer. OCE Optimizer is a real-time map-based territory and sales rep alignment solution, which helps our clients plan their sales rep activity and improve their marketing plans. Switching to our real world business, our real world business has been relatively well-insulated from the impact of the virus and it has strong growth for the year. The business is advanced in the use of secondary data, remote monitoring and virtual research approaches, which help the team pivot quickly to working in the new remote world at the onset of the pandemic. Our rich clinical data assets are key to our real world differentiation. The team has continued to invest in these rich clinical data assets and these assets now include over 1 billion active non-identified patients globally, and the team is busy integrating this rich clinical data into research. In 2020, we launched CARE, our COVID active research experience registry to help communities and public health authorities better understand the impact of COVID-19 on the population. We are leveraging this platform along with our vast experience of registries and analytics to partner with the FDA to support a better understanding of how people are affected by exposure to COVID. This work will help identify with symptoms individuals experience, the length and severity of symptoms and whether any medications or supplements they are taking affect the severity of those symptoms. It's a perfect application of our real world capabilities. Similarly, we have become the partner of choice around the world to assist various governments and healthcare authorities with large scale diagnostic testing and monitoring of COVID patients. This new series of offerings, which leverages our connected capabilities contributed incrementally to the strong sequential growth in our TAS segment. Moving to R&DS. As you know, the R&DS team responded quickly in 2020 to support our clients with the development of vaccines and therapies for COVID-19. We've been involved in more than 300 clinical trials and studies for the virus, including four of the five vaccine trials that made it through Phase 3 and were funded by the U.S. Government in operational work speed. To help speed recruitment, we leveraged our direct-to-patient solutions, which include the use of patient registries and IQVIA sponsored advertisements. To-date, we've recruited over 100,000 patients to COVID trials. The pandemic has accelerated the need for remote and risk-based monitoring and clinical research, which in turn has accelerated the adoption of our virtual trial technology. In total, we've won over 60 new studies using our virtual trials solutions across 10 therapeutic areas, including awards with five top 10 pharma clients. The technology suite combines e-consent, telemedicine, eCOA and digital communication and in platform on health cloud, the sales force platform that is purpose built for healthcare and life sciences. This technology is being deployed to speed vaccine development and was an important factor in helping the team secure the two Phase 3 full service COVID trials that we are working on. The environment for R&D and outsourcing remains very healthy. Biotech funding remains strong, with the National Venture Capital Association reporting a record number of deals for the year. The pipeline of late-stage molecules continues to expand and is at an all time high. It is these healthy environments combined with our differentiated capabilities, that has resulted in strong new business awards for the R&DS team. Our contracted backlog including pass-throughs grew 18.5% year-over-year to $22.6 billion at December 31, 2020. As a result, our next 12 months revenue from backlog increased to $5.9 billion, up 13.5% year-over-year. We continue to build on our strong momentum in the fourth quarter, with the team delivering a contracted net book-to-bill ratio of 1.41 including pass-throughs and 1.42 excluding pass-throughs. We exited the year with an LTM contracted book-to-bill ratio of 1.63 including pass-throughs and 1.44 excluding pass-throughs. We expect continued strong activity going forward as our pipeline of R&DS opportunities is growing double-digit in both volume and dollars across a very wide range of therapies. I'll now turn it over to Ron for more details on our financial performance. Yeah. Thank you. Look, TAS, in general, has been more insulated from the impacts of COVID during 2020 than R&D or CSMS, right? So, all data, analytics, consulting, real world business were pretty much unaffected, and as you know noted, the only pockets there that we had -- where we had issues were the events management business, which essentially came to a halt. Now, in the fourth quarter the underlying TAS business return to normal growth rate. It had already returned to normal growth rates in the third quarter, I think, we posted 9.2% a constant currency growth in the third quarter. The sequential increase in that growth rate in the fourth quarter, which is about, let's call it, 600 basis points was entirely due, as you know noted, to the incremental work from COVID-related activities. So we expect this incremental contribution to continue about the same pace into the first quarter. Now, similar to R&DS, the COVID work in TAS has been faster execution and the guidance that we give you for 2021 does include the COVID work that we have visibility to, but I can tell you, there is no COVID work in the second half of 2021 that's built into our guidance. It's still early in the year, so this could change, right? It's not going to stop abruptly. But right now, the bulk of what we see in terms of COVID work in TAS for 2021 is in the first quarter, similar as in the fourth quarter and a little bit of sales in the second quarter and that's it. What is that COVID work, by the way? It's mainly related to projects for governments, essentially using our people and analytics to support authorities in the management of the crisis. The real work -- real world work for the FDA that I described in my introductory remarks. We also performing large scale diagnostic testing and monitoring of COVID patience for other governments, Europe and Asia, around the world. And we're assuming that's going to go away certainly by the middle of the year in our guidance. But again, that's -- that could be -- that could prove to be and I have an expectation -- again, it's not built in the guidance, but an expectation that we will continue to have similar type of work as we've developed capabilities and really a new set of offerings which we intend to go-to-market going forward. Yes. So, again, just as in TAS, COVID work did contribute significantly to R&DS growth. Obviously, I mean, look, mid double-digit growth in TAS is not the new normal. We've said TAS growth accelerated, but it accelerated to the high single-digit growth that we always anticipated pre-pandemic. If you go back to the guidance we gave, the long-term guidance we gave in June of 2019. We did expect TAS to reach high single-digit 8%, 9% and eventually 10%. But that's the underlying TAS growth business. Now, with R&DS, it also, of course, would be misleading to look at the R&DS business, and say, that's the normal mid double-digit growth. Obviously, it's hard to -- it's harder to determine what would have been without the COVID work, because without the COVID work, there would have been other business that had essentially been pushed to the right, right, in our MDS, as you can understand. But by the way, even absence the large COVID trials that we've been a privilege to work on, we would have had very strong underlying R&DS services growth in the fourth quarter as well. Now, we expect COVID work to be with us through 2021 and maybe also into 2022, because there's a need for vaccines for multiple manufacturers to meet global demand. There are new vaccines that are being developed for variants of the virus. There are alternative vaccines that are needed in case of adverse safety events or quality issues or manufacturing delays. There are novel treatment programs that are targeted at specific populations and conditions. And of course, there are post-approval commitments to regulators, all of which do require continued R&D work. Now, look, we have a large backlog to execute, 22.6 billion at the end of 2020. We are, look, we have got the ability to execute on this existing backlog and that ability will continue to improve. Site startup and patient recruitment continues to improve. The next 12 month revenue from backlog has increase. So, all of this provides the basis for our 2021 R&DS revenue guide guidance. The pipeline of opportunities is very strong. If we exclude COVID opportunities, our pipeline is showing good growth. For example, the oncology pipeline is in the mid double-digit growth. The CNS pipeline is up low-double digits to at least 12%, 13%. Cardiovascular and diabetes pipe is growing strong double digits, very, very strong double digits. So we know if your question is suggesting that what happens post-COVID? We're not falling off a cliff. We have -- the vast majority of the backlog is not COVID, obviously. If you look at our bookings in 2020, every quarter except for the first quarter, obviously, COVID-related work represented between 15% and 20% of our services bookings. And for the year, I think, it was exactly 15%, 1-5. So we continue to book very, very solid good business across all therapy areas and we expect our strong growth in R&DS to continue even post-COVID. Thank you. Yeah. Go ahead, Andrew. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, look, yeah. It's just like. We're delighted to have this COVID work, right? I mean, we are super excited, because the broader picture here strategically is that these crises, as bad as it was, for everyone. In terms of our company, we've been talking -- it's almost like this company existed for situations like this. All of a sudden, the sets of capabilities that we've spent so much effort and investment developing, proved to be exactly what was needed to help our clients and to help governments, whether it's on the commercial side, on the real world side or on the R&DS side. And our relationship with clients has been strengthened. This -- our sets of capabilities have been demonstrated and we expect to continue to capture an ever bigger share of spend going forward into the very long-term in the life sciences industry. And we really are very excited by the pipeline of opportunities, again both on the commercial side and on the R&DS side. What was your first -- your first -- what was the question. Right. Yeah. I mean, look, in the first -- when the trough in the -- at the worst moment of the crisis, we were like less than 20% of site access and that really created huge headwinds for our R&DS business, as you know. Second quarter earnings call, we told you that we would -- we had gone up to 53% site access. And at the end of the third quarter, we were at about 70% site access. And the kind of bad news good news here that we have not improved that metric, it remained at 70%. However, we've learned to work around that and the reason why it hasn't gone back to 100%, frankly, is because of all these new flare ups, et cetera. But the good news here is that it's been all right, because the -- it's not so much we found with the number of sites, but it's really other metrics. The main metric we looked at the beginning of the pandemic was site access, because again, without that you've got nothing. But we found out that there is a critical mass of site access, which again, we think is about the level where we are now, whereby our remote monitoring capabilities then prevent material disruption to the delivery of our services in general. We've got site networks, relationships, we can work around sites that are not yet up and running for clinical research and today we can pivot much faster to remote monitoring versus when this pandemic hit. Now, if you look at startup activity, which is another important metric that we were looking at, which had also come to a halt, is now back to baseline levels pre-pandemic and that's extremely good news. And there hasn't been any major change from this due to the increases in COVID cases or the new variants of the virus. So startup activity, people have learned to work with the virus and it's essentially back to pre-pandemic levels and we don't see that changing. Patient recruitment, another very important metric. Obviously, here we lag site startup, but essentially those trends are very strong and the patients are returning to sites essentially close to pre-pandemic levels. So, again, we're very encouraged by that. You have another question on... OCT. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I mentioned that, in my prepared remarks that our virtual trials, technology has been really brought to the front here in the context of COVID. If you step back and think about what OCT is, there's really four blocks. There is the digital site suite, which you don't focus on the pin -- on the site portal, payments, ETMF. Then there is a digital patient suite with -- what the patient has to go through with e-consent, eCOA, that's where the virtual trial essentially is the study hub. Then you have the digital trial management suite with the CTMS, risk-based monitoring and then you have the compliance suite with RIM Smart and Vigilant. So the technologies in our site suite, the patient suite and the compliance suite went live during 2020. And the technologies in our trial management suite will be going live shortly, most likely end of the first quarter, beginning of the second quarter of this year. So, again, all these four suites, the site, the patient and the compliance, they are all went live during 2020 and the trial management suite will be live to be probably March, April timeframe this year. And we are seeing very strong interest on clients. We have seen an increase in RFP activity for OCT platform, not just for individual suites or standalone products, but for the whole platform. We are seeing interest on all customer segments large, mid and AVP [ph] and stay tuned. We'll report more on that. But the answer to your question is, we are live for most of the products and it will be fully live and operational by the beginning of the second quarter. Thank you. I don't think so. No. No. Yeah. No. It doesn't change anything to the design of the trials. I mean, it just another element that allows a patient to access offices sites or interact with healthcare professionals. But would be -- would have been the same with a negative test or a -- or somebody with antibodies. I mean, that doesn't change anything to the design, no. And then the second -- the first... No. He is asking versus the previous guidance... Yeah. Yeah. So, again, we continue to see very good traction in the marketplace. Obviously it takes time to deploy. We had 60 client wins in 2020 and I should point out, obviously, despite the difficult environment created by the pandemic, we continue to sell. Total 140 clients win since launch. We keep winning two out of three times against competition. We are deploying large clients which we disclose before. We have a global deployment with Roche. We have global deployment with Novo Nordisk International Operations, AstraZeneca U.S. deployment as well. We have another top 15 pharma deployment for a country in Asia and other top 15 pharma companies that's globally deploying for the medical teams. So we already have, I mean, is -- I'm not sure if we should disclose this number, but we do have tens of thousands of users already. Now that did move the needle on $12.9 billion revenue company, no, not in 2021, but it is providing very significant growth. And certainly, it is an area where we expect strong margin drop through over time as we complete implementations. As you know, it's a -- the drop through becomes much more attractive when revenue is license driven and we're starting to see that, but it will continue to increase as we complete deployments and implementation. Now, we continue to sell. So that also will require implementation. And the strategy overall is the same as for any technology company, which is the land and expand model, and as you know, we resolve the HCP engagement management, I mentioned it. We saw the HCP compliance. We are launching additional modules and continue to expand. So it's not just OCE, OCE was kind of the centerpiece and then it continues to grow. Ron, anything? Yeah. Thank you."

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker's remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder this call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Andrew Markwick, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasury. Mr. Markwick, please begin your conference.\nAndrew Markwick: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our third quarter 2020 earnings call. With me on the call today are Ari Bousbib, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Ron Bruehlman, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Eric Sherbet, Executive Vice President and General Counsel; Nick Childs, Senior Vice President, Financial Planning and Analysis; and Jen Halchak, Senior Director, Investor Relations. Today, we will be referencing a presentation that will be visible during this call for those of you on our webcast. This presentation will also be available following this call, on the Events and Presentations section of our IQVIA Investor Relations Web site at ir.iqvia.com. Before we begin, I would like to caution listeners that certain information discussed by management during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those stated or implied by forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties associated with the company's business, which are discussed in the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings. In addition, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures on this call, which should be considered a supplement to, and not a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the comparable GAAP measures is included in the press release and conference call presentation. I would now like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Ari Bousbib.\nAri Bousbib: Thank you, Andrew, and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining our third quarter 2020 earnings call. The third quarter marked a nice sequential improvement in our financial performance, with results coming in above the high-end of our expectations. You will recall that based on early signs of recovery at the end of the second quarter, we raised our guidance for the year. Based on stronger than expected performance in the third quarter, we are again raising our full-year guidance ranges for revenue, adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted diluted EPS. We're expecting a continuation of these recovery trends in the fourth quarter. This of course sets us up well for next year. As we promised back in April at the onset of this pandemic, we will talk to you today about our outlook for 2021. Based on what we currently see, we think the most significant COVID impact to our business are behind us, and our outlook for 2021 indicates strong performance next year, and a return to our growth trajectory. Ron will discuss 2020 and 2021 guidance in more detail later. Before we review the quarter, a quick operational update, we continue to experience a gradual improvement in the accessibility of clinical resource sites in the R&D Solutions business even with the localized flare-ups we've seen around the world. We are seeing a return to on-site monitoring visits, and similar to last quarter, on-site visits exceeded the number of remote visits. In instances where sites remain physically inaccessible for clinical monitoring, remote monitoring and virtual solutions are proving to be effective workarounds. The pace of startup activity picked up significantly during the first quarter, and we are pretty much back to baseline levels for site initiation visits. Of course, special recruitment trends have started to follow as well. Moving to Technology & Analytics, as expected TAS has remained resilient throughout this crisis in almost every area. We've had very little interruption in data supply or demand. Our information services continue to be mission critical to our clients, and are therefore very insulated from the impacts of the pandemic. The analytics and consulting businesses are performing remarkably well, development being hampered by the lack of in-person interactions. One area we discussed before that has experienced significant disruption is the event management business, which relies almost entirely on face-to-face interaction, and of course, as you know, that business is essentially on pause for now. Demand for our technology offerings remains strong. We've added 45 OCE clients this year, bringing our total number of clients to 125. During the quarter, we successfully rolled out OCE Optimizer, a real-time map-based territory and sales rep alignment solution. These tools saved management teams significant amounts of time previously spent planning and assessing sales data to ensure resources are effectively focused on the appropriate client base and products. Finally, our CSMS business, demand for field reps continues to be soft, which of course impacts revenue, but as we said before, while business development has also slowed due to the lack of in-person interactions, so far the business has performed modestly better than we would have expected as existing clients have largely retained field reps and have been continuing their engagements with us. Now against that backdrop, let's now review our third quarter results. Revenue for the third quarter came in at $2,786 million, which was $11 million above the high end of our guidance range. This revenue beat came from strong organic operational performance. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA was $604 million, with a $22 million beat versus the high end of our guidance range. The EBITDA beat was due to better operational performance and productivity. Third quarter adjusted diluted EPS was $1.63, reflecting the EBITDA drop through because the below-the-line item essentially netted out to zero. Third quarter R&DS contracted backlog, including pass throughs grew 18.5% year-over-year to $21.7 billion as of September 30, 2020. We have broad-based bookings strength, but full-service clinical and lab were particularly strong. The contracted net book-to-bill ratio including pass throughs was 1.71 for the third quarter of 2020, and 1.42 excluding pass throughs. The LTM contracted book-to-bill ratio, at September 30, was 1.55 including pass throughs, and 1.45 excluding pass throughs. I will now turn it over to Ron for more details on our financial performance.\nRon Bruehlman: Thank you, Ari, and good morning everyone. Let's turn first to revenue. Third quarter revenue of $2,786 million grew 0.6% reported, and was flat at constant currency. Revenue for the first nine months of the year was $8,061 million, which was down 1.6% reported, and 1.2% at constant currency. Technology & Analytics Solutions revenue of $1,207 million grew 10.2% reported, and 9.2% in constant currency. Year-to-date, Tech & Analytics Solutions revenue was $3,433 million, up 4.9% reported, and 5.6% at constant currency. In R&D Solutions, third quarter revenue of $1,400 million was down 4.5% at actual FX rate, and 5.1% at constant currency. Excluding the impact of pass throughs, R&D Solution third quarter revenue grew 2.6%. Year-to-date revenue of $4,076 million was down 5.6% at actual FX rate, and 5.4% at constant currency. Contract Sales and Medical Solutions revenue of $179 million was down 13.9% year-over-year reported, and 14.4 % on a constant currency basis in the third quarter. Year-to-date, revenue was $552 million, down 8.6% at actual FX rate, and 8.3% at constant currency. Now moving down to P&L, adjusted EBITDA was $604 million for the third quarter, which represented growth of 1.9%, year-to-date adjusted EBITDA was $1,649 million. Third quarter GAAP net income was $101 million, and GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.52. Year-to-date GAAP net income was $160 million, and GAAP diluted earnings per share $0.82. Adjusted income was $318 million for the quarter and $841 million year-to-date. Our adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 1.9% in the third quarter at $1.63. Year-to-date adjusted diluted earnings per share was $4.32. Now turning to the R&D Solutions backlog, as Ari mentioned, R&DS new business activity remains quite strong. Consequent on the robust booking activity that Ari talked about, our backlog grew 18.5% year-over-year with close at $21.7, and we expect $5.8 billion of this backlog to convert to renew over the next 12 months, which is an increase of over $400 million versus where we were at June 30, and I would add that the outlook remains quite positive as RFPs are growing low double digits in both volume and dollars. Moving to the balance sheet now, at September 30, cash and cash equivalents total $1.5 billion and debt was $12.3 billion resulting in net debt of $10.9 billion. Due to our strong EBITDA and cash flow in the quarter, our net leverage ratio at September 30 was 4.7 times trailing 12 month adjusted EBITDA, which was down a tick from where we were at June 30. Cash flow was a bright spot as it last quarter. Cash flow from operations was $574 million in the third quarter, up 74% over last year. Capital expenditures were $157 million and that resulted in free cash flow of $470 million. M&A spending as you saw was negligible in the quarter. For the first nine months of the year, free cash flow was $769 million which is about double the same period last year. Now as you know, when the COVID-19 outbreak became a pandemic in March, we temporarily suspended our share repurchase program. We did not repurchase any shares in the second or third quarters, but the business is recovering well from COVID-19 disruptions. Underlying demand is robust and cash flow is as well, and we have a very solid liquidity position. Closing the quarter with an undrawn revolver of almost $1.5 billion of cash on the balance sheet, and as a result of all this, we have lifted our suspension on share repurchase program, and we are expecting to opportunistically resume share repurchase activity, and as a reminder, we currently have about $1 billion of share repurchase authorization remaining under the program. Now let's turn to guidance. Given the continuing momentum in the business, we are raising our full-year guidance range for revenue, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted diluted EPS. Our guidance for the fourth quarter and full-year of 2020 assumes that business congestions will continue to improve during the fourth quarter, and specifically, we assume that localized flare-ups of COVID-19 will not have a material impact on fourth quarter results. We now expect 2020 revenue for the full-year to be between $11,100 million and $11,250 million, which is an increase of $125 million over our prior guidance at the midpoint of the range. For profit, we now expect full-year adjusted EBITDA to be $2,335 million and $2,360 million which represent a $27 million increase over our prior guidance at the midpoint of the range, and adjusted diluted EPS we are expecting to be between $6.25 and $6.35, which is an increase of $0.10 over our prior guidance, again at the midpoint of the range. This full-year guidance implies fourth quarter revenue of $3,040 million to $3,190 million, representing growth of 5.0 to 10.2%. Now, this is a wider range than we would normally guide to at this point in year due to the uncertain timing of pass-through revenues associated with the COVID trials that we are working on. From a segment perspective, we expect Technology & Analytics Solutions revenue would be in the high single digits at the midpoint of our guidance range, R&D Solutions revenue growth to reach double-digits, with the caveat that this growth rate could move up or down based on the timing of pass through revenue, and CSMS revenue growth to be similar to what we saw in the third quarter. For fourth quarter profit, we expect adjusted EBITDA to be between $685 million and $710 million, representing growth of 6.7% to 10.6%, and adjusted diluted EPS to be between $1.92 and $2.03 or growth of 10.9% to 16.7%. This guidance assumes that foreign exchange rates at September 30, 2020 remain in effect for the rest of the year. As we indicated at the start of the pandemic, we've decided to advance our planning process versus prior years, and as a result we're now in a position to provide our 2021 outlook, and this is much earlier than we would have done in the ordinary course. For the full-year 2021, we expect revenue in the range of $12,300 million to $12,600 million. This represents growth at 10.1% to 12.8% versus the midpoint of our 2020 guide. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be the range of $2,725 million to $2,800 million, representing growth at 16.1% to 19.3% compared to the midpoint of our 2020 guidance, and finally, we expect adjusted EPS to be in the range of $7.65 to $7.95, which would represent growth of 21.4% to 26.2% compared to the midpoint of our 2020 guidance. A little bit more detail for you, the adjusted diluted EPS guidance assumes interest expense of approximately $420 million, operational depreciation and amortization of about $400 million, and other below-the-line expense items such as minority interest of approximately $50 million, and also a continuation of our share repurchase activity. The effective tax rate we're assuming will remain largely in line with 2020. Our 2021 guidance is predicated on the assumption that business conditions will continue to improve in the fourth quarter, and that majority of business will return to normal during 2021. Our outlook for 2021 also incorporates our view that there will be some tail of COVID work, but growth in R&DS will come primarily from our base business. So in summary, we're pleased with our team's ability to navigate the challenges that COVID has presented throughout the year, and we're proud to be a critical contributor to the solution to this public health crisis. Our R&DS business has adapted well, returning to growth in services revenue, and achieving another record quarter of bookings. Our Technology & Analytics Solutions business improved sequentially and has returned to pre COVID growth rates despite the headwinds of the event management business. Our solid year-to-date overall company performance has enabled us to raise our guidance for the full-year for revenue, adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted diluted EPS, and now this performance combined with our strong free cash flow and liquidity position has enabled us to lift the suspension of our share repurchase program, and finally, we are expecting continued recovery in the fourth quarter and a very strong 2021. So, with that, let me hand it back over to the operator for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from Eric Coldwell with Baird.\nEric Coldwell: Thanks very much, and good morning. I was curious if you could share with us the percent of your bookings this quarter that came from COVID-related trials? You did give us the metric last quarter, as did I think virtually all of your peers.\nAri Bousbib: I think looking at the contracted services bookings, in the quarter it was about 20%.\nEric Coldwell: And, Ari, I assume higher on a pass through basis given the nature of those large vaccine studies?\nAri Bousbib: Yes, I mean the -- it's very hard, the timing of pass throughs and the volume of pass throughs is different. Look, we have a lot of COVID awards since the start of the pandemic, many of them small from protocol reviews. I mean I think we had like close to 200 different awards around the world, so gives you a sense. Some of them very tiny, some protocol reviews, we have lab work. They range from -- you had normal fees to, of course, we are on several of the large vaccine trials, not necessarily doing the entire work but we, for example, have been awarded work I think on four of the five trials that are part of Operation Warp Speed that are in phase three. So sometimes we've got in -- and in a couple of cases we've got the full service work, and, of course, there we've got big pass through numbers. In other cases we'll get the lab work, the pharmacovigilance work. So we are very involved, and some of that work does not include pass through, some of that it does include pass throughs. A lot of trials where we have full clinical work do have big pass through numbers which have not been yet into -- in our revenue numbers given that, as you probably know, we are in our full service vaccine work is in at a later stage than to have some of our competitors who have already seen that revenue -- that very strong revenue flow through in prior quarter or will seek in this quarter, in Q3, mostly from pass through revenue.\nEric Coldwell: That's very helpful, and if I could get you to just follow on to that, a number of investors are focused on how the COVID work plays out over the next several quarters. When do you expect a peak in bookings and/or revenue from COVID-related trials at which point we would obviously need the quarter to be back fully to offset any year-over-year comparisons that might be developing?\nAri Bousbib: Yes, well look, I mean in developing -- I'm sorry, you're talking about 2021 obviously.\nEric Coldwell: Yes, and [multiple speakers] -- yes.\nAri Bousbib: Yes, so I mean, look, Eric, we have spent a lot of time, as mentioned back in April, we wanted to try to give you a sense for how 2021 would shape up, and we've spent a lot of time, bottom up, reviewing what would happen. As you know, we affect everything or piece of work across our business segments with probabilities and an assessment of what revenue would be derived in subsequent periods. So the same applies to the COVID trials. Most of the revenue on the large full-service COVID trial is pass through, okay, so there's no impact to profit, and that's just the fact. When you are a full service work on a vaccine trial you have to remember there are cases I've seen, I don't know if that's the case with us, but it's where the past revenue is a ratio of 10 to one, in other words $10 or pass through versus $1 of service revenue, whereas in normal traditional trials we would see one pass through dollar to each two or three dollars of service revenue, and once again, pass throughs is totally irrelevant to our profits, it has no impact whatsoever. So, it makes it very difficult to predict. So that's one element of the COVID trial. The second one is, of course, we've taken into account the possibility that vaccine trials get cancelled. There could be a vaccine that gets approved, or two, or three, and the others ones feel that it's not economically worthwhile for the sponsor to continue to vaccine trial. In fact historically, well before COVID, we know from experience that vaccine work carries an unusually high risk of cancellation versus traditional other drug developments. So with all of that in mind, so we know all of that, we've factored all of that into our guidance, and we feel good and we have anticipated in many in our possibility and many such scenarios, and we feel good about that. Now, you bear in mind that a lot of the work that was supposed to come online, new projects, have been put on hold by our clients because many clients have devoted their attention, resources to COVID, whether it's for therapeutics or for vaccine work, and we do expect, in fact our clients have told us that when that phase goes away they'll go back to the projects they were supposed to have been working on in 2020. So we have no concern that all of a sudden, if that's what you're alluding to, there will be a kind of a drop in either bookings or revenue, we do not expect that, and we've factored a lot of that potential variability into our guidance. That's the benefit of having such a wide diversified portfolio as we do have at IQVIA, both within our R&DS business and our TAS business. You should also realize that we are getting a lot of interest from public health authorities and also a lot from sponsors for pharmacovigilance, in other words tracking COVID patients. Our real world business is experiencing strong double-digit growth, and we expect continued interest in pandemic-related work in general. We all hope this will be the last time that it ever, but we also all know and understand that crises will happen in the future, and perhaps the magnitude of the COVID crisis has taught all of us a lot of interesting things that we are going to put in place going forward in terms of preparedness, in terms of patient tracking, in terms of monitoring what exactly -- you've seen our press release on the CARE Project with the FDA, where we are looking at patients who have potentially been exposed to COVID. We are connecting all the dots between their medical history and our de-identified patient records, understanding what types of vitamins they've been taking, what other drug regimens they've been under, and trying to determine a map of at-risk populations with a lot more precision than what's been done today. So all of those projects are in the pipe, and I expect those to continue irrespective of whether the COVID crisis ends or not. So again, everything has been factored into our guidance.\nEric Coldwell: Ari, thank you very much for the detailed answers, I appreciate it.\nOperator: Next question comes from John Kreger with William Blair.\nJohn Kreger: Hi, thanks very much. Ari, just to kind of continue on that, I think you mentioned to Eric that about 20% of your bookings were COVID-related. For the other 80%, are you able to start those studies up and enroll in a fairly reasonable basis or would you say that's still broadly impaired?\nAri Bousbib: Thank you. Well, okay, as I said in my introductory remarks, with respect to site initiation visits which -- and site startup activity, that's the area of our business that has seen the strongest improvement. In fact, the site initiation visits are back to baseline levels, and recruitment of positions obviously starting to follow. So I think actually very good moves on that front. The accessibility to sites for trials that are in flight hasn't quite recovered. We are currently at about, I want to say the -- I look at my team about 70%, right. We are currently for global, if you look globally at our sites we are back to about 70% normal accessibility. That's a bit below what we would have expected, but interestingly it's critical site, because a site is not a site is not a site. There are sites that are very tiny, and the relative incremental value of opening that sites doesn't mean as much. So we are focused on the ones that are most significant. So that's for in-flight trials, and we're returning gradually to normal activity there. For new trails, again site startup activities has resumed, site initiation as essentially the visits are where they should be normally pre-COVID levels, normally patient recruitment lives, but that has increased significantly throughout the quarter, patient recruitment was fundamentally disrupted, okay, because essentially everything was put on a hold, and we're gradually going back, we have good momentum, and we don't think we will recover to baseline level and sometime in 2021, but again all of that is factored into our guidance.\nJohn Kreger: Great, thank you. One quick follow-up, can you give us a sense about where your focus is on sort of new technology development? I think in the past, you've talked about an OCT suite launch by year-end, is that still on the table?\nAri Bousbib: Yes, absolutely. As you know, we've had great success with OCT coming from behind, and we therefore along with our partners Salesforce, we expanded the relationship to clinical tech platform in tools on the health cloud, we have seven technologies available today for digital sides and patient suites. The digital patient suite includes products such as eConsent, eCOA, and also patient portal. We will by the end of the year have the digital trial management suite go live probably before the end of the year, and the products will include CTMS, risk based monitoring, and the mobile CRA platform. So again, the fully orchestrated solution, OCT, that you're referring to, will be available by the end of this year. Again, we are also coming from behind in this area, but we will be claiming our fair share as we're doing in OCT on the commercial side. Thank you.\nJohn Kreger: Sounds good. Thank you.\nOperator: Next question comes from Bob Jones with Goldman Sachs.\nBob Jones: Great, thanks for taking the questions. I guess, Ari, maybe just a follow-up there, you're saying that site activations are getting back to normal and patient recruitment obviously catching up. You saw X pass through growth in RDS I think of around 2.6%, I guess, what needs to happen to see the double-digit RDS growth in 4Q, and more importantly, what has to happen between now and over the course of '21 to kind of get to that guidance range, is there a lot that needs to improve, or is it just kind of a normal course of what you're already seeing that needs to play out in order to get to these 4Q and 2021 RDS targets?\nAri Bousbib: Well, look, we've said that we should be seeing or reaching double-digit RDS growth in Q4, okay, and we do expect mid-teens in 2021. So, what needs to happen is all normal course of business based on the work that we've done that I described earlier in my reply to Eric's question, our guidance is being bottom-up, as we always do project-by-project and we make an assumption of -- look, I mean what needs to happen is things are going to happen, okay? The elections are going to be behind us, there will be more clarity in environment, there will be at least two or three vaccines out there, people have learned to live with this, people are moving on, and all of that will happen sometime in 2021 during the year. Obviously, this assumes when we say \"Normal Business Conditions,\" it means that what we're seeing today, the trends that we're seeing today, the improvements that we are seeing today continue with a bit more stability in 2021 due to all of these factors being unclear, again, election behind, more clarity on the environment, vaccines learning to live with this thing, all of these assumes when we say stable business conditions it means there is no new pandemic, God forbid, or anything like that, and it's a new normal, if you will, and that's what we're assuming; nothing extraordinary, nothing needs to happen, I should point out that we haven't done any acquisitions of significance as you know really for the past two years. I mean we haven't been spent at the rate that we used to. This is all organic for the most part, and so again, we feel very good about this guidance.\nBob Jones: That's fair, and I guess maybe just one follow-up, we haven't spent a lot of time on TAS. You described it as resilient, but I think the growth rates the highest we've seen in years. Can you maybe just spend a little bit more time there talking about what's driving the performance in TAS? I know you mentioned real world evidence, but just wanted to get a little bit more clarity behind the record growth you're seeing in that segment?\nAri Bousbib: Look, the performance is the reflection of the sales, I can't say a different way of the resilience of the business, A lot of what we do is mission critical to our clients with or without the pandemic. Certainly the data business hasn't moved. If anything, there was -- if it proves how mission critical it was. We probably had the best visibility, I mean, you guys and a lot of people out there felt we were insane back at the beginning of the pandemic for giving relatively precise guidance for the balance of the year, and now here we are, and it looks like more or less we are on target and that it's not because we're geniuses, it's because we have visibility, we've got businesses that they allow us to have that visibility, and we are global. So, there are different stages of the pandemic in different parts of the world, so we can model this out, we have our internal database, deep analytics, predictive analytics, and modeling capability.\n.: Ron, do you want to add\u2026\nRon Bruehlman: Yes, just one thing I would emphasize, Bob, if there was a surprise versus where we were expecting early in the year, it's our analytics and consulting business has continued to be very strong, and I think Ari highlighted that in his prepared remarks that we were expecting some disruption due to business development activity, face-to-face selling being affected, and in fact that hasn't, our analytics and consulting visits has been quite strong.\nBob Jones: Thanks for all that. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Next question comes from Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan.\nTycho Peterson: Hey, thanks. Ari, starting with R&D, does the 4Q guidance assume resumption of any of the trials that have been halted with J&J and AstraZeneca, and then, what gives you the confidence that COVID flare-up won't impact results? I know you talked about site initiation visits back to baseline levels, but I guess what I'm really asking you is have you taken steps to try to kind of mitigate any impact of flare-ups, and then, as we look ahead to 2021 in R&D, can you just give us a sense of how much could contribute to that mid-teens growth you talked about? Thanks.\nAri Bousbib: Yes, I mean you asked me about the impacts of the delays in the vaccine work. Yes, I mean, first of all, interruptions in trials in general are a common occurrence. There are adverse events. In the case of vaccine trials where you have the number, which is arguably one of the reasons why fasteners are so big, because the number of patients enrolling in vaccine trials is huge, we're talking about massive amounts 30,000, 40,000, 50,000, 60,000 people in a trial. You're going to have adverse events, and those adverse events will cause an interruption of the trial, but again, we've factored that in. It's all in our guidance, and we don't expect -- and by the way, as I mentioned before, there are also cancellations in vaccine trials that are more likely. So, look, again we factored that in, we put probabilities on all of our vaccine work, and bear in mind, cancellation is only result in 100% of lost revenue, there is one down and so on, and finally, frankly, since for the full service trial, the one that we talked about, most of the revenue is pass through. So, and this is COVID work. So, it's not likely or maybe even on the service, the small portion of the revenue that's service, it's not like we're making a margin or a margin at all, right, because it's part of our contribution to the effort. So, that's for the vaccine, and what was the other question you had?\nTycho Peterson: Yes, I mean, it was whether you're taking proactive steps to mitigate any impact from COVID flare-ups? You talked about set initiation levels, but what gives you confidence and no impact, and then on the 2021 outlook you talked about COVID being 20% of awards, but how much do you think it contributes to growth that mentions growth next year?\nAri Bousbib: Yes, I don't have to give you the exact contribution to vote, but it's not what's creating the very strong double-digit growth that we expect.\nRon Bruehlman: We have solid growth next year in revenue in R&DS even excluding like COVID work. That's the short answer.\nTycho Peterson: Right.\nAri Bousbib: By the way, our growth this year, underlying growth without the COVID work also, not that great growth, but\u2026\nRon Bruehlman: In Q4 also\u2026\nAri Bousbib: Yes, in Q4 also, yes, yes, but the flare-ups, I mean look, if it continues in the same proportion and occurrence, and frequency as we see now, that's what's factoring in our guidance, but again, eventually, with the advent of vaccines by the end of the year, or next year, we think all of that will -- and people we learn how to work with this, it's already happening. If you look at, again China is a good -- things are back to normal in China, I'd say entirely, I mean, it's not 100%, it's 95% plus accessible. There are flare-ups by the way in China, but people just work with this. Also again, we have to do some catch-up work, bear in mind, that's also factored into our guidance. We did a lot of remote monitoring this year when we couldn't access the site, and I think people forget that we are not going to move to 100% remote monitoring, okay? There is still a requirement by all regulatory authorities around the world that source document verification has to occur on site. FDA, all the regulatory explicitly require that the source document should not be shared remotely. So again, obviously, what has changed is the number of data points that might be looked at remotely like key safety and efficacy data for example, and so, there's reduced requirements on less critical data, but in general, we still have to do that work that we will not be able to do. So, all of that is, \"Pent-up Demand\" that needs to be addressed in the coming quarters, catch-up work, if you will.\nTycho Peterson: Okay, and then, Ari, last quick one on CSMS, can that return to, you know call it low single-digit growth next year?\nAri Bousbib: I don't know about that, because I'm not going to venture to make prediction on CSMS, I've been wrong in both directions. I have assumed they would go down and they went up, and I assumed they would go up, and they went down. So, look, what's factored into our guidance is kind of flattish five growth, okay, if it's plus 1%, plus 2%, I don't know; flattish growth, flattish for next year.\nTycho Peterson: Okay, thank you.\nAri Bousbib: More detail on the segments when we provide guidance in the ordinary course at the beginning of '21 when we share full-year results and Q4 results, and as we traditionally do, and we'll give more detail on segments there, because I'm sure you can derive based on the comments we made and on the overall guidance that the momentum we see now, three business segments will continue.\nOperator: Next question comes from Erin Wright with Credit Suisse.\nErin Wright: Thanks. In terms of capital deployments here, the share repurchase activity, what's embedded overall on your guidance for 2020-2021, and in terms of the share repurchase activity and have you been active in the fourth quarter to-date, and I guess, on that topic as well, you mentioned it was a largely organic growth that you're pointing to, I just want to clarify, does this guidance assume any acquisition I guess activity consistent with your past practices?\nAri Bousbib: You mean the fourth quarter?\nErin Wright: Fourth quarter and 2021.\nAri Bousbib: Yes. So, first of all, congratulations to you, Erin, nice to have you back.\nErin Wright: Thank you.\nAri Bousbib: And secondly, look, we have not done any share repurchase since we suspended our program. So, other than the shares that we repurchased in the first quarter when the last primary sponsor shares were sold and we participated into that secondary, and you know about that. That was in the first quarter pre-pandemic. We haven't done anything since then. I wish we had bought all the shares by the way at $85 a share, but we didn't, and so, we're going to start now optimistically after the earnings release, and there will be probably the markets. We don't have lots of time since we have to start before the end of the year anyway, and with respect to acquisitions, no, I mean there's nothing here for the balance of the year that would be materially different than what we've seen this year, that is relatively negligible M&A activity. In 2021, what's the assumption, Ron\u2026\nRon Bruehlman: Well, you can expect in 2021 we'll spend some on acquisition share repurchase together, we'll trade-off between the two, and our normal assumption there which is valid in 2021 is about a $1.5 billion between the two during the course of the year.\nAri Bousbib: And that's what we had before pandemic. That is what we had before.\nRon Bruehlman: Consistent with past practice.\nErin Wright: Okay, great, and then just cost mitigation efforts and further flexibility, I guess if you do continue to see things get a little bit worse in terms of these flare-ups, there are ample levers you can pull here from a cost mitigation standpoint, correct?\nAri Bousbib: Yes. I mean, Erin, you make a very good point, as you know we made a deliberate decision not -- by and large, not to do any restructuring of our workforce. We had maintained employment, and I might add base compensation as well. First of all, the crisis situation dictated that -- you know, that was the right thing to do to focus on our people and take care of our people, and number two, we anticipated the strong V-shaped recovery in Q4 and 2021, and obviously, we wanted to preserve our talents and resources, and so, we've not done anything. Now, obviously, we had any sustained situation that in a systemic way would force us to look at totally different environment for long-term, then we would change that and we do have levers, and the only thing that I can tell you is that we've had strong productivity, despite not reducing our workforce or our base compensation, we've learned like most companies to work remotely. We have very important study going on called the Future of Work internally, and we're trying to determine which roles -- and as you know, we have about 70,000 people. So, there are a lot of different roles in the company, and we are detailing which roles can actually work from home. What we've learnt during this pandemic, what office space do we really need, and if you are going to be behind your workstation all the day not interacting with other people, what's the need for having a physical presence at an office? Again, dependent on the geographies, there are countries where that's just required like in Japan, for example, others not and when we do home assist and so and so forth. So, there will be a lot of questions depending on the roles, and so, there will be changes to our real estate footprint no questions like most companies, but IT investments that we are making, it is to solidified the remote for more capabilities even further et cetera, but again, we've got very significant levers that we have by and large not touched.\nErin Wright: Okay, great. Thank you.\nOperator: Next question comes from Patrick Donnelly with Citigroup.\nPatrick Donnelly: Thank you for taking the question. Ari, maybe it's on the remote monitoring, virtual trial side, lot of talk about that during the pandemic. I guess do you see general bookings and trials pick back up? Are you seeing any notable shift in activity towards that, or -- I mean how are you guys positioned? Maybe just talk through that.\nAri Bousbib: You are talking about remote? Yes, anybody wants to take this?\nRon Bruehlman: Yes, on the remote monitoring side -- and stop me Patrick if I am not answer your specific question here, but remote monitoring side, we have largely been able to substitute for the work we would otherwise be doing onsite, but not 100% because there are still the requirement to be onsite to check source documentation at the site under FDA guidelines. Now, remote monitoring we should say is different than virtual trials. Virtual trials include patient tele visits, home health nursing, phlebotomy services, user --patient diaries and things of that nature. So, quite different in that regard, so, I think sometimes these two terms are confused, and people are saying that they are doing virtual trials when in fact what they are doing is remote monitoring.\nAri Bousbib: Right, remote monitoring of that which could be monitored remotely which is not everything, right. Not all components of a trial may be monitored remotely. Virtual trial is a trial that has been designed to be virtual, and that doesn't mean that there won't be onsite monitoring visit either, but it uses different technology than has been designed from the start, whereas remote monitoring is a component of regular trials that just happens to be that some of the data -- some of the activities are monitored remotely.\nPatrick Donnelly: Okay, that's helpful. I guess just on the TAS business and following up on Bob's question, you guys had lengthy talks about the quality resiliency there. So, it's encouraging to see the high single digit growth this quarter. Outlook certainly seems bullish for 4Q in '21. I guess when we think about '21, continuing this high single digit growth, I guess further one or two key drivers you see there, customer conversations I assume certainly trending positively, but would love just little more granularity on the outlook for next question on that side?\nAri Bousbib: Look, we have developed our guidance on TAS assuming what we see today continues, and there is no reason -- again we see in the worst of the pandemic performed very well. So, certainly when things return to most stable environment, we will continue our high single digit growth trajectory where we are now, and so, there aren't any specific parts of the business. Now remember the data business is zero to low single digit growth and that's kind of very stable. The analytics and services business again was mid to high single digits, and continues so on the high end of that range. The real world business is just on fire to be frank. I mean it was before on fire I mean in a positive way, and firing on all cylinders, and it was already in very strong double digit territory before the pandemic. It continued to be solid double digit territory before the pandemic, and is now expected to continue to grow at that same pace. Technology continues to pick up as the deployments of OCE are well on their way. Going very well I might add, and all of that will start generating the license revenue. We expect not a huge portion of TAS business, but very nice revenue of nice margins. So, all of that will continue, and so, this four segments of our business and when you do that math and you look at the momentum, no, there is no reason to anticipate -- there is no big -- there is no one big good guy that will affect this company's growth rate, and there is no big bad guy that would have said that that's [indiscernible]. Andrew, you have any\u2026\nAndrew Markwick: We are approaching the top of the hour. So, I was wondering do we want to squeeze in one more quickly, operator.\nOperator: The question is from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel.\nShlomo Rosenbaum: Hi, thank you very much for squeezing me in at the end. I just want to piggyback out at the last question. Ari if you can talk a little bit about more just on the incumbent patients? One of point of time, you mentioned there were like 50,000 seats to deploy. Just like where you are? How long do you think this is going to take, and is there anything changing in terms of competitively, or is it really the same kind of run rates that you had talked about in prior earnings calls?\nAri Bousbib: Yes, thank you, Shlomo. This OCS continued with exactly the same momentum that is moving about two thirds of time. As I mentioned in my introductory remarks, we have now since the beginning of the year won another 45 new clients, and that's now is total of 125 distinct clients. When we talk about the client, I mean it's one company. There are competitors out there that count five different wins with the same client as five. We count that as one. You mentioned 50,000. I think we are now -- correct me if I am wrong, Andrew, at 63 - 64,000.\nAndrew Markwick: Maybe just around 63, yes.\nAri Bousbib: Yes, close to 65,000 users in deployment, and we expect that to continue to grow. That's a nice pipeline. Lots of conversations continue to go. So, the momentum here is unabated. No changes. Thank you, Shlomo. Thank you everyone.\nAndrew Markwick: Thanks very much. Thank you everyone, and thanks for taking the time to join us today. We look forward to speaking with you again on our fourth quarter 2020 earnings call, and as always, Jen and I will be available to take any follow-up questions you might have throughout the day.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Ron Bruehlman",
            "content": "Thank you, Ari, and good morning everyone. Let's turn first to revenue. Third quarter revenue of $2,786 million grew 0.6% reported, and was flat at constant currency. Revenue for the first nine months of the year was $8,061 million, which was down 1.6% reported, and 1.2% at constant currency. Technology & Analytics Solutions revenue of $1,207 million grew 10.2% reported, and 9.2% in constant currency. Year-to-date, Tech & Analytics Solutions revenue was $3,433 million, up 4.9% reported, and 5.6% at constant currency. In R&D Solutions, third quarter revenue of $1,400 million was down 4.5% at actual FX rate, and 5.1% at constant currency. Excluding the impact of pass throughs, R&D Solution third quarter revenue grew 2.6%. Year-to-date revenue of $4,076 million was down 5.6% at actual FX rate, and 5.4% at constant currency. Contract Sales and Medical Solutions revenue of $179 million was down 13.9% year-over-year reported, and 14.4 % on a constant currency basis in the third quarter. Year-to-date, revenue was $552 million, down 8.6% at actual FX rate, and 8.3% at constant currency. Now moving down to P&L, adjusted EBITDA was $604 million for the third quarter, which represented growth of 1.9%, year-to-date adjusted EBITDA was $1,649 million. Third quarter GAAP net income was $101 million, and GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.52. Year-to-date GAAP net income was $160 million, and GAAP diluted earnings per share $0.82. Adjusted income was $318 million for the quarter and $841 million year-to-date. Our adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 1.9% in the third quarter at $1.63. Year-to-date adjusted diluted earnings per share was $4.32. Now turning to the R&D Solutions backlog, as Ari mentioned, R&DS new business activity remains quite strong. Consequent on the robust booking activity that Ari talked about, our backlog grew 18.5% year-over-year with close at $21.7, and we expect $5.8 billion of this backlog to convert to renew over the next 12 months, which is an increase of over $400 million versus where we were at June 30, and I would add that the outlook remains quite positive as RFPs are growing low double digits in both volume and dollars. Moving to the balance sheet now, at September 30, cash and cash equivalents total $1.5 billion and debt was $12.3 billion resulting in net debt of $10.9 billion. Due to our strong EBITDA and cash flow in the quarter, our net leverage ratio at September 30 was 4.7 times trailing 12 month adjusted EBITDA, which was down a tick from where we were at June 30. Cash flow was a bright spot as it last quarter. Cash flow from operations was $574 million in the third quarter, up 74% over last year. Capital expenditures were $157 million and that resulted in free cash flow of $470 million. M&A spending as you saw was negligible in the quarter. For the first nine months of the year, free cash flow was $769 million which is about double the same period last year. Now as you know, when the COVID-19 outbreak became a pandemic in March, we temporarily suspended our share repurchase program. We did not repurchase any shares in the second or third quarters, but the business is recovering well from COVID-19 disruptions. Underlying demand is robust and cash flow is as well, and we have a very solid liquidity position. Closing the quarter with an undrawn revolver of almost $1.5 billion of cash on the balance sheet, and as a result of all this, we have lifted our suspension on share repurchase program, and we are expecting to opportunistically resume share repurchase activity, and as a reminder, we currently have about $1 billion of share repurchase authorization remaining under the program. Now let's turn to guidance. Given the continuing momentum in the business, we are raising our full-year guidance range for revenue, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted diluted EPS. Our guidance for the fourth quarter and full-year of 2020 assumes that business congestions will continue to improve during the fourth quarter, and specifically, we assume that localized flare-ups of COVID-19 will not have a material impact on fourth quarter results. We now expect 2020 revenue for the full-year to be between $11,100 million and $11,250 million, which is an increase of $125 million over our prior guidance at the midpoint of the range. For profit, we now expect full-year adjusted EBITDA to be $2,335 million and $2,360 million which represent a $27 million increase over our prior guidance at the midpoint of the range, and adjusted diluted EPS we are expecting to be between $6.25 and $6.35, which is an increase of $0.10 over our prior guidance, again at the midpoint of the range. This full-year guidance implies fourth quarter revenue of $3,040 million to $3,190 million, representing growth of 5.0 to 10.2%. Now, this is a wider range than we would normally guide to at this point in year due to the uncertain timing of pass-through revenues associated with the COVID trials that we are working on. From a segment perspective, we expect Technology & Analytics Solutions revenue would be in the high single digits at the midpoint of our guidance range, R&D Solutions revenue growth to reach double-digits, with the caveat that this growth rate could move up or down based on the timing of pass through revenue, and CSMS revenue growth to be similar to what we saw in the third quarter. For fourth quarter profit, we expect adjusted EBITDA to be between $685 million and $710 million, representing growth of 6.7% to 10.6%, and adjusted diluted EPS to be between $1.92 and $2.03 or growth of 10.9% to 16.7%. This guidance assumes that foreign exchange rates at September 30, 2020 remain in effect for the rest of the year. As we indicated at the start of the pandemic, we've decided to advance our planning process versus prior years, and as a result we're now in a position to provide our 2021 outlook, and this is much earlier than we would have done in the ordinary course. For the full-year 2021, we expect revenue in the range of $12,300 million to $12,600 million. This represents growth at 10.1% to 12.8% versus the midpoint of our 2020 guide. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be the range of $2,725 million to $2,800 million, representing growth at 16.1% to 19.3% compared to the midpoint of our 2020 guidance, and finally, we expect adjusted EPS to be in the range of $7.65 to $7.95, which would represent growth of 21.4% to 26.2% compared to the midpoint of our 2020 guidance. A little bit more detail for you, the adjusted diluted EPS guidance assumes interest expense of approximately $420 million, operational depreciation and amortization of about $400 million, and other below-the-line expense items such as minority interest of approximately $50 million, and also a continuation of our share repurchase activity. The effective tax rate we're assuming will remain largely in line with 2020. Our 2021 guidance is predicated on the assumption that business conditions will continue to improve in the fourth quarter, and that majority of business will return to normal during 2021. Our outlook for 2021 also incorporates our view that there will be some tail of COVID work, but growth in R&DS will come primarily from our base business. So in summary, we're pleased with our team's ability to navigate the challenges that COVID has presented throughout the year, and we're proud to be a critical contributor to the solution to this public health crisis. Our R&DS business has adapted well, returning to growth in services revenue, and achieving another record quarter of bookings. Our Technology & Analytics Solutions business improved sequentially and has returned to pre COVID growth rates despite the headwinds of the event management business. Our solid year-to-date overall company performance has enabled us to raise our guidance for the full-year for revenue, adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted diluted EPS, and now this performance combined with our strong free cash flow and liquidity position has enabled us to lift the suspension of our share repurchase program, and finally, we are expecting continued recovery in the fourth quarter and a very strong 2021. So, with that, let me hand it back over to the operator for Q&A. Yes, just one thing I would emphasize, Bob, if there was a surprise versus where we were expecting early in the year, it's our analytics and consulting business has continued to be very strong, and I think Ari highlighted that in his prepared remarks that we were expecting some disruption due to business development activity, face-to-face selling being affected, and in fact that hasn't, our analytics and consulting visits has been quite strong. We have solid growth next year in revenue in R&DS even excluding like COVID work. That's the short answer. In Q4 also... Well, you can expect in 2021 we'll spend some on acquisition share repurchase together, we'll trade-off between the two, and our normal assumption there which is valid in 2021 is about a $1.5 billion between the two during the course of the year. Consistent with past practice. Yes, on the remote monitoring side -- and stop me Patrick if I am not answer your specific question here, but remote monitoring side, we have largely been able to substitute for the work we would otherwise be doing onsite, but not 100% because there are still the requirement to be onsite to check source documentation at the site under FDA guidelines. Now, remote monitoring we should say is different than virtual trials. Virtual trials include patient tele visits, home health nursing, phlebotomy services, user --patient diaries and things of that nature. So, quite different in that regard, so, I think sometimes these two terms are confused, and people are saying that they are doing virtual trials when in fact what they are doing is remote monitoring."

            "content": "Thank you, Andrew, and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining our third quarter 2020 earnings call. The third quarter marked a nice sequential improvement in our financial performance, with results coming in above the high-end of our expectations. You will recall that based on early signs of recovery at the end of the second quarter, we raised our guidance for the year. Based on stronger than expected performance in the third quarter, we are again raising our full-year guidance ranges for revenue, adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted diluted EPS. We're expecting a continuation of these recovery trends in the fourth quarter. This of course sets us up well for next year. As we promised back in April at the onset of this pandemic, we will talk to you today about our outlook for 2021. Based on what we currently see, we think the most significant COVID impact to our business are behind us, and our outlook for 2021 indicates strong performance next year, and a return to our growth trajectory. Ron will discuss 2020 and 2021 guidance in more detail later. Before we review the quarter, a quick operational update, we continue to experience a gradual improvement in the accessibility of clinical resource sites in the R&D Solutions business even with the localized flare-ups we've seen around the world. We are seeing a return to on-site monitoring visits, and similar to last quarter, on-site visits exceeded the number of remote visits. In instances where sites remain physically inaccessible for clinical monitoring, remote monitoring and virtual solutions are proving to be effective workarounds. The pace of startup activity picked up significantly during the first quarter, and we are pretty much back to baseline levels for site initiation visits. Of course, special recruitment trends have started to follow as well. Moving to Technology & Analytics, as expected TAS has remained resilient throughout this crisis in almost every area. We've had very little interruption in data supply or demand. Our information services continue to be mission critical to our clients, and are therefore very insulated from the impacts of the pandemic. The analytics and consulting businesses are performing remarkably well, development being hampered by the lack of in-person interactions. One area we discussed before that has experienced significant disruption is the event management business, which relies almost entirely on face-to-face interaction, and of course, as you know, that business is essentially on pause for now. Demand for our technology offerings remains strong. We've added 45 OCE clients this year, bringing our total number of clients to 125. During the quarter, we successfully rolled out OCE Optimizer, a real-time map-based territory and sales rep alignment solution. These tools saved management teams significant amounts of time previously spent planning and assessing sales data to ensure resources are effectively focused on the appropriate client base and products. Finally, our CSMS business, demand for field reps continues to be soft, which of course impacts revenue, but as we said before, while business development has also slowed due to the lack of in-person interactions, so far the business has performed modestly better than we would have expected as existing clients have largely retained field reps and have been continuing their engagements with us. Now against that backdrop, let's now review our third quarter results. Revenue for the third quarter came in at $2,786 million, which was $11 million above the high end of our guidance range. This revenue beat came from strong organic operational performance. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA was $604 million, with a $22 million beat versus the high end of our guidance range. The EBITDA beat was due to better operational performance and productivity. Third quarter adjusted diluted EPS was $1.63, reflecting the EBITDA drop through because the below-the-line item essentially netted out to zero. Third quarter R&DS contracted backlog, including pass throughs grew 18.5% year-over-year to $21.7 billion as of September 30, 2020. We have broad-based bookings strength, but full-service clinical and lab were particularly strong. The contracted net book-to-bill ratio including pass throughs was 1.71 for the third quarter of 2020, and 1.42 excluding pass throughs. The LTM contracted book-to-bill ratio, at September 30, was 1.55 including pass throughs, and 1.45 excluding pass throughs. I will now turn it over to Ron for more details on our financial performance. I think looking at the contracted services bookings, in the quarter it was about 20%. Yes, I mean the -- it's very hard, the timing of pass throughs and the volume of pass throughs is different. Look, we have a lot of COVID awards since the start of the pandemic, many of them small from protocol reviews. I mean I think we had like close to 200 different awards around the world, so gives you a sense. Some of them very tiny, some protocol reviews, we have lab work. They range from -- you had normal fees to, of course, we are on several of the large vaccine trials, not necessarily doing the entire work but we, for example, have been awarded work I think on four of the five trials that are part of Operation Warp Speed that are in phase three. So sometimes we've got in -- and in a couple of cases we've got the full service work, and, of course, there we've got big pass through numbers. In other cases we'll get the lab work, the pharmacovigilance work. So we are very involved, and some of that work does not include pass through, some of that it does include pass throughs. A lot of trials where we have full clinical work do have big pass through numbers which have not been yet into -- in our revenue numbers given that, as you probably know, we are in our full service vaccine work is in at a later stage than to have some of our competitors who have already seen that revenue -- that very strong revenue flow through in prior quarter or will seek in this quarter, in Q3, mostly from pass through revenue. Yes, well look, I mean in developing -- I'm sorry, you're talking about 2021 obviously. Yes, so I mean, look, Eric, we have spent a lot of time, as mentioned back in April, we wanted to try to give you a sense for how 2021 would shape up, and we've spent a lot of time, bottom up, reviewing what would happen. As you know, we affect everything or piece of work across our business segments with probabilities and an assessment of what revenue would be derived in subsequent periods. So the same applies to the COVID trials. Most of the revenue on the large full-service COVID trial is pass through, okay, so there's no impact to profit, and that's just the fact. When you are a full service work on a vaccine trial you have to remember there are cases I've seen, I don't know if that's the case with us, but it's where the past revenue is a ratio of 10 to one, in other words $10 or pass through versus $1 of service revenue, whereas in normal traditional trials we would see one pass through dollar to each two or three dollars of service revenue, and once again, pass throughs is totally irrelevant to our profits, it has no impact whatsoever. So, it makes it very difficult to predict. So that's one element of the COVID trial. The second one is, of course, we've taken into account the possibility that vaccine trials get cancelled. There could be a vaccine that gets approved, or two, or three, and the others ones feel that it's not economically worthwhile for the sponsor to continue to vaccine trial. In fact historically, well before COVID, we know from experience that vaccine work carries an unusually high risk of cancellation versus traditional other drug developments. So with all of that in mind, so we know all of that, we've factored all of that into our guidance, and we feel good and we have anticipated in many in our possibility and many such scenarios, and we feel good about that. Now, you bear in mind that a lot of the work that was supposed to come online, new projects, have been put on hold by our clients because many clients have devoted their attention, resources to COVID, whether it's for therapeutics or for vaccine work, and we do expect, in fact our clients have told us that when that phase goes away they'll go back to the projects they were supposed to have been working on in 2020. So we have no concern that all of a sudden, if that's what you're alluding to, there will be a kind of a drop in either bookings or revenue, we do not expect that, and we've factored a lot of that potential variability into our guidance. That's the benefit of having such a wide diversified portfolio as we do have at IQVIA, both within our R&DS business and our TAS business. You should also realize that we are getting a lot of interest from public health authorities and also a lot from sponsors for pharmacovigilance, in other words tracking COVID patients. Our real world business is experiencing strong double-digit growth, and we expect continued interest in pandemic-related work in general. We all hope this will be the last time that it ever, but we also all know and understand that crises will happen in the future, and perhaps the magnitude of the COVID crisis has taught all of us a lot of interesting things that we are going to put in place going forward in terms of preparedness, in terms of patient tracking, in terms of monitoring what exactly -- you've seen our press release on the CARE Project with the FDA, where we are looking at patients who have potentially been exposed to COVID. We are connecting all the dots between their medical history and our de-identified patient records, understanding what types of vitamins they've been taking, what other drug regimens they've been under, and trying to determine a map of at-risk populations with a lot more precision than what's been done today. So all of those projects are in the pipe, and I expect those to continue irrespective of whether the COVID crisis ends or not. So again, everything has been factored into our guidance. Thank you. Well, okay, as I said in my introductory remarks, with respect to site initiation visits which -- and site startup activity, that's the area of our business that has seen the strongest improvement. In fact, the site initiation visits are back to baseline levels, and recruitment of positions obviously starting to follow. So I think actually very good moves on that front. The accessibility to sites for trials that are in flight hasn't quite recovered. We are currently at about, I want to say the -- I look at my team about 70%, right. We are currently for global, if you look globally at our sites we are back to about 70% normal accessibility. That's a bit below what we would have expected, but interestingly it's critical site, because a site is not a site is not a site. There are sites that are very tiny, and the relative incremental value of opening that sites doesn't mean as much. So we are focused on the ones that are most significant. So that's for in-flight trials, and we're returning gradually to normal activity there. For new trails, again site startup activities has resumed, site initiation as essentially the visits are where they should be normally pre-COVID levels, normally patient recruitment lives, but that has increased significantly throughout the quarter, patient recruitment was fundamentally disrupted, okay, because essentially everything was put on a hold, and we're gradually going back, we have good momentum, and we don't think we will recover to baseline level and sometime in 2021, but again all of that is factored into our guidance. Yes, absolutely. As you know, we've had great success with OCT coming from behind, and we therefore along with our partners Salesforce, we expanded the relationship to clinical tech platform in tools on the health cloud, we have seven technologies available today for digital sides and patient suites. The digital patient suite includes products such as eConsent, eCOA, and also patient portal. We will by the end of the year have the digital trial management suite go live probably before the end of the year, and the products will include CTMS, risk based monitoring, and the mobile CRA platform. So again, the fully orchestrated solution, OCT, that you're referring to, will be available by the end of this year. Again, we are also coming from behind in this area, but we will be claiming our fair share as we're doing in OCT on the commercial side. Thank you. Well, look, we've said that we should be seeing or reaching double-digit RDS growth in Q4, okay, and we do expect mid-teens in 2021. So, what needs to happen is all normal course of business based on the work that we've done that I described earlier in my reply to Eric's question, our guidance is being bottom-up, as we always do project-by-project and we make an assumption of -- look, I mean what needs to happen is things are going to happen, okay? The elections are going to be behind us, there will be more clarity in environment, there will be at least two or three vaccines out there, people have learned to live with this, people are moving on, and all of that will happen sometime in 2021 during the year. Obviously, this assumes when we say \"Normal Business Conditions,\" it means that what we're seeing today, the trends that we're seeing today, the improvements that we are seeing today continue with a bit more stability in 2021 due to all of these factors being unclear, again, election behind, more clarity on the environment, vaccines learning to live with this thing, all of these assumes when we say stable business conditions it means there is no new pandemic, God forbid, or anything like that, and it's a new normal, if you will, and that's what we're assuming; nothing extraordinary, nothing needs to happen, I should point out that we haven't done any acquisitions of significance as you know really for the past two years. I mean we haven't been spent at the rate that we used to. This is all organic for the most part, and so again, we feel very good about this guidance. Look, the performance is the reflection of the sales, I can't say a different way of the resilience of the business, A lot of what we do is mission critical to our clients with or without the pandemic. Certainly the data business hasn't moved. If anything, there was -- if it proves how mission critical it was. We probably had the best visibility, I mean, you guys and a lot of people out there felt we were insane back at the beginning of the pandemic for giving relatively precise guidance for the balance of the year, and now here we are, and it looks like more or less we are on target and that it's not because we're geniuses, it's because we have visibility, we've got businesses that they allow us to have that visibility, and we are global. So, there are different stages of the pandemic in different parts of the world, so we can model this out, we have our internal database, deep analytics, predictive analytics, and modeling capability. Yes, I mean you asked me about the impacts of the delays in the vaccine work. Yes, I mean, first of all, interruptions in trials in general are a common occurrence. There are adverse events. In the case of vaccine trials where you have the number, which is arguably one of the reasons why fasteners are so big, because the number of patients enrolling in vaccine trials is huge, we're talking about massive amounts 30,000, 40,000, 50,000, 60,000 people in a trial. You're going to have adverse events, and those adverse events will cause an interruption of the trial, but again, we've factored that in. It's all in our guidance, and we don't expect -- and by the way, as I mentioned before, there are also cancellations in vaccine trials that are more likely. So, look, again we factored that in, we put probabilities on all of our vaccine work, and bear in mind, cancellation is only result in 100% of lost revenue, there is one down and so on, and finally, frankly, since for the full service trial, the one that we talked about, most of the revenue is pass through. So, and this is COVID work. So, it's not likely or maybe even on the service, the small portion of the revenue that's service, it's not like we're making a margin or a margin at all, right, because it's part of our contribution to the effort. So, that's for the vaccine, and what was the other question you had? Yes, I don't have to give you the exact contribution to vote, but it's not what's creating the very strong double-digit growth that we expect. By the way, our growth this year, underlying growth without the COVID work also, not that great growth, but... Yes, in Q4 also, yes, yes, but the flare-ups, I mean look, if it continues in the same proportion and occurrence, and frequency as we see now, that's what's factoring in our guidance, but again, eventually, with the advent of vaccines by the end of the year, or next year, we think all of that will -- and people we learn how to work with this, it's already happening. If you look at, again China is a good -- things are back to normal in China, I'd say entirely, I mean, it's not 100%, it's 95% plus accessible. There are flare-ups by the way in China, but people just work with this. Also again, we have to do some catch-up work, bear in mind, that's also factored into our guidance. We did a lot of remote monitoring this year when we couldn't access the site, and I think people forget that we are not going to move to 100% remote monitoring, okay? There is still a requirement by all regulatory authorities around the world that source document verification has to occur on site. FDA, all the regulatory explicitly require that the source document should not be shared remotely. So again, obviously, what has changed is the number of data points that might be looked at remotely like key safety and efficacy data for example, and so, there's reduced requirements on less critical data, but in general, we still have to do that work that we will not be able to do. So, all of that is, \"Pent-up Demand\" that needs to be addressed in the coming quarters, catch-up work, if you will. I don't know about that, because I'm not going to venture to make prediction on CSMS, I've been wrong in both directions. I have assumed they would go down and they went up, and I assumed they would go up, and they went down. So, look, what's factored into our guidance is kind of flattish five growth, okay, if it's plus 1%, plus 2%, I don't know; flattish growth, flattish for next year. More detail on the segments when we provide guidance in the ordinary course at the beginning of '21 when we share full-year results and Q4 results, and as we traditionally do, and we'll give more detail on segments there, because I'm sure you can derive based on the comments we made and on the overall guidance that the momentum we see now, three business segments will continue. You mean the fourth quarter? Yes. So, first of all, congratulations to you, Erin, nice to have you back. And secondly, look, we have not done any share repurchase since we suspended our program. So, other than the shares that we repurchased in the first quarter when the last primary sponsor shares were sold and we participated into that secondary, and you know about that. That was in the first quarter pre-pandemic. We haven't done anything since then. I wish we had bought all the shares by the way at $85 a share, but we didn't, and so, we're going to start now optimistically after the earnings release, and there will be probably the markets. We don't have lots of time since we have to start before the end of the year anyway, and with respect to acquisitions, no, I mean there's nothing here for the balance of the year that would be materially different than what we've seen this year, that is relatively negligible M&A activity. In 2021, what's the assumption, Ron... And that's what we had before pandemic. That is what we had before. Yes. I mean, Erin, you make a very good point, as you know we made a deliberate decision not -- by and large, not to do any restructuring of our workforce. We had maintained employment, and I might add base compensation as well. First of all, the crisis situation dictated that -- you know, that was the right thing to do to focus on our people and take care of our people, and number two, we anticipated the strong V-shaped recovery in Q4 and 2021, and obviously, we wanted to preserve our talents and resources, and so, we've not done anything. Now, obviously, we had any sustained situation that in a systemic way would force us to look at totally different environment for long-term, then we would change that and we do have levers, and the only thing that I can tell you is that we've had strong productivity, despite not reducing our workforce or our base compensation, we've learned like most companies to work remotely. We have very important study going on called the Future of Work internally, and we're trying to determine which roles -- and as you know, we have about 70,000 people. So, there are a lot of different roles in the company, and we are detailing which roles can actually work from home. What we've learnt during this pandemic, what office space do we really need, and if you are going to be behind your workstation all the day not interacting with other people, what's the need for having a physical presence at an office? Again, dependent on the geographies, there are countries where that's just required like in Japan, for example, others not and when we do home assist and so and so forth. So, there will be a lot of questions depending on the roles, and so, there will be changes to our real estate footprint no questions like most companies, but IT investments that we are making, it is to solidified the remote for more capabilities even further et cetera, but again, we've got very significant levers that we have by and large not touched. You are talking about remote? Yes, anybody wants to take this? Right, remote monitoring of that which could be monitored remotely which is not everything, right. Not all components of a trial may be monitored remotely. Virtual trial is a trial that has been designed to be virtual, and that doesn't mean that there won't be onsite monitoring visit either, but it uses different technology than has been designed from the start, whereas remote monitoring is a component of regular trials that just happens to be that some of the data -- some of the activities are monitored remotely. Look, we have developed our guidance on TAS assuming what we see today continues, and there is no reason -- again we see in the worst of the pandemic performed very well. So, certainly when things return to most stable environment, we will continue our high single digit growth trajectory where we are now, and so, there aren't any specific parts of the business. Now remember the data business is zero to low single digit growth and that's kind of very stable. The analytics and services business again was mid to high single digits, and continues so on the high end of that range. The real world business is just on fire to be frank. I mean it was before on fire I mean in a positive way, and firing on all cylinders, and it was already in very strong double digit territory before the pandemic. It continued to be solid double digit territory before the pandemic, and is now expected to continue to grow at that same pace. Technology continues to pick up as the deployments of OCE are well on their way. Going very well I might add, and all of that will start generating the license revenue. We expect not a huge portion of TAS business, but very nice revenue of nice margins. So, all of that will continue, and so, this four segments of our business and when you do that math and you look at the momentum, no, there is no reason to anticipate -- there is no big -- there is no one big good guy that will affect this company's growth rate, and there is no big bad guy that would have said that that's [indiscernible]. Andrew, you have any... Yes, thank you, Shlomo. This OCS continued with exactly the same momentum that is moving about two thirds of time. As I mentioned in my introductory remarks, we have now since the beginning of the year won another 45 new clients, and that's now is total of 125 distinct clients. When we talk about the client, I mean it's one company. There are competitors out there that count five different wins with the same client as five. We count that as one. You mentioned 50,000. I think we are now -- correct me if I am wrong, Andrew, at 63 - 64,000. Yes, close to 65,000 users in deployment, and we expect that to continue to grow. That's a nice pipeline. Lots of conversations continue to go. So, the momentum here is unabated. No changes. Thank you, Shlomo. Thank you everyone."

That's very helpful, and if I could get you to just follow on to that, a number of investors are focused on how the COVID work plays out over the next several quarters. When do you expect a peak in bookings and/or revenue from COVID-related trials at which point we would obviously need the quarter to be back fully to offset any year-over-year comparisons that might be developing? Yes, and [multiple speakers] -- yes. Ari, thank you very much for the detailed answers, I appreciate it."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder this call is being recorded. Thank you. I would like to now turn the call over to Andrew Markwick, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasury. Mr. Markwick, please begin your conference.\nAndrew Markwick: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our second quarter 2020 earnings call. With me on the call today are Ari Bousbib, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Michael McDonnell, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Ron Bruehlman, who will be Mike's successor, as of August 1; Eric Sherbet, Executive Vice President and General Counsel; Nick Childs, Senior Vice President, Financial Planning and Analysis; and Jen Halchak, Senior Director, Investor Relations. Today, we will be referencing a presentation that will be visible during this call for those of you on our webcast. This presentation will also be available following this call, on the Events and Presentations section of our IQVIA Investor Relations website at ir.iqvia.com. Before we begin, I would like to caution listeners that certain information discussed by management during this conference call, will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those stated or implied by forward-looking statements, due to risks and uncertainties associated with the company's business, including COVID-19 impacts, which are discussed in the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings. In addition, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures on this call, which should be considered as supplement to and not a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the comparable GAAP measures is included in the press release and conference call presentation. I would now like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Ari Bousbib.\nAri Bousbib: Thank you, Andrew, and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining our second quarter 2020 earnings call. Before we get to the results, I'm sure you all saw the announcement last night, and so this will be Mike's last IQVIA earnings call, and so I wanted to take the opportunity to thank him for his service and wish him well in his new role at Biogen. I also want to thank Ron and welcome him back, he really never left, but I want to thank him for agreeing to serve as our Interim Chief Financial Officer until we decide on a permanent successor. Many of you already know Ron, and I'm sure you are delighted to welcome him back to the CFO chair. Now to our results; revenue, adjusted EBITDA and earnings all came in above our guidance ranges. Today, we are also updating our guidance for the year and raising our full year revenue, adjusted EBITDA and earnings ranges. Before we review the numbers, I'd like to give you a quick operational update. During the second quarter, we saw gradual improvement in the accessibility of clinical research sites in the R&D solutions business, pretty much in line with what we told you three months ago. Global site access improved to approximately 20% in April, to 40% at the end of June. Average site accessibility for the second quarter was about 30%, again in line with the assumption that we made, when we set our second quarter guidance. The progress of global site reopenings is continuing into the third quarter, and today, it's at 53%. I should point out that the progress has been slowing somewhat in the past couple of weeks, as a result of several localized COVID-19 flare-ups in geographies around the world, and especially, in parts of the United States. As sites have become accessible, we've seen an improvement in the number of onsite monitoring visits. In fact, on-site visits are now exceeding the number of remote visit, and as a result, remote visits have reduced from the peak in the second quarter. Of course, wherever sites are still inaccessible, our ability to deliver solutions like remote monitoring and virtual trials remains critical to ensuring trial continuity. Now, patients who are already enrolled in trials have slowly begun returning for in-person treatment. As you would expect, this varies by therapeutic area. For example, oncology patients are returning at a faster rate than dermatology patients. Also, the recent outbreaks in parts of the U.S. have hampered the pace of recovery in the number of patients enrolled in trials, who are willing to come in for in-person treatment. For trials that have not yet started, the pace of site startup and patients recruitment has obviously been slow. It's improving, but still slow. For example, patient recruitment for new trials, which had been virtually halted during the second quarter, has resumed over the past few weeks, and is now at about 25% of normal baseline enrollment levels. We expect this to continue to improve over time. R&DS business development activity has remained very strong. We still have not had any material cancellations of trials in our backlog, due to COVID-19. Interactions with clients, such as Big Defenses continue, as clients adjust to working virtually. RFP volume and value continue to hold at basically similar levels to 2019. And of course, the R&DS team has been awarded a wide range of COVID-19 vaccine therapeutics and related lab work. Of course, you will have seen, we announced a collaboration with AstraZeneca last week, to accelerate development of a potential COVID vaccine. COVID-19, more broadly has accelerated interest in our virtual trials solution, including Study Hub. Awards for our virtual trial solutions have actually doubled, albeit of a relatively small base. We are leveraging our virtual trial technology platform, Study Hub, to deliver a seamless patient experience. As you know, the platform combined eConsent, telemedicine, eCOA and digital communication. Moving to Technology & Analytics. We continue to have very little interruption in data, supply or demand. Our data production centers around the world remain fully operational, and our Technology & Analytics deliveries continue in the ordinary course. Selling activities have started to resume, as clients have adjusted to working virtually as well. There is still some delayed decision making for ad hoc services work, but we've had real good momentum in our fastest growing businesses, such as Real World and Tech. Our Real World business continues to expand even in this environment, with strong growth in the quarter. As a reminder, the results of our Real World business are reported in our TAS segment. So unlike our CRO peers, this growth is not included in R&DS results. In the Technology space, OCE has added 35 new clients so far in 2020. OCE deployments continue to progress as scheduled, as clients look to accelerate their usage and get up and running on the platform even faster. We now have 115 customers that have chosen OCE, and they represent over 60,000 potential users of the platform. Most of these customers are still in the early stage of deployment. So far, our win rate in this segment when going head-to-head against the incumbent is approximately 70%. Finally, in our CSMS business, we've not experienced any material cancellations. Although, as expected, we've experienced softer demand for field reps, which of course impacts revenue. Additionally, business development has slowed considerably in this segment. Let's now review the second quarter results. Revenue for the second quarter came in at $2,521,000,000, which is a $118 million above the midpoint of our guidance range. Now $41 million of this $118 million beat came from FX and pass-throughs. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA was $483 million, with a $25 million beat versus the midpoint of our guidance, and this came entirely from better operational performance. Second quarter adjusted diluted EPS was $1.18. Second quarter R&DS contracted backlog, including pass-throughs grew 13.5% year-over-year to $20.5 billion at June 30, 2020. We saw good growth in awards for our large pharma clients, as well as our EBP clients in the quarter. We had broad-based booking strength by offering, with particular strength in full service clinical and in lab. The contracted net book-to-bill ratio including pass-throughs was 1.64 for the second quarter of 2020, and excluding pass-throughs, the second quarter contracted book-to-bill ratio was 1.60. The LTM contracted book-to-bill ratio at June 30 was 1.43, including pass-throughs and 1.42 excluding pass-throughs. As we said previously, we've continued to make every effort to preserve employment during this crisis and to the extent possible we have not affected based compensation for our employees. Of course, we've worked to reduce other costs and discretionary spend and as a result of these actions, our adjusted EBITDA came in well above our expectations. You can see, when you adjust for pass-throughs and FX, that the drop through incremental margin on the revenue beat was over 30%. So far, even considering several flare-ups around the world, things seem to be moving in the right direction. Sites are reopening globally, allowing us to resume our critical work in R&DS. We continue to be cautiously optimistic, and we anticipate a sharp recovery in the back end of the year. Mike will review in more detail how we see the second half playing out. Finally, a quick update on our 2021 planning process. As I've already shared with you, we started this process earlier than usual and our plan is to provide 2021 guidance before the end of this year. Given the positive trends we've seen in operational execution and client demand, together with catch-up work and the associated change orders that we currently anticipate, as well as the COVID awards, we remain optimistic that in 2021, we will see a return to our previous growth trajectory. Now, I'll turn it over to Mike for some more detail on the quarter, how we see the second half of the year play out, and the upward revisions to our guidance.\nMichael McDonnell: Thank you, Ari, and good morning everyone. Turning first to revenue; second quarter revenue was $2.521 billion compared to $2.740 billion in the second quarter of 2019. First half revenue was $5.275 billion compared to $5.424 billion in the first half of 2019. Second quarter revenue in Technology & Analytics Solutions was $1.109 billion compared to $1.102 billion in the second quarter of 2019. First half Tech & Analytics Solutions revenue was $2.226 billion compared with $2.177 billion for the first half of 2019. R&D Solutions second quarter revenue was $1.235 compared with $1.435 billion in the second quarter of 2019. First half revenue in R&D Solutions was $2.676 billion compared with $2.851 billion in the first half of 2019. Second quarter contract Sales & Medical Solutions revenue was $177 million compared with $203 million in the second quarter of 2019. First half contract Sales & Medical Solutions revenue was $373 million compared to $396 million in the first half of 2019. Turning now to profit, adjusted EBITDA was $483 million for the second quarter, and $1.045 billion for the first half. Second quarter GAAP net loss was $23 million, resulting in a $0.12 loss per diluted share. For the first half, we had GAAP net income of $59 million or $0.30 of earnings per diluted share. Adjusted net income was $229 million for the second quarter or $1.18 per share. Adjusted net income for the first half was $523 million or $2.68 per share. Let's now turn to R&D Solutions backlog; closing backlog grew 13.5% to $20.5 billion at June 30, 2020. New business wins remain strong and to-date we have experienced no material COVID-19 related cancellations. Let's now review the balance sheet; at June 30, cash and cash equivalents totaled $1.1 billion and debt was $12.1 billion, resulting in net debt of approximately $11 billion. As of June 30, 2020, our net leverage ratio ticked up slightly to 4.8 times our trailing 12 month adjusted EBITDA, as a result of the COVID-19 related impacts on our first half adjusted EBITDA. As a reminder, we continue to be committed to bringing our leverage ratio to a range of 3.5 to 4 times, as we exit 2022. Cash flow from operating activities was $472 million in the second quarter and $635 million year-to-date. CapEx for the quarter was $142 million, $283 million year-to-date, and free cash flow for the quarter was $330 million or $352 million year-to-date. As you know, when the COVID-19 outbreak became a pandemic in March, we temporarily suspended share repurchase activity. Accordingly, we did not repurchase any shares in the second quarter, and as of June 30 of 2020, we had approximately $1 billion of share repurchase authorization remaining. We will continue to evaluate the right time to reinitiate our share repurchase program. We continue to have strong liquidity. At June 30, we had $1.1 billion of cash on the balance sheet and our $1.5 billion revolving credit facility was undrawn. We also have over $1 billion of EBITDA cushion, relative to our leverage and interest coverage maintenance covenants, even as our first half adjusted EBITDA has suffered a significant and unusual impact from COVID-19. And finally, I would point out that we have a lot of flexibility with capital allocation, which includes CapEx, M&A and share repurchases. And now, let's move to guidance; on our first quarter earnings call, we outlined our assumptions regarding the global progression of the virus, the percentage of clinical research sites accessible to us throughout 2020, and our ability to interact with clients to support business development activities. These assumptions supported our 2020 guidance provided at that time. During the second quarter, it became apparent that the global spread of the virus would become wider and more prolonged than we had assumed. However, the percentage of sites accessible to us, tracked in line with our expectations, and business development activities have progressed better than our original assumptions. We also had made the assumption at the time that 100% of clinical research sites would be accessible by the beginning of the fourth quarter. However, given localized flare-ups around the world, we now see this happening more at the beginning of 2021. But, in spite of this, we have been able to overcome restricted site access better than we initially thought, through work around, including the use of our remote capabilities. Based on our better than expected performance in the second quarter, the company's ability to execute in this environment, incremental COVID-19 trial work and evaluation of current business conditions and outlook for the balance of the year, we are now forecasting better performance in our TAS segment and better execution against our R&DS backlog than previously anticipated. Together, these factors are expected to contribute to improved financial performance in 2020 versus the company's expectations on April 28, 2020. As a result, we are raising our full year guidance ranges for the full year. We now expect full year revenue to be between $11 billion and $11,100,000,000, which represents an increase of approximately $290 million at the midpoint, of which approximately 20% represents a favorable FX impact based on exchange rates as of the end of the second quarter. Please note that FX still represents a year-over-year headwind of 60 basis points on our average revenue guidance. At the midpoint of the new guidance range, the constant currency growth represents slight growth year-over-year. For full year profit, we expect adjusted EBITDA to be between $2,295,000,000 and $2,345,000,000 and we expect adjusted diluted EPS to be between $6.10 and $6.30. This guidance assumes foreign currency rates at the end of the second quarter remain in effect for the rest of the year. Now turning to guidance for the third quarter of 2020. Assuming FX rates at the end of the second quarter remain constant through the end of the third quarter, we expect revenue to be between $2,725,000,000 and $2,775,000,000. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $564 million and $582 million. And adjusted diluted EPS is expected to be between $1.47 and $1.55. So in summary, we delivered second quarter revenue, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS all above the top end of our guidance ranges. We are seeing encouraging signs of a migration back to normal business conditions by the end of the year. We are utilizing our unique capabilities to help in the fight against COVID-19 globally. We have raised our guidance for the full year, and we are already planning for 2021 in anticipation of a return to our growth trajectory. And finally, as Ari mentioned at the start of the call, this is my last earnings call with IQVIA. I am very grateful for the opportunity to serve as IQVIA's Chief Financial Officer since our merger. It's been a privilege to work with Ari and the executive leadership team. I have learned a lot over the past four years, and I am incredibly proud of what we have accomplished. I firmly believe IQVIA is incredibly well positioned to achieve its Vision 2022 ambitions. I intend to remain a shareholder in the company and will be rooting for its continued success. And with that, let me hand it back to the operator for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of George Hill from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.\nGeorge Hill: You covered a lot. I guess, the first question I would ask is, have you seen any change in the competitive environment as it relates to COVID-19? And I know you haven't any cancellations and the win rate\u2019s been strong. But I guess just talk about how the selection process is going and whether you guys think you're taking share.\nAri Bousbib: Thank you, George. Good morning. Again, when we refer to no material cancellations related to COVID-19, we are speaking about cancellations of trials that were already in the backlog and not for COVID, for other things. And it just points to the resilience of our customers and their long-term view. They haven't changed their priorities, and they are still focused on the diseases that they were focused on before the crisis emerged. With respect to COVID-19 itself, we've won a wide variety of the trials, ranging from small lab work or - all the way to wide vaccine trials. A number of those are - I mean, are well publicized. There are a few large ones. Some of them are nominal fees related to product reviews for small biopharma companies. There are multimillion-dollar vaccine trials. There are currently two vaccine trials that are funded by the U.S. government. So operational work speed, which we have won, one of which we mentioned - I mentioned in my introductory remarks, which is the one with AstraZeneca. So in terms of competitive wins, I think the crisis has shown that our unique capabilities are highly, highly differentiated. All I can say is, we've become a lot closer to the customer base during this crisis, with many of them we had weekly forum. We've got extraordinary feedback from our customers in terms of the criticality of the information we were providing them in realtime for their own decision-making process. And we've continued to win at a very high pace. I believe that we've continued to gain market share. And certainly, we gained a significant amount of the overall COVID-19 work out there. And I want to point out that this COVID-19-related work is - we are contributing as well to the resolution of the crisis. And so in many cases, because these are government-sponsored, we are discounting those. So they are important, and they are going to continue to play a role in the foreseeable future here. And they were a part of our bookings in the quarter. I believe they represent somewhere in the teens of our service bookings in the quarter, sort of mid-teens or so. And so it's not a negligible piece of our dollar bookings but - it wasn't a 'make it or break it' kind of set of activities.\nGeorge Hill: And maybe if I could ask, Mike, a quick follow-up. And Mike, you're going to be missed there at IQVIA. Remote monitoring has played a huge part of the process as we've gone through the COVID crisis. I guess can you talk a little bit about the financial implications of moving to the remote environment versus the on-site environment?\nMichael McDonnell: You're asking about the remote environment versus - yes. I mean, look, we - as I said in my remarks, the remote monitoring, obviously, is where everyone went. And in order - because we could simply not access the site, I think that, as I said in my remarks, on-site visits have replaced - are now overcome the number of remote visits. The peak of those remote visits were sometime in the May, June time frame. And now we have started accelerating in a steep fashion the number of actual visits. We're still not to our normal pace, but it has dramatically increased. As I said, 53% of the sites are now accessible, and we are able to visit those sites. Bear in mind, while remote is helpful and then we are using it mostly to meet obligations to patients and clients and to ensure their safety, et cetera but again, it's important to know that in-person site visits are still required in order to meet the source data verification criteria, the - each trial budget, of course, will have to be revised accordingly. So we see this as more of an opportunity as well as we go back to site. Thank you, George.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\nTycho Peterson: Thanks. I appreciate all the color. I guess, Ari, on the reopening of site, I\u2019m just curious about how much risk you see in the flare-up of cases, now heading into 3Q in the back half of the year and other implications to R&DS and CSMS for your business and other steps you can take in anticipation of some of this to try to mitigate the impact.\nAri Bousbib: CSMS? Did you mention CSMS or - what's the question?\nTycho Peterson: The question was about the flare-up of COVID cases and the risk heading into 3Q in the back half of the year and the steps you can take to mitigate some of that in advance and then just any - where you would see more impact.\nMichael McDonnell: Was that Tycho who's asked? Was that George still?\nTycho Peterson: No. It's Tycho.\nMichael McDonnell: Tycho, sorry. We're having trouble hearing on our end.\nTycho Peterson: The question is about the flare-up in COVID cases and risks for 3Q in the back half of the year and other steps you can take to mitigate some of the impact these cases are going back up in a number of regions.\nAri Bousbib: Yes. I mean, look, there's flare-ups out there, Texas, Florida, California, South Carolina, around the world. I mean Europe and certainly Asia is pretty much back up to not quite 100%, but not that far. The main issue here is, in some parts of the United States - but, again, we don't disclose exactly which sites are where, but you should know that it's not going to be that material, these flare-ups in the U.S. to our - we have over 100,000 sites globally. And we've become very adept at transitioning to remote monitoring. So, I think - yes, I mean, we now have been able during the second quarter, to adapt, and we have a number of workarounds using our remote capabilities. And so, we feel that these assumptions that we made for the third quarter, I think, are, in a way, better educated than the ones that we made three months ago, when we were just learning to adapt to the crisis. I should point out that these assumptions that we made in April 2020, many folks out there thought that we were getting ahead of ourselves and we\u2019re maybe too optimistic about those assumptions. And the fact is, the progression of site accessibility as a metric was exactly as we predicted. And we base that on the course of the disease in China and other geographies that were more - that had been ahead of the rest of the world in terms of the disease. And we base that also on our own internal data and modeling that we are using to project our business. So, once again, while people thought we were overly optimistic, it turned out we were exactly on target with respect to site accessibility and, in fact, not so optimistic. So, I think, I'm not suggesting that, because we were right three months ago, we are right now for the next three months. But, I think, we - if anything, I believe, we are a little bit more educated now, and our models are even more precise than they were three months ago.\nTycho Peterson: And then Ari, one follow-up. You talked about a return to normal growth next year. 15% growth off 630 would be 725 and essentially where consensus is. Is that the right way to be thinking about it for next year?\nAri Bousbib: I said that we are going to give guidance for 2021, much earlier than before than usual. That is not at the beginning of the year more this year for next year, and that is because, as you correctly point out, we have visibility. We have more visibility than usual because we know of the work that should have been done this year that's still in our books that we need to progress plus the work that we want this year, so we have more visibility. I'm not going to give you any numbers. I'll let you speculate, but hopefully in a not too distant future I mean, I don't know if we'll be able to do this in the third quarter, but maybe we should have that as a goal, okay? We're getting there in terms of our 2021 plans. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Robert Jones from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nRobert Jones: Thanks for the question. And yes Mike, definitely enjoyed working with you. Good luck in the next endeavor, and now look forward to engaging. I guess maybe Ari, just on that last line of questions, but maybe to put some numbers around it. The second half revenue guidance looks like it implies about 2% year-over-year growth in total revenue over the back half of 2019? But you updated the NTM revenue, expect it to convert at a backlog is, I think up 10% versus the last update with 2Q. Is that - does that dynamic get at what you just commented on that you have just better visibility into the backlog and what could come out of the backlog in the first half of 2021?\nAri Bousbib: Yes, I mean - Andrew, do you want to take?\nAndrew Markwick: Yes sure. Yes, I mean yes, the next 12 months revenue from backlog increased considerably quarter-over-quarter. It was $4.9 billion at the end of Q1 and now sits at $5.4 billion, a large sequential move. And I think that's the ultimate forward-looking indicator for future revenue growth in the trajectory of the business. So we're very pleased with that. I think obviously, we still want to dig into our plans when we started with that process, as Ari said earlier. And we're looking forward to providing 2021 guidance, but I think...\nAri Bousbib: Yes but Bob, I think you're thinking about it the right way. Part of this is the fact that this - as you know, we won I believe, a disproportionate piece of the market over the past year or so. And those market share gains have translated into a big proportion of our backlog that's new wins that are - haven't started. And so a big piece, which is why you saw the revenue conversion being slower than usual even without the COVID-19 crisis. That's because site start-up activity is typically a little slower. Patient enrollment is a little slower. The vast majority of our book of business is not in the sweet spot, so to speak, where the trial is ongoing. And so the COVID-19 crisis has added to this issue because when you think about the impact of the crisis on trials for patients that were already enrolled. And for trials that are in that phase, where you are really - in the sweet spot and executing the trial and patients with insights. Then we worked around that with - you can work around with remote monitoring. And now we're returning patients to sites, et cetera. But sites that had not started yet, site start-up activity is - was much more difficult, simply because people were just not at work, and we weren't able to get the site up and running. So that has been delayed, and it's kind of slowed down a bit. Similarly, patient enrollment was more difficult and is more difficult. We are now enrolling, as I said in my introductory remarks, patients back into trial. But we still are only at 25% of normal baseline number of patients recruited per week. So it's going up, and we're catching up. And I think that's part of why you see more revenue pushed back into the next 12 months. That's kind of the pent-up, if you will, revenue that should have been executed - that's now going to be executed. And that's in addition, of course, to the change orders for the work that needs to be done. I mentioned before, we need to do on-site data verification. So despite the remote visits, a piece of the work - still needs to be done on site. So that's additional. And then finally, we continue to book at a very high pace, as shown by our high book-to-bill ratios. As all of that adds up to what we believe is the expected next 12 months revenue from backlog.\nRobert Jones: No, that all makes a ton of sense. And I guess maybe just a quick follow-up Ari, on TAS. Maybe just - I know you touched on some of the elements there in the prepared remarks, but clearly better performance than many expected. What are clients specifically utilizing within the segment I know there's a lot of components there. Is it the analytics for virtual meetings? Is it more safety studies? Just trying to get a better sense of what was driving the performance in TAS?\nAri Bousbib: Yes, I mean look, the usual thing, data technology, Real-World as well. I mean, why don't I turn to Ron, you want to add here?\nRon Bruehlman: Yes look, the strongest part of the TAS segment has been and remains Real-World. We've also seen continued implementations in the tech sector that's gone well. Analytics solutions actually has been strong, although there have been some delayed client decisions as a result of COVID. So I would say, across the board, but there is particular strength that we see is in Real-World.\nAri Bousbib: And again, the weakness in TAS, as we said before, is the part of the business where we help clients organize face-to-face meetings with physicians, healthcare professionals around the world, the conference business that requires in-person, and that has essentially dried out. It's beginning interestingly, to show signs of revival. People are scheduling conferences in the next few quarters. So that's going to come back. But, certainly, it's been largely brought to a hold and that has created a hole in our revenue, which is why TAS hasn't performed as greatly as, but everything else I think, has done very good.\nRon Bruehlman: Yes everything, yes [TAS] and data remains very solid.\nAri Bousbib: Very stable, yes.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Donnelly from Citi. Your line is now open.\nPatrick Donnelly: Maybe just a follow-up on the TAS question there certainly, appreciate Real-World doing well. Can you just give us a bit more color on OCE? I know you kind of noted 35 new clients so far in 2020. Can you just discuss how that's trending relative to your expectations? And then again, maybe some of the feedback you're getting from customers that are either converting over to you or kind of competitive wins, what you're hearing about the offering there?\nAri Bousbib: So again, the team has really performed very well. We've crossed the 100-customer mark, and now we're at 115 wins. We continue to see a lot of success. Generally, with a handful of exceptions, we're not seeing any slowdowns in implementation actually in many cases accelerations of implementations. We went live for several deployments, including by the way, in the midst of the crisis. I remember seeing - I think I saw an e-mail somewhat from one of our large, large, large clients, congratulating the team for an amazing job they did on deploying in Spain in the middle of the - peak - the COVID crisis over there. So, things have tended to go very well on our deployment. Generally, the demand for remote detailing continues to rise. We've got a module within OCE - called OCE Remote Detailing, which is the most secure compliance platform in the space. We also launched last quarter our compliance solution in the commercial space, HCP engagement management, which already has four wins. And a strong pipeline has been building. So I think it's all going very well according to expectations. And frankly for OCE, we haven't seen any - a few - again a handful of slowdowns in terms of some areas where we couldn't redeploy. But on the other hand, we've seen acceleration. So it's essentially going as well as we could have expected.\nPatrick Donnelly: And then maybe just one on the margin side, you guys did a pretty good job insulating the bottom line from some of the revenue headwinds, are pretty quick to do some cost controls. I know you talked about planning for 2021 already. I guess how should we think about some of the costs that have come out? Are those going to come back in terms of your planning? Are you feeling good enough, to your point there, Ari, I think you talked a few times about the visibility? Now that you're more comfortable there, are you kind of easing on some of the cost controls? Maybe just help us think about kind of the margin cadence and the go-forward, the cost control measures that you have in place? Thank you.\nAri Bousbib: Okay, yes. I mean do you want to - Ron, you want to...\nRon Bruehlman: Yes sure. Look obviously there is some margin pressure in the first half due to the drop in revenue and how quickly we could get costs out more so and early on and later on. We should see margin expansion in the second half of the year as the business comes back. We've taken a lot of cost out. I don't think all of it's going to come back. Certainly, we're going to continue to try to keep pressure on keeping T&E costs down. And I think naturally, they will in this COVID crisis. And we're always looking to take out - to improve efficiency wherever we can. One of the things that we've looked at very carefully other than T&E, which obviously has fallen off, is renegotiating vendor contracts, reducing third-party spend. And we're reassessing our office space needs, which I think a lot of companies are doing right now. So I think that the cost trends will be positive going forward as will margin progression.\nAri Bousbib: Yes, I mean again, you can see we have a large cost base. And so as for me, the situation becomes worse, there are many levers that we can use to mitigate impact to profit. And again, I want to emphasize, we have not taken any virtually, no action with respect to employment. There are very, very small pockets, really affecting a few hundred employees, where there were furloughs or there were a few restructurings, but nothing out of the ordinary course. Nothing dramatic and we do not plan to do so. And the reason for that is, again, we are a people-based business. We're a services company, and we want to protect our employees. We know they're going through difficult times. And then secondly, we do expect a V-shaped recovery and a very strong - well here I go I'm talking about 2021. I didn't want to, but we expect a strong 2021, and we are going to need our very talented employees. So we didn't take any base compensation or restructuring actions as a result of the crisis.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Eric Coldwell from Baird. Your line is now open.\nEric Coldwell: Thanks, good morning Mike, good luck with your future endeavors. A couple of quick questions here, but first off, I heard in the Q&A, a mention of particular strength in Real-World evidence. Last quarter, I believe you highlighted that RWE could be a tale of two cities, prospective and retrospective work, with the prospective work looking more like trials? There could be some headwind. What changed there, if anything or what were the dynamics between the old IMS RWE and the old Quintiles' RWE business mix?\nAri Bousbib: Well that's a very, it\u2019s very - okay I don't want to flatter you too much. It's a very thoughtful question. And you're right, to - your understanding why yes, we are doing well in Real-World. And that is that the ability to use patient-level data, which I'll remind you, is really an unparalleled asset at our company. We have now - we did over 800 million patient lives - unique patient lives, which have been extremely useful. The unique E360 technology capabilities enable us to conduct a lot of retrospective studies. And that part of the business has been extremely strong. The second factor is that, while access to sites has also been restricted, but it is less restricted than a clinical trial site. To a degree, there are many Real-World studies where the sites are actually doctor offices, as opposed to hospitals and those have tended to have - while restricted still and many of them were shut down, as you know, but access - physical access was better than we would have thought. And the experience has proven that the site accessibility for Real-World is somewhat better than for clinical trial sites. So as a result Real-World has done, again, better than we would have expected. Bear in mind also, when we report site accessibility metrics, we only report for clinical trials. And as you know, our competitors, our CRO peers report those numbers in aggregate.\nEric Coldwell: Yes, helpful thank you. IQV is one of two companies in the space that reports authorizations on a contracted basis. I think there was some speculation that you could have strong awards, but maybe contracts would be pushed out given the global uncertainty and clients putting out fires. Clearly, that was not a big headwind, but I am curious, what is the normal lag from award to contract at IQV? My hunch would be maybe a couple of months, but I'd love to hear your thoughts. And then how has that changed in - this COVID environment? We know the COVID specific trials are being contracted extremely quickly, but have you seen other changes in the duration between award and contract time?\nAri Bousbib: Well, your general assumption is correct okay. You're kind of two months' lag time. We're trying to reduce that. But that kind of 60-day period is a good assumption. The lag between booking and revenue could be up to 12 months, okay. So the lag between award and contracting could be up to 60 days, 30 to 60 days, let's say. And the lag between booking and revenue could be up to 12 months, six months to 12 months, depending on the client, the study dynamics. And of course, the COVID situation has pushed that lag between booking and revenue further simply because we were unable to get sites started. But we are going - we are getting back into it as we speak. And certainly in Asia, we are already back up to normal, and we expect that to happen with a three to six-month lag in the rest of the world, Europe and then U.S. So yes, I mean, it has created some delays in execution. On the other hand, as you suggested COVID-19 trials are much faster burn, but it has partially begun to offset that.\nRon Bruehlman: Eric, one thing.\nEric Coldwell: Yes.\nRon Bruehlman: Both awards and contracted bookings were very strong in the quarter. So either way you look at it\u2026\nAri Bousbib: Yes, Ron makes a good point. I mean I don't want to - you remember the old way of reporting book-to-bills, which was basically on awards. And if we had done that this quarter, did I say - it would be having - materially higher than the 1.64, materially higher on awards - I mean awards basis.\nEric Coldwell: Very helpful, last one, just a clarification. There were some phone issues in one of your earlier responses. Did I hear you say that COVID work in total across therapies and vaccines accounted for mid-teens of your contracted awards?\nAri Bousbib: Yes, in services yes, yes.\nEric Coldwell: Yes, okay. Great, thanks guys.\nAndrew Markwick: Okay. Operator, I think we're up to the top of the hour now. So I think we've run out of time for the call. Thank you, everyone, for taking the time to join us today, and we look forward to speaking with you again on our third quarter 2020 earnings call. Jen and I we are available to take any questions that you may have for the rest of the day.\nAri Bousbib: And Mike and Ron.\nAndrew Markwick: Yes. Mike and Ron will join us as well.\nAri Bousbib: Okay, thank you, everyone.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Michael McDonnell",
            "content": "Thank you, Ari, and good morning everyone. Turning first to revenue; second quarter revenue was $2.521 billion compared to $2.740 billion in the second quarter of 2019. First half revenue was $5.275 billion compared to $5.424 billion in the first half of 2019. Second quarter revenue in Technology & Analytics Solutions was $1.109 billion compared to $1.102 billion in the second quarter of 2019. First half Tech & Analytics Solutions revenue was $2.226 billion compared with $2.177 billion for the first half of 2019. R&D Solutions second quarter revenue was $1.235 compared with $1.435 billion in the second quarter of 2019. First half revenue in R&D Solutions was $2.676 billion compared with $2.851 billion in the first half of 2019. Second quarter contract Sales & Medical Solutions revenue was $177 million compared with $203 million in the second quarter of 2019. First half contract Sales & Medical Solutions revenue was $373 million compared to $396 million in the first half of 2019. Turning now to profit, adjusted EBITDA was $483 million for the second quarter, and $1.045 billion for the first half. Second quarter GAAP net loss was $23 million, resulting in a $0.12 loss per diluted share. For the first half, we had GAAP net income of $59 million or $0.30 of earnings per diluted share. Adjusted net income was $229 million for the second quarter or $1.18 per share. Adjusted net income for the first half was $523 million or $2.68 per share. Let's now turn to R&D Solutions backlog; closing backlog grew 13.5% to $20.5 billion at June 30, 2020. New business wins remain strong and to-date we have experienced no material COVID-19 related cancellations. Let's now review the balance sheet; at June 30, cash and cash equivalents totaled $1.1 billion and debt was $12.1 billion, resulting in net debt of approximately $11 billion. As of June 30, 2020, our net leverage ratio ticked up slightly to 4.8 times our trailing 12 month adjusted EBITDA, as a result of the COVID-19 related impacts on our first half adjusted EBITDA. As a reminder, we continue to be committed to bringing our leverage ratio to a range of 3.5 to 4 times, as we exit 2022. Cash flow from operating activities was $472 million in the second quarter and $635 million year-to-date. CapEx for the quarter was $142 million, $283 million year-to-date, and free cash flow for the quarter was $330 million or $352 million year-to-date. As you know, when the COVID-19 outbreak became a pandemic in March, we temporarily suspended share repurchase activity. Accordingly, we did not repurchase any shares in the second quarter, and as of June 30 of 2020, we had approximately $1 billion of share repurchase authorization remaining. We will continue to evaluate the right time to reinitiate our share repurchase program. We continue to have strong liquidity. At June 30, we had $1.1 billion of cash on the balance sheet and our $1.5 billion revolving credit facility was undrawn. We also have over $1 billion of EBITDA cushion, relative to our leverage and interest coverage maintenance covenants, even as our first half adjusted EBITDA has suffered a significant and unusual impact from COVID-19. And finally, I would point out that we have a lot of flexibility with capital allocation, which includes CapEx, M&A and share repurchases. And now, let's move to guidance; on our first quarter earnings call, we outlined our assumptions regarding the global progression of the virus, the percentage of clinical research sites accessible to us throughout 2020, and our ability to interact with clients to support business development activities. These assumptions supported our 2020 guidance provided at that time. During the second quarter, it became apparent that the global spread of the virus would become wider and more prolonged than we had assumed. However, the percentage of sites accessible to us, tracked in line with our expectations, and business development activities have progressed better than our original assumptions. We also had made the assumption at the time that 100% of clinical research sites would be accessible by the beginning of the fourth quarter. However, given localized flare-ups around the world, we now see this happening more at the beginning of 2021. But, in spite of this, we have been able to overcome restricted site access better than we initially thought, through work around, including the use of our remote capabilities. Based on our better than expected performance in the second quarter, the company's ability to execute in this environment, incremental COVID-19 trial work and evaluation of current business conditions and outlook for the balance of the year, we are now forecasting better performance in our TAS segment and better execution against our R&DS backlog than previously anticipated. Together, these factors are expected to contribute to improved financial performance in 2020 versus the company's expectations on April 28, 2020. As a result, we are raising our full year guidance ranges for the full year. We now expect full year revenue to be between $11 billion and $11,100,000,000, which represents an increase of approximately $290 million at the midpoint, of which approximately 20% represents a favorable FX impact based on exchange rates as of the end of the second quarter. Please note that FX still represents a year-over-year headwind of 60 basis points on our average revenue guidance. At the midpoint of the new guidance range, the constant currency growth represents slight growth year-over-year. For full year profit, we expect adjusted EBITDA to be between $2,295,000,000 and $2,345,000,000 and we expect adjusted diluted EPS to be between $6.10 and $6.30. This guidance assumes foreign currency rates at the end of the second quarter remain in effect for the rest of the year. Now turning to guidance for the third quarter of 2020. Assuming FX rates at the end of the second quarter remain constant through the end of the third quarter, we expect revenue to be between $2,725,000,000 and $2,775,000,000. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $564 million and $582 million. And adjusted diluted EPS is expected to be between $1.47 and $1.55. So in summary, we delivered second quarter revenue, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS all above the top end of our guidance ranges. We are seeing encouraging signs of a migration back to normal business conditions by the end of the year. We are utilizing our unique capabilities to help in the fight against COVID-19 globally. We have raised our guidance for the full year, and we are already planning for 2021 in anticipation of a return to our growth trajectory. And finally, as Ari mentioned at the start of the call, this is my last earnings call with IQVIA. I am very grateful for the opportunity to serve as IQVIA's Chief Financial Officer since our merger. It's been a privilege to work with Ari and the executive leadership team. I have learned a lot over the past four years, and I am incredibly proud of what we have accomplished. I firmly believe IQVIA is incredibly well positioned to achieve its Vision 2022 ambitions. I intend to remain a shareholder in the company and will be rooting for its continued success. And with that, let me hand it back to the operator for Q&A. You're asking about the remote environment versus - yes. I mean, look, we - as I said in my remarks, the remote monitoring, obviously, is where everyone went. And in order - because we could simply not access the site, I think that, as I said in my remarks, on-site visits have replaced - are now overcome the number of remote visits. The peak of those remote visits were sometime in the May, June time frame. And now we have started accelerating in a steep fashion the number of actual visits. We're still not to our normal pace, but it has dramatically increased. As I said, 53% of the sites are now accessible, and we are able to visit those sites. Bear in mind, while remote is helpful and then we are using it mostly to meet obligations to patients and clients and to ensure their safety, et cetera but again, it's important to know that in-person site visits are still required in order to meet the source data verification criteria, the - each trial budget, of course, will have to be revised accordingly. So we see this as more of an opportunity as well as we go back to site. Thank you, George. Was that Tycho who's asked? Was that George still? Tycho, sorry. We're having trouble hearing on our end."

            "name": "Ron Bruehlman",
            "content": "Yes look, the strongest part of the TAS segment has been and remains Real-World. We've also seen continued implementations in the tech sector that's gone well. Analytics solutions actually has been strong, although there have been some delayed client decisions as a result of COVID. So I would say, across the board, but there is particular strength that we see is in Real-World. Yes everything, yes [TAS] and data remains very solid. Yes sure. Look obviously there is some margin pressure in the first half due to the drop in revenue and how quickly we could get costs out more so and early on and later on. We should see margin expansion in the second half of the year as the business comes back. We've taken a lot of cost out. I don't think all of it's going to come back. Certainly, we're going to continue to try to keep pressure on keeping T&E costs down. And I think naturally, they will in this COVID crisis. And we're always looking to take out - to improve efficiency wherever we can. One of the things that we've looked at very carefully other than T&E, which obviously has fallen off, is renegotiating vendor contracts, reducing third-party spend. And we're reassessing our office space needs, which I think a lot of companies are doing right now. So I think that the cost trends will be positive going forward as will margin progression. Eric, one thing. Both awards and contracted bookings were very strong in the quarter. So either way you look at it..."

        "speaker3": {
            "name": "Ari Bousbib",
            "content": "Thank you, Andrew, and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining our second quarter 2020 earnings call. Before we get to the results, I'm sure you all saw the announcement last night, and so this will be Mike's last IQVIA earnings call, and so I wanted to take the opportunity to thank him for his service and wish him well in his new role at Biogen. I also want to thank Ron and welcome him back, he really never left, but I want to thank him for agreeing to serve as our Interim Chief Financial Officer until we decide on a permanent successor. Many of you already know Ron, and I'm sure you are delighted to welcome him back to the CFO chair. Now to our results; revenue, adjusted EBITDA and earnings all came in above our guidance ranges. Today, we are also updating our guidance for the year and raising our full year revenue, adjusted EBITDA and earnings ranges. Before we review the numbers, I'd like to give you a quick operational update. During the second quarter, we saw gradual improvement in the accessibility of clinical research sites in the R&D solutions business, pretty much in line with what we told you three months ago. Global site access improved to approximately 20% in April, to 40% at the end of June. Average site accessibility for the second quarter was about 30%, again in line with the assumption that we made, when we set our second quarter guidance. The progress of global site reopenings is continuing into the third quarter, and today, it's at 53%. I should point out that the progress has been slowing somewhat in the past couple of weeks, as a result of several localized COVID-19 flare-ups in geographies around the world, and especially, in parts of the United States. As sites have become accessible, we've seen an improvement in the number of onsite monitoring visits. In fact, on-site visits are now exceeding the number of remote visit, and as a result, remote visits have reduced from the peak in the second quarter. Of course, wherever sites are still inaccessible, our ability to deliver solutions like remote monitoring and virtual trials remains critical to ensuring trial continuity. Now, patients who are already enrolled in trials have slowly begun returning for in-person treatment. As you would expect, this varies by therapeutic area. For example, oncology patients are returning at a faster rate than dermatology patients. Also, the recent outbreaks in parts of the U.S. have hampered the pace of recovery in the number of patients enrolled in trials, who are willing to come in for in-person treatment. For trials that have not yet started, the pace of site startup and patients recruitment has obviously been slow. It's improving, but still slow. For example, patient recruitment for new trials, which had been virtually halted during the second quarter, has resumed over the past few weeks, and is now at about 25% of normal baseline enrollment levels. We expect this to continue to improve over time. R&DS business development activity has remained very strong. We still have not had any material cancellations of trials in our backlog, due to COVID-19. Interactions with clients, such as Big Defenses continue, as clients adjust to working virtually. RFP volume and value continue to hold at basically similar levels to 2019. And of course, the R&DS team has been awarded a wide range of COVID-19 vaccine therapeutics and related lab work. Of course, you will have seen, we announced a collaboration with AstraZeneca last week, to accelerate development of a potential COVID vaccine. COVID-19, more broadly has accelerated interest in our virtual trials solution, including Study Hub. Awards for our virtual trial solutions have actually doubled, albeit of a relatively small base. We are leveraging our virtual trial technology platform, Study Hub, to deliver a seamless patient experience. As you know, the platform combined eConsent, telemedicine, eCOA and digital communication. Moving to Technology & Analytics. We continue to have very little interruption in data, supply or demand. Our data production centers around the world remain fully operational, and our Technology & Analytics deliveries continue in the ordinary course. Selling activities have started to resume, as clients have adjusted to working virtually as well. There is still some delayed decision making for ad hoc services work, but we've had real good momentum in our fastest growing businesses, such as Real World and Tech. Our Real World business continues to expand even in this environment, with strong growth in the quarter. As a reminder, the results of our Real World business are reported in our TAS segment. So unlike our CRO peers, this growth is not included in R&DS results. In the Technology space, OCE has added 35 new clients so far in 2020. OCE deployments continue to progress as scheduled, as clients look to accelerate their usage and get up and running on the platform even faster. We now have 115 customers that have chosen OCE, and they represent over 60,000 potential users of the platform. Most of these customers are still in the early stage of deployment. So far, our win rate in this segment when going head-to-head against the incumbent is approximately 70%. Finally, in our CSMS business, we've not experienced any material cancellations. Although, as expected, we've experienced softer demand for field reps, which of course impacts revenue. Additionally, business development has slowed considerably in this segment. Let's now review the second quarter results. Revenue for the second quarter came in at $2,521,000,000, which is a $118 million above the midpoint of our guidance range. Now $41 million of this $118 million beat came from FX and pass-throughs. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA was $483 million, with a $25 million beat versus the midpoint of our guidance, and this came entirely from better operational performance. Second quarter adjusted diluted EPS was $1.18. Second quarter R&DS contracted backlog, including pass-throughs grew 13.5% year-over-year to $20.5 billion at June 30, 2020. We saw good growth in awards for our large pharma clients, as well as our EBP clients in the quarter. We had broad-based booking strength by offering, with particular strength in full service clinical and in lab. The contracted net book-to-bill ratio including pass-throughs was 1.64 for the second quarter of 2020, and excluding pass-throughs, the second quarter contracted book-to-bill ratio was 1.60. The LTM contracted book-to-bill ratio at June 30 was 1.43, including pass-throughs and 1.42 excluding pass-throughs. As we said previously, we've continued to make every effort to preserve employment during this crisis and to the extent possible we have not affected based compensation for our employees. Of course, we've worked to reduce other costs and discretionary spend and as a result of these actions, our adjusted EBITDA came in well above our expectations. You can see, when you adjust for pass-throughs and FX, that the drop through incremental margin on the revenue beat was over 30%. So far, even considering several flare-ups around the world, things seem to be moving in the right direction. Sites are reopening globally, allowing us to resume our critical work in R&DS. We continue to be cautiously optimistic, and we anticipate a sharp recovery in the back end of the year. Mike will review in more detail how we see the second half playing out. Finally, a quick update on our 2021 planning process. As I've already shared with you, we started this process earlier than usual and our plan is to provide 2021 guidance before the end of this year. Given the positive trends we've seen in operational execution and client demand, together with catch-up work and the associated change orders that we currently anticipate, as well as the COVID awards, we remain optimistic that in 2021, we will see a return to our previous growth trajectory. Now, I'll turn it over to Mike for some more detail on the quarter, how we see the second half of the year play out, and the upward revisions to our guidance. Thank you, George. Good morning. Again, when we refer to no material cancellations related to COVID-19, we are speaking about cancellations of trials that were already in the backlog and not for COVID, for other things. And it just points to the resilience of our customers and their long-term view. They haven't changed their priorities, and they are still focused on the diseases that they were focused on before the crisis emerged. With respect to COVID-19 itself, we've won a wide variety of the trials, ranging from small lab work or - all the way to wide vaccine trials. A number of those are - I mean, are well publicized. There are a few large ones. Some of them are nominal fees related to product reviews for small biopharma companies. There are multimillion-dollar vaccine trials. There are currently two vaccine trials that are funded by the U.S. government. So operational work speed, which we have won, one of which we mentioned - I mentioned in my introductory remarks, which is the one with AstraZeneca. So in terms of competitive wins, I think the crisis has shown that our unique capabilities are highly, highly differentiated. All I can say is, we've become a lot closer to the customer base during this crisis, with many of them we had weekly forum. We've got extraordinary feedback from our customers in terms of the criticality of the information we were providing them in realtime for their own decision-making process. And we've continued to win at a very high pace. I believe that we've continued to gain market share. And certainly, we gained a significant amount of the overall COVID-19 work out there. And I want to point out that this COVID-19-related work is - we are contributing as well to the resolution of the crisis. And so in many cases, because these are government-sponsored, we are discounting those. So they are important, and they are going to continue to play a role in the foreseeable future here. And they were a part of our bookings in the quarter. I believe they represent somewhere in the teens of our service bookings in the quarter, sort of mid-teens or so. And so it's not a negligible piece of our dollar bookings but - it wasn't a 'make it or break it' kind of set of activities. CSMS? Did you mention CSMS or - what's the question? Yes. I mean, look, there's flare-ups out there, Texas, Florida, California, South Carolina, around the world. I mean Europe and certainly Asia is pretty much back up to not quite 100%, but not that far. The main issue here is, in some parts of the United States - but, again, we don't disclose exactly which sites are where, but you should know that it's not going to be that material, these flare-ups in the U.S. to our - we have over 100,000 sites globally. And we've become very adept at transitioning to remote monitoring. So, I think - yes, I mean, we now have been able during the second quarter, to adapt, and we have a number of workarounds using our remote capabilities. And so, we feel that these assumptions that we made for the third quarter, I think, are, in a way, better educated than the ones that we made three months ago, when we were just learning to adapt to the crisis. I should point out that these assumptions that we made in April 2020, many folks out there thought that we were getting ahead of ourselves and we're maybe too optimistic about those assumptions. And the fact is, the progression of site accessibility as a metric was exactly as we predicted. And we base that on the course of the disease in China and other geographies that were more - that had been ahead of the rest of the world in terms of the disease. And we base that also on our own internal data and modeling that we are using to project our business. So, once again, while people thought we were overly optimistic, it turned out we were exactly on target with respect to site accessibility and, in fact, not so optimistic. So, I think, I'm not suggesting that, because we were right three months ago, we are right now for the next three months. But, I think, we - if anything, I believe, we are a little bit more educated now, and our models are even more precise than they were three months ago. I said that we are going to give guidance for 2021, much earlier than before than usual. That is not at the beginning of the year more this year for next year, and that is because, as you correctly point out, we have visibility. We have more visibility than usual because we know of the work that should have been done this year that's still in our books that we need to progress plus the work that we want this year, so we have more visibility. I'm not going to give you any numbers. I'll let you speculate, but hopefully in a not too distant future I mean, I don't know if we'll be able to do this in the third quarter, but maybe we should have that as a goal, okay? We're getting there in terms of our 2021 plans. Thank you. Yes, I mean - Andrew, do you want to take? Yes but Bob, I think you're thinking about it the right way. Part of this is the fact that this - as you know, we won I believe, a disproportionate piece of the market over the past year or so. And those market share gains have translated into a big proportion of our backlog that's new wins that are - haven't started. And so a big piece, which is why you saw the revenue conversion being slower than usual even without the COVID-19 crisis. That's because site start-up activity is typically a little slower. Patient enrollment is a little slower. The vast majority of our book of business is not in the sweet spot, so to speak, where the trial is ongoing. And so the COVID-19 crisis has added to this issue because when you think about the impact of the crisis on trials for patients that were already enrolled. And for trials that are in that phase, where you are really - in the sweet spot and executing the trial and patients with insights. Then we worked around that with - you can work around with remote monitoring. And now we're returning patients to sites, et cetera. But sites that had not started yet, site start-up activity is - was much more difficult, simply because people were just not at work, and we weren't able to get the site up and running. So that has been delayed, and it's kind of slowed down a bit. Similarly, patient enrollment was more difficult and is more difficult. We are now enrolling, as I said in my introductory remarks, patients back into trial. But we still are only at 25% of normal baseline number of patients recruited per week. So it's going up, and we're catching up. And I think that's part of why you see more revenue pushed back into the next 12 months. That's kind of the pent-up, if you will, revenue that should have been executed - that's now going to be executed. And that's in addition, of course, to the change orders for the work that needs to be done. I mentioned before, we need to do on-site data verification. So despite the remote visits, a piece of the work - still needs to be done on site. So that's additional. And then finally, we continue to book at a very high pace, as shown by our high book-to-bill ratios. As all of that adds up to what we believe is the expected next 12 months revenue from backlog. Yes, I mean look, the usual thing, data technology, Real-World as well. I mean, why don't I turn to Ron, you want to add here? And again, the weakness in TAS, as we said before, is the part of the business where we help clients organize face-to-face meetings with physicians, healthcare professionals around the world, the conference business that requires in-person, and that has essentially dried out. It's beginning interestingly, to show signs of revival. People are scheduling conferences in the next few quarters. So that's going to come back. But, certainly, it's been largely brought to a hold and that has created a hole in our revenue, which is why TAS hasn't performed as greatly as, but everything else I think, has done very good. Very stable, yes. So again, the team has really performed very well. We've crossed the 100-customer mark, and now we're at 115 wins. We continue to see a lot of success. Generally, with a handful of exceptions, we're not seeing any slowdowns in implementation actually in many cases accelerations of implementations. We went live for several deployments, including by the way, in the midst of the crisis. I remember seeing - I think I saw an e-mail somewhat from one of our large, large, large clients, congratulating the team for an amazing job they did on deploying in Spain in the middle of the - peak - the COVID crisis over there. So, things have tended to go very well on our deployment. Generally, the demand for remote detailing continues to rise. We've got a module within OCE - called OCE Remote Detailing, which is the most secure compliance platform in the space. We also launched last quarter our compliance solution in the commercial space, HCP engagement management, which already has four wins. And a strong pipeline has been building. So I think it's all going very well according to expectations. And frankly for OCE, we haven't seen any - a few - again a handful of slowdowns in terms of some areas where we couldn't redeploy. But on the other hand, we've seen acceleration. So it's essentially going as well as we could have expected. Okay, yes. I mean do you want to - Ron, you want to... Yes, I mean again, you can see we have a large cost base. And so as for me, the situation becomes worse, there are many levers that we can use to mitigate impact to profit. And again, I want to emphasize, we have not taken any virtually, no action with respect to employment. There are very, very small pockets, really affecting a few hundred employees, where there were furloughs or there were a few restructurings, but nothing out of the ordinary course. Nothing dramatic and we do not plan to do so. And the reason for that is, again, we are a people-based business. We're a services company, and we want to protect our employees. We know they're going through difficult times. And then secondly, we do expect a V-shaped recovery and a very strong - well here I go I'm talking about 2021. I didn't want to, but we expect a strong 2021, and we are going to need our very talented employees. So we didn't take any base compensation or restructuring actions as a result of the crisis. Well that's a very, it's very - okay I don't want to flatter you too much. It's a very thoughtful question. And you're right, to - your understanding why yes, we are doing well in Real-World. And that is that the ability to use patient-level data, which I'll remind you, is really an unparalleled asset at our company. We have now - we did over 800 million patient lives - unique patient lives, which have been extremely useful. The unique E360 technology capabilities enable us to conduct a lot of retrospective studies. And that part of the business has been extremely strong. The second factor is that, while access to sites has also been restricted, but it is less restricted than a clinical trial site. To a degree, there are many Real-World studies where the sites are actually doctor offices, as opposed to hospitals and those have tended to have - while restricted still and many of them were shut down, as you know, but access - physical access was better than we would have thought. And the experience has proven that the site accessibility for Real-World is somewhat better than for clinical trial sites. So as a result Real-World has done, again, better than we would have expected. Bear in mind also, when we report site accessibility metrics, we only report for clinical trials. And as you know, our competitors, our CRO peers report those numbers in aggregate. Well, your general assumption is correct okay. You're kind of two months' lag time. We're trying to reduce that. But that kind of 60-day period is a good assumption. The lag between booking and revenue could be up to 12 months, okay. So the lag between award and contracting could be up to 60 days, 30 to 60 days, let's say. And the lag between booking and revenue could be up to 12 months, six months to 12 months, depending on the client, the study dynamics. And of course, the COVID situation has pushed that lag between booking and revenue further simply because we were unable to get sites started. But we are going - we are getting back into it as we speak. And certainly in Asia, we are already back up to normal, and we expect that to happen with a three to six-month lag in the rest of the world, Europe and then U.S. So yes, I mean, it has created some delays in execution. On the other hand, as you suggested COVID-19 trials are much faster burn, but it has partially begun to offset that. Yes, Ron makes a good point. I mean I don't want to - you remember the old way of reporting book-to-bills, which was basically on awards. And if we had done that this quarter, did I say - it would be having - materially higher than the 1.64, materially higher on awards - I mean awards basis. Yes, in services yes, yes. And Mike and Ron.

[Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. Thank you.  I would now like to turn the call over to Andrew Markwick, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasury. Mr. Markwick, please begin your conference.\nAndrew Markwick: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our first quarter earnings call. With me on the call today are Ari Bousbib, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Michael McDonnell, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Eric Sherbet, Executive Vice President and General Counsel; Nick Childs, Senior Vice President, Financial Planning and Analysis; and Jen Halchak, Senior Director, Investor Relations. Today, we will be referencing a presentation that will be visible during this call for those of you on our webcast. This presentation will also be available following this call on the Events and Presentation section of IQVIA's Investor Relations website at ir.iqvia.com. Before we begin, I would like to caution listeners that certain information discussed by management during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those stated or implied by forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties associated with the company's business, including impacts from COVID-19, which is discussed in the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings.  In addition, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures on this call, which should be considered as supplement to and not a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the comparable GAAP measures is included in the press release and conference call presentation. @ And finally, please bear with us as we're conducting this call from various remote locations. We will do our best to make sure the call goes smoothly.  I would now like to turn it over to our Chairman and CEO, Ari Bousbib.\nAri Bousbib: Thank you, Andrew, and good morning, everyone. Hope everyone is safe and well. Thanks for joining us on our first quarter 2020 earnings call. I want to apologize in advance that, given the crisis, I will be a little longer in my narratives today in an effort to provide you a good amount of color on what we're seeing on the ground. Of course, as always, if we don't have time to get to your questioning, our team is available to answer questions after the call. Today, we will review our first quarter performance. We will also provide guidance for the second quarter and update our full year guidance in light of COVID-19.  First, let's review how we've been navigating the challenges over the last couple of months. We've instituted a precrisis management structure to ensure that we align on priorities across the organization. I've been meeting every day with my senior leadership team. As disclosed, communication has allowed us to be agile and decisive in our response to the crisis, and collectively, we're currently centered around four priorities.  First, the safety of our employees, patients, health care professionals, customers, suppliers with whom we frequently interact. To limit exposure, of course, we prohibited substantially all travel, supplied PPE to field-based employees, closed facilities and have most of our staff to work remotely. We've added bandwidth VPN capacity to our advanced infrastructure to enable remote working and avoid service disruptions.  Second, as clinics and hospitals have become inaccessible and has become unsafe or difficult for patients to travel, we've continued to do everything in our power to mitigate disruptions to clinical trials and ensure patient safety. Wherever possible, we have been transitioning to remote monitoring with the number of remote monitoring visits reaching 5x the level they were prior to the crisis. We have leveraged our existing drug delivery and home health services for activities such as at-home lab draws. Perhaps we could -- but whenever we could, we've been enabling telehealth visits to ensure continuity of contact between investigator, patients and CRAs, and we've been transitioning portions of trials to Study Hub, our virtual trial platform.  Third, to help our clients and other organizations manage and plan for the outbreak, we're deploying our unique capabilities. For example, we are applying our people, data and technology to bring AI and insights to help our clients track the progression of the disease, manage capacity and monitor supply chains. We are actively engaged with clients through regular executive briefings, 3 weekly market tracking reports, white papers, thought leadership pieces and webinars to help them understand the rapidly evolving dynamics of the outbreak and to predict how things will develop.  Finally, we're joining the global response to the crisis and contributing our resources to its resolution. Last week, for example, in the U.K., on behalf of Department of Health, we joined with the Office of National Statistics, Oxford University and the U.K. Biocentre. We immediately commenced a countrywide testing program of U.K. households for COVID-19 infection and immunity. In Asia, we provided an IQVIA team to have developed 2 new treatments for COVID-19 using existing HIV and flu vaccines. In the U.S., we're partnering with the University of Texas to develop new lab tests to identify vaccine candidates quicker than currently available tests. In the U.S. and Europe, we are collaborating with governments and the industry to develop several experimental vaccine candidates using our prime site networks and data assets to accelerate time line. We are, of course, involved in multiple trials for COVID-19 therapeutics and vaccines, which I will talk more about later.  During this critical time, we continue to innovate. Two weeks ago, our R&D team launched the first technology-enabled COVID-19 trial matching solution at c19trials.com. This online platform will connect at-risk individuals and researchers to ongoing COVID-19 clinical research projects within the U.S. In addition, the Real-World team launched the IQVIA CARE Project registry. The platform will apply our vast experience with registries and analytics to help connect stakeholders and advance information sharing to better understand how to treat and prevent the disease. If successful, all of these will bring much in the certain treatments to patients.  Now before I'll review the results of the quarter, let's take a look at some of the operational impacts to our business caused by the virus. It is important to note, across all of our segments, we view the impacts from the virus as temporary. Client demand and interest in our differentiated offerings remain strong even if their own ability to move forward on projects is hampered or delayed.  In R&DS, site start-up patient recruitment are the most impacted part of the clinical trial life cycle. Site monitoring visits have also been impacted. As of today, only 20% of our global sites are currently accessible to our CRAs for on-site monitoring visits. On the other hand, data collection and regulatory reporting activities are more or less continuing with little interruption.  For in-site trials, we are coordinating closely with local health authorities and customers to deploy, when appropriate and feasible, our services and technologies to further increase remote-based CRA and centralized monitoring for trials and remote patient visits. As site access remains constrained, we are seeing an uptick in demand for e-consent, virtual trials, eCOA and connected devices. When the crisis subsides, we anticipate that some trials will require minimal additional work to satisfy requirements over and above the remote visits. But the vast majority, substantially, most of the other trials, will require CRAs to go on-site and perform the task of checking documentation, et cetera, that we would not have performed safely during the crisis.  R&D business development activity has remained strong. We have not had a single COVID-related cancellation. RFPs are holding strong at levels that are in line with 2019, which was a record year, and our qualified pipeline remains at a record high. Face-to-face interactions with clients is the obvious challenge. Big defenses, for example, have been delayed with some new business activity getting pushed to the right.  In Technology & Analytics, we had no interruptions in data supply or demand. Our data production centers remain fully operational and our Technology & Analytics deliveries continue in the ordinary course. Conversely, the parts of the business that rely on face-to-face interactions or are dependent on in-person gathering events or conferences are experiencing disruption. The prospective portion of our Real-World business that requires site monitoring activity has also been impacted. That said, given the higher proportion of recurring revenue in the TAS segment, it remains relatively well insulated. Business development activity, however, has been somewhat hampered as decisions are being delayed due to the situation.  Finally, CSMS did not see much of an impact in the first quarter. And what's happening here is that clients are reluctant to alter their commercial footprint in anticipation that the crisis will subside in the near term, and as a result, we have not seen any significant cancellations at this stage. We are, of course, also trying to deliver services remotely through e-detailing and virtual meetings. However, activity has become much more challenging due to a decline in sales rep visits and, of course, physical attention being focused -- physician attention being focused on the COVID-19 crisis. Business development has also become challenging in CSMS due to delayed decision-making and reduced RFP flow.  Now against this backdrop, let's review the first quarter results. Revenue for the first quarter came in at $2.754 billion and was slightly higher than our most recent guidance range. The revenue beat was mostly driven by pass-through, which came in a little higher than we have anticipated. From a segment perspective, Technology & Analytics Solutions revenue came in at $1.170 billion. Constant currency growth was 5.5%. R&D Solutions was $1.441 billion, up 2.4% at constant currency, and excluding a pass-through headwind of approximately 300 basis points, services growth would have been over 5%. Contract Sales & Medical Solutions revenue in the quarter was $196 million and grew 2.6% at constant currency, essentially as we originally expected. First quarter adjusted EBITDA was $562 million and first quarter adjusted diluted EPS was $1.50.  Now I want to highlight bookings growth in R&DS, which was impressive by any standard, but especially so given the broader backdrop. First quarter contracted backlog, including pass-throughs, grew 14% year-over-year to $19.6 billion at March 31, 2020. In the first quarter, awards and net business -- net new business was strong across the board. LTM contracted net new business, including pass-throughs, at March 31 was up 7.5% compared to LTM new business at the end of last year. The contracted book-to-bill ratio, including pass-throughs, was 1.42 for the first quarter of 2020. And excluding pass-throughs, the first quarter contracted book-to-bill was 1.35. The LTM contracted book-to-bill ratio at March 31 was 1.43 including pass-throughs and 1.36 excluding pass-throughs.  The team was, of course, awarded a number of COVID-19 treatment and vaccine trial during the first quarter, most of which are not in our contracted bookings or backlog that I just mentioned. In fact, between treatments and vaccines, we are currently working on 36 COVID-19 awards with a pipeline of 70 other potential projects. Of course, these projects are generally heavily discounted. We are contributing to the general effort against COVID-19 so they won't represent much of our bookings. Importantly, a significant number of these studies entail transformative trial design, including several with government sponsorship and many using the Real-World comparator arm, which IQVIA is uniquely positioned to deliver, on behalf of our customers.  As dramatic as this crisis is, it will eventually subside. It will not change our industry's fundamental dynamics, and in fact, I believe the prospects for our industry are better than ever. We all know some industries will experience a permanent loss of revenue due to their short-cycle or consumer-oriented nature. However, we are a long-cycle business serving the critical needs of the pharma industry. We've got good visibility into our long-term business due to our backlog and pipeline. In our case, work is just being pushed to the right.  This crisis is a reminder of how critical the pharmaceutical industry is to society. Patients will continue to require innovative new medicines and is no viable substitution for drug discovery. We have an enormous role to play in helping our clients bring life-saving treatments to patients. For example, every year, 100 million patients are treated in oncology, 500 million patients for cardiovascular disease and, at any given time, more than 250 million people suffer from more than 6,000 rare diseases. The need for our customers to use real-world data, advanced analytics and technology, combined with therapeutic expertise to accelerate clinical trial time lines and to launch new medicines has become even more evident during this crisis. We will be even more relevant to our customers than we were before the crisis started.  While the course of the virus is uncertain and no one knows for sure how the balance of the year will develop, one could, of course, step back and say, well, let's suspend guidance and see what happens. But we believe it is incumbent on us to have a point of view and to make assumptions about what our business looks like as we navigate this disruption. And our current point of view is that the business will snap back as the crisis subsides, hopefully later this year and certainly into 2021.  Given these assumptions about the future, we're focused on maintaining our operational capability as we navigate through the crisis. We are, of course, taking aggressive actions to manage our costs in line with revenue declines while also ensuring we are ready for a quick recovery. We've stopped renewing temporary employment contracts in the second quarter. We've renegotiated real estate leases and vendor contracts. We've deferred some of our projects. We stopped much of our discretionary third-party spend and many similar actions to control costs. However, for now, we will do our best to preserve employment and, to the extent we can, to not affect base compensation for our employees. We want to take care of our employees as much as possible, especially in these difficult times. They are our greatest assets, and we need to stick together in anticipation of the strong rebound we are expecting in demand for our services.  Many companies are announcing broad-based reductions in pay affecting significant proportions of their staff. We're taking a somewhat more nuanced approach. We've, of course, offer some employees who need the time-off during this difficult time the option of a reduced work week. In very small parts of our business where utilization has dropped very significantly, we are implementing temporary partial work with corresponding pay reductions. In total to date, approximately 650 people, employees, have either requested time-off or been asked to take time-off. This represents less than 1% of our total workforce. Obviously, should the recovery be delayed and our assumptions prove to be materially different from our current -- from reality, we are, of course, prepared to make more drastic decisions if conditions on the ground defer. For now, the rest of our 67,000-plus employees will not see any broad mandatory-based compensation reductions.  Separately, and as an expression of solidarity with all those affected by the crisis, we are launching a temporary voluntary pay reduction program this quarter for the most senior executives across the company ranging from 10% for SVPs to 20% for my direct reports and to 50% for the CEO. These executive pay cuts will be used entirely to fund IQVIA CARE, a new COVID-19 relief program we're launching this week. The proceeds from these executive pay cuts will be distributed to lower pay level colleagues who are facing family hardships as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak.  Finally, I want to highlight to you that at the same time as we are focused on managing the crisis and helping our organization navigate through these difficult times, we have also, in parallel, started our annual planning process for next year much earlier than usual. This is normally an end-of-summer through end-of-year activity, though we have already started engaging our leadership team and our business units in planning for 2021 based on various scenarios of recovery. While we usually provide annual guidance at the beginning of the year concurrent with the release of our fourth quarter earnings, we hope this year to provide 2021 guidance earlier than usual.  Now I will turn it over to Mike for some detail on the quarter and the assumptions we've laid out for the remainder of 2020. Mike?\nMichael McDonnell: Thank you, Ari. Good morning, everyone, and I also hope that you're staying safe and healthy. Let's start with revenue. First quarter revenue of $2.754 billion grew 3.7% at constant currency and 2.6% reported. As Ari noted, revenue outperformed our revised first quarter guidance due to greater-than-expected pass-throughs, which, as we have said, are very hard to predict. Technology & Analytics Solutions first quarter revenue of $1.117 billion grew 5.5% at constant currency and 3.9% reported. R&D Solutions first quarter revenue of $1.441 billion grew 2.4% at constant currency and 1.8% reported. First quarter Contract Sales & Medical Solutions revenue of $196 million grew 2.6% on a constant currency basis and 1.6% reported.  Turning to profit. Adjusted EBITDA was $562 million for the first quarter. First quarter GAAP net income was $82 million, and GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.42. Adjusted net income was $294 million for the first quarter or $1.50 per share.  Let's now turn to R&D Solutions backlog. Closing backlog at March 31, 2020, was $19.6 billion. New business wins remain strong, and to date, we have not experienced any COVID-19 related cancellations.  Let's now review the balance sheet. As of March 31, cash and cash equivalents totaled $927 million and debt was approximately $12 billion, resulting in net debt of $11.1 billion. Our net leverage ratio was 4.7x our trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA. Cash flow from operating activities was $163 million in the first quarter. CapEx for the quarter was $141 million, and free cash flow for the quarter was $22 million. A reminder, the first quarter is seasonally our lightest free cash flow quarter. To date, we have not experienced any collection delays related to COVID-19.  Prior to the COVID-19 outbreak becoming a pandemic in March, the company had repurchased $321 million of its common stock in the first quarter, including the purchase of 1 million shares in connection with the February 2020 private resale by certain stockholders. Since the COVID-19 outbreak became a pandemic in March, we have temporarily suspended share repurchase activity. As of March 31, 2020, we had approximately $1 billion of share repurchase authorization remaining.  We continue to have strong liquidity. At March 31, we had over $900 million of cash on the balance sheet and $1.4 billion of available borrowing capacity on our revolver. Our first maturity of any size is not until 2023, which is our term loan A held by a consortium of our relationship banks. We also have approximately $1 billion of EBITDA cushion on one of our maintenance covenants in our credit agreement and about $1.1 billion under the other. Our senior secured net leverage ratio must be below 4x and at March 31, it was 2.17x. Our interest coverage must be above 3.5x, and as of March 31, we were at 5.92x. And finally, I would point out that we have a lot of flexibility with capital allocation, which includes CapEx, M&A and share repurchases and which would typically equate to about $2 billion per year.  Before we turn to guidance, it will be useful to take a closer look at the COVID-19 situation in China. In China, there were about 8 weeks of a public health emergency from January to March, during which about 80% of our clinical research sites in China were inaccessible. After that 8-week period, activity started to return to normal outside of the Hubei province, and by the end of March, about 40% of our sites were inaccessible. As we moved into April, services outside of Hubei returned to normal with nearly 100% of clinical research sites becoming accessible during May.  As we recap our 2020 guidance, we have used what we have seen in China as a reference point, and we are using a proprietary model with predictive analytics and AI, which is guiding our forecast. All models rely on the accuracy of the inputs used in the model, and the future course of the virus is inherently uncertain.  Despite this uncertainty, we have used our best efforts to estimate the impact of COVID-19 on our business. And when resetting 2020 guidance, we've assumed that new cases of the virus continue to increase globally through the second quarter then level off and begin to decline by the end of the quarter. This slide here shows the number of active cases per 100,000 people, but the curves of the number of new cases or symptomatic cases would be similar. We expect that business activity begins to recover during the third quarter as access to clinical research sites resumes gradually during the quarter with a return to 100% functionality at the beginning of the fourth quarter.  Currently, with the exception of China, most of the company's offices are closed and substantially all of the IQVIA employees are working remotely. Because this is also the case with our clients, business development and execution activities, especially when they require face-to-face interaction, have been inhibited. We assume that commercial activity gradually resumes throughout the second and third quarters and returns to normal by the beginning of the fourth quarter.  Currently, approximately 80% of our clinical research sites are inaccessible. We assume the number of inaccessible sites will average about 70% through the second quarter. For the third quarter, we expect an average of 35% of sites to be inaccessible with all sites open and accessible by the beginning of the fourth quarter.  Based on those assumptions, we are revising our full year 2020 guidance ranges. Full year revenue is now expected to be between $10.6 billion to $10.925 billion. The new revenue guidance includes an unfavorable $75 million impact to reflect FX rates as of April 24. For full year profit, we expect adjusted EBITDA to be between $2.2 billion and $2.3 billion, and we expect adjusted diluted EPS to be between $5.75 per share and $6.10 per share. This guidance assumes foreign currency rates at April 24, 2020, remain in effect for the rest of the year.  Now turning to guidance for the second quarter of 2020. Consistent with the assumptions that we laid out for our full year guidance, including the assumption that business starts to return to normal in some parts of the world in the third quarter, we are expecting the second quarter will have the biggest impact from COVID-19, representing approximately half of the expected total impact for the year. Assuming FX rates at April 24, 2020, remain constant through the end of the quarter, we expect revenue to be between $2.365 billion and $2.440 million. Note that FX is expected to be a headwind to revenue growth of approximately 150 basis points in the second quarter. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $445 million and $470 million, and adjusted diluted EPS is expected to be between $1 per share and $1.09 per share. You should note in the second half of 2020 of the remaining impact from COVID-19, we expect approximately 75% to be weighted to the third quarter.  And so in summary, continued strength in new business wins position us well for a return to strong growth and the momentum we had earlier in the year. We are utilizing our unique capabilities to help in the fight against COVID-19 globally. We are engaging with clients around the world at a much higher level and frequency than ever before. We are taking cost actions to mitigate the impact, have decided to prioritize operational capability in anticipation of the return to normal later this year. We expect the migration back to normal business conditions by the beginning of the fourth quarter, but the second quarter bearing most of the impact from COVID-19. And we are already planning for 2021 in anticipation of a return to our growth trajectory.  And with that, let me hand it back to the operator for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson from JPMorgan. \nTycho Peterson: Ari, I'm just wondering if you can talk to the mitigation efforts, what percentage has actually moved to virtual enrollment and remote monitoring at this point and how comfortable the FDA is maybe switching trials mid course to more remote monitoring. If you could just talk to those dynamics.\nAri Bousbib: Well, thank you. But the -- on your question, about 50%, I would say, moved to remote monitoring. Obviously, the FDA has issued guidance on how we should do remote monitoring. The guidelines are extremely beneficial that provide a way to enable remote approaches to monitor patients and site data. Obviously, you have to check that they're taking their medication and so on.  We built the industry's largest central monitoring organization, and it's across 5 global locations. It supports our remote monitoring capability. We have hundreds of already successfully executed risk-based monitoring studies, RBM studies, in which remote monitoring has been the key component. This is before the crisis. And we complete thousands of remote monitoring visits successfully every year, and the number is growing. So we were happy with the FDA guidance.  There are, of course -- I just -- besides, there are trials where remote monitoring of data is not always an option. Even when the technology and complexity of the -- and the regulatory infrastructure allows this, sometimes it's not always feasible. Not all of the components of the trial also may be monitored remotely. So the key to monitor successfully is to apply the appropriate level of remote and on-site monitoring based on risk. To do that, you need a good therapeutic understanding of the protocol. You need to [indiscernible] strong analytics and technology. So we've got all these elements at scale, but not every trial lends itself to remote monitoring.\nTycho Peterson: And then for a follow-up, as we think about the recovery, just wondering if you could give us some color on what type of work you think could come back sooner, Phase I versus II, III, oncology versus other therapeutic areas. And to what degree do you have to fight through sites that have been repurposed for COVID and beds that have been turned over? How much of a headwind could that be as we think about trial sites getting back up and running?\nAri Bousbib: Obviously, the -- look, we've got to -- over 100,000 sites around the world. So the situation is very different site by site, and you're right to point to therapeutic differences. Patient safety, obviously, in oncology is paramount because the patients are in the middle -- especially for in-site trials, where you can't just stop the treatment mid-course. So those are more likely to come back faster.  The activities that are hampered by these -- by the lack of access are site start-up, patient enrollment and, as we just discussed, monitoring. So it's not just the monitoring visits. It's also the early part, and as you know, we've got a big backlog of trial in start-up phase. So that has been the key hindrance for us.  Thank you. I'll ask everyone to if you could just -- given the timing constraint, I just want to limit your questions to one, unless it's an obvious follow-up. Thank you. Thanks, Bob.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bob Jones from Goldman Sachs.\nRobert Jones: I guess maybe just to follow-up on that line of questioning, Ari. If you look at the update from the end of March with the number of sites that you guys framed as inaccessible, I think real time, you're saying 80%, and then obviously expecting 100% back online by 4Q. Maybe just spending a little bit more time understanding what's informing the cadence of the recovery. Obviously, you guys are a lot closer to it than us on this side of the world. And so just trying to get a better sense of really kind of how you're thinking through that type of recovery because I think, on the surface, obviously, it does seem to be fairly sharp but kind of V-shaped from here to the end of the year.\nAri Bousbib: Well, look, what we're talking about here is accessibility to on-site monitoring. That doesn't necessarily mean that all of the activities related to the trial are going to be enabled just because we can now access safely the site. You also have to have patients coming back. For example, we've seen in China that even when the site is open, not all patients are willing to come in. There's going to be a little bit of lingering concerns. So that's number one.  Number two, once the site is accessible to our CRAs, then they can go in and perform all the tasks that -- as I said in my introductory remarks, there are many tasks that we cannot do remotely, that the vast majority of the trials are going to require us to go back on-site and do the work that we would have done now in the second quarter or third quarter, checking documentations, making sure everything is in order and so on, physically, which is required. And our clients have already told us they will require that, when they accept remote monitoring visits, it's really to check on the patients and to do all the things we can do remotely. We still have to go on-site to do that work.  So this snapback does include a catch-up, if you will. In a given trial, that means, and I think our clients understand that, that the overall cost of the trial is going to go up because in addition to the remote monitoring visits, which we're doing now, we still have to do an on-site visit. It won't be the same on-site because a lot of the activities will have been done remotely, but there is an incremental piece of work that still needs to be done to ensure full compliance. So this is part of why it looks like a V-shaped somewhat.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Eric Coldwell from Baird.\nEric Coldwell: A couple of topics. First off, in the early days of IQVIA, there was a lot of talk about fixed-price contracts, and I know that conversation died down over time. But I am curious, to the extent that you implemented fixed price contracting, what are the impacts on those contracts in the current environment? And secondarily or as an add-on, I'm curious if you have any early views on what change orders will look like over the next year or so, net negative, net neutral, net positive. Just your best guess on what happens to the total book of business compared to original expectations and what you might need to go back to clients for.\nAri Bousbib: Thank you, Eric. Okay, I think it's a good question. But look, when we said fixed price, I think it's a big -- it's a \"fixed price\", right? It's -- we don't have any contract where we take to one price for everything. No, it's parts of the contract that are based on a specific milestone being achieved in exchange for a specific value to be paid. Now obviously, all contracts have caveats, have outs, have circumstances. And look, our clients want the trial to be conducted. So they understand there are changes of scope that are being discussed. Fixed price is assuming the site visit can actually be performed. If it cannot be performed, then there's no way to fulfill the contractual obligation. So there has to be scope changes. I'm not -- I understand where the question comes from, but it's not a concern for us.  With respect to the book of business, in aggregate, look, the RFP flows, as I said earlier, are essentially flat to 2019, whether it's in dollars or in volume. And as you know, 2019 was a real, real record year. Our total R&DS pipeline is up mid-teens year-over-year, and our qualified pipeline for the next 12 months is the largest qualified pipeline we've ever had.  So the message I'm trying to send here, and frankly, while it might be intuitively easy to conclude that, we ourselves are stunned by the degree to which this is a very resilient industry, the pharma industry. And as I said before, it's not going away. If anything, I think people are right in the past to target pharma companies. I think these talks hopefully will recede and people -- as people understand how crucial drug discovery is.  And frankly, Eric, we are very confident going into 2021. We are -- this is why we've decided not to alter our operational capabilities. Even as many of our employees are essentially at home not very utilized, we decided we want to take care of them and continue because we've got strong expectations for 2021. It's also why we decided to engage as a leadership team. Now we've already started planning for 2021 because, again, we have good visibility on the book of business.\nOperator: Your next call comes from the line of John Kreger from William Blair.\nJohn Kreger: Ari, you've mentioned a number of things you've been able to do to help mitigate the crisis, like remote monitoring and virtual visits and televisits. Just curious, in your view, as you move to the recovery phase, let's say, next year, do you think any of these things are going to sort of be structurally adopted by sites and clients? Or are you viewing them primarily as just temporary ways to mitigate the crisis.\nAri Bousbib: Yes. I mean look, we -- long before the crisis had been advancing our virtual trial platform and -- which is being -- was being piloted last year and which -- for which we're having a lot of demand right now, many, many clients calling to ask whether we can transition, now it's hard to do that in the middle of a trial. But we are doing it to the degree we can, and we [indiscernible] accelerating development. So we think the trend will continue, and certainly -- but you will always need physical visits as well, okay? There's no way around it. A virtual trial means that all the pieces that can be done remotely will be done remotely. The patient still has to interact with their physician. And to the degree they could do it with telehealth, they'll do that. But there will be physical interactions as well. So the answer to your question is yes, people will accelerate the way we're thinking about this going forward. So yes.  I mean look it's true. I know what you're looking at. The unit price for a remote monitoring visit is less than a standard in-person site visit, given that there's less effort. There's no -- there's also less pass-through expense because there's no travel, for example, to the site. On the other hand, there is more time and more productivity. Again, as I said before, in-person site visits are still required, even in virtual trials, to meet the source data verification criteria. And until the standards, the regulatory standards change, we still need to verify the source data. And so yes, I mean the trial budget, actually, in the context of the crisis, as I said before, probably are going to go up, not down for now.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Patrick Donnelly from Citi.\nPatrick Donnelly: Great. Ari, maybe just on the TAS business. It seems like that's proven pretty durable during these uncertain times. Can you just talk through recent trends, conversations with customers there and then just expectations kind of through this? And then again, on the other side, it feels like we have a pretty good handle on the R&D business. You're expecting that acceleration in the back end. Can you just talk about the pace of tasks during the year and then again on the other side of this as well?\nAri Bousbib: Patrick -- yes go ahead.\nAndrew Markwick: Patrick, do you mind just repeating again?\nAri Bousbib: Which area of the business? I couldn't hear the first part of your question.\nPatrick Donnelly: The TAS business, sorry.\nAri Bousbib: The TAS business, okay. Yes, yes. Well, look, I mean, again, I just want to remind you, the TAS business roughly can be divided into 3 thirds, which is our legacy IMS info business and then you've got the technology business and then you've got the -- Technology and Analytics business and then you've got the Real-World business.  So with respect to information, the demand and our ability to supply our -- the information has been -- if anything, had a little uptick in the middle of the crisis. And once again, this is a business that's been historically flat. It is subscription-based, license-based and is more than 90% recurring. So that is entirely intact.  The part of the business that -- on the Real-World side that is based on patient-level data and so on is intact. The part of the business that's still prospective study is more similar -- more akin to the R&DS business and does require site visits. That has similar type of characteristics and has a little bit of headwind as a result of the crisis.  The Technology & Analytics business is basically intact. A lot of it is also licenses and recurring business. What is true, frankly, in this business is that the business that requires -- that's more marketing and sales, that requires face-to-face interactions, it's not a big business, frankly, but it is essentially virtually coming to a halt because you just can't have meetings with doctors. You can't have the conferences where -- or the compliance meetings and so on take place. And it's very hard to do it remotely. Maybe -- I think the last number I saw is 12% of that business has been moved to webinar-type format, but it's clearly not the same thing. And so that is very affected. But again, it's a very small part of the total. So yes, that is why the impact on TAS is less than on R&DS.  With respect to the exciting part of that business, which is the OCE platform, we've crossed the 100 customer mark with over 100 wins. We continue to see a lot of success. We're winning 2 out of 3 times against the competition. We are -- with a handful of exceptions, generally speaking, we're not seeing any slowdowns in the implementations. Actually, we've seen acceleration. We went live in the middle of the crisis for several deployments. They were very successful. I saw some very nice feedback from clients. The demand for remote detailing continues to rise with the OCE remote detailing, which is the most secure compliant platform in the space. We also launched in Q1 our compliance solutions in the commercial space. We also launched HCP engagement management, which already has 4 wins in Q1 and a strong pipeline.  So the technology platform business, we're not seeing any slowdown even on the business development front. Now they're all in the projects, analytics. We've got a little bit of consulting projects. All of that, as always, is delayed. And some of the business development activity is just being pushed to the right because the meetings can't take place and because the clients themselves are somewhat on hold with respect to new purchases of somewhat discretionary projects. So that obviously is a headwind to the rest of the year, third, fourth quarter and first quarter and next year. And again, these are smaller parts of the TAS business.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Sandy Draper from SunTrust.\nAlexander Draper: And listen, with regards to time, it'll be a quick one, I think, for Mike. On the delay of the share or the halting of the share repos, what are sort of the key factors that open that back up to you? Is it really -- if you hit your fourth quarter, everything is fully ramped back up then you go back? Do you want to see a couple of quarters? Just how should we think about going back to a more normalized capital deployment strategy? What are the factors that go into that decision?\nMichael McDonnell: Sure, Sandy. Thanks for the question. As we mentioned, we did repurchase $321 million of our stock in the first quarter, and that all occurred largely before the crisis, including a chunk that we participated in a secondary offering by our sponsors.  I think we're going to be judicious with respect to capital deployment, obviously, manage our liquidity as a priority. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we've not seen any disruption to -- or delays in collections at this point. We're continuing to manage that closely and carefully. We've got $1.4 billion on our $1.5 billion facility that's undrawn. So it puts us in a very good liquidity spot. But at the same time, obviously, with declines in EBITDA, leverage ratio has ticked up a bit. We're going to monitor that carefully. We prioritized keeping our employee base in a great place and not impacting base compensation in any way in anticipation of a big delivery task as things come back to normal.  And I think that share repurchases, we'll just continue to monitor as we get through the crisis with the prudent time to reenter the market. Obviously, we would love to be buying shares at the current levels, but at the same time, we're going to be very judicious with our capital allocation, whether it's M&A, share repurchase or CapEx. And I think we'll logically find the most prudent time to reenter when we get through the -- to the other side.\nOperator: Our final question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum from Stifel.\nShlomo Rosenbaum: So Ari, can you talk a little bit more about how the billing works in the current environment on the CRO side? If people can't get into the sites, is there a portion of what they do that's billable or a portion that's not billable? And then just to clarify, as part of this, when they actually have to go back in physically, the cost -- of that additional cost, you expect that to be largely borne by the clients versus being borne by the company. Is that correct?\nAri Bousbib: Thanks. Yes, the second part of your question, yes. Obviously, as I said before, there are, as a result of the crisis, changes of scope to the trial, and that includes conversation with the client as to how do we handle that incremental work that needs to be done. As to the first question, I wasn't sure I understood. The practical, the actual way that we do the billing, I don't know, Mike, do you have any insights on that?\nMichael McDonnell: Yes. I mean I think -- bear in mind that revenue is driven by a percentage of completion, not so much the billing. But to the extent that we're able to complete tasks in the ordinary course and progress toward completion, we're able to bill that. In some cases, if we have milestones that we actually physically cannot hit because of factors that are outside of our control, in some cases, we have to have that conversation, are having those conversations with clients that allow us to bill and collect in cases where we're just stuck on not being able to hit a predetermined milestone, that didn't anticipate this kind of pandemic.  So we haven't seen disruption at this point. We'll continue to monitor. We have a great road map in China where sites are now reopening, and we've not seen really any disruption of note at all anywhere in the billing and collections front, including in the R&DS business.\nAndrew Markwick: Thank you for taking the time to join us today, everyone, and we look forward to speaking with you again on our Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. Jen and I will be available for the rest of the day to take any follow-up questions that you may have. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Michael McDonnell",
            "content": "Thank you, Ari. Good morning, everyone, and I also hope that you're staying safe and healthy. Let's start with revenue. First quarter revenue of $2.754 billion grew 3.7% at constant currency and 2.6% reported. As Ari noted, revenue outperformed our revised first quarter guidance due to greater-than-expected pass-throughs, which, as we have said, are very hard to predict. Technology & Analytics Solutions first quarter revenue of $1.117 billion grew 5.5% at constant currency and 3.9% reported. R&D Solutions first quarter revenue of $1.441 billion grew 2.4% at constant currency and 1.8% reported. First quarter Contract Sales & Medical Solutions revenue of $196 million grew 2.6% on a constant currency basis and 1.6% reported.  Turning to profit. Adjusted EBITDA was $562 million for the first quarter. First quarter GAAP net income was $82 million, and GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.42. Adjusted net income was $294 million for the first quarter or $1.50 per share.  Let's now turn to R&D Solutions backlog. Closing backlog at March 31, 2020, was $19.6 billion. New business wins remain strong, and to date, we have not experienced any COVID-19 related cancellations.  Let's now review the balance sheet. As of March 31, cash and cash equivalents totaled $927 million and debt was approximately $12 billion, resulting in net debt of $11.1 billion. Our net leverage ratio was 4.7x our trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA. Cash flow from operating activities was $163 million in the first quarter. CapEx for the quarter was $141 million, and free cash flow for the quarter was $22 million. A reminder, the first quarter is seasonally our lightest free cash flow quarter. To date, we have not experienced any collection delays related to COVID-19.  Prior to the COVID-19 outbreak becoming a pandemic in March, the company had repurchased $321 million of its common stock in the first quarter, including the purchase of 1 million shares in connection with the February 2020 private resale by certain stockholders. Since the COVID-19 outbreak became a pandemic in March, we have temporarily suspended share repurchase activity. As of March 31, 2020, we had approximately $1 billion of share repurchase authorization remaining.  We continue to have strong liquidity. At March 31, we had over $900 million of cash on the balance sheet and $1.4 billion of available borrowing capacity on our revolver. Our first maturity of any size is not until 2023, which is our term loan A held by a consortium of our relationship banks. We also have approximately $1 billion of EBITDA cushion on one of our maintenance covenants in our credit agreement and about $1.1 billion under the other. Our senior secured net leverage ratio must be below 4x and at March 31, it was 2.17x. Our interest coverage must be above 3.5x, and as of March 31, we were at 5.92x. And finally, I would point out that we have a lot of flexibility with capital allocation, which includes CapEx, M&A and share repurchases and which would typically equate to about $2 billion per year.  Before we turn to guidance, it will be useful to take a closer look at the COVID-19 situation in China. In China, there were about 8 weeks of a public health emergency from January to March, during which about 80% of our clinical research sites in China were inaccessible. After that 8-week period, activity started to return to normal outside of the Hubei province, and by the end of March, about 40% of our sites were inaccessible. As we moved into April, services outside of Hubei returned to normal with nearly 100% of clinical research sites becoming accessible during May.  As we recap our 2020 guidance, we have used what we have seen in China as a reference point, and we are using a proprietary model with predictive analytics and AI, which is guiding our forecast. All models rely on the accuracy of the inputs used in the model, and the future course of the virus is inherently uncertain.  Despite this uncertainty, we have used our best efforts to estimate the impact of COVID-19 on our business. And when resetting 2020 guidance, we've assumed that new cases of the virus continue to increase globally through the second quarter then level off and begin to decline by the end of the quarter. This slide here shows the number of active cases per 100,000 people, but the curves of the number of new cases or symptomatic cases would be similar. We expect that business activity begins to recover during the third quarter as access to clinical research sites resumes gradually during the quarter with a return to 100% functionality at the beginning of the fourth quarter.  Currently, with the exception of China, most of the company's offices are closed and substantially all of the IQVIA employees are working remotely. Because this is also the case with our clients, business development and execution activities, especially when they require face-to-face interaction, have been inhibited. We assume that commercial activity gradually resumes throughout the second and third quarters and returns to normal by the beginning of the fourth quarter.  Currently, approximately 80% of our clinical research sites are inaccessible. We assume the number of inaccessible sites will average about 70% through the second quarter. For the third quarter, we expect an average of 35% of sites to be inaccessible with all sites open and accessible by the beginning of the fourth quarter.  Based on those assumptions, we are revising our full year 2020 guidance ranges. Full year revenue is now expected to be between $10.6 billion to $10.925 billion. The new revenue guidance includes an unfavorable $75 million impact to reflect FX rates as of April 24. For full year profit, we expect adjusted EBITDA to be between $2.2 billion and $2.3 billion, and we expect adjusted diluted EPS to be between $5.75 per share and $6.10 per share. This guidance assumes foreign currency rates at April 24, 2020, remain in effect for the rest of the year.  Now turning to guidance for the second quarter of 2020. Consistent with the assumptions that we laid out for our full year guidance, including the assumption that business starts to return to normal in some parts of the world in the third quarter, we are expecting the second quarter will have the biggest impact from COVID-19, representing approximately half of the expected total impact for the year. Assuming FX rates at April 24, 2020, remain constant through the end of the quarter, we expect revenue to be between $2.365 billion and $2.440 million. Note that FX is expected to be a headwind to revenue growth of approximately 150 basis points in the second quarter. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $445 million and $470 million, and adjusted diluted EPS is expected to be between $1 per share and $1.09 per share. You should note in the second half of 2020 of the remaining impact from COVID-19, we expect approximately 75% to be weighted to the third quarter.  And so in summary, continued strength in new business wins position us well for a return to strong growth and the momentum we had earlier in the year. We are utilizing our unique capabilities to help in the fight against COVID-19 globally. We are engaging with clients around the world at a much higher level and frequency than ever before. We are taking cost actions to mitigate the impact, have decided to prioritize operational capability in anticipation of the return to normal later this year. We expect the migration back to normal business conditions by the beginning of the fourth quarter, but the second quarter bearing most of the impact from COVID-19. And we are already planning for 2021 in anticipation of a return to our growth trajectory.  And with that, let me hand it back to the operator for Q&A. Sure, Sandy. Thanks for the question. As we mentioned, we did repurchase $321 million of our stock in the first quarter, and that all occurred largely before the crisis, including a chunk that we participated in a secondary offering by our sponsors.  I think we're going to be judicious with respect to capital deployment, obviously, manage our liquidity as a priority.

            "name": "Ari Bousbib",
            "content": "Thank you, Andrew, and good morning, everyone. Hope everyone is safe and well. Thanks for joining us on our first quarter 2020 earnings call. I want to apologize in advance that, given the crisis, I will be a little longer in my narratives today in an effort to provide you a good amount of color on what we're seeing on the ground. Of course, as always, if we don't have time to get to your questioning, our team is available to answer questions after the call. Today, we will review our first quarter performance. We will also provide guidance for the second quarter and update our full year guidance in light of COVID-19.  First, let's review how we've been navigating the challenges over the last couple of months. We've instituted a precrisis management structure to ensure that we align on priorities across the organization. I've been meeting every day with my senior leadership team. As disclosed, communication has allowed us to be agile and decisive in our response to the crisis, and collectively, we're currently centered around four priorities.  First, the safety of our employees, patients, health care professionals, customers, suppliers with whom we frequently interact. To limit exposure, of course, we prohibited substantially all travel, supplied PPE to field-based employees, closed facilities and have most of our staff to work remotely. We've added bandwidth VPN capacity to our advanced infrastructure to enable remote working and avoid service disruptions.  Second, as clinics and hospitals have become inaccessible and has become unsafe or difficult for patients to travel, we've continued to do everything in our power to mitigate disruptions to clinical trials and ensure patient safety. Wherever possible, we have been transitioning to remote monitoring with the number of remote monitoring visits reaching 5x the level they were prior to the crisis. We have leveraged our existing drug delivery and home health services for activities such as at-home lab draws. Perhaps we could -- but whenever we could, we've been enabling telehealth visits to ensure continuity of contact between investigator, patients and CRAs, and we've been transitioning portions of trials to Study Hub, our virtual trial platform.  Third, to help our clients and other organizations manage and plan for the outbreak, we're deploying our unique capabilities. For example, we are applying our people, data and technology to bring AI and insights to help our clients track the progression of the disease, manage capacity and monitor supply chains. We are actively engaged with clients through regular executive briefings, 3 weekly market tracking reports, white papers, thought leadership pieces and webinars to help them understand the rapidly evolving dynamics of the outbreak and to predict how things will develop.  Finally, we're joining the global response to the crisis and contributing our resources to its resolution. Last week, for example, in the U.K., on behalf of Department of Health, we joined with the Office of National Statistics, Oxford University and the U.K. Biocentre. We immediately commenced a countrywide testing program of U.K. households for COVID-19 infection and immunity. In Asia, we provided an IQVIA team to have developed 2 new treatments for COVID-19 using existing HIV and flu vaccines. In the U.S., we're partnering with the University of Texas to develop new lab tests to identify vaccine candidates quicker than currently available tests. In the U.S. and Europe, we are collaborating with governments and the industry to develop several experimental vaccine candidates using our prime site networks and data assets to accelerate time line. We are, of course, involved in multiple trials for COVID-19 therapeutics and vaccines, which I will talk more about later.  During this critical time, we continue to innovate. Two weeks ago, our R&D team launched the first technology-enabled COVID-19 trial matching solution at c19trials.com. This online platform will connect at-risk individuals and researchers to ongoing COVID-19 clinical research projects within the U.S. In addition, the Real-World team launched the IQVIA CARE Project registry. The platform will apply our vast experience with registries and analytics to help connect stakeholders and advance information sharing to better understand how to treat and prevent the disease. If successful, all of these will bring much in the certain treatments to patients.  Now before I'll review the results of the quarter, let's take a look at some of the operational impacts to our business caused by the virus. It is important to note, across all of our segments, we view the impacts from the virus as temporary. Client demand and interest in our differentiated offerings remain strong even if their own ability to move forward on projects is hampered or delayed.  In R&DS, site start-up patient recruitment are the most impacted part of the clinical trial life cycle. Site monitoring visits have also been impacted. As of today, only 20% of our global sites are currently accessible to our CRAs for on-site monitoring visits. On the other hand, data collection and regulatory reporting activities are more or less continuing with little interruption.  For in-site trials, we are coordinating closely with local health authorities and customers to deploy, when appropriate and feasible, our services and technologies to further increase remote-based CRA and centralized monitoring for trials and remote patient visits. As site access remains constrained, we are seeing an uptick in demand for e-consent, virtual trials, eCOA and connected devices. When the crisis subsides, we anticipate that some trials will require minimal additional work to satisfy requirements over and above the remote visits. But the vast majority, substantially, most of the other trials, will require CRAs to go on-site and perform the task of checking documentation, et cetera, that we would not have performed safely during the crisis.  R&D business development activity has remained strong. We have not had a single COVID-related cancellation. RFPs are holding strong at levels that are in line with 2019, which was a record year, and our qualified pipeline remains at a record high. Face-to-face interactions with clients is the obvious challenge. Big defenses, for example, have been delayed with some new business activity getting pushed to the right.  In Technology & Analytics, we had no interruptions in data supply or demand. Our data production centers remain fully operational and our Technology & Analytics deliveries continue in the ordinary course. Conversely, the parts of the business that rely on face-to-face interactions or are dependent on in-person gathering events or conferences are experiencing disruption. The prospective portion of our Real-World business that requires site monitoring activity has also been impacted. That said, given the higher proportion of recurring revenue in the TAS segment, it remains relatively well insulated. Business development activity, however, has been somewhat hampered as decisions are being delayed due to the situation.  Finally, CSMS did not see much of an impact in the first quarter. And what's happening here is that clients are reluctant to alter their commercial footprint in anticipation that the crisis will subside in the near term, and as a result, we have not seen any significant cancellations at this stage. We are, of course, also trying to deliver services remotely through e-detailing and virtual meetings. However, activity has become much more challenging due to a decline in sales rep visits and, of course, physical attention being focused -- physician attention being focused on the COVID-19 crisis. Business development has also become challenging in CSMS due to delayed decision-making and reduced RFP flow.  Now against this backdrop, let's review the first quarter results. Revenue for the first quarter came in at $2.754 billion and was slightly higher than our most recent guidance range. The revenue beat was mostly driven by pass-through, which came in a little higher than we have anticipated. From a segment perspective, Technology & Analytics Solutions revenue came in at $1.170 billion. Constant currency growth was 5.5%. R&D Solutions was $1.441 billion, up 2.4% at constant currency, and excluding a pass-through headwind of approximately 300 basis points, services growth would have been over 5%. Contract Sales & Medical Solutions revenue in the quarter was $196 million and grew 2.6% at constant currency, essentially as we originally expected. First quarter adjusted EBITDA was $562 million and first quarter adjusted diluted EPS was $1.50.  Now I want to highlight bookings growth in R&DS, which was impressive by any standard, but especially so given the broader backdrop. First quarter contracted backlog, including pass-throughs, grew 14% year-over-year to $19.6 billion at March 31, 2020. In the first quarter, awards and net business -- net new business was strong across the board. LTM contracted net new business, including pass-throughs, at March 31 was up 7.5% compared to LTM new business at the end of last year. The contracted book-to-bill ratio, including pass-throughs, was 1.42 for the first quarter of 2020. And excluding pass-throughs, the first quarter contracted book-to-bill was 1.35. The LTM contracted book-to-bill ratio at March 31 was 1.43 including pass-throughs and 1.36 excluding pass-throughs.  The team was, of course, awarded a number of COVID-19 treatment and vaccine trial during the first quarter, most of which are not in our contracted bookings or backlog that I just mentioned. In fact, between treatments and vaccines, we are currently working on 36 COVID-19 awards with a pipeline of 70 other potential projects. Of course, these projects are generally heavily discounted. We are contributing to the general effort against COVID-19 so they won't represent much of our bookings. Importantly, a significant number of these studies entail transformative trial design, including several with government sponsorship and many using the Real-World comparator arm, which IQVIA is uniquely positioned to deliver, on behalf of our customers.  As dramatic as this crisis is, it will eventually subside. It will not change our industry's fundamental dynamics, and in fact, I believe the prospects for our industry are better than ever. We all know some industries will experience a permanent loss of revenue due to their short-cycle or consumer-oriented nature. However, we are a long-cycle business serving the critical needs of the pharma industry. We've got good visibility into our long-term business due to our backlog and pipeline. In our case, work is just being pushed to the right.  This crisis is a reminder of how critical the pharmaceutical industry is to society. Patients will continue to require innovative new medicines and is no viable substitution for drug discovery. We have an enormous role to play in helping our clients bring life-saving treatments to patients. For example, every year, 100 million patients are treated in oncology, 500 million patients for cardiovascular disease and, at any given time, more than 250 million people suffer from more than 6,000 rare diseases. The need for our customers to use real-world data, advanced analytics and technology, combined with therapeutic expertise to accelerate clinical trial time lines and to launch new medicines has become even more evident during this crisis. We will be even more relevant to our customers than we were before the crisis started.  While the course of the virus is uncertain and no one knows for sure how the balance of the year will develop, one could, of course, step back and say, well, let's suspend guidance and see what happens. But we believe it is incumbent on us to have a point of view and to make assumptions about what our business looks like as we navigate this disruption. And our current point of view is that the business will snap back as the crisis subsides, hopefully later this year and certainly into 2021.  Given these assumptions about the future, we're focused on maintaining our operational capability as we navigate through the crisis. We are, of course, taking aggressive actions to manage our costs in line with revenue declines while also ensuring we are ready for a quick recovery. We've stopped renewing temporary employment contracts in the second quarter. We've renegotiated real estate leases and vendor contracts. We've deferred some of our projects. We stopped much of our discretionary third-party spend and many similar actions to control costs. However, for now, we will do our best to preserve employment and, to the extent we can, to not affect base compensation for our employees. We want to take care of our employees as much as possible, especially in these difficult times. They are our greatest assets, and we need to stick together in anticipation of the strong rebound we are expecting in demand for our services.  Many companies are announcing broad-based reductions in pay affecting significant proportions of their staff. We're taking a somewhat more nuanced approach. We've, of course, offer some employees who need the time-off during this difficult time the option of a reduced work week. In very small parts of our business where utilization has dropped very significantly, we are implementing temporary partial work with corresponding pay reductions. In total to date, approximately 650 people, employees, have either requested time-off or been asked to take time-off. This represents less than 1% of our total workforce. Obviously, should the recovery be delayed and our assumptions prove to be materially different from our current -- from reality, we are, of course, prepared to make more drastic decisions if conditions on the ground defer. For now, the rest of our 67,000-plus employees will not see any broad mandatory-based compensation reductions.  Separately, and as an expression of solidarity with all those affected by the crisis, we are launching a temporary voluntary pay reduction program this quarter for the most senior executives across the company ranging from 10% for SVPs to 20% for my direct reports and to 50% for the CEO. These executive pay cuts will be used entirely to fund IQVIA CARE, a new COVID-19 relief program we're launching this week. The proceeds from these executive pay cuts will be distributed to lower pay level colleagues who are facing family hardships as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak.  Finally, I want to highlight to you that at the same time as we are focused on managing the crisis and helping our organization navigate through these difficult times, we have also, in parallel, started our annual planning process for next year much earlier than usual. This is normally an end-of-summer through end-of-year activity, though we have already started engaging our leadership team and our business units in planning for 2021 based on various scenarios of recovery. While we usually provide annual guidance at the beginning of the year concurrent with the release of our fourth quarter earnings, we hope this year to provide 2021 guidance earlier than usual.  Now I will turn it over to Mike for some detail on the quarter and the assumptions we've laid out for the remainder of 2020. Mike? Well, thank you. But the -- on your question, about 50%, I would say, moved to remote monitoring. Obviously, the FDA has issued guidance on how we should do remote monitoring. The guidelines are extremely beneficial that provide a way to enable remote approaches to monitor patients and site data. Obviously, you have to check that they're taking their medication and so on.  We built the industry's largest central monitoring organization, and it's across 5 global locations. It supports our remote monitoring capability. We have hundreds of already successfully executed risk-based monitoring studies, RBM studies, in which remote monitoring has been the key component. This is before the crisis. And we complete thousands of remote monitoring visits successfully every year, and the number is growing. So we were happy with the FDA guidance.  There are, of course -- I just -- besides, there are trials where remote monitoring of data is not always an option. Even when the technology and complexity of the -- and the regulatory infrastructure allows this, sometimes it's not always feasible. Not all of the components of the trial also may be monitored remotely. So the key to monitor successfully is to apply the appropriate level of remote and on-site monitoring based on risk. To do that, you need a good therapeutic understanding of the protocol. You need to [indiscernible] strong analytics and technology. So we've got all these elements at scale, but not every trial lends itself to remote monitoring. Obviously, the -- look, we've got to -- over 100,000 sites around the world. So the situation is very different site by site, and you're right to point to therapeutic differences. Patient safety, obviously, in oncology is paramount because the patients are in the middle -- especially for in-site trials, where you can't just stop the treatment mid-course. So those are more likely to come back faster.  The activities that are hampered by these -- by the lack of access are site start-up, patient enrollment and, as we just discussed, monitoring. So it's not just the monitoring visits. It's also the early part, and as you know, we've got a big backlog of trial in start-up phase. So that has been the key hindrance for us.  Thank you. I'll ask everyone to if you could just -- given the timing constraint, I just want to limit your questions to one, unless it's an obvious follow-up. Thank you. Thanks, Bob. Well, look, what we're talking about here is accessibility to on-site monitoring. That doesn't necessarily mean that all of the activities related to the trial are going to be enabled just because we can now access safely the site. You also have to have patients coming back. For example, we've seen in China that even when the site is open, not all patients are willing to come in. There's going to be a little bit of lingering concerns. So that's number one.  Number two, once the site is accessible to our CRAs, then they can go in and perform all the tasks that -- as I said in my introductory remarks, there are many tasks that we cannot do remotely, that the vast majority of the trials are going to require us to go back on-site and do the work that we would have done now in the second quarter or third quarter, checking documentations, making sure everything is in order and so on, physically, which is required. And our clients have already told us they will require that, when they accept remote monitoring visits, it's really to check on the patients and to do all the things we can do remotely. We still have to go on-site to do that work.  So this snapback does include a catch-up, if you will. In a given trial, that means, and I think our clients understand that, that the overall cost of the trial is going to go up because in addition to the remote monitoring visits, which we're doing now, we still have to do an on-site visit. It won't be the same on-site because a lot of the activities will have been done remotely, but there is an incremental piece of work that still needs to be done to ensure full compliance. So this is part of why it looks like a V-shaped somewhat. Thank you, Eric. Okay, I think it's a good question. But look, when we said fixed price, I think it's a big -- it's a \"fixed price\", right? It's -- we don't have any contract where we take to one price for everything. No, it's parts of the contract that are based on a specific milestone being achieved in exchange for a specific value to be paid. Now obviously, all contracts have caveats, have outs, have circumstances. And look, our clients want the trial to be conducted. So they understand there are changes of scope that are being discussed. Fixed price is assuming the site visit can actually be performed. If it cannot be performed, then there's no way to fulfill the contractual obligation. So there has to be scope changes. I'm not -- I understand where the question comes from, but it's not a concern for us.  With respect to the book of business, in aggregate, look, the RFP flows, as I said earlier, are essentially flat to 2019, whether it's in dollars or in volume. And as you know, 2019 was a real, real record year. Our total R&DS pipeline is up mid-teens year-over-year, and our qualified pipeline for the next 12 months is the largest qualified pipeline we've ever had.  So the message I'm trying to send here, and frankly, while it might be intuitively easy to conclude that, we ourselves are stunned by the degree to which this is a very resilient industry, the pharma industry. And as I said before, it's not going away. If anything, I think people are right in the past to target pharma companies. I think these talks hopefully will recede and people -- as people understand how crucial drug discovery is.  And frankly, Eric, we are very confident going into 2021. We are -- this is why we've decided not to alter our operational capabilities. Even as many of our employees are essentially at home not very utilized, we decided we want to take care of them and continue because we've got strong expectations for 2021. It's also why we decided to engage as a leadership team. Now we've already started planning for 2021 because, again, we have good visibility on the book of business. Yes. I mean look, we -- long before the crisis had been advancing our virtual trial platform and -- which is being -- was being piloted last year and which -- for which we're having a lot of demand right now, many, many clients calling to ask whether we can transition, now it's hard to do that in the middle of a trial. But we are doing it to the degree we can, and we [indiscernible] accelerating development. So we think the trend will continue, and certainly -- but you will always need physical visits as well, okay? There's no way around it. A virtual trial means that all the pieces that can be done remotely will be done remotely. The patient still has to interact with their physician. And to the degree they could do it with telehealth, they'll do that. But there will be physical interactions as well. So the answer to your question is yes, people will accelerate the way we're thinking about this going forward. So yes.  I mean look it's true. I know what you're looking at. The unit price for a remote monitoring visit is less than a standard in-person site visit, given that there's less effort. There's no -- there's also less pass-through expense because there's no travel, for example, to the site. On the other hand, there is more time and more productivity. Again, as I said before, in-person site visits are still required, even in virtual trials, to meet the source data verification criteria. And until the standards, the regulatory standards change, we still need to verify the source data. And so yes, I mean the trial budget, actually, in the context of the crisis, as I said before, probably are going to go up, not down for now. Patrick -- yes go ahead. Which area of the business? I couldn't hear the first part of your question. The TAS business, okay. Yes, yes. Well, look, I mean, again, I just want to remind you, the TAS business roughly can be divided into 3 thirds, which is our legacy IMS info business and then you've got the technology business and then you've got the -- Technology and Analytics business and then you've got the Real-World business.  So with respect to information, the demand and our ability to supply our -- the information has been -- if anything, had a little uptick in the middle of the crisis. And once again, this is a business that's been historically flat. It is subscription-based, license-based and is more than 90% recurring. So that is entirely intact.  The part of the business that -- on the Real-World side that is based on patient-level data and so on is intact. The part of the business that's still prospective study is more similar -- more akin to the R&DS business and does require site visits. That has similar type of characteristics and has a little bit of headwind as a result of the crisis.  The Technology & Analytics business is basically intact. A lot of it is also licenses and recurring business. What is true, frankly, in this business is that the business that requires -- that's more marketing and sales, that requires face-to-face interactions, it's not a big business, frankly, but it is essentially virtually coming to a halt because you just can't have meetings with doctors. You can't have the conferences where -- or the compliance meetings and so on take place. And it's very hard to do it remotely. Maybe -- I think the last number I saw is 12% of that business has been moved to webinar-type format, but it's clearly not the same thing. And so that is very affected. But again, it's a very small part of the total. So yes, that is why the impact on TAS is less than on R&DS.  With respect to the exciting part of that business, which is the OCE platform, we've crossed the 100 customer mark with over 100 wins. We continue to see a lot of success. We're winning 2 out of 3 times against the competition. We are -- with a handful of exceptions, generally speaking, we're not seeing any slowdowns in the implementations. Actually, we've seen acceleration. We went live in the middle of the crisis for several deployments. They were very successful. I saw some very nice feedback from clients. The demand for remote detailing continues to rise with the OCE remote detailing, which is the most secure compliant platform in the space. We also launched in Q1 our compliance solutions in the commercial space. We also launched HCP engagement management, which already has 4 wins in Q1 and a strong pipeline.  So the technology platform business, we're not seeing any slowdown even on the business development front. Now they're all in the projects, analytics. We've got a little bit of consulting projects. All of that, as always, is delayed. And some of the business development activity is just being pushed to the right because the meetings can't take place and because the clients themselves are somewhat on hold with respect to new purchases of somewhat discretionary projects. So that obviously is a headwind to the rest of the year, third, fourth quarter and first quarter and next year. And again, these are smaller parts of the TAS business. Thanks. Yes, the second part of your question, yes. Obviously, as I said before, there are, as a result of the crisis, changes of scope to the trial, and that includes conversation with the client as to how do we handle that incremental work that needs to be done. As to the first question, I wasn't sure I understood. The practical, the actual way that we do the billing, I don't know, Mike, do you have any insights on that?"

But I am curious, to the extent that you implemented fixed price contracting, what are the impacts on those contracts in the current environment? And secondarily or as an add-on, I'm curious if you have any early views on what change orders will look like over the next year or so, net negative, net neutral, net positive. Just your best guess on what happens to the total book of business compared to original expectations and what you might need to go back to clients for."

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Nick Childs, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Mr. Childs, you may begin your conference.\nNick Childs: Thank you and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining our fourth quarter 2021 earnings call. With me today are Ari Bousbib, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Ron Bruehlman, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Eric Sherbet, Executive Vice President and General Counsel; Mike Fedock, Senior Vice President, Financial Planning and Analysis; and Bryan Stengel, Associate Director, Investor Relations. Today, we will be referencing a presentation that will be visible during this call for those of you on our webcast. This presentation will also be available following this call in the events and presentations section of our IQVIA Investor Relations website at ir.iqvia.com. Before we begin, I would like to caution listeners that certain information discussed by management during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results will differ materially from those stated or implied by forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties associated with the company's business which are discussed in the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings. In addition, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures on this call, which should be considered a supplement to and not a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the comparable GAAP measures is included in the press release and conference call presentation. I would now like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Ari Bousbib.\nAri Bousbib: Thank you, Nick and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining today for our fourth quarter results. It was great to see many of you in person at our Analyst and Investor Conference in November. And as you will recall, we shared our expectations that we would meet or exceed our three-year Vision 2022 targets. We also laid out our plans to make 2022 yet another inflection point in our growth trajectory and further accelerate the company's growth rate in the next three phase -- three-year phase of our journey to 2025. The team highlighted the power of connected intelligence, which brings together IQVIA differentiated capabilities and drive our leadership position in the clinical and commercial markets. This underpins our new 20 x 2025 strategy, which alludes to our plans to achieve at least $20 billion of revenue by 2025. We're excited about this next phase of growth for IQVIA, and we are busy refining our strategies and action plans, and you will hear more about it as the year progresses. Two years -- two weeks ago, IQVIA was named to Fortune's list of the World's Most Admired Companies for the fifth consecutive year. Importantly, we earned a first place ranking within the health care, pharmacy and other services category for the first time. We ranked number one in the categories of innovation, capital deployment, global competitiveness, quality of product and services, and long-term investment value. I want to thank our nearly 80,000 employees worldwide for this recognition is a tribute to their innovation and drive. Turning now to our results. We ended 2021 on a high note, despite COVID-19's continued impact on many parts of the world. We delivered robust top and bottom line growth in the quarter, which, as you know, was against a much tougher year-over-year comparison than earlier in the year. These results reinforce our confidence that we will achieve our 2022 guidance. And, of course, it sets us up well to meet our ambitious 2025 targets. Let's review the fourth quarter. Revenue for the fourth quarter grew 10.2% on a reported basis and 11.6% at constant currency. The $62 million beat above the midpoint of our guidance range was driven by stronger operational performance across all three segments as well as higher pass-throughs, partially offset by FX headwinds. Compared to prior year and excluding COVID related work, our core businesses, meaning R&DS and TAS, grew mid-teens at constant currency on an organic basis. Ron will provide a lot more detail in his remarks, including additional COVID adjusted numbers for each segment. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA grew 12.7%, reflecting our revenue growth as well as ongoing productivity initiatives. The $27 million beat above the midpoint of our guidance range was entirely due to our operational performance. Fourth quarter adjusted diluted EPS of $2.55 grew 20.9%. That was $0.13 above the midpoint of our guidance, with the majority of the beat coming from the adjusted EBITDA drop-through. Let me now provide an update on the business. On the commercial side of the business, it was a strong year for new molecules and launches as the industry continued its recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic disruption. This year, 50 new molecules were approved by the FDA and 72 new commercial launches took place. IQVIA supported nearly 80% of launches by top 20 pharma and approximately 60% of all launches. This highlights our scale globally and across all customer segments in applying advanced technology and analytics capabilities to enhance launch planning, engagement and measurement. Overall, we've seen significant momentum and continued demand for our technology solutions. There are now over 3,000 clients who have adopted one or more of our technology platforms, including human data science cloud, orchestrated analytics, E360, Omnichannel Navigator, Engage and of course, Orchestrated Customer Engagement, or OCE. In fact, the footprint of our OCE platform itself has continued to grow, with over 350 clients having adopted one or more modules on the platform since launch. Early in 2021, we launched IQVIA Next Best Action, which is an AI-driven omni-channel customer engagement decision engine. Two top 20 pharma clients have successfully rolled out this intelligence engine to orchestrate customer engagements in over 30 countries and across more than 40 brands each. Two other top 20 pharmas are currently in the implementation phase. Another highlight in our TAS business has been the success of DMD Marketing Solutions, a leading provider of data and digital marketing solutions that help brands deliver personalized digital content to healthcare professionals. In the quarter, we entered into an enterprise agreement with a top 10 pharma clients to utilize DMD's advanced analytic capabilities to power omnichannel engagement across all eight of their brand franchises. To date, 18 of the top 20 have adopted at least one of DMD solutions. We're very excited for the future growth of this business within IQVIA. Real-world evidence and other highlights of the year, IQVIA continues to play a leading role in the use of secondary data to answer key questions for life science customers. In the fourth quarter, we won two large post-authorization safety studies in an autoimmune area with a top 10 pharma. These studies use existing healthcare data to observe patients over a period of 10 years to better understand long-term effects of the treatment. We were also recently awarded a disease registry project for an upcoming novel gene therapy. Here, we will recruit a broad population of patients with a specific disease to understand how they are currently managed in clinical practice. This information is vital to our life science sponsors to inform the design of subsequent clinical trials so they can target patient groups with the highest unmet need. Moving to clinical technology. We saw increased adoption of our Orchestrated Clinical Trials, OCT platform, which supports trial planning, site management, patient engagement, trial management and clinical data analytics. During the year, we added 90 new OCT clients, bringing the total to over 350 clients who have adopted one or more modules within our clinical technology suite since launch, including all of the top 10 and 18 of the top 20. Within OCT's digital patient suite this year, we secured three preferred provider partnerships with top 30 pharmaceutical clients to provide our interactive response technology, IRT capabilities, to support site operations across their entire clinical trial portfolios. This technology facilitates patient randomization to ensure protocol adherence and streamline site supply chain management to reduce drug wastage and to drive significant cost reductions. Our solution was awarded a top-ranking by industry leaders in a recent ISR report for randomization and chart supply management capabilities. We also saw increased demand for our industry-leading decentralized clinical trial offering. Approximately one-third of our active full-service clinical trials incorporate one or more of our DCT technology or services capabilities, and we expect this to continue to grow as the need for these capabilities in complex studies becomes more evident. For example, we are currently executing a full-service trial for treatment of multiple system atrophy, a severe degenerative neurological disorder affecting the body's involuntary functions. We are deploying our full suite of capabilities, including eCOA, eConsent, and home research nurses on this study to significantly reduce the travel burden on these patients who have significant mobility challenges. Finally, our overall R&DS business continues to build on its strong momentum with over $2.4 billion of net new business, including pass-throughs, and it set a record for quarterly service bookings, achieving over $1.9 billion of service bookings for the first time ever. This resulted in a fourth quarter contracted net book-to-bill ratio of 1.36 excluding pass-throughs and 1.24, including pass-throughs. For the calendar year, we delivered over $10 billion of total net new bookings for the first time ever, an increase of 14.6% compared to 2020. This led to an LTM contracted net book-to-bill ratio of 1.35 excluding pass-throughs and 1.34 including pass-throughs. Our contracted backlog in R&DS, including pass-throughs, grew 10.2% year-over-year to a record $24.8 billion as of December 31, 2021. And now I will turn it over to Ron for more details on our financial performance.\nRon Bruehlman: Thanks Ari and good morning everyone. Let's start by reviewing revenue. Fourth quarter revenue of $3.636 billion grew 10.2% on a reported basis and 11.6% at constant currency. You'll recall that last year's fourth quarter was a much tougher comparison than earlier quarters as we picked up incremental demand from mega vaccine studies in R&DS and government-related COVID work within TAS. Also, the core business began to rebound from the effects of COVID-19. In this year's fourth quarter, COVID-related revenues were approximately $325 million, down about 25% versus the fourth quarter of 2020. In our base business, that is excluding all COVID-related work from both 2021 and 2020, organic growth at constant currency was mid-teens. Technology & Analytics Solutions revenue for the fourth quarter was $1.496 billion, up 5% reported and 6.6% at constant currency. Year-over-year, TAS experienced just over 400 basis points of headwind due to a step-down in COVID-related work. Excluding all COVID-related work, organic growth at constant currency in TAS was high single digits. R&D Solutions fourth quarter revenue of $1.944 billion was up 15.4% at actual FX rates and 16.3% at constant currency. Excluding all COVID-related work, organic growth at constant currency and R&DS was approximately 25%. Contract Sales & Medical Solutions, or CSMS, fourth quarter revenue of $196 million grew 3.7% reported and 7.4% at constant currency. Excluding all COVID-related work, organic growth at constant currency in CSMS was low single digits. For the full year, revenue was $13.874 billion, growing at 22.1% reported and 21.1% at constant currency. COVID-related revenues in 2021 were approximately $1.8 billion, with just under 80% of that attributable to R&DS, about 20% due to TAS and the remainder in CSMS. The incremental COVID-related revenues in 2021 versus 2020 accounted for approximately half of our growth in 2021. Full year Technology & Analytics Solutions revenue was $5.534 billion, up 13.9% reported and 12.4% at constant currency. Excluding COVID-related work, organic growth at constant currency in TAS was high single digits. Full year revenue in R&D Solutions was $7.556 billion, growing at 31.2% reported and 30.4% at constant currency. Excluding COVID-related work, R&DS organic growth at constant currency for both total revenue and services revenue was low double digits. Full year CSMS revenue was $784 million, representing 5.8% growth on a reported basis and 5.7% at constant currency. And excluding COVID-related work, organic growth at constant currency in CSMS was low single digits. Now moving down to P&L. Adjusted EBITDA was $828 million for the fourth quarter, which was 12.7% growth on a reported basis. Full year adjusted EBITDA was $3.022 billion, up 26.8% year-over-year on a reported basis. Fourth quarter GAAP net income was $318 million and GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.63. Full year GAAP net income was $966 million or $4.95 of earnings per diluted share. Adjusted net income was $496 million for the fourth quarter, up 20.7% year-over-year and adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 20.9% to $2.55. For the full year, adjusted net income was $1.760 billion or $9.03 per share, up 41%. Now as already reviewed, R&D Solutions delivered another outstanding quarter of net new business. R&DS backlog now stands at a record $24.8 billion, an increase of 10.2% year-over-year. Full year 2021 net new bookings, including pass-throughs, rose to over $10 billion for the first time, that's 14.6% growth compared to 2020. Okay. Let's move to the balance sheet now. Cash flow was again quite strong in the quarter. Cash flow from operations was $692 million and CapEx was $184 million, which resulted in free cash flow of $508 million. This brought our free cash flow for the full year to a record $2.3 billion, up 70% versus the prior year. At December 31, cash and cash equivalents totaled $1.366 billion and gross debt was $12.125 billion, resulting in net debt of $10.759 billion. Our net leverage ratio at December 31 was 3.56 times trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA. Now it's worth highlighting that our improved free cash flow over the last two years allowed us to deploy approximately $4.5 billion of capital to internal investments, acquisitions and share repurchase, while at the same time, we were able to reduce our net leverage ratio from a high of 4.8 times in Q2 2020, which you'll recall was the height of the pandemic to nearly 3.5 times. And in doing this, we achieved our Vision 2022 net leverage ratio target of 3.5 times to four times a full year early. In the quarter, we repurchased $174 million of our shares, which resulted in full year share repurchase of $395 million, and we ended the year with 195 million fully diluted shares outstanding and $523 million of share repurchase authorization remaining under our existing program. Now last week, our Board of Directors approved a $2 billion increase to our share repurchase authorization, which increases our remaining authorization to just over $2.5 billion. Now let's turn to the guidance, as you saw we\u2019re reaffirming the full year 2022 revenue guidance that we issued at our analyst and investor conference in November. And in maintaining this guidance, we actually absorbed a $70 million revenue headwind from FX since we initially guided in November. Now additionally, we're raising our full year 2022 profit guidance versus what we provided you in November. So to summarize the overall guidance for the full year, we expect revenue to be between $14.700 billion and $15 billion, which represent year-over-year growth of 7.1% to 9.2% at constant currency and 6% to 8.1% on a reported basis compared to 2021. Now we now expect adjusted EBITDA to be between $3.330 billion and $3.405 billion representing year-over-year growth of 10.2% to 12.7%. And we also now expect adjusted diluted EPS to be between $9.95 and $10.25, which represents year-over-year growth of 10.2% to 13.5%. Now our full year 2022 guidance assumes at December 31, 2021 foreign currency exchange rates remain in fact, for the balance of the year. Now compared to the prior year, I should mention FX is now a headwind of 110 basis points to our full year revenue growth and our projected revenue growth includes a little bit over 100 basis points of contribution from M&A activity. Now with our analyst and investor conference in November, we told you to anticipate that our COVID-related revenue will step down by approximately $1 billion in 2022, but will more than compensate for that headwind with strong growth in our base business. And let me give you some additional detail around this that I think will be helpful. Excluding COVID-related revenue, the FX headwind and the contribution of acquisitions, our total company revenue guidance implies organic growth at constant currency in the low to mid-teens. At the segment level, we anticipate full year Technology & Analytics Solutions revenue growth of between 5% and 7%. Excluding COVID-related work, we expect organic revenue growth at constant currency in TAS to be in the high single digits. Research & Development Solutions revenue growth is expected to be between 8% and 10%. Excluding COVID-related work, we expect organic revenue growth at constant currency in R&DS to be in the upper teens. And finally, Contract Sales & Medical Solutions revenue was anticipated to be down about 2%, but excluding COVID-related work, we expect organic revenue growth at constant currency in CSMS to be in the low single digits.  Let's move to the first quarter now. As you all know, the first quarter of last year marked a continued rebound in our base business after the 2020 pandemic-related decline. In addition, Q1 and Q2 of last year represented our peak COVID-related revenues. As a result of this, the first half of the year will have the most challenging year-over-year compares. For the first quarter, our revenue is expected to be between $3.515 billion and $3.575 billion, representing growth of 4.8% to 6.6% on a constant currency basis and 3.1% to 4.9% on a reported basis. Now excluding COVID-related work, we expect organic revenue growth at constant currency to be in the mid-teens. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $800 million and $815 million, up 7.5% to 9.5%. And finally, adjusted diluted EPS is expected to be between $2.40 and $2.46, growing 10.1% to 12.8%. So to summarize, we delivered very strong fourth quarter results on both the top and bottom line against what was also a very strong fourth quarter of 2020. R&DS recorded its largest ever quarter of service bookings and for the first time, had over $10 billion of total net new bookings in a year. Our contracted backlog improved to a record of nearly $25 billion, up over 10% year-over-year. We delivered another strong quarter of free cash flow, bringing the full year to a record $2.3 billion. We closed 2021 with net leverage of 3.6 x trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA. Our Board approved a $2 billion increase to our share repurchase authorization. And finally, we're reaffirming the full year of 2022 guidance that we provided in November for revenue, and we're raising our adjusted EBITDA and adjusted diluted EPS guidance. And with that, let me turn it back over to the operator for questions and answers.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from Jack Meehan with Nephron Research.\nJack Meehan: Thank you and good morning. Wanted to talk a little bit more about COVID and I appreciate all the color you gave, Ron, during the prepared remarks on this. So at the Analyst Day, you talked about $1 billion of COVID tapering this year, there was 1.8 in 2021. Can you talk about the balance of the COVID work and just how you feel about the duration of COVID kind of over the next few years? Do you think there's some aspect that might prove stickier in TAS or some ongoing work in R&DS? Just any color there would be great.\nRon Bruehlman: Yes. Look, we do have a balance of COVID work, obviously. That's going to continue to burn off over the next two years. I think it will be a gradual decline during the course of 2022, but it's going to continue on into 2023. Yes, it's hard to foresee, Jack, how much additional COVID work there might be. We've all been surprised by the ups and downs of the pandemic and so forth. So it's certainly possible there could be more right now. We're facing our projections on what we currently have in the backlog, and we'll see where it goes from there and see what other work might come along.\nAri Bousbib: Yes. Jack, I mean, this is exactly right. And I -- all we can do is look at the situation today. If anything -- if we've learned anything about this pandemic is we just can't predict the evolution. So we do have in our RFP pipeline, especially on the R&DS side, request for proposals to assist in new therapies to address COVID, there are even large top 10 pharmas that we are talking to about potential therapeutics. So I do anticipate there will be some residual amount of COVID work ongoing. But unless things change dramatically based on the picture today, it's just going to gradually taper down -- that's what we have here through 2023 and maybe beginning of 2024. Unless something else happens, which no one here hopes for. But that's what we have. It's all largely based on burning off the world, both commercial and clinical.\nJack Meehan: Great. And then just as a follow-up, it would be great to get your latest thinking on labor and maybe wage inflation? What is -- how has your view changed at all related to when you initially gave guidance around just wage inflation and the impact that might have on the forecast for 2022?\nAri Bousbib: Yes. I mean, look, that's a good question. That's the single most important -- operational challenge we have is people management. I mean look, it's wonderful to be the leader in this space and to have such -- a $25 billion backlog to execute and strong commercial demand as well. And the result of that is we need a lot of people, even though technology is gradually taking over more and more of the work that we deliver, but we still need a lot of people. And at 80,000 people, we know we have to recruit many thousands more this coming year. We have attrition, which is an issue really for everybody. The great resignation is affecting us as well, post-pandemic. We are -- we've become -- and that's the price of our success. I might say, we have become an academy company, a lot of people recruit talent from IQVIA. But look, we are adjusting to this. We're creating all kinds of flexible work arrangements, compensation arrangements, loyalty building programs, training programs, back-to-work, the future of work, which is an initiative that we have to redefine roles and what's expected from our employees. So, we've been very innovative in terms of our workspace, really working on a lot of multiple fronts. With respect to the numbers and how it affects our numbers, obviously, it's challenging when you have to raise compensation costs and generally people management costs. However, I would point to you that our margins, our adjusted EBITDA margins has continued to grow. I mean in fact, they've been growing more than -- and they are expected to grow more than ever before. We -- and the reason for that is we are finally getting the leverage on the massive restructuring and cost improvement initiatives that we launched immediately post-merger. And we're now getting the benefit of that leverage and that's offsetting -- more than offsetting the wage inflation headwinds. Again, I'd point to the growth of our profit numbers relative to the growth of our revenue numbers, and you see that we significantly materially raised -- grow our profit higher than -- materially higher than our revenue growth, which implies significant margin growth. Ron?\nRon Bruehlman: Yes. And also I would say, Jack, that we do have the ability in a lot of instances to raise prices to adjust prices. We have some provisions for improvement in our MSA agreements. We also have some short-cycle businesses. So, wherever we have the ability to adjust prices, we are doing so. And we're getting some offset there as well.\nJack Meehan: Great. Thank you guys.\nOperator: Your next question is from Eric Coldwell with Baird.\nEric Coldwell: Thank you. Good morning. So, probably the number one topic here recently has been the biotech funding environment and any potential knock-on impacts to the group. Your competitor, who also reported at the same time this morning and is very exposed to pre-commercial biotech, said their RFP volumes were down 10% in the fourth quarter, down 25% in January. But that they haven't seen any cancellations or delays so far, no business impact so far. I'm curious if you could help us by, one, talking about your mix of pre-commercial biotech as a percent of R&D backlog or bookings? And two, talk about what you're seeing in real-time in terms of business demand bookings, other related activity in that pre-commercial biotech space? That would be very helpful. Thank you.\nAri Bousbib: Yes. Thanks, Eric. Well, as you can imagine, we track these numbers pretty tightly. And as you know, many definitions of what biotech funding and so on. We are not seeing in the actual RFP pipeline any changes versus what has been. As you know, a very strong demand environment for the EVP segment in general. In terms of percent of our bookings, what do we give you, we don't have the backlog, but we have the bookings. Let me see -- I have got a few numbers here for you. I think, look, in terms of the actual bookings, large pharma still represents the majority, right, a little bit over half. Is that correct?\nRon Bruehlman: That's correct.\nAri Bousbib: Right. And then we -- maybe the midsize is perhaps about somewhere around 10-ish percent -- \nRon Bruehlman: Yes.\nAri Bousbib:  -- of our bookings. And the rest, so again, I'd say 35% plus is EBP. And that has been the case -- again, it fluctuates, as you can imagine, these things -- these numbers go up and down. Now if you compare where we are here in terms of the pipe of the RFP, of flow, okay? It still continues to grow double digits in dollars and volume. I mean, it's really, really high, more than double digits. I don't know if we can give you the numbers, but the pipeline is very, very strong. I mean, actually, it's about -- our pipeline is about equal to our backlog as we speak right now, okay? And again, as I said before, COVID is basically gone more or less. It's very, very tiny percentage of the total pipeline here. A lot of it is oncology, which is up more than 20%, the CNS, more than 33% up. Agree, across therapy categories, we are seeing very good EBIT growth in the pipeline. I'm talking now, okay, not the book. I'm talking the pipeline, to your question, what do we see going forward, okay, which would be normally a line indicator of the funding. And we see that EBP in the pipeline actually represents a majority of our pipeline right now. So, again, we don't see any significant changes. Look, I wouldn't -- yes, it's true. For example, January was lower -- the month of January was lower than of EBP funding, but I wouldn't extrapolate from one month and -- or from one quarter for that matter. As you know, generally, the levels of EBP funding are very, very high. I mean, we are -- we must be in the top three years ever in terms of funding. So, okay, maybe that this year will be a little lower than last year, which, again, these were record years. We're talking about orders of magnitude greater in terms of multiples of the funding, if you just go back three, four, five, six years. So, yes, I mean, the step-down in funding would -- doesn't concern, as we continue to see very, very good, both bookings and even higher numbers in the pipeline.\nEric Coldwell: Hey, Ari, if I could just do one follow-up. The -- could you remind everyone what your definition of EBP, the emerging biopharma, what your technical definition is, what it takes for a client to fit into that category versus some of the other?\nAri Bousbib: Well, we look at how much the spend in terms of clinical development, of R&D spend. Okay.\nEric Coldwell: Some of that client base -- \nAri Bousbib: So below that number -- I'm sorry?\nEric Coldwell: Go ahead. I was just going to say some of that client base would actually be companies that have a commercial pipeline, they wouldn\u2019t have these -- ?\nAri Bousbib: Yes, yes. That's correct. That encompasses what you might call small pharma as well that has commercialized products, in addition to commercial.\nRon Bruehlman: Let's say, if a company spends less than a couple of hundred million, I don't know exactly the number and how we segment it, we have, as you know, tons of analytics and segmentation definitions. But broadly speaking, a company that spends less than a couple of hundred million dollars in a given year in its R&D budget, for us is an EBP, that's just one definition. We've got others also we triangulate, as you can imagine. But that's one definition that I happen to like.\nEric Coldwell: All right. Last one. If you had to guess and maybe you're not willing to do so, but if you had to guess just off the cuff, not holding your feet to the fire. Would 10% of your backlog be pre-commercial biotech? 20%?\nAri Bousbib: I don't know if I can give you these numbers. But you know what, why don't we do this? Why don't we give us on follow-up questions, we'll try to give you a little bit more clarity or range on what's in the backlog. We will try to that. I'll ask the finance team here to -- I'll try to prevail and use my executive privilege to prepare all these guys. But I don't know at this point, you're putting me on the spot here. I don't know exactly what I'm going to give you but I will give you something.\nRon Bruehlman: Eric, it's helpful to give you a partial answer to that and say the last two years, large pharma orders had been -- bookings have been slightly over 50% of our bookings. So that gives you at least to start at what you're looking at anyway.\nEric Coldwell: Right. Yeah, correct. All right. Well, look, I appreciate it, and I thought you had a great quarter. So good job, keep it up and look forward to the rest of the call. Thanks so much.\nAri Bousbib: Well, thank you, Eric. Usually, you tell this at the beginning of the question, so I was concerned, but thanks for saying it again.\nEric Coldwell: All right. It's all good.\nAri Bousbib: All right. Next question.\nOperator: Your next question is from Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan.\nTycho Peterson: Hey thanks. Ari, given that most of the questions we're getting are on RFPs and wage inflation, I want to go back to the wage inflation discussion and EBITDA margins because it is notably you're guiding for expansion here. You talked about benefits from the original merger and integration plan. You talked about digitization and maybe some price increases. But can you maybe just give us a little bit more color on how you're planning to drive margin expansion in this environment this year? Are you pulling forward any additional cost actions?\nAri Bousbib: No. Not at all, not at all. As I said before, just to make myself clear again, the -- largely, the main driver of our margin expansion is simply leveraging the benefit of all the cost actions that we took post merger, okay? You will recall -- go back and look at the numbers; we have significant restructuring amounts every year, which obviously affected our cash flow. And we are now benefiting and leveraging those overhead optimization, outsourcing actions, consolidation of infrastructure, merging of IT systems, et cetera, et cetera. Now in addition to this, part of the reason you see margin expansion actually probably accelerate in 2022 versus 2021 in a quite significant way, I think some of it is what I just said and some of it is a mix benefit. I want to remind everyone that the COVID related work, which was quite significant portion over the past year or two, was at a lower margin than we would otherwise have our base business at, okay? Last of it was government work, whether it's on the commercial side, very small margins or on the R&D side, where we also contributed to the global effort to address the pandemic by pricing our COVID-related clinical trials not at the same level as we would otherwise have for traditional work. And so in terms of mix, as this COVID-related work gradually tapers down and the base business continues to grow as a proportion of the total, then of course, you've got a benefit on the margin side. I might add further that the amount of pass-throughs on COVID-related work was unusually high, vaccine trials and came also earlier on than it would under normal trial timelines. So the combination of lower margin service margins to start with, to us, a higher proportion -- an unusually high proportion of pass-throughs, all of that are contributed to be to an adverse impact, mix impact on our margins. As this work gradually tapers down, then obviously, the mix impact our margins is going to be more favorable. And that's the other reason you see an acceleration of our margin growth.\nTycho Peterson: Okay. That's helpful. And then a follow-up on APAC. Your long-term guidance is 11% to 13% growth through 2025. Obviously, within China, there's been a lot of noise, biologics getting placed in the unverified list. They're CDMO, you're a CRO, so very different markets. But can you just talk on your view on China here in the near-term? And does any of this kind of noise potentially benefit you?\nAri Bousbib: Well, I mean, I don't know if we disclosed this, but we've got a couple of $100 million business in China. It's been growing double-digits over the last few years. We have a fully owned CRO subsidiary in addition to IQVIA, we have a core IQVIA business, and we've got a fully owned CRO subsidiary that's called Punto [ph], which is designed for local Chinese regulatory requirements and largely caters to the local market, the local biotechs, whilst IQVIA parent deals with the work of multinational sponsors for their piece of the clinical trial in China, when it exists. It's a unique setup, which in combination with our global CRO platform allows us to capture higher growth opportunities with China. Again, we feel good about our capabilities in this market and about our prospects to continue this growth trend. Look, there are local CROs that are emerging that are formidable competitors that are gaining share. There are hundreds literally of outfits in China. As you know, I want -- I don't need to be able to pull, but China is a complex market. There are lots of factors external to our industry that can affect how market dynamics play out. But I'm -- we're not worried, we're not concerned. We are continuing to invest as required. We have a good market position and it's a small piece of our total business.\nTycho Peterson: Okay. One last quick one before I hop off. On OCE on the retention, you talked about 350 clients using one or more. Your biggest competitor did, I think, talked about winning back Roche. Are you able to comment on that at all?\nAri Bousbib: Anyone?\nRon Bruehlman: No. Look, we don't comment on individual customers and dynamics with individual customers. And as the Roche win is a very big win and the large majority of that is outside of the U.S., I think about 90% or so.\nAri Bousbib: Yes, 90% of the world -- of the project is outside the US. So I think the other, an independent subsidiary...\nRon Bruehlman: Yes.\nAri Bousbib: Yes, that has its own program. But yes, no -- Roche has reaffirmed their commitment and is looking to accelerate the rollout actually after the successful implementations we had in several regions, plus they've also expressed interest in purchasing other modules. So we're very pleased with our collaboration with this client. But beyond that, we're not going to comment. Yes.\nRon Bruehlman: Next question.\nOperator: Your next question is from John Kreger with William Blair.\nJohn Kreger: Hi, thanks very much. I wanted to come back to -- you guys made the comment that you expect your R&DS revenue growth this year, I think, to be in the upper teens if you ignore COVID work, which is a very impressive number. Just curious, what do you think that business can do longer term?\nNick Childs: Longer-term growth. Yes, I think -- look, I think that the double-digit growth was a marker that we have achieved and strive to achieve. If you remember at the beginning of the merger, the growth was very low in the single digits. So we think the continued acceleration will continue and certainly got double-digit sort of mark in the longer term is something that we're looking forward to maintain that acceleration.\nAri Bousbib: Yes. I mean, look at our investor conference, we gave you even '25 targets for our company as a whole. And we said that the company as a whole will grow 10% to 12% annually, which presumably from a $15 billion base. So R&DS has to be growing into double digits in order to achieve that. And so that's kind of where we -- you know we view guidance or so by segment for '25? Do you have those numbers? While the team here is bringing this up. But again, I call your attention -- I bring your attention what we gave as a longer-term growth trend just a couple of months ago in November in New York, when we were all together in-person, and we gave you long-term goals and growth trends and all of which represented a significant acceleration versus what we've had over the '19 to '22...\nNick Childs: Strong double digits at the investor conference.\nAri Bousbib: Yes, strong double digits. Yes. So that's the long-term trend of the business. And again, I point to you that these are large-scale businesses.\nJohn Kreger: Yes, absolutely. Very, very impressive. And a quick follow-up, Ron, I think this one is probably best for you. In the quarter, can you remind us what the acquisition contribution was to growth? And did you buy anything notable in the fourth quarter?\nRon Bruehlman: Yes. The acquisition contribution to the growth was relatively minimal. It was a little over 150 basis points -- we made a couple of acquisitions in the quarter. The largest of which was a payer analytics company in Europe, but nothing terribly large.\nJohn Kreger: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from Shlomo Rosenbaum from Stifel.\nShlomo Rosenbaum: Hi. Good morning. Thank you. Yes, Ari, can you talk a little bit about the breakdown of the upper single-digit revenue growth in TAS when you exclude COVID? What's driving the growth there? Is it real world evidence? Is it technology? And I know the information, part of the business doesn't grow much at all. So maybe you can just help us with the composition and what are some of the really big drivers there.\nAri Bousbib: Yes. Thank you, Shlomo. What I -- we've done this before. We've told you what it's comprised of. And if you look at TAS, I mean, I'd like to look at it in terms of three tiers. You've got the basic core information solutions, which is the old IMS business, essentially the data. And that's about, I'm going to say, 30% of the business, give or take. And that's a flattish growth rate business, okay? No -- and that's strategic. That's the way we do it. We just sell the data with very little price increases. It's a flattish business. Then you've got the moderately growing piece of the business, which is, let's call it, another quarter at this point, maybe a-quarter of the business that's analytics, consulting various services. And that grows double digits now. It's been growing strong double digits in the past two, three years, used to grow mid to high single digits. Now it's growing low to mid-double digits the past few years.\nRon Bruehlman: Low teens.\nAri Bousbib: Yes, low teens. Yes. And then you've got the higher growth businesses. And that's the real world and of course, the technology businesses, which will grow good mid-teens. And that's about -- when it was to the balance, was like at 45% of the business today. Obviously, we used to say it's a-third, a-third, a-third. Now, obviously, because real world, the fastest-growing piece of TAS, real world and technology are growing at a much faster rate. So they now represent already 45% of the total. And so, if you do the math, that should get you to high single digits underlying growth for the segment.\nShlomo Rosenbaum: Okay, great. Thank you. And then, maybe just for Ron. How much is the incremental FX headwinds impacting EBITDA and EPS guidance for 2022? You talked about absorbing the $70 million of revenue. If I were to normalize, how much was that impacting the guidance and just maybe give us a little bit of color on that.\nRon Bruehlman: Well, we offset the entire $70 million in maintaining our revenue guidance. So, I mean, another way of looking at it, as we raised our constant currency revenue guidance by $70 million. I'm not sure I understand your question beyond that. EBITDA?\nShlomo Rosenbaum: If it\u2019s the EBITDA. Yes. EBITDA, you went up like $10 million on each side and EPS of like $0.05 in each side \u2013 is that sort of revenue...\nRon Bruehlman: Yes, EBITDA typically doesn't have a big -- an FX typically doesn't have a big impact on our EBITDA. We've had a little bit of negative drag from FX, not like we did with the revenue that we absorbed in our numbers. And we have more offsets on the EBITDA side than we do on the revenue side, so you don't see as much impact there.\nShlomo Rosenbaum: Okay. Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from Patrick Donnelly with Citi.\nPatrick Donnelly: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking questions. Maybe just a follow-up on the M&A question earlier. Can you just talk a little bit about the outlook? Obviously, cash flow really strong, leverage is pretty reasonable at 3.6 times. Are you seeing more activity in the pipeline given some of the volatility in the public markets, or does that take a little bit longer to play a role in kind of rattling out the potential sellers?\nAri Bousbib: Well, that's a good question. Look, we always -- obviously, we're always looking and even if you weren't looking, people call us. There are lots of assets that are in the market. We haven't been that active over the past couple of years in terms of numbers of acquisitions. We've done a little bit more in dollars this year, largely driven by our largest ever deal, which was simply the consolidation of our lab business. We bought 40% that we didn't own from Q\u00b2 -- I'm sorry, from Quest, that was our Q\u00b2 lab joint venture, and we paid, I think, $760 million for that and we need a couple of more larger acquisitions. As you know, the multiple valuations in this space where we operate in the healthcare, technology, information space, the multiples that are really very high, and the reason for that is that private equity essentially is trading those assets from one private equity firm to another. And so they keep bumping up the valuations. And we look at these assets, but we are always going to continue to be very reasonable and conservative. If we see value that we can create, then we will certainly look at these assets. But no major changes versus what you have seen us do before. We will be opportunistic if there are things -- assets that we would like to own, we will make a reasonable bids, and we won't get excited by what we have told the market is. Plus I've got good balancing CFO here with saying that we have healthy discussions with the business heads. And again, I hope that you could see from our history that our capital deployment has been prudent. We've been willing to have more debt and we may be willing to have more debt if necessary because we believe our business model is very different. Leverage for us at the peak of the pandemic was 4.8. And as a company or even if you go back the legacy companies, we believe with leverage ratios that were even six times. And the reasons for why we were willing to live with those leverage ratios is simply because our business profile, our cash flow generation model, our business visibility profile where a vast majority of our business is already booked early in the year, both commercial and clinical, all of that makes us comfortable that we can live with those, especially in an environment where I know there's a lot of talk about rising rates. And I would remind you that the bulk of our debt is at essentially fixed rates largely because of hedges and the alignment between our euro and debt and euro profits and dollars versus dollar profit. So all of that makes us comfortable, rates continue to be at historic lows. So we will do what's right for the business. We will allocate capital to first, internal investments; secondly, to acquisitions; then thirdly, to share repurchase, and you will see us go back and forth depending on opportunities. But again, we intend to try to continue to reduce debt as is prudent within the limits of what makes sense from a management standpoint, it doesn't make sense to eliminate our debt at the current rates. I mean, we would view that as a negligence on our part. So that's, I guess, the best answer I can give to your question. Thank you very much. We're done?\nPatrick Donnelly: Yes. Thanks Ari. And if I could just squeeze in one follow-up, if you have a minute. I just want to follow-up on the funding backdrop. Obviously, you've talked a little bit about the R&DS strength going out multiple years, double-digit growth. I guess when you think about the funding, I mean, it seems like you were never underwriting the type of record strength we saw last year in order to hit those numbers. If we did see some prolonged softness in the funding environment relative to last year's levels, it's still more than sufficient to support that growth outlook, I guess I just want to make sure that's the way you're framing it.\nAri Bousbib: I cannot be -- I cannot overemphasize that we are not seeing that translate into our sales pipeline. I mean again, I gave you some numbers earlier in biotech, I'm not giving you the numbers here because I don't know if I should give them to you or not, but the vast -- the majority, a big majority of the RFP dollar pipeline and numbers, volume and dollars is actually EBP. So we are not seeing any impact from potential slowdown of the funding into our pipeline, not at all. And the pipeline is at record high levels. So again, we -- it won't affect us one bit. And by the way, again, I'm not seeing that happening. We talk to EBP all the time.\nPatrick Donnelly: That\u2019s encouraging to hear. Thanks.\nAri Bousbib: Okay. Thank you.\nNick Childs: Thank you. That's going to be our last question. So thank you for taking the time to join us today. We look forward to speaking again next quarter. Myself and the team will be available for any follow-up questions you might have in the rest of the day. Thanks.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Ron Bruehlman",
            "content": "Thanks Ari and good morning everyone. Let's start by reviewing revenue. Fourth quarter revenue of $3.636 billion grew 10.2% on a reported basis and 11.6% at constant currency. You'll recall that last year's fourth quarter was a much tougher comparison than earlier quarters as we picked up incremental demand from mega vaccine studies in R&DS and government-related COVID work within TAS. Also, the core business began to rebound from the effects of COVID-19. In this year's fourth quarter, COVID-related revenues were approximately $325 million, down about 25% versus the fourth quarter of 2020. In our base business, that is excluding all COVID-related work from both 2021 and 2020, organic growth at constant currency was mid-teens. Technology & Analytics Solutions revenue for the fourth quarter was $1.496 billion, up 5% reported and 6.6% at constant currency. Year-over-year, TAS experienced just over 400 basis points of headwind due to a step-down in COVID-related work. Excluding all COVID-related work, organic growth at constant currency in TAS was high single digits. R&D Solutions fourth quarter revenue of $1.944 billion was up 15.4% at actual FX rates and 16.3% at constant currency. Excluding all COVID-related work, organic growth at constant currency and R&DS was approximately 25%. Contract Sales & Medical Solutions, or CSMS, fourth quarter revenue of $196 million grew 3.7% reported and 7.4% at constant currency. Excluding all COVID-related work, organic growth at constant currency in CSMS was low single digits. For the full year, revenue was $13.874 billion, growing at 22.1% reported and 21.1% at constant currency. COVID-related revenues in 2021 were approximately $1.8 billion, with just under 80% of that attributable to R&DS, about 20% due to TAS and the remainder in CSMS. The incremental COVID-related revenues in 2021 versus 2020 accounted for approximately half of our growth in 2021. Full year Technology & Analytics Solutions revenue was $5.534 billion, up 13.9% reported and 12.4% at constant currency. Excluding COVID-related work, organic growth at constant currency in TAS was high single digits. Full year revenue in R&D Solutions was $7.556 billion, growing at 31.2% reported and 30.4% at constant currency. Excluding COVID-related work, R&DS organic growth at constant currency for both total revenue and services revenue was low double digits. Full year CSMS revenue was $784 million, representing 5.8% growth on a reported basis and 5.7% at constant currency. And excluding COVID-related work, organic growth at constant currency in CSMS was low single digits. Now moving down to P&L. Adjusted EBITDA was $828 million for the fourth quarter, which was 12.7% growth on a reported basis. Full year adjusted EBITDA was $3.022 billion, up 26.8% year-over-year on a reported basis. Fourth quarter GAAP net income was $318 million and GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.63. Full year GAAP net income was $966 million or $4.95 of earnings per diluted share. Adjusted net income was $496 million for the fourth quarter, up 20.7% year-over-year and adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 20.9% to $2.55. For the full year, adjusted net income was $1.760 billion or $9.03 per share, up 41%. Now as already reviewed, R&D Solutions delivered another outstanding quarter of net new business. R&DS backlog now stands at a record $24.8 billion, an increase of 10.2% year-over-year. Full year 2021 net new bookings, including pass-throughs, rose to over $10 billion for the first time, that's 14.6% growth compared to 2020. Okay. Let's move to the balance sheet now. Cash flow was again quite strong in the quarter. Cash flow from operations was $692 million and CapEx was $184 million, which resulted in free cash flow of $508 million. This brought our free cash flow for the full year to a record $2.3 billion, up 70% versus the prior year. At December 31, cash and cash equivalents totaled $1.366 billion and gross debt was $12.125 billion, resulting in net debt of $10.759 billion. Our net leverage ratio at December 31 was 3.56 times trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA. Now it's worth highlighting that our improved free cash flow over the last two years allowed us to deploy approximately $4.5 billion of capital to internal investments, acquisitions and share repurchase, while at the same time, we were able to reduce our net leverage ratio from a high of 4.8 times in Q2 2020, which you'll recall was the height of the pandemic to nearly 3.5 times. And in doing this, we achieved our Vision 2022 net leverage ratio target of 3.5 times to four times a full year early. In the quarter, we repurchased $174 million of our shares, which resulted in full year share repurchase of $395 million, and we ended the year with 195 million fully diluted shares outstanding and $523 million of share repurchase authorization remaining under our existing program. Now last week, our Board of Directors approved a $2 billion increase to our share repurchase authorization, which increases our remaining authorization to just over $2.5 billion. Now let's turn to the guidance, as you saw we're reaffirming the full year 2022 revenue guidance that we issued at our analyst and investor conference in November. And in maintaining this guidance, we actually absorbed a $70 million revenue headwind from FX since we initially guided in November. Now additionally, we're raising our full year 2022 profit guidance versus what we provided you in November. So to summarize the overall guidance for the full year, we expect revenue to be between $14.700 billion and $15 billion, which represent year-over-year growth of 7.1% to 9.2% at constant currency and 6% to 8.1% on a reported basis compared to 2021. Now we now expect adjusted EBITDA to be between $3.330 billion and $3.405 billion representing year-over-year growth of 10.2% to 12.7%. And we also now expect adjusted diluted EPS to be between $9.95 and $10.25, which represents year-over-year growth of 10.2% to 13.5%. Now our full year 2022 guidance assumes at December 31, 2021 foreign currency exchange rates remain in fact, for the balance of the year. Now compared to the prior year, I should mention FX is now a headwind of 110 basis points to our full year revenue growth and our projected revenue growth includes a little bit over 100 basis points of contribution from M&A activity. Now with our analyst and investor conference in November, we told you to anticipate that our COVID-related revenue will step down by approximately $1 billion in 2022, but will more than compensate for that headwind with strong growth in our base business. And let me give you some additional detail around this that I think will be helpful. Excluding COVID-related revenue, the FX headwind and the contribution of acquisitions, our total company revenue guidance implies organic growth at constant currency in the low to mid-teens. At the segment level, we anticipate full year Technology & Analytics Solutions revenue growth of between 5% and 7%. Excluding COVID-related work, we expect organic revenue growth at constant currency in TAS to be in the high single digits. Research & Development Solutions revenue growth is expected to be between 8% and 10%. Excluding COVID-related work, we expect organic revenue growth at constant currency in R&DS to be in the upper teens. And finally, Contract Sales & Medical Solutions revenue was anticipated to be down about 2%, but excluding COVID-related work, we expect organic revenue growth at constant currency in CSMS to be in the low single digits.  Let's move to the first quarter now. As you all know, the first quarter of last year marked a continued rebound in our base business after the 2020 pandemic-related decline. In addition, Q1 and Q2 of last year represented our peak COVID-related revenues. As a result of this, the first half of the year will have the most challenging year-over-year compares. For the first quarter, our revenue is expected to be between $3.515 billion and $3.575 billion, representing growth of 4.8% to 6.6% on a constant currency basis and 3.1% to 4.9% on a reported basis. Now excluding COVID-related work, we expect organic revenue growth at constant currency to be in the mid-teens. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $800 million and $815 million, up 7.5% to 9.5%. And finally, adjusted diluted EPS is expected to be between $2.40 and $2.46, growing 10.1% to 12.8%. So to summarize, we delivered very strong fourth quarter results on both the top and bottom line against what was also a very strong fourth quarter of 2020. R&DS recorded its largest ever quarter of service bookings and for the first time, had over $10 billion of total net new bookings in a year. Our contracted backlog improved to a record of nearly $25 billion, up over 10% year-over-year. We delivered another strong quarter of free cash flow, bringing the full year to a record $2.3 billion. We closed 2021 with net leverage of 3.6 x trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA. Our Board approved a $2 billion increase to our share repurchase authorization. And finally, we're reaffirming the full year of 2022 guidance that we provided in November for revenue, and we're raising our adjusted EBITDA and adjusted diluted EPS guidance. And with that, let me turn it back over to the operator for questions and answers. Yes. Look, we do have a balance of COVID work, obviously. That's going to continue to burn off over the next two years. I think it will be a gradual decline during the course of 2022, but it's going to continue on into 2023. Yes, it's hard to foresee, Jack, how much additional COVID work there might be. We've all been surprised by the ups and downs of the pandemic and so forth. So it's certainly possible there could be more right now. We're facing our projections on what we currently have in the backlog, and we'll see where it goes from there and see what other work might come along. Yes. And also I would say, Jack, that we do have the ability in a lot of instances to raise prices to adjust prices. We have some provisions for improvement in our MSA agreements. We also have some short-cycle businesses. So, wherever we have the ability to adjust prices, we are doing so. And we're getting some offset there as well. That's correct. Yes. Let's say, if a company spends less than a couple of hundred million, I don't know exactly the number and how we segment it, we have, as you know, tons of analytics and segmentation definitions. But broadly speaking, a company that spends less than a couple of hundred million dollars in a given year in its R&D budget, for us is an EBP, that's just one definition. We've got others also we triangulate, as you can imagine. But that's one definition that I happen to like. Eric, it's helpful to give you a partial answer to that and say the last two years, large pharma orders had been -- bookings have been slightly over 50% of our bookings. So that gives you at least to start at what you're looking at anyway. No. Look, we don't comment on individual customers and dynamics with individual customers. And as the Roche win is a very big win and the large majority of that is outside of the U.S., I think about 90% or so. Yes. Next question. Yes. The acquisition contribution to the growth was relatively minimal. It was a little over 150 basis points -- we made a couple of acquisitions in the quarter. The largest of which was a payer analytics company in Europe, but nothing terribly large. Low teens. Well, we offset the entire $70 million in maintaining our revenue guidance. So, I mean, another way of looking at it, as we raised our constant currency revenue guidance by $70 million. I'm not sure I understand your question beyond that. EBITDA? Yes, EBITDA typically doesn't have a big -- an FX typically doesn't have a big impact on our EBITDA. We've had a little bit of negative drag from FX, not like we did with the revenue that we absorbed in our numbers. And we have more offsets on the EBITDA side than we do on the revenue side, so you don't see as much impact there."

            "content": "Thank you, Nick and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining today for our fourth quarter results. It was great to see many of you in person at our Analyst and Investor Conference in November. And as you will recall, we shared our expectations that we would meet or exceed our three-year Vision 2022 targets. We also laid out our plans to make 2022 yet another inflection point in our growth trajectory and further accelerate the company's growth rate in the next three phase -- three-year phase of our journey to 2025. The team highlighted the power of connected intelligence, which brings together IQVIA differentiated capabilities and drive our leadership position in the clinical and commercial markets. This underpins our new 20 x 2025 strategy, which alludes to our plans to achieve at least $20 billion of revenue by 2025. We're excited about this next phase of growth for IQVIA, and we are busy refining our strategies and action plans, and you will hear more about it as the year progresses. Two years -- two weeks ago, IQVIA was named to Fortune's list of the World's Most Admired Companies for the fifth consecutive year. Importantly, we earned a first place ranking within the health care, pharmacy and other services category for the first time. We ranked number one in the categories of innovation, capital deployment, global competitiveness, quality of product and services, and long-term investment value. I want to thank our nearly 80,000 employees worldwide for this recognition is a tribute to their innovation and drive. Turning now to our results. We ended 2021 on a high note, despite COVID-19's continued impact on many parts of the world. We delivered robust top and bottom line growth in the quarter, which, as you know, was against a much tougher year-over-year comparison than earlier in the year. These results reinforce our confidence that we will achieve our 2022 guidance. And, of course, it sets us up well to meet our ambitious 2025 targets. Let's review the fourth quarter. Revenue for the fourth quarter grew 10.2% on a reported basis and 11.6% at constant currency. The $62 million beat above the midpoint of our guidance range was driven by stronger operational performance across all three segments as well as higher pass-throughs, partially offset by FX headwinds. Compared to prior year and excluding COVID related work, our core businesses, meaning R&DS and TAS, grew mid-teens at constant currency on an organic basis. Ron will provide a lot more detail in his remarks, including additional COVID adjusted numbers for each segment. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA grew 12.7%, reflecting our revenue growth as well as ongoing productivity initiatives. The $27 million beat above the midpoint of our guidance range was entirely due to our operational performance. Fourth quarter adjusted diluted EPS of $2.55 grew 20.9%. That was $0.13 above the midpoint of our guidance, with the majority of the beat coming from the adjusted EBITDA drop-through. Let me now provide an update on the business. On the commercial side of the business, it was a strong year for new molecules and launches as the industry continued its recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic disruption. This year, 50 new molecules were approved by the FDA and 72 new commercial launches took place. IQVIA supported nearly 80% of launches by top 20 pharma and approximately 60% of all launches. This highlights our scale globally and across all customer segments in applying advanced technology and analytics capabilities to enhance launch planning, engagement and measurement. Overall, we've seen significant momentum and continued demand for our technology solutions. There are now over 3,000 clients who have adopted one or more of our technology platforms, including human data science cloud, orchestrated analytics, E360, Omnichannel Navigator, Engage and of course, Orchestrated Customer Engagement, or OCE. In fact, the footprint of our OCE platform itself has continued to grow, with over 350 clients having adopted one or more modules on the platform since launch. Early in 2021, we launched IQVIA Next Best Action, which is an AI-driven omni-channel customer engagement decision engine. Two top 20 pharma clients have successfully rolled out this intelligence engine to orchestrate customer engagements in over 30 countries and across more than 40 brands each. Two other top 20 pharmas are currently in the implementation phase. Another highlight in our TAS business has been the success of DMD Marketing Solutions, a leading provider of data and digital marketing solutions that help brands deliver personalized digital content to healthcare professionals. In the quarter, we entered into an enterprise agreement with a top 10 pharma clients to utilize DMD's advanced analytic capabilities to power omnichannel engagement across all eight of their brand franchises. To date, 18 of the top 20 have adopted at least one of DMD solutions. We're very excited for the future growth of this business within IQVIA. Real-world evidence and other highlights of the year, IQVIA continues to play a leading role in the use of secondary data to answer key questions for life science customers. In the fourth quarter, we won two large post-authorization safety studies in an autoimmune area with a top 10 pharma. These studies use existing healthcare data to observe patients over a period of 10 years to better understand long-term effects of the treatment. We were also recently awarded a disease registry project for an upcoming novel gene therapy. Here, we will recruit a broad population of patients with a specific disease to understand how they are currently managed in clinical practice. This information is vital to our life science sponsors to inform the design of subsequent clinical trials so they can target patient groups with the highest unmet need. Moving to clinical technology. We saw increased adoption of our Orchestrated Clinical Trials, OCT platform, which supports trial planning, site management, patient engagement, trial management and clinical data analytics. During the year, we added 90 new OCT clients, bringing the total to over 350 clients who have adopted one or more modules within our clinical technology suite since launch, including all of the top 10 and 18 of the top 20. Within OCT's digital patient suite this year, we secured three preferred provider partnerships with top 30 pharmaceutical clients to provide our interactive response technology, IRT capabilities, to support site operations across their entire clinical trial portfolios. This technology facilitates patient randomization to ensure protocol adherence and streamline site supply chain management to reduce drug wastage and to drive significant cost reductions. Our solution was awarded a top-ranking by industry leaders in a recent ISR report for randomization and chart supply management capabilities. We also saw increased demand for our industry-leading decentralized clinical trial offering. Approximately one-third of our active full-service clinical trials incorporate one or more of our DCT technology or services capabilities, and we expect this to continue to grow as the need for these capabilities in complex studies becomes more evident. For example, we are currently executing a full-service trial for treatment of multiple system atrophy, a severe degenerative neurological disorder affecting the body's involuntary functions. We are deploying our full suite of capabilities, including eCOA, eConsent, and home research nurses on this study to significantly reduce the travel burden on these patients who have significant mobility challenges. Finally, our overall R&DS business continues to build on its strong momentum with over $2.4 billion of net new business, including pass-throughs, and it set a record for quarterly service bookings, achieving over $1.9 billion of service bookings for the first time ever. This resulted in a fourth quarter contracted net book-to-bill ratio of 1.36 excluding pass-throughs and 1.24, including pass-throughs. For the calendar year, we delivered over $10 billion of total net new bookings for the first time ever, an increase of 14.6% compared to 2020. This led to an LTM contracted net book-to-bill ratio of 1.35 excluding pass-throughs and 1.34 including pass-throughs. Our contracted backlog in R&DS, including pass-throughs, grew 10.2% year-over-year to a record $24.8 billion as of December 31, 2021. And now I will turn it over to Ron for more details on our financial performance. Yes. Jack, I mean, this is exactly right. And I -- all we can do is look at the situation today. If anything -- if we've learned anything about this pandemic is we just can't predict the evolution. So we do have in our RFP pipeline, especially on the R&DS side, request for proposals to assist in new therapies to address COVID, there are even large top 10 pharmas that we are talking to about potential therapeutics. So I do anticipate there will be some residual amount of COVID work ongoing. But unless things change dramatically based on the picture today, it's just going to gradually taper down -- that's what we have here through 2023 and maybe beginning of 2024. Unless something else happens, which no one here hopes for. But that's what we have. It's all largely based on burning off the world, both commercial and clinical. Yes. I mean, look, that's a good question. That's the single most important -- operational challenge we have is people management. I mean look, it's wonderful to be the leader in this space and to have such -- a $25 billion backlog to execute and strong commercial demand as well. And the result of that is we need a lot of people, even though technology is gradually taking over more and more of the work that we deliver, but we still need a lot of people. And at 80,000 people, we know we have to recruit many thousands more this coming year. We have attrition, which is an issue really for everybody. The great resignation is affecting us as well, post-pandemic. We are -- we've become -- and that's the price of our success. I might say, we have become an academy company, a lot of people recruit talent from IQVIA. But look, we are adjusting to this. We're creating all kinds of flexible work arrangements, compensation arrangements, loyalty building programs, training programs, back-to-work, the future of work, which is an initiative that we have to redefine roles and what's expected from our employees. So, we've been very innovative in terms of our workspace, really working on a lot of multiple fronts. With respect to the numbers and how it affects our numbers, obviously, it's challenging when you have to raise compensation costs and generally people management costs. However, I would point to you that our margins, our adjusted EBITDA margins has continued to grow. I mean in fact, they've been growing more than -- and they are expected to grow more than ever before. We -- and the reason for that is we are finally getting the leverage on the massive restructuring and cost improvement initiatives that we launched immediately post-merger. And we're now getting the benefit of that leverage and that's offsetting -- more than offsetting the wage inflation headwinds. Again, I'd point to the growth of our profit numbers relative to the growth of our revenue numbers, and you see that we significantly materially raised -- grow our profit higher than -- materially higher than our revenue growth, which implies significant margin growth. Ron? Yes. Thanks, Eric. Well, as you can imagine, we track these numbers pretty tightly. And as you know, many definitions of what biotech funding and so on. We are not seeing in the actual RFP pipeline any changes versus what has been. As you know, a very strong demand environment for the EVP segment in general. In terms of percent of our bookings, what do we give you, we don't have the backlog, but we have the bookings. Let me see -- I have got a few numbers here for you. I think, look, in terms of the actual bookings, large pharma still represents the majority, right, a little bit over half. Is that correct? Right. And then we -- maybe the midsize is perhaps about somewhere around 10-ish percent -- -- of our bookings. And the rest, so again, I'd say 35% plus is EBP. And that has been the case -- again, it fluctuates, as you can imagine, these things -- these numbers go up and down. Now if you compare where we are here in terms of the pipe of the RFP, of flow, okay? It still continues to grow double digits in dollars and volume. I mean, it's really, really high, more than double digits. I don't know if we can give you the numbers, but the pipeline is very, very strong. I mean, actually, it's about -- our pipeline is about equal to our backlog as we speak right now, okay? And again, as I said before, COVID is basically gone more or less. It's very, very tiny percentage of the total pipeline here. A lot of it is oncology, which is up more than 20%, the CNS, more than 33% up. Agree, across therapy categories, we are seeing very good EBIT growth in the pipeline. I'm talking now, okay, not the book. I'm talking the pipeline, to your question, what do we see going forward, okay, which would be normally a line indicator of the funding. And we see that EBP in the pipeline actually represents a majority of our pipeline right now. So, again, we don't see any significant changes. Look, I wouldn't -- yes, it's true. For example, January was lower -- the month of January was lower than of EBP funding, but I wouldn't extrapolate from one month and -- or from one quarter for that matter. As you know, generally, the levels of EBP funding are very, very high. I mean, we are -- we must be in the top three years ever in terms of funding. So, okay, maybe that this year will be a little lower than last year, which, again, these were record years. We're talking about orders of magnitude greater in terms of multiples of the funding, if you just go back three, four, five, six years. So, yes, I mean, the step-down in funding would -- doesn't concern, as we continue to see very, very good, both bookings and even higher numbers in the pipeline. Well, we look at how much the spend in terms of clinical development, of R&D spend. Okay. So below that number -- I'm sorry? Yes, yes. That's correct. That encompasses what you might call small pharma as well that has commercialized products, in addition to commercial. I don't know if I can give you these numbers. But you know what, why don't we do this? Why don't we give us on follow-up questions, we'll try to give you a little bit more clarity or range on what's in the backlog. We will try to that. I'll ask the finance team here to -- I'll try to prevail and use my executive privilege to prepare all these guys. But I don't know at this point, you're putting me on the spot here. I don't know exactly what I'm going to give you but I will give you something. Well, thank you, Eric. Usually, you tell this at the beginning of the question, so I was concerned, but thanks for saying it again. All right. Next question. No. Not at all, not at all. As I said before, just to make myself clear again, the -- largely, the main driver of our margin expansion is simply leveraging the benefit of all the cost actions that we took post merger, okay? You will recall -- go back and look at the numbers; we have significant restructuring amounts every year, which obviously affected our cash flow. And we are now benefiting and leveraging those overhead optimization, outsourcing actions, consolidation of infrastructure, merging of IT systems, et cetera, et cetera. Now in addition to this, part of the reason you see margin expansion actually probably accelerate in 2022 versus 2021 in a quite significant way, I think some of it is what I just said and some of it is a mix benefit. I want to remind everyone that the COVID related work, which was quite significant portion over the past year or two, was at a lower margin than we would otherwise have our base business at, okay? Last of it was government work, whether it's on the commercial side, very small margins or on the R&D side, where we also contributed to the global effort to address the pandemic by pricing our COVID-related clinical trials not at the same level as we would otherwise have for traditional work. And so in terms of mix, as this COVID-related work gradually tapers down and the base business continues to grow as a proportion of the total, then of course, you've got a benefit on the margin side. I might add further that the amount of pass-throughs on COVID-related work was unusually high, vaccine trials and came also earlier on than it would under normal trial timelines. So the combination of lower margin service margins to start with, to us, a higher proportion -- an unusually high proportion of pass-throughs, all of that are contributed to be to an adverse impact, mix impact on our margins. As this work gradually tapers down, then obviously, the mix impact our margins is going to be more favorable. And that's the other reason you see an acceleration of our margin growth. Well, I mean, I don't know if we disclosed this, but we've got a couple of $100 million business in China. It's been growing double-digits over the last few years. We have a fully owned CRO subsidiary in addition to IQVIA, we have a core IQVIA business, and we've got a fully owned CRO subsidiary that's called Punto [ph], which is designed for local Chinese regulatory requirements and largely caters to the local market, the local biotechs, whilst IQVIA parent deals with the work of multinational sponsors for their piece of the clinical trial in China, when it exists. It's a unique setup, which in combination with our global CRO platform allows us to capture higher growth opportunities with China. Again, we feel good about our capabilities in this market and about our prospects to continue this growth trend. Look, there are local CROs that are emerging that are formidable competitors that are gaining share. There are hundreds literally of outfits in China. As you know, I want -- I don't need to be able to pull, but China is a complex market. There are lots of factors external to our industry that can affect how market dynamics play out. But I'm -- we're not worried, we're not concerned. We are continuing to invest as required. We have a good market position and it's a small piece of our total business. Anyone? Yes, 90% of the world -- of the project is outside the US. So I think the other, an independent subsidiary... Yes, that has its own program. But yes, no -- Roche has reaffirmed their commitment and is looking to accelerate the rollout actually after the successful implementations we had in several regions, plus they've also expressed interest in purchasing other modules. So we're very pleased with our collaboration with this client. But beyond that, we're not going to comment. Yes. Yes. I mean, look at our investor conference, we gave you even '25 targets for our company as a whole. And we said that the company as a whole will grow 10% to 12% annually, which presumably from a $15 billion base. So R&DS has to be growing into double digits in order to achieve that. And so that's kind of where we -- you know we view guidance or so by segment for '25? Do you have those numbers? While the team here is bringing this up. But again, I call your attention -- I bring your attention what we gave as a longer-term growth trend just a couple of months ago in November in New York, when we were all together in-person, and we gave you long-term goals and growth trends and all of which represented a significant acceleration versus what we've had over the '19 to '22... Yes, strong double digits. Yes. So that's the long-term trend of the business. And again, I point to you that these are large-scale businesses. Yes. Thank you, Shlomo. What I -- we've done this before. We've told you what it's comprised of. And if you look at TAS, I mean, I'd like to look at it in terms of three tiers. You've got the basic core information solutions, which is the old IMS business, essentially the data. And that's about, I'm going to say, 30% of the business, give or take. And that's a flattish growth rate business, okay? No -- and that's strategic. That's the way we do it. We just sell the data with very little price increases. It's a flattish business. Then you've got the moderately growing piece of the business, which is, let's call it, another quarter at this point, maybe a-quarter of the business that's analytics, consulting various services. And that grows double digits now. It's been growing strong double digits in the past two, three years, used to grow mid to high single digits. Now it's growing low to mid-double digits the past few years. Yes, low teens. Yes. And then you've got the higher growth businesses. And that's the real world and of course, the technology businesses, which will grow good mid-teens. And that's about -- when it was to the balance, was like at 45% of the business today. Obviously, we used to say it's a-third, a-third, a-third. Now, obviously, because real world, the fastest-growing piece of TAS, real world and technology are growing at a much faster rate. So they now represent already 45% of the total. And so, if you do the math, that should get you to high single digits underlying growth for the segment. Well, that's a good question. Look, we always -- obviously, we're always looking and even if you weren't looking, people call us. There are lots of assets that are in the market. We haven't been that active over the past couple of years in terms of numbers of acquisitions. We've done a little bit more in dollars this year, largely driven by our largest ever deal, which was simply the consolidation of our lab business. We bought 40% that we didn't own from Q2 -- I'm sorry, from Quest, that was our Q2 lab joint venture, and we paid, I think, $760 million for that and we need a couple of more larger acquisitions. As you know, the multiple valuations in this space where we operate in the healthcare, technology, information space, the multiples that are really very high, and the reason for that is that private equity essentially is trading those assets from one private equity firm to another. And so they keep bumping up the valuations. And we look at these assets, but we are always going to continue to be very reasonable and conservative. If we see value that we can create, then we will certainly look at these assets. But no major changes versus what you have seen us do before. We will be opportunistic if there are things -- assets that we would like to own, we will make a reasonable bids, and we won't get excited by what we have told the market is. Plus I've got good balancing CFO here with saying that we have healthy discussions with the business heads. And again, I hope that you could see from our history that our capital deployment has been prudent. We've been willing to have more debt and we may be willing to have more debt if necessary because we believe our business model is very different. Leverage for us at the peak of the pandemic was 4.8. And as a company or even if you go back the legacy companies, we believe with leverage ratios that were even six times. And the reasons for why we were willing to live with those leverage ratios is simply because our business profile, our cash flow generation model, our business visibility profile where a vast majority of our business is already booked early in the year, both commercial and clinical, all of that makes us comfortable that we can live with those, especially in an environment where I know there's a lot of talk about rising rates. And I would remind you that the bulk of our debt is at essentially fixed rates largely because of hedges and the alignment between our euro and debt and euro profits and dollars versus dollar profit. So all of that makes us comfortable, rates continue to be at historic lows. So we will do what's right for the business. We will allocate capital to first, internal investments; secondly, to acquisitions; then thirdly, to share repurchase, and you will see us go back and forth depending on opportunities. But again, we intend to try to continue to reduce debt as is prudent within the limits of what makes sense from a management standpoint, it doesn't make sense to eliminate our debt at the current rates. I mean, we would view that as a negligence on our part. So that's, I guess, the best answer I can give to your question. Thank you very much. We're done? I cannot be -- I cannot overemphasize that we are not seeing that translate into our sales pipeline. I mean again, I gave you some numbers earlier in biotech, I'm not giving you the numbers here because I don't know if I should give them to you or not, but the vast -- the majority, a big majority of the RFP dollar pipeline and numbers, volume and dollars is actually EBP. So we are not seeing any impact from potential slowdown of the funding into our pipeline, not at all. And the pipeline is at record high levels. So again, we -- it won't affect us one bit. And by the way, again, I'm not seeing that happening. We talk to EBP all the time. Okay. Thank you."

After the speakers remarks there will be a question and answer session [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. Thank you. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Nick Childs, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Mr. Childs, please begin your conference.\nNick Childs: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our third quarter 2021 earnings call. With me today are Ari Bousbib, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Ron Bruehlman, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Eric Sherbet, Executive Vice President and General Counsel; Mike Fedock, Senior Vice President, Financial Planning and Analysis; and Bryan Stengel, Associate Director, Investor Relations. Today, we will be referencing a presentation that will be visible during this call for those of you on our webcast. This presentation will also be available following this call in the Events and Presentations section of our IQVIA Investor Relations website at ir.iqvia.com. Before we begin, I would like to caution listeners that certain information discussed by management during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. The actual results could differ materially from those stated or implied by forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties associated with the company's business, which are discussed in the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission including our annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings. In addition, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures on this call, which should be considered a supplement to and not a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the comparable GAAP measures is included in the press release and conference call presentation. I would now like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Ari Bousbib.\nAri Bousbib: Thank you, Nick, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining today for our third quarter results. Our strong momentum from earlier in the year has continued despite the resurgence of COVID-19 due to the Delta variant. This has not had an impact on our operations as we have learned to manage through these disruptions. Our outlook for the longer term remains unchanged. The backdrop for the life science industry continues to be very strong. Biotech funding continues to run at record levels according to the National Venture Capital Association. Funding total of $35.8 billion through September 2021, already exceeding the full year of 2020. The pipeline of late-stage molecules continues to expand and is at an all-time high with almost 3,000 molecules in active Phase II or Phase III development. Clinical trial starts are trending well ahead of recent years with the year-to-year date starts up 23% over 2020 and 13% over 2019. And finally, new drug approvals by the FDA are keeping pace with the historically high levels of 2020, with 40 new drugs approved year-to-date, which set the stage for a strong volume of upcoming commercial launches. The bottom line is the dynamics in the industry are strong, and we remain bullish on our outlook for our end markets and for IQVIA in particular. As we think about our longer-term plans, I want to remind you of our upcoming analyst and investor conference on November 16 in New York City. At that meeting, we will provide financial guidance for 2022, ahead of our usual time line which is normally coinciding with the end of year results in early February. And we will share as well our midterm outlook and plans for the next phase of our Qs growth. We look forward to seeing everyone and hope you can join us then. With that, let's review the third quarter. Revenue for the third quarter grew 21.7% on a reported basis and 21.1% at constant currency and was $64 million above the midpoint of our guidance range. The beat was driven primarily by higher pass-throughs, which, as you know, dilutes our margins somewhat as well as by stronger organic revenue growth. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA grew 20.5%, reflecting our revenue growth as well as productivity measures. The $8 million beat above the midpoint of our guidance range was entirely due to the stronger operational performance. Third quarter adjusted diluted EPS of $2.17 grew 33.1%. That was $0.07 above the midpoint of our guidance, with the beat coming from the adjusted EBITDA drop-through as well as favorability in below-the-line items. Let me now provide an update on the business. Our real-world evidence business continues to take a leading role in informing health care. In late September, the FDA released their draft guidance on how electronic health records and medical claims data can support regulatory decision-making, and it cited several IQVIA publications. With the growth of rare disease therapies and personalized medicine driven trials, the number of single-arm clinical trials increases every year and external competitors provide important context for these studies for both regulators and payers. Our clients recognize our leading expertise in this area. For example, we had a recent major win to deliver an external comparator in a cardiovascular study for a top 20 pharma clients. In another example, we were awarded a 15-year follow-up study to demonstrate the long-term effectiveness and safety of a newly launched gene therapy. Regulatory guidance requires extended follow-up for patients exposed to cell and gene therapy. And IQVIA's innovative real-world capabilities combining direct-to-patient solutions as well as IQVIA technology platforms to capture secondary data was pivotal in this award. On the technology front, our suite of offerings continue to be adopted in the marketplace. You are familiar with our OCE platform and other commercial technology applications. And we have, of course, continued to expand our footprint here. We have 10 new client wins in the quarter, bringing the total number of OCE wins to date to 169 customers. But we are also very excited to see increased adoption of our orchestrated clinical trial suite, OCT. This quarter, for example, a leading biotechnology company in Asia selected our site portal module within OCT to power site engagement across all of their trials. We now have 165 customers that have bought the site portal module, representing 155,000 sites and 1,716 active studies that are using our site portal module. Similarly, our award-winning eCOA platform continues to experience strong demand. We have successfully deployed over 150 projects across 35 different therapeutic areas. To date, we have over 70 customers using this platform, including 8 of the top 10 pharma clients. The platform has processed over 10 million unique patient responses in 65 countries and across 28 languages. Now I want to say a few words about a fast-growing part of our industry. You're familiar with decentralized trials or DCT. The IQVIA decentralized trial offering combined several tech modules within our OCT suite including eCOA, eConsent, telemedicine and connected devices as well as other service capabilities, including home nurses and phlebotomists along with our decentralized trial patient cancers and study coordinators, all organized around our decentralized trial platform. Importantly, we've developed innovative clinical patient engagement offerings, including direct-to-patient services to accelerate recruitment and improve patient diversity and inclusion in clinical trials. When we step back and look at the growing importance of DCT in our own portfolio, we find that up to 30% of our active full-service trials utilize one or more components of our DCT offering. Incidentally, when our competitors speak about their own DCT offerings, this is often with the report as their DCT business. When we look at trials that actually fully utilize our DCT capabilities, meaning they are fully run on our decentralized trial platform, we've been awarded 89 trials to date totaling over $1 billion. These awards are with 34 unique sponsors, of which 10 have multiple decentralized trials ongoing with us. These trials span 12 different therapeutic areas, 32 unique indications and have recruited over 200,000 patients in 40 countries. Our ability to combine advanced clinical technology with an extensive network of investigators and care professionals differentiates us in this space and makes us a partner of chose for decentralized trials and utilize the full capabilities. Our overall R&DS business continues to build on its strong momentum. We had approximately $2.6 billion of net new bookings in the quarter, bringing our LTM net new bookings for the first time to over $10 billion including pass-throughs. This resulted in a contracted net book-to-bill ratio of 1.39 including pass-throughs, and 1.28 excluding pass-throughs. At September 30, our LTM contracted book-to-bill ratio was 1.38, including pass-throughs; and 1.37, excluding pass-throughs. Our contracted backlog in R&D, including pass-throughs, grew 12.7% year-over-year to $24.4 billion at September 30, 2021. As a result, our next 12 months revenue from backlog increased to $6.9 billion, up $300 million sequentially versus the second quarter. As we have signaled several times in the past, we've ramped up investments in our lab capabilities. We recently announced the opening of our new 160,000 square foot innovation laboratories in North Carolina. This facility provides customers with access to cutting-edge bioanalytical, vaccine and genomics capabilities, along with an expansion into exploratory human biomarker discovery services. These new services will enable us to partner closely with sponsors in the development of essential biomarkers to support new molecules moving into clinical development and throughout the life cycle. And this expansion, of course, comes on top of the investment we announced last quarter in our 130,000 square foot facility in Scotland. I will now turn it over to Ron for more details on our financial performance.\nRon Bruehlman : Okay. Thanks, Ari, and good morning, everyone. Let's start by reviewing revenue. Third quarter revenue of $3.391 billion grew 21.7% on a reported basis and 21.1% at constant currency. Year-to-date revenue was $10.238 billion, growing at 27% reported and 25% at constant currency. Technology & Analytics Solutions revenue for the third quarter was $1.337 billion, which was up 10.8% reported and 9.9% at constant currency. Year-to-date, Technology & Analytics Solutions revenue was $4.38 billion, which was up 17.6% reported and 14.9% at constant currency. In the third quarter, R&D Solutions had revenue of $1.853 billion, up 32.4% at actual FX rates and 31.9% at constant currency. Excluding the impact of pass-throughs, third quarter R&DS revenue grew 24.7% year-over-year. Year-to-date, revenue in R&D Solutions was $5.612 billion, up 37.7% reported and 36.2% at constant currency. Finally, contract sales in Medical Solutions or CSMS revenue of $201 million was up 12.3% reported and 12.8% at constant currency. Year-to-date, CSMS revenue was $588 million, growing 6.5% reported and 5.1% at constant currency. Now let's move down the P&L to adjusted EBITDA, which was $728 million in the third quarter, up 20.5%. Year-to-date adjusted EBITDA was $2.194 billion, growing 33.1% year-over-year. Third quarter GAAP net income was $261 million and GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.34. Year-to-date, we had GAAP net income of $648 million or $3.32 of earnings per diluted share. Adjusted net income was $423 million for the third quarter, and adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 33.1% to $2.17. Year-to-date, adjusted net income was $1.264 billion or $6.48 per share. Turning now to the R&D Solutions backlog. As already reviewed, R&D Solutions delivered another outstanding quarter of net new business. Backlog now stands at $24.4 billion. In the last 12 months, net new bookings, including pass-throughs, rose to over $10 billion. Okay. Turning to the balance sheet. At September 30, cash and cash equivalents totaled $1.5 billion and debt was $12.2 billion. This resulted in net debt of $10.7 billion. Our net leverage ratio at September 30 came in at 3.65x trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA. Our cash flow was again quite strong in the third quarter. Cash flow from operations was $844 million, and with CapEx of $162 million. This resulted in free cash flow of $682 million. This third quarter performance brought our free cash flow year-to-date, that is through the first 3 quarters, to almost $1.8 billion which continues the strong improvement trend we've had over the past 3 years. In the quarter, we repurchased $125 million of our shares, which leaves us with $697 million of share repurchase authorization remaining under our latest program Okay. Let's turn to guidance. As you saw, we're raising our full year 2021 revenue guidance by $188 million at the midpoint. This reflecting the third quarter strength in the continued operational momentum in our business. Our new revenue guidance is $13.775 billion to $13.850 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 21.3% to 21.9%. I'll note that included in this guidance is a $30 million headwind from FX versus our previous guidance. Now looking at the comparison to the prior year, FX is a tailwind of about 120 basis points to full year revenue growth. We're also raising our profit guidance as a result of a stronger revenue outlook, we've increased our full year adjusted EBITDA guidance by $20 million at the midpoint. Our new full year guidance is $2.980 billion to $3 billion -- $3.010 billion, rather, which represents year-over-year growth of 25% to 26.3%. Moving down to EPS. We're increasing our adjusted EPS guidance by $0.10 at the midpoint. The new guidance range is now $8.85 to $8.95, which represents year-over-year growth of 37.9% to 39.4%. Now our full year 2021 guidance assumes that September 30 foreign currency rates remain in fact for the balance of the year. Of course, the full year guidance implies a fourth quarter guidance, which we show here. And before getting to the numbers, I'll say, for context, you'll probably recall that last year's fourth quarter was unusual due to a snapback in the general business as we rebounded from the effects of COVID-19, picked up incremental demand from meta vaccine studies in R&DS and government-related COVID work within TAS. Fourth quarter revenue is expected to be between $3.537 billion and $3.612 billion, representing growth of 7.2% to 9.5%. FX in the quarter is a headwind to growth of about 100 basis points. We expect fourth quarter TAS revenue growth to be mid-single digits reflecting the expected year-over-year decline in government COVID-related work and the FX drag. I'll note though that underlying constant currency organic growth for TAS will be in the high single digits, which is the level that TAS has recently accelerated. R&DS revenue growth will be in the low teens with services growth in the mid-teens despite last year's difficult comparison due to the COVID vaccine work. CSMS will be slightly down. Adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter is expected to be between $786 million and $816 million, up 6.9% to 11%, and adjusted diluted EPS is expected to be between $2.37 and $2.47, growing 12.3% to 17.1%. So in summary, we delivered a very strong third quarter with strong results on both the top and bottom line. R&DS backlog improved to $24.4 billion. That's up 12.7% year-over-year. Next 12 months revenue from backlog increased to $6.9 billion, up $300 million sequentially versus the second quarter. We reported another strong quarter of free cash flow, which at $1.8 million through the first 3 quarters of the year, is a marked improvement over prior year. And finally, we are once again raising our full year guidance for revenue, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted diluted EPS. And with that, let me hand it back over to the operator for questions and answers.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of John Kreger with William Blair.\nJohn Kreger : Ari, thanks for all the detail around the OCT and DCT offerings. That was great. Curious if you could just take that one step further, what do you think the operational implications are for you guys and your clients as you see greater adoption of some of these newer technology tools?\nAri Bousbib: Well, I mean, operationally, obviously, you know that one of -- the single most important challenge we and actually the entire industry has is the ability to deploy people, again, the strong book of business that we've all generated. And so this is a great development because what DCT does is it kind of increased productivity, reduces labor and enables us to essentially execute more efficiently. So I think operationally, we are just adapting to this. Now again, the full productivity only comes when the trial is fully decentralized trial that I explained because there's a lot of confusion in this space. As soon as someone uses a digital platform, they say, well, we've had a [Indiscernible] DCT award here, but that's not the case. Now if we do that, as I mentioned, about 30% of our full clinical trials, which is just -- probably we have a little bit under 1,000 trials that are full-service clinical trials ongoing. So it's a larger number that already utilize one or several of our DCT modules, eConsent or eCOA or other connected devices. Our clients are experimenting with smaller trials and trying the full DCT platform, which puts together all of the capabilities and the maximum utilization of the digital tools that we have at our disposal. I think hands down, I believe we are leader in this space.\nJohn Kreger : Sounds good. And one quick follow-up on staffing. Obviously, we've -- there's a lot of talk about a tight labor market. Is that proving to be any sort of a headwind for you guys on EBITDA margins? And have you seen your staff attrition rates change at all as we've moved through this year?\nAri Bousbib: I mean, there's no question about it. It's not a secret. This is true across industry sectors and in our sector, in particular, since we have such a strong industry backdrop. There's a lot of competition for talent. We have all of the peers in the CRO space are hunting ground for talent. So obviously, we are responding. We are actively recruiting and hiring to meet this demand. We recruit dozens of employees every year. So we've got whole talent acquisition capability that's global and that's active, or does it create cost pressure? Yes. And it's already included in our guidance, that certainly a headwind. But as you well know, by now, hopefully, you know that when you look at our overall results, you see that there has been margin expansion despite these cost headwinds. In fact, even when you see in this past, in this Q3 results, that our operating margins are flat to slightly declining. When you actually take out the pass-throughs, you actually see that our margin -- the operating margins expanded quite nicely and this is despite the cost headwinds that we have. So yes, it is a headwind, and we are dealing with it and offsetting with the usual productivity and efficiency programs that I hope we've been demonstrating we're good at.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Eric Coldwell with Baird.\nEric Coldwell: I have a couple as well. First one, I think the number one inbound this morning is on your M&A spend in the quarter. Obviously, a much higher number than we were anticipating with the Myriad deal sizing being known. I'm curious if you could address that in a couple of ways. One, the type of deals, nature of deals, number of deals but also what impact you expect on a revenue basis, both in the fourth quarter as well as any thoughts on the run rate of the companies that you've recently acquired? And I might have a follow-up as well.\nAri Bousbib: Okay. So let me take the latter part of your question first. In the quarter, the contribution of M&A was minimal. I mean, maybe a little over a point. And that's the same basically for R&DS and for TAS. In the fourth quarter, Nick, a little bit more than that?\nNick Childs: Yes, fourth quarter total company were a little over 1.5 points.\nAri Bousbib: Yes, 1.5 points of contribution to our revenue growth. Now yes, we had a big spend this year. It's going to be lumpy. We always see acquisitions is binary. It happens or it doesn't happen. I will note that we didn't spend very much last year. I think in the entire year, we spent $177 million. And there are quarters where we spent $10 million or $50 million. And this quarter and this year, actually, we spent quite a bit more money. As you know, the largest acquisitions we've done is simply the consolidation of our joint venture request in the lab business, and that was a $760 million transaction we did in the second quarter. So that represents really a very large portion, almost half of the spend to date. In the quarter, we were very active. We were -- we actually closed only a handful of transactions. The 2 largest accounts for the vast majority, let's say, almost 90% in sales, something like that ,80% to 90% of the spend. It's 2 transactions only. One is the Myriad RBM Lab, which we had announced during our second quarter earnings and it actually closed in the third quarter. It's a lab that performs sophisticated biomarker detection and testing. It supports early- and late-stage drug development in very specific therapeutic areas, oncology, CNS and immunology. We also purchased DMD. DMD is a leading provider of analytics and digital marketing solutions to health care professionals. It brings advanced tech-enabled analytics and insights for intelligent omnichannel marketing, and we consider that acquisition to be a strategic asset. And yes, it did come with a lot of -- it costs quite a bit. So these 2 transactions, again, is basically the bulk of the spend.\nEric Coldwell: Now Ari...\nAri Bousbib: You have a second question, right?\nEric Coldwell: Yes. Just a clarification on the first one. So the last one, I think you said DMV, if I understood correctly.\nAri Bousbib: DMD, as in David.\nEric Coldwell: DMD. Okay. Got it. And then is that actually a CSMS segment deal? Or is that a Tech &  Analytics deal?\nAri Bousbib: Yes, it's a Tech & Analytics deal.\nEric Coldwell: Okay. And then my follow-up is my typical burden on you to talk about COVID contributions in 3Q for revenue and bookings, specifically in R&DS but also other segments as necessary. If you could update us on the backlog of COVID work in total in R&DS and then talk about bookings in 3Q related to total COVID-related activity would be great.\nAri Bousbib: Yes. I mean as we think our COVID work is obviously going to -- it continues a little bit. There is a tail to it. But certainly, on the TAS segment, it's a significant step-down. We have signaled this before. The government-related coverage work is gradually going away and certainly will start down dramatically in the fourth quarter and going forward. And we're just going to return once you eliminate the noise of what that happened last year. The TAS underlying organic growth rate is in the high single digits. You remember TAS historically was in a mid-single-digit grower and in our investor conference in June '19, we said that TAS would accelerate to high single digits, and that's where we've been most of the year. We've told you that when we reported prior quarters that the TAS growth rate included significant COVID-related work. And excluding that the growth rate was in the high single digits, and it remains so when you take out the noise of the compares, et cetera. On the RMBS, can you give us the numbers?\nRon Bruehlman : Yes, sure. Look, first, we like to look at the contribution of COVID to the backlog. And if you strip out the mega vaccine trials, Eric, from the backlog of R&DS, it's less than 5% of the backlog. If you take out all COVID-related work, it's less than 10% of the R&DS backlog. And you were asking about the contribution of COVID to revenue, I think, 2 in the quarter. And look, R&DS had very strong growth, even accepting the COVID-related work. If you take out the large fast burning COVID work, you were in the high 20s for R&DS revenue growth. And even if you take out all COVID-related work, you were still strong teens growth. So COVID did contribute, of course, and the work will trail down over time. But the underlying business in other therapeutic areas is very strong and ramping up as we go forward in R&DS.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Jack Meehan with Nephron Research.\nJack Meehan: I wanted to continue on the COVID conversation. But looking at the TAS business, I think you referenced when talking about the fourth quarter guidance some headwinds versus the prior year. But could you just maybe talk a little bit about how you feel like the longer-term durability of COVID work in the segment? Just your thoughts around that?\nAri Bousbib: Yes. Again, there's no headwinds in the fourth quarter for TAS. The growth rate is slower simply because it's a mass question. We're comparing last year's fourth quarter, which was -- which included the COVID work and a bunch of noise with the fourth quarter here, which eliminates that noise. Again, when you eliminate all of that, the underlying organic growth rate for TAS is in high single digits in the fourth quarter. So there is no headwind in the underlying business, and we expect that trend and momentum to continue. We will, as you know, provide -- we generally provide guidance on the year concurrent with the release of our fourth quarter earnings. Last year, because it was such an unusual year, we decided to give guidance for 2021 concurrent with the release of our third quarter earnings. And this year, we plan to do it at our November investor conference, which is just 3 weeks away.\nJack Meehan: Great. And I don't want to steal any thunder from the Investor Day a few weeks from now, but I was curious if you could talk a little bit about some of the puts and takes for 2022. The funding environment, as you referenced, seems very strong. Are there any takes that you would consider? And then the one thing that stands out to me is pass-throughs. They've obviously been elevated this year. Just any color around how that might phase in the next year would be helpful.\nAri Bousbib: Yes. So I mean, look, it's always important to put things in context and look at the longer-term trends as you're asking. And if you go back to June '19, we gave a 3-year set of targets for revenue, profit, EPS, capital deployment leverage, et cetera. Now no one could have predicted then that 6 months later, we would be starting the pandemic, and we would have such disruption across the world for all businesses and including for ours. But when you -- and I think people like to look at '19 to '21 to kind of try to eliminate COVID. I don't think that's fair because the whole COVID effect is not gone yet because of that. And a little bit of this is because of COVID and the pass-throughs that you just referred to. But even if you strip that out, we're still ahead on every single one of the metrics. Now I don't know if you had that conference, but as you're doing now and as your colleagues are doing, trying to push me for even more precision on what the numbers would be, I said then that I was hoping to exit 2022 at a 10% growth rate for the company. Now I've said before, earlier this year, that we reached our end of '22 targets in '21. And I believe that, that momentum will continue into '22. So that's all I can say, and I have to wait for more precision to 3 weeks. But I totally sitting here feel very, very confident that we will certainly exceed those numbers that we gave you years ago and set the stage for further acceleration beyond.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel.\nShlomo Rosenbaum: Ari, can you talk about where you are in general with the OCE implementations, particularly with like Roche and AstraZeneca? Have you gotten to the point where the implementations are not a significant drag on the margins that you have to offset in other areas? And just where are you seeing the business progress in terms of hitting kind of a steady state of revenue or revenue exceeding the cost to implement.\nAri Bousbib: I mean, you bring up a report, implementations are very costly. And because we have the large annual wins, and I referenced an additional 10 new wins. So every time a new award, again, you have to implement. So it's not like when you are behind the curve of implementation and start generating the license revenue, you still have to implement the new one that you sold and we're happy we did. So we not pass that headwind, if you will, in terms of the implementation costs. That's a significant drag, and we've not seen yet we haven't passed, if you will, that inflection point where you're now essentially plateaued your market penetration and you're essentially sitting tight and collecting license revenue for Moody's installations. We're not there in aggregate.\nShlomo Rosenbaum: Okay. And then just maybe this one's for Ron. The free cash flow was incredibly strong. Something -- there's more of this year, 33% more than you had all of last year, which was, I think, a record quarter. Could you talk about what's going on? There was a significant increase in unearned revenue and some other working capital changes? And how should we be thinking about this on a go-forward basis? Obviously, very healthy numbers. Is this something that you can keep up? Or is it or adjusting and catching up on some of the working capital items?\nRon Bruehlman : Well, Shlomo, we've made a really concerted effort internally here to improve our processes around receivables, which, of course, is one of our largest classes of assets. We don't have inventory, as you would have in a manufacturing firm receivables are really where we have a lot of our assets other than our deferred software investment. And that's been -- our efforts have been on several fronts. First off is collecting on time. We had a -- go back a little while, we had a large amount of overdue receivables. And that's just kind of focused to go and collect what's due from us. The next is billing on time. I mean, we had a large amount of unbilled receivables. And that comes down to internal processes about billing more quickly, more -- in a more timely fashion. So we get paid in a more timely fashion. And of course, the third that you mentioned is the deferred revenue that the customer advances that we get. We again made an effort internally to negotiate contracts with our customers, so we get paid more upfront. So we're not out of pocket, and this has helped substantially. And I expect all 3 of those that continue to be a driver of strong cash flow in the future. Now, of course, having said that cash flow is lumpy. Quarter-to-quarter, it's difficult to predict. And you do get instances where you'll get an unusual amount of advances to some of the work you're doing that will burn out off over time and then rebuild up. So I would urge you not to focus too much on the quarter-to-quarter. But yes, what you're saying is that fundamentally, we've improved our collections processes and improved our underlying free cash flow generation as a result.\nAri Bousbib: Yes. I mean if I just might add to that, we're very pleased with the performance, but let's be honest. This was a bad a bad point for us. And I think some of you had pulled that out in the past 3 years or so, our cash flow performance was simply very poor. So the fact that we are now performing very well is not an unusual thing. I mean I think not too long ago, in 2018, we generated just barely over $600 million of free cash flow for the entire year. And here we are, 3 quarters into the year, we've already generated 3x that number. Obviously, we are a much bigger company and so on. But look, the outperformance was just not good. and we said that and was on us, and we work on it, and we will continue to pay attention and have the right metrics and the right incentives and the team focused on it. And as always, when you shine the light on something, it improves. And that's what will happen here. And where we are now is the normal, not unusual.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Dave Windley with Jefferies.\nDave Windley: Wanted to follow up on, I believe, a John Kreger question around DCT. He asked around operational. Ari, I wanted to ask around financial. It seems like you now have a pretty substantial number of trials where you're running pretty fully on your DCT platform. I'm wondering if you could relate to us what -- how that changes the dollar value of a trial? And does that give you the opportunity to garner more margin in that trial because of the technology-enabled efficiency?\nAri Bousbib: Yes. I mean, look, there's a high degree of interest from clients, okay, around how to operational DCT, and it's not like it's going to overwhelm and all of sudden become 100% overnight. As I said, large pharma, in particular, is experimenting. A lot of trials are using one composite or the other. So it's going to take time. So this is not next year or the year after that we're going to have to face the issue that you're raising. Our experience, customers are striving with how to make various point solutions fit together. So we are actually very -- being very aggressive here. We want to move to DCT. We've said this since the merger got 5 years ago, we want to accelerate and not slow down technology introduction and changing the model. Now obviously, your question you asked is a question what I asked of us many years ago, which is as you seek to replace labor in a model that where pricing is largely based on labor inputs, then aren't you lowering the value of the trial and the -- and et cetera, what are implications on the margin. So we don't believe so. We have -- as you know, we've had a long run effort to switch pricing to value and deliverables and outputs. That's number one, and that has made substantial progress. Our clients are not really looking at saving a couple of pennies here or there. They're looking at getting what they need -- the answers that they want faster, more efficiently with less error and with higher quality. And they are willing to pay a premium for that. Now they're not going to pay more than what they were paying before, but they're not going to pay less than what they're paying before. And so now the margin implication is correct. Over time, the more we deploy technology, the less we need people, the more there's going to be margin accretion. But again, this is going to take time. There are also new delivery roles, which offset some of the reduced CRA visit activity. So I think it's too early to comment on the exact margin impact for this overall. We are monitoring -- we do not anticipate this to disrupt our margin performance. R&DS is a very long-cycle business. We have -- I mentioned 89 fully decentralized trial ongoing that we won. But we're working on -- if you look at, as I said, just under maybe 900 to also full-service trials. So it's a fraction of that. If you look at the total trials we're involved with, this over 2,500 clinical trials that we're involved in globally. So it does take some time to penetrate. It's a slow-moving business. But it's a good point. We are totally focused on it. We do not anticipate a margin -- I'm sorry, a value deterioration. We do anticipate a margin accretion over the long term.\nDave Windley: Great. If I could ask a second follow-up around a question on COVID. It seems like a lot of focus on how much revenue now and how much in backlog now, it seems equally important to me, if not more so, to focus on how that will phase out. And I think you've made comments in the past that you see projects booked out through '22 and maybe even into '23. Would it be appropriate to call the COVID contribution kind of a soft landing, so to speak, that it's not going to drop off, it's just going to slowly taper over time. Is that the right way to think about it?\nAri Bousbib: On the R&DS business, absolutely. No question. What you said is exactly what I would say. It's a soft landing '22, '23, and it -- frankly, we get lost in the rounding, by the time we get to '23. Unless, of course, it's not complete. There is another variant or another COVID. But right now, as we see based on what we know today, it's a soft landing, we get lost in the rounding by '23.\nOperator: Your last question is from the line of Dan Leonard with Wells Fargo.\nDan Leonard: Can you comment on trial site operations? Are there any continued bottlenecks you flag? Or is site activity normalizing?\nAri Bousbib: Ron?\nRon Bruehlman : Yes. Look, the site accessibility numbers remain around 80% or so. But look, we've managed to work around that and operate it close to normal. And not all sites are equal, the larger sites are open, and that hasn't been an issue for us. We've seen site start-ups and patient recruitment at near pre-pandemic levels, not quite, but near pre-pandemic levels. The patient visits are still lagging a little bit. just gradually coming back. And so when we look at our overall operations, we're not totally back to pre-pandemic level yet and we'll expect a gradual improvement over time back to pre-pandemic level, but it really hasn't been a major issue for our operations. As Ari mentioned in his opening remarks, we've learned how to manage driving around the...\nAri Bousbib: Yes. I mean the numbers that -- I got the numbers here in detail, but basically, we're over between -- it's 80% or so across all of those metrics. A little bit higher for site start-up, which is more -- again, as a percentage of 2019 base levels, okay? So site startup is a little higher, is that more 85% or thereabouts globally. The bottom line is these metrics that we see provide confidence that the non-COVID trial pipeline is not only being awarded, as you can see from the strong bookings, but it's also starting to be delivered. And the sites are enrolling, the patients are enrolling and the patient visits are ongoing. So I think there hasn't been any major change from this as a result of the new variant or anything like that.\nDan Leonard: And as a follow-up, Ari, can you comment on perceived market share trends in R&DS in the quarter? You've been pretty open about the various strategic actions by your competitors potentially allowing an opportunity for share gain.\nAri Bousbib: Look, it's hard to look at market share in a given quarter. Okay? It's lumpy trial, it can be awarded the quarter or the first or the following. I wouldn't look at -- we like -- as we always say, look, we've -- we were defeated and gave you quarterly book-to-bill ratios. But really, we don't -- we believe we should focus on longer-term book-to-bill ratios because it's lumpy and focus also on business from the backlog over the next 12 months. Now if you look at our competitors, there's been a lot of disruption. And yes, I mean, we've had conversations with customers, but just as we do to win a new customer overnight, you don't throw out a CRO overnight or in the middle of trials, right? So some of those mergers will have an impact on market share. I think it's favorable to us. Maybe we remain the last CRO standing, I don't know. But we feel that -- and we know from experience what a merger and a large acquisition does to the underlying business. There's all of disruptions, there's -- people lose their jobs, people who don't like the new arrangement, and that's just life. And the result of that is some market share. We had that problem after our merger in '16. Let's be honest about it, then we have some market share issues which we rebounded once we put together the company and integrated. I think we are -- the future is very bright for us. We continue to gain new customers. And the biotech environment in particular, is extremely, extremely hot right now. We are gaining new clients. In Europe, we're making inbounds with the customers we never had before. In Asia as well, and the teams are extremely energized and I think we are on a winning momentum here and no doubt that when we look back, we will see that our market share has improved.\nNick Childs: Can -- this is going to be our last question of the day.\nOperator: And your last question comes from the line of Patrick Donnelly with Citi.\nPatrick Donnelly: Ari, maybe a follow-up on that last question. You talked a little bit about kind of all the mergers going on in the space, again, headcount disruption. Following up on one of the earlier questions in terms of labor costs, does that position you guys better in terms of being able to acquire some talent that got modeled around during some of these mergers, kind of being a stable shift there and kind of grab some people, maybe not quite the inflationary costs you're seeing on the labor side? And then secondarily to that, maybe with a focus on R&Ds. How much can you pass some of these price increases on to customers? I know full-service contracts and backlog are particularly tough to adjust. But just wondering how much you can pass on in terms of some so the price pressure you're getting there?\nAri Bousbib: Okay. Well, on the personnel question, you've got to differentiate between the executive management leadership level and then the actual field force with CRAs, et cetera. So on the first group, in general, the first category, yes, there is an opportunity to bringing challenge that somehow dissatisfied with where they are and that will only occur and it has happened already in a few cases. But again, these are small numbers. On the CRAs and the project lead and so on, that's much more difficult because it's driven by the book of business and by the execution that our competitors are also in the midst of trials and they need those people as much as we do. And so there's not much -- there's just an inflation on wages, which is the result of all the factors we talked about before, but that doesn't -- the mergers don't affect at least immediately the CRAs and the people in the field. Your other question had to do\nPatrick Donnelly: With pricing. And do we need a passing on cost.\nAri Bousbib: Yes. So as you noted yourself in your question, it's very hard. You can't -- we sold projects with certain assumptions. And there are some escalations and some factors built into those contracts. So that will be reflected. But by and large, the pricing was set based on different assumptions and when you have higher cost, then you have to absorb. But then as we move forward, obviously, the pricing is affected. There's no magic here. It's all going to get fast on and there's no secret. But it's going to lag because of the nature of our business, certainly in the R&DS business.\nRon Bruehlman : Right. And of course, on the TAS side of the business, shorter-cycle business, a greater ability to pass along cost increases.\nAri Bousbib: Right, but there's less labor. So that's..\nRon Bruehlman : Less labor. correct.\nNick Childs: Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. We look forward to seeing everyone at our Investor Day in a few weeks. If you have any other follow-up questions, feel free to reach out. We're happy to answer them. Thanks for joining today.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Ron Bruehlman",
            "content": "Okay. Thanks, Ari, and good morning, everyone. Let's start by reviewing revenue. Third quarter revenue of $3.391 billion grew 21.7% on a reported basis and 21.1% at constant currency. Year-to-date revenue was $10.238 billion, growing at 27% reported and 25% at constant currency. Technology & Analytics Solutions revenue for the third quarter was $1.337 billion, which was up 10.8% reported and 9.9% at constant currency. Year-to-date, Technology & Analytics Solutions revenue was $4.38 billion, which was up 17.6% reported and 14.9% at constant currency. In the third quarter, R&D Solutions had revenue of $1.853 billion, up 32.4% at actual FX rates and 31.9% at constant currency. Excluding the impact of pass-throughs, third quarter R&DS revenue grew 24.7% year-over-year. Year-to-date, revenue in R&D Solutions was $5.612 billion, up 37.7% reported and 36.2% at constant currency. Finally, contract sales in Medical Solutions or CSMS revenue of $201 million was up 12.3% reported and 12.8% at constant currency. Year-to-date, CSMS revenue was $588 million, growing 6.5% reported and 5.1% at constant currency. Now let's move down the P&L to adjusted EBITDA, which was $728 million in the third quarter, up 20.5%. Year-to-date adjusted EBITDA was $2.194 billion, growing 33.1% year-over-year. Third quarter GAAP net income was $261 million and GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.34. Year-to-date, we had GAAP net income of $648 million or $3.32 of earnings per diluted share. Adjusted net income was $423 million for the third quarter, and adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 33.1% to $2.17. Year-to-date, adjusted net income was $1.264 billion or $6.48 per share. Turning now to the R&D Solutions backlog. As already reviewed, R&D Solutions delivered another outstanding quarter of net new business. Backlog now stands at $24.4 billion. In the last 12 months, net new bookings, including pass-throughs, rose to over $10 billion. Okay. Turning to the balance sheet. At September 30, cash and cash equivalents totaled $1.5 billion and debt was $12.2 billion. This resulted in net debt of $10.7 billion. Our net leverage ratio at September 30 came in at 3.65x trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA. Our cash flow was again quite strong in the third quarter. Cash flow from operations was $844 million, and with CapEx of $162 million. This resulted in free cash flow of $682 million. This third quarter performance brought our free cash flow year-to-date, that is through the first 3 quarters, to almost $1.8 billion which continues the strong improvement trend we've had over the past 3 years. In the quarter, we repurchased $125 million of our shares, which leaves us with $697 million of share repurchase authorization remaining under our latest program Okay. Let's turn to guidance. As you saw, we're raising our full year 2021 revenue guidance by $188 million at the midpoint. This reflecting the third quarter strength in the continued operational momentum in our business. Our new revenue guidance is $13.775 billion to $13.850 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 21.3% to 21.9%. I'll note that included in this guidance is a $30 million headwind from FX versus our previous guidance. Now looking at the comparison to the prior year, FX is a tailwind of about 120 basis points to full year revenue growth. We're also raising our profit guidance as a result of a stronger revenue outlook, we've increased our full year adjusted EBITDA guidance by $20 million at the midpoint. Our new full year guidance is $2.980 billion to $3 billion -- $3.010 billion, rather, which represents year-over-year growth of 25% to 26.3%. Moving down to EPS. We're increasing our adjusted EPS guidance by $0.10 at the midpoint. The new guidance range is now $8.85 to $8.95, which represents year-over-year growth of 37.9% to 39.4%. Now our full year 2021 guidance assumes that September 30 foreign currency rates remain in fact for the balance of the year. Of course, the full year guidance implies a fourth quarter guidance, which we show here. And before getting to the numbers, I'll say, for context, you'll probably recall that last year's fourth quarter was unusual due to a snapback in the general business as we rebounded from the effects of COVID-19, picked up incremental demand from meta vaccine studies in R&DS and government-related COVID work within TAS. Fourth quarter revenue is expected to be between $3.537 billion and $3.612 billion, representing growth of 7.2% to 9.5%. FX in the quarter is a headwind to growth of about 100 basis points. We expect fourth quarter TAS revenue growth to be mid-single digits reflecting the expected year-over-year decline in government COVID-related work and the FX drag. I'll note though that underlying constant currency organic growth for TAS will be in the high single digits, which is the level that TAS has recently accelerated. R&DS revenue growth will be in the low teens with services growth in the mid-teens despite last year's difficult comparison due to the COVID vaccine work. CSMS will be slightly down. Adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter is expected to be between $786 million and $816 million, up 6.9% to 11%, and adjusted diluted EPS is expected to be between $2.37 and $2.47, growing 12.3% to 17.1%. So in summary, we delivered a very strong third quarter with strong results on both the top and bottom line. R&DS backlog improved to $24.4 billion. That's up 12.7% year-over-year. Next 12 months revenue from backlog increased to $6.9 billion, up $300 million sequentially versus the second quarter. We reported another strong quarter of free cash flow, which at $1.8 million through the first 3 quarters of the year, is a marked improvement over prior year. And finally, we are once again raising our full year guidance for revenue, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted diluted EPS. And with that, let me hand it back over to the operator for questions and answers. Yes, sure. Look, first, we like to look at the contribution of COVID to the backlog. And if you strip out the mega vaccine trials, Eric, from the backlog of R&DS, it's less than 5% of the backlog. If you take out all COVID-related work, it's less than 10% of the R&DS backlog. And you were asking about the contribution of COVID to revenue, I think, 2 in the quarter. And look, R&DS had very strong growth, even accepting the COVID-related work. If you take out the large fast burning COVID work, you were in the high 20s for R&DS revenue growth. And even if you take out all COVID-related work, you were still strong teens growth. So COVID did contribute, of course, and the work will trail down over time. But the underlying business in other therapeutic areas is very strong and ramping up as we go forward in R&DS. Well, Shlomo, we've made a really concerted effort internally here to improve our processes around receivables, which, of course, is one of our largest classes of assets. We don't have inventory, as you would have in a manufacturing firm receivables are really where we have a lot of our assets other than our deferred software investment. And that's been -- our efforts have been on several fronts. First off is collecting on time. We had a -- go back a little while, we had a large amount of overdue receivables. And that's just kind of focused to go and collect what's due from us. The next is billing on time. I mean, we had a large amount of unbilled receivables. And that comes down to internal processes about billing more quickly, more -- in a more timely fashion. So we get paid in a more timely fashion. And of course, the third that you mentioned is the deferred revenue that the customer advances that we get. We again made an effort internally to negotiate contracts with our customers, so we get paid more upfront. So we're not out of pocket, and this has helped substantially. And I expect all 3 of those that continue to be a driver of strong cash flow in the future. Now, of course, having said that cash flow is lumpy. Quarter-to-quarter, it's difficult to predict. And you do get instances where you'll get an unusual amount of advances to some of the work you're doing that will burn out off over time and then rebuild up. So I would urge you not to focus too much on the quarter-to-quarter. But yes, what you're saying is that fundamentally, we've improved our collections processes and improved our underlying free cash flow generation as a result. Yes. Look, the site accessibility numbers remain around 80% or so. But look, we've managed to work around that and operate it close to normal. And not all sites are equal, the larger sites are open, and that hasn't been an issue for us. We've seen site start-ups and patient recruitment at near pre-pandemic levels, not quite, but near pre-pandemic levels. The patient visits are still lagging a little bit. just gradually coming back. And so when we look at our overall operations, we're not totally back to pre-pandemic level yet and we'll expect a gradual improvement over time back to pre-pandemic level, but it really hasn't been a major issue for our operations. As Ari mentioned in his opening remarks, we've learned how to manage driving around the... Right. And of course, on the TAS side of the business, shorter-cycle business, a greater ability to pass along cost increases. Less labor. correct."

            "name": "Ari Bousbib",
            "content": "Thank you, Nick, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining today for our third quarter results. Our strong momentum from earlier in the year has continued despite the resurgence of COVID-19 due to the Delta variant. This has not had an impact on our operations as we have learned to manage through these disruptions. Our outlook for the longer term remains unchanged. The backdrop for the life science industry continues to be very strong. Biotech funding continues to run at record levels according to the National Venture Capital Association. Funding total of $35.8 billion through September 2021, already exceeding the full year of 2020. The pipeline of late-stage molecules continues to expand and is at an all-time high with almost 3,000 molecules in active Phase II or Phase III development. Clinical trial starts are trending well ahead of recent years with the year-to-year date starts up 23% over 2020 and 13% over 2019. And finally, new drug approvals by the FDA are keeping pace with the historically high levels of 2020, with 40 new drugs approved year-to-date, which set the stage for a strong volume of upcoming commercial launches. The bottom line is the dynamics in the industry are strong, and we remain bullish on our outlook for our end markets and for IQVIA in particular. As we think about our longer-term plans, I want to remind you of our upcoming analyst and investor conference on November 16 in New York City. At that meeting, we will provide financial guidance for 2022, ahead of our usual time line which is normally coinciding with the end of year results in early February. And we will share as well our midterm outlook and plans for the next phase of our Qs growth. We look forward to seeing everyone and hope you can join us then. With that, let's review the third quarter. Revenue for the third quarter grew 21.7% on a reported basis and 21.1% at constant currency and was $64 million above the midpoint of our guidance range. The beat was driven primarily by higher pass-throughs, which, as you know, dilutes our margins somewhat as well as by stronger organic revenue growth. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA grew 20.5%, reflecting our revenue growth as well as productivity measures. The $8 million beat above the midpoint of our guidance range was entirely due to the stronger operational performance. Third quarter adjusted diluted EPS of $2.17 grew 33.1%. That was $0.07 above the midpoint of our guidance, with the beat coming from the adjusted EBITDA drop-through as well as favorability in below-the-line items. Let me now provide an update on the business. Our real-world evidence business continues to take a leading role in informing health care. In late September, the FDA released their draft guidance on how electronic health records and medical claims data can support regulatory decision-making, and it cited several IQVIA publications. With the growth of rare disease therapies and personalized medicine driven trials, the number of single-arm clinical trials increases every year and external competitors provide important context for these studies for both regulators and payers. Our clients recognize our leading expertise in this area. For example, we had a recent major win to deliver an external comparator in a cardiovascular study for a top 20 pharma clients. In another example, we were awarded a 15-year follow-up study to demonstrate the long-term effectiveness and safety of a newly launched gene therapy. Regulatory guidance requires extended follow-up for patients exposed to cell and gene therapy. And IQVIA's innovative real-world capabilities combining direct-to-patient solutions as well as IQVIA technology platforms to capture secondary data was pivotal in this award. On the technology front, our suite of offerings continue to be adopted in the marketplace. You are familiar with our OCE platform and other commercial technology applications. And we have, of course, continued to expand our footprint here. We have 10 new client wins in the quarter, bringing the total number of OCE wins to date to 169 customers. But we are also very excited to see increased adoption of our orchestrated clinical trial suite, OCT. This quarter, for example, a leading biotechnology company in Asia selected our site portal module within OCT to power site engagement across all of their trials. We now have 165 customers that have bought the site portal module, representing 155,000 sites and 1,716 active studies that are using our site portal module. Similarly, our award-winning eCOA platform continues to experience strong demand. We have successfully deployed over 150 projects across 35 different therapeutic areas. To date, we have over 70 customers using this platform, including 8 of the top 10 pharma clients. The platform has processed over 10 million unique patient responses in 65 countries and across 28 languages. Now I want to say a few words about a fast-growing part of our industry. You're familiar with decentralized trials or DCT. The IQVIA decentralized trial offering combined several tech modules within our OCT suite including eCOA, eConsent, telemedicine and connected devices as well as other service capabilities, including home nurses and phlebotomists along with our decentralized trial patient cancers and study coordinators, all organized around our decentralized trial platform. Importantly, we've developed innovative clinical patient engagement offerings, including direct-to-patient services to accelerate recruitment and improve patient diversity and inclusion in clinical trials. When we step back and look at the growing importance of DCT in our own portfolio, we find that up to 30% of our active full-service trials utilize one or more components of our DCT offering. Incidentally, when our competitors speak about their own DCT offerings, this is often with the report as their DCT business. When we look at trials that actually fully utilize our DCT capabilities, meaning they are fully run on our decentralized trial platform, we've been awarded 89 trials to date totaling over $1 billion. These awards are with 34 unique sponsors, of which 10 have multiple decentralized trials ongoing with us. These trials span 12 different therapeutic areas, 32 unique indications and have recruited over 200,000 patients in 40 countries. Our ability to combine advanced clinical technology with an extensive network of investigators and care professionals differentiates us in this space and makes us a partner of chose for decentralized trials and utilize the full capabilities. Our overall R&DS business continues to build on its strong momentum. We had approximately $2.6 billion of net new bookings in the quarter, bringing our LTM net new bookings for the first time to over $10 billion including pass-throughs. This resulted in a contracted net book-to-bill ratio of 1.39 including pass-throughs, and 1.28 excluding pass-throughs. At September 30, our LTM contracted book-to-bill ratio was 1.38, including pass-throughs; and 1.37, excluding pass-throughs. Our contracted backlog in R&D, including pass-throughs, grew 12.7% year-over-year to $24.4 billion at September 30, 2021. As a result, our next 12 months revenue from backlog increased to $6.9 billion, up $300 million sequentially versus the second quarter. As we have signaled several times in the past, we've ramped up investments in our lab capabilities. We recently announced the opening of our new 160,000 square foot innovation laboratories in North Carolina. This facility provides customers with access to cutting-edge bioanalytical, vaccine and genomics capabilities, along with an expansion into exploratory human biomarker discovery services. These new services will enable us to partner closely with sponsors in the development of essential biomarkers to support new molecules moving into clinical development and throughout the life cycle. And this expansion, of course, comes on top of the investment we announced last quarter in our 130,000 square foot facility in Scotland. I will now turn it over to Ron for more details on our financial performance. Well, I mean, operationally, obviously, you know that one of -- the single most important challenge we and actually the entire industry has is the ability to deploy people, again, the strong book of business that we've all generated. And so this is a great development because what DCT does is it kind of increased productivity, reduces labor and enables us to essentially execute more efficiently. So I think operationally, we are just adapting to this. Now again, the full productivity only comes when the trial is fully decentralized trial that I explained because there's a lot of confusion in this space. As soon as someone uses a digital platform, they say, well, we've had a [Indiscernible] DCT award here, but that's not the case. Now if we do that, as I mentioned, about 30% of our full clinical trials, which is just -- probably we have a little bit under 1,000 trials that are full-service clinical trials ongoing. So it's a larger number that already utilize one or several of our DCT modules, eConsent or eCOA or other connected devices. Our clients are experimenting with smaller trials and trying the full DCT platform, which puts together all of the capabilities and the maximum utilization of the digital tools that we have at our disposal. I think hands down, I believe we are leader in this space. I mean, there's no question about it. It's not a secret. This is true across industry sectors and in our sector, in particular, since we have such a strong industry backdrop. There's a lot of competition for talent. We have all of the peers in the CRO space are hunting ground for talent. So obviously, we are responding. We are actively recruiting and hiring to meet this demand. We recruit dozens of employees every year. So we've got whole talent acquisition capability that's global and that's active, or does it create cost pressure? Yes. And it's already included in our guidance, that certainly a headwind. But as you well know, by now, hopefully, you know that when you look at our overall results, you see that there has been margin expansion despite these cost headwinds. In fact, even when you see in this past, in this Q3 results, that our operating margins are flat to slightly declining. When you actually take out the pass-throughs, you actually see that our margin -- the operating margins expanded quite nicely and this is despite the cost headwinds that we have. So yes, it is a headwind, and we are dealing with it and offsetting with the usual productivity and efficiency programs that I hope we've been demonstrating we're good at. Okay. So let me take the latter part of your question first. In the quarter, the contribution of M&A was minimal. I mean, maybe a little over a point. And that's the same basically for R&DS and for TAS. In the fourth quarter, Nick, a little bit more than that? Yes, 1.5 points of contribution to our revenue growth. Now yes, we had a big spend this year. It's going to be lumpy. We always see acquisitions is binary. It happens or it doesn't happen. I will note that we didn't spend very much last year. I think in the entire year, we spent $177 million. And there are quarters where we spent $10 million or $50 million. And this quarter and this year, actually, we spent quite a bit more money. As you know, the largest acquisitions we've done is simply the consolidation of our joint venture request in the lab business, and that was a $760 million transaction we did in the second quarter. So that represents really a very large portion, almost half of the spend to date. In the quarter, we were very active. We were -- we actually closed only a handful of transactions. The 2 largest accounts for the vast majority, let's say, almost 90% in sales, something like that ,80% to 90% of the spend. It's 2 transactions only. One is the Myriad RBM Lab, which we had announced during our second quarter earnings and it actually closed in the third quarter. It's a lab that performs sophisticated biomarker detection and testing. It supports early- and late-stage drug development in very specific therapeutic areas, oncology, CNS and immunology. We also purchased DMD. DMD is a leading provider of analytics and digital marketing solutions to health care professionals. It brings advanced tech-enabled analytics and insights for intelligent omnichannel marketing, and we consider that acquisition to be a strategic asset. And yes, it did come with a lot of -- it costs quite a bit. So these 2 transactions, again, is basically the bulk of the spend. You have a second question, right? DMD, as in David. Yes, it's a Tech & Analytics deal. Yes. I mean as we think our COVID work is obviously going to -- it continues a little bit. There is a tail to it. But certainly, on the TAS segment, it's a significant step-down. We have signaled this before. The government-related coverage work is gradually going away and certainly will start down dramatically in the fourth quarter and going forward. And we're just going to return once you eliminate the noise of what that happened last year. The TAS underlying organic growth rate is in the high single digits. You remember TAS historically was in a mid-single-digit grower and in our investor conference in June '19, we said that TAS would accelerate to high single digits, and that's where we've been most of the year. We've told you that when we reported prior quarters that the TAS growth rate included significant COVID-related work. And excluding that the growth rate was in the high single digits, and it remains so when you take out the noise of the compares, et cetera. On the RMBS, can you give us the numbers? Yes. Again, there's no headwinds in the fourth quarter for TAS. The growth rate is slower simply because it's a mass question. We're comparing last year's fourth quarter, which was -- which included the COVID work and a bunch of noise with the fourth quarter here, which eliminates that noise. Again, when you eliminate all of that, the underlying organic growth rate for TAS is in high single digits in the fourth quarter. So there is no headwind in the underlying business, and we expect that trend and momentum to continue. We will, as you know, provide -- we generally provide guidance on the year concurrent with the release of our fourth quarter earnings. Last year, because it was such an unusual year, we decided to give guidance for 2021 concurrent with the release of our third quarter earnings. And this year, we plan to do it at our November investor conference, which is just 3 weeks away. Yes. So I mean, look, it's always important to put things in context and look at the longer-term trends as you're asking. And if you go back to June '19, we gave a 3-year set of targets for revenue, profit, EPS, capital deployment leverage, et cetera. Now no one could have predicted then that 6 months later, we would be starting the pandemic, and we would have such disruption across the world for all businesses and including for ours. But when you -- and I think people like to look at '19 to '21 to kind of try to eliminate COVID. I don't think that's fair because the whole COVID effect is not gone yet because of that. And a little bit of this is because of COVID and the pass-throughs that you just referred to. But even if you strip that out, we're still ahead on every single one of the metrics. Now I don't know if you had that conference, but as you're doing now and as your colleagues are doing, trying to push me for even more precision on what the numbers would be, I said then that I was hoping to exit 2022 at a 10% growth rate for the company. Now I've said before, earlier this year, that we reached our end of '22 targets in '21. And I believe that, that momentum will continue into '22. So that's all I can say, and I have to wait for more precision to 3 weeks. But I totally sitting here feel very, very confident that we will certainly exceed those numbers that we gave you years ago and set the stage for further acceleration beyond. I mean, you bring up a report, implementations are very costly. And because we have the large annual wins, and I referenced an additional 10 new wins. So every time a new award, again, you have to implement. So it's not like when you are behind the curve of implementation and start generating the license revenue, you still have to implement the new one that you sold and we're happy we did. So we not pass that headwind, if you will, in terms of the implementation costs. That's a significant drag, and we've not seen yet we haven't passed, if you will, that inflection point where you're now essentially plateaued your market penetration and you're essentially sitting tight and collecting license revenue for Moody's installations. We're not there in aggregate. Yes. I mean if I just might add to that, we're very pleased with the performance, but let's be honest. This was a bad a bad point for us. And I think some of you had pulled that out in the past 3 years or so, our cash flow performance was simply very poor. So the fact that we are now performing very well is not an unusual thing. I mean I think not too long ago, in 2018, we generated just barely over $600 million of free cash flow for the entire year. And here we are, 3 quarters into the year, we've already generated 3x that number. Obviously, we are a much bigger company and so on. But look, the outperformance was just not good. and we said that and was on us, and we work on it, and we will continue to pay attention and have the right metrics and the right incentives and the team focused on it. And as always, when you shine the light on something, it improves. And that's what will happen here. And where we are now is the normal, not unusual. Yes. I mean, look, there's a high degree of interest from clients, okay, around how to operational DCT, and it's not like it's going to overwhelm and all of sudden become 100% overnight. As I said, large pharma, in particular, is experimenting. A lot of trials are using one composite or the other. So it's going to take time. So this is not next year or the year after that we're going to have to face the issue that you're raising. Our experience, customers are striving with how to make various point solutions fit together. So we are actually very -- being very aggressive here. We want to move to DCT. We've said this since the merger got 5 years ago, we want to accelerate and not slow down technology introduction and changing the model. Now obviously, your question you asked is a question what I asked of us many years ago, which is as you seek to replace labor in a model that where pricing is largely based on labor inputs, then aren't you lowering the value of the trial and the -- and et cetera, what are implications on the margin. So we don't believe so. We have -- as you know, we've had a long run effort to switch pricing to value and deliverables and outputs. That's number one, and that has made substantial progress. Our clients are not really looking at saving a couple of pennies here or there. They're looking at getting what they need -- the answers that they want faster, more efficiently with less error and with higher quality. And they are willing to pay a premium for that. Now they're not going to pay more than what they were paying before, but they're not going to pay less than what they're paying before. And so now the margin implication is correct. Over time, the more we deploy technology, the less we need people, the more there's going to be margin accretion. But again, this is going to take time. There are also new delivery roles, which offset some of the reduced CRA visit activity. So I think it's too early to comment on the exact margin impact for this overall. We are monitoring -- we do not anticipate this to disrupt our margin performance. R&DS is a very long-cycle business. We have -- I mentioned 89 fully decentralized trial ongoing that we won. But we're working on -- if you look at, as I said, just under maybe 900 to also full-service trials. So it's a fraction of that. If you look at the total trials we're involved with, this over 2,500 clinical trials that we're involved in globally. So it does take some time to penetrate. It's a slow-moving business. But it's a good point. We are totally focused on it. We do not anticipate a margin -- I'm sorry, a value deterioration. We do anticipate a margin accretion over the long term. On the R&DS business, absolutely. No question. What you said is exactly what I would say. It's a soft landing '22, '23, and it -- frankly, we get lost in the rounding, by the time we get to '23. Unless, of course, it's not complete. There is another variant or another COVID. But right now, as we see based on what we know today, it's a soft landing, we get lost in the rounding by '23. Ron? Yes. I mean the numbers that -- I got the numbers here in detail, but basically, we're over between -- it's 80% or so across all of those metrics. A little bit higher for site start-up, which is more -- again, as a percentage of 2019 base levels, okay? So site startup is a little higher, is that more 85% or thereabouts globally. The bottom line is these metrics that we see provide confidence that the non-COVID trial pipeline is not only being awarded, as you can see from the strong bookings, but it's also starting to be delivered. And the sites are enrolling, the patients are enrolling and the patient visits are ongoing. So I think there hasn't been any major change from this as a result of the new variant or anything like that. Look, it's hard to look at market share in a given quarter. Okay? It's lumpy trial, it can be awarded the quarter or the first or the following. I wouldn't look at -- we like -- as we always say, look, we've -- we were defeated and gave you quarterly book-to-bill ratios. But really, we don't -- we believe we should focus on longer-term book-to-bill ratios because it's lumpy and focus also on business from the backlog over the next 12 months. Now if you look at our competitors, there's been a lot of disruption. And yes, I mean, we've had conversations with customers, but just as we do to win a new customer overnight, you don't throw out a CRO overnight or in the middle of trials, right? So some of those mergers will have an impact on market share. I think it's favorable to us. Maybe we remain the last CRO standing, I don't know. But we feel that -- and we know from experience what a merger and a large acquisition does to the underlying business. There's all of disruptions, there's -- people lose their jobs, people who don't like the new arrangement, and that's just life. And the result of that is some market share. We had that problem after our merger in '16. Let's be honest about it, then we have some market share issues which we rebounded once we put together the company and integrated. I think we are -- the future is very bright for us. We continue to gain new customers. And the biotech environment in particular, is extremely, extremely hot right now. We are gaining new clients. In Europe, we're making inbounds with the customers we never had before. In Asia as well, and the teams are extremely energized and I think we are on a winning momentum here and no doubt that when we look back, we will see that our market share has improved. Okay. Well, on the personnel question, you've got to differentiate between the executive management leadership level and then the actual field force with CRAs, et cetera. So on the first group, in general, the first category, yes, there is an opportunity to bringing challenge that somehow dissatisfied with where they are and that will only occur and it has happened already in a few cases. But again, these are small numbers. On the CRAs and the project lead and so on, that's much more difficult because it's driven by the book of business and by the execution that our competitors are also in the midst of trials and they need those people as much as we do. And so there's not much -- there's just an inflation on wages, which is the result of all the factors we talked about before, but that doesn't -- the mergers don't affect at least immediately the CRAs and the people in the field. Your other question had to do Yes. So as you noted yourself in your question, it's very hard. You can't -- we sold projects with certain assumptions. And there are some escalations and some factors built into those contracts. So that will be reflected. But by and large, the pricing was set based on different assumptions and when you have higher cost, then you have to absorb. But then as we move forward, obviously, the pricing is affected. There's no magic here. It's all going to get fast on and there's no secret. But it's going to lag because of the nature of our business, certainly in the R&DS business. Right, but there's less labor. So that's.."

[Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Nick Childs, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Mr. Childs, please begin your conference.\nNicholas Childs: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our second quarter 2021 earnings call. With me today are Ari Bousbib, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Ron Bruehlman, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Eric Sherbet, Executive Vice President and General Counsel; Mike Fedock, Senior Vice President, Financial Planning and Analysis; and Brian Stengel [ph], Associate Director, Investor Relations.  Today, we will be referencing a presentation that will be visible during this call for those of you on our webcast. This presentation will also be available following this call in the Events and Presentations section of our IQVIA Investor Relations website at ir.iqvia.com.  Before we begin, I would like to caution listeners that certain information discussed by management during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those stated or implied by forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties associated with the company's business, which are discussed in the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings. In addition, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures on this call, which should be considered a supplement to and not a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the comparable GAAP measures is included in the press release and conference call presentation.  I would now like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Ari Bousbib.\nAri Bousbib: Thank you, Nick, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining today. This morning, we reported second quarter results with outstanding double-digit growth in all key financial metrics. Following the strong performance, we've once again raised our guidance for the year. As you recall, we're tracking ahead of our pre-COVID V 22 financial plan.  The health of the life sciences industry continues to strengthen. New clinical trial starts are trending well above recent historical figures. They are up 22% versus 2020 levels and up 7% compared to 2019. The pipeline of late-stage molecules continues to expand to record numbers, indicating a large backlog of potential launches, some of which have been pushed to the right during the pandemic last year.  And finally, biotech funding continues to increase significantly. According to the National Venture Capital Association, funding totaled $25 billion in the first half of 2021. This represents an increase of 64% compared to the first half of 2020, which itself was already a record first half year.  During 2020, the pandemic disrupted execution of clinical trials and businesses requiring face-to-face interactions. But at the same time, it accelerated change in the industry. It created new demand for new services. And IQVIA is uniquely positioned to deliver based on the differentiated capabilities such as data analytics, advanced technology offerings, and of course, our deep scientific and therapeutic expertise, all of which capabilities were highlighted to our clients during the pandemic.  We are confident that these capabilities will continue to drive strong demand for both our clinical and commercial offerings in 2021 into 2022 and beyond.  As we begin thinking about our plans during 2022, I am pleased to announce that we will be hosting an investor conference in New York City on November 16, where we will update you on our V 22 progress and share our plans for the next phase in IQVIA's evolution. Nick and the team will, of course, provide more details once all the logistics are set and available.  With that, let's review the second quarter in more detail. Revenue for the second quarter grew 36.4% on a reported basis and 33.2% at constant currency. This represents growth that was $176 million above the midpoint of our guidance range. About 40% of this beat came from strong operational performance, and the remainder was from higher pass-throughs.  Second quarter adjusted EBITDA grew 49.5%, reflecting the revenue growth drop-through as well as productivity measures. The $20 million beat above the midpoint of our guidance range was entirely due to the stronger operational performance. Second quarter adjusted diluted EPS of $2.13 grew 80.5%. That was 8% above the midpoint of our guidance range and was driven entirely by the adjusted EBITDA drop-through.  Let me provide a little more update and color on the business during the quarter. Starting with our real-world evidence business. It once again performed well, strengthening its leadership position. This included a recent win with a top 20 pharma client to develop an ophthalmology evidence platform for upcoming product launches. The platform integrates primary and secondary data and layers on AI/ML tools to monitor patient safety in realtime. This will allow this client to add new products and indications to the platform without initiating new studies. This, of course, will save critical amounts of time and money while also reducing the burden on patients and sites.  Turning to our commercial technology business. It continues to increase penetration among top 10 life science companies and emerging biopharma clients. A top 5 pharma client entered during the quarter into a commercial agreement to leverage the IQVIA human data science cloud as part of their core data and digital strategy for one of their large therapeutic areas. This client plans to roll out this platform in over 50 countries to centralize all of their fragmented data assets, resolve data management complexities and improve speed to insights.  Our orchestrated customer engagement offering, OCE, gained additional ground this quarter as 9 new clients adopted the platform for commercial operations, including 2 wins with large biotech clients. One of these OCE biotech clients has the potential for a global rollout to over 20 countries. The other large biotech win represents a competitive win back of the customer-facing team in the U.S. To date, we have 159 client wins for OCE.  Our clinical technology solutions team continued our path to innovation in decentralized clinical trials with the introduction of IQVIA's Clinical Data Analytics Suite or CDAS. This solution builds on our human data science cloud platform, provides life science companies with new approaches to data use and harmonization as well as producing AI/ML and analytics-based insights. As an open scalable cloud platform, CDAS seamlessly works with sponsors' existing data archive and systems. We now have all of the top 10 and 18 out of the top 20 pharma clients using at least one of the several modules within our clinical technology suite.  By connecting the right technology with the right data sources, IQVIA is enabling customers to identify new opportunities to maximize product value, get to market faster, improve departmental and business alignment and reduce costs.  Switching to our R&DS business. During the quarter, it continued to build on its strong momentum, with over $2.5 billion of net new bookings on a 606 basis. In the quarter, we achieved a contracted net book-to-bill ratio of 1.34 including pass-throughs and 1.37 excluding pass-throughs. As of June 30, our LTM contracted book-to-bill ratio was 1.45 including pass-throughs and 1.40 excluding pass-throughs.  Our contracted backlog in R&DS including pass-throughs grew 16.7% year-over-year to $23.9 billion as of June 30, 2021. As a result, our next 12 months' revenue from backlog increased to $6.6 billion, which is up 19.6% year-over-year.  I want to highlight the lab business, which continues to be a key driver of growth and, therefore, will remain an area of strong investments for IQVIA. You'll recall that on April 1, we completed the acquisition of the remaining interest in Q2 Solutions from Quest Diagnostics. Following this transaction, we announced our plans to expand our laboratory operation in Scotland to bolster our investment in cutting-edge technology, including next-generation genomic sequencing and testing.  Also in the quarter, we agreed to acquire Myriad RBM, adding to our capabilities in the lab. RBM specializes in biomarker detection and quantification testing that supports early- and late-phase drug development in key therapeutic areas such as oncology, CNS and immunology. This acquisition fits nicely into our strategy to develop specialized testing and precision medicine to help support drug development with state-of-the-art solutions. These actions further demonstrate our commitment to advancing outcomes in this space, and we are excited to continue to grow and innovate in the lab business. The Myriad RBM transaction is expected to close sometime in the third quarter.  I'll now turn it over to Ron for more details on our financial performance in the quarter. Ron?\nRonald Bruehlman: Yes. Thanks, Ari, and good morning, everyone. Let me first start with revenue. Second quarter revenue of $3.438 billion grew 36.4% on a reported basis and 33.2% at constant currency. First half revenue was $6.847 billion, growing at 29.8% reported and 27% at constant currency.  Our Technology & Analytics Solutions revenue for the second quarter was $1.353 billion. That was up 22% reported and 17.9% at constant currency. For the first half, Tech & Analytics Solutions revenue was $2.701 billion, up 21.3% reported and 17.5% at constant currency.  R&D Solutions second quarter revenue of $1.891 billion was up 53.1% at actual FX rate and 50.7% at constant currency. Now excluding the impact of pass-through, second quarter R&DS revenue grew 44.6% year-over-year. For the first half, revenue in R&D Solutions was up 44.5% reported and 38.5% at constant currency.  CSMS revenue of $194 million in the quarter grew 9.6% reported and 7.3% on a constant currency basis. And that brings the first half CSMS revenue to $387 million, up 3.8% reported and 1.3% at constant currency.  And moving down the P&L and going to adjusted EBITDA. That was $722 million in the second quarter, which represented growth of 49.5%, bringing first half adjusted EBITDA to $1.466 billion, up 40.3% year-over-year. Second quarter GAAP net income was $175 million, and GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.90. For the first half, we had GAAP net income of $387 million or $1.99 per diluted share.  Adjusted net income was $416 million for the second quarter, and adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 80.5% to $2.13. For the first half, adjusted net income was $841 million or $4.32 per share.  Let's turn briefly to R&D Solutions. As Ari mentioned, we delivered another outstanding quarter of net new business. We see backlog grew 16.7% year-over-year to $23.9 billion at June 30. And next 12 months' revenue from backlog at June 30 stood at $6.6 billion, up 19.6% year-over-year.  Okay. Now on to the balance sheet. At June 30, cash and cash equivalents totaled $1.8 billion, and debt was $12.3 billion, which results in net debt of $10.5 billion. Our net leverage ratio at June 30 came in at 3.74x trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA.  Cash flow was again strong in the quarter. Cash flow from operations was $539 billion -- million and CapEx was $145 million, resulting in free cash flow of $394 million. This brought our free cash flow for the first half of 2021 to over $1.1 billion, which is a material improvement over our 2019 and 2020 results.  In the quarter, we repurchased $45 million of our shares, leaving us with $822 million of share repurchase authorization remaining under our latest program.  And now on to guidance. We're raising our full year 2021 revenue guidance by $275 million at the midpoint, reflecting the strong second quarter and the continued operational momentum that we see in the business. Our new revenue guidance is $13.550 billion to $13.700 billion, which is year-over-year growth of 19.3% to 20.6%. I would note there's no FX impact versus our previous guidance. Compared to prior year FX continues to be a tailwind of 150 basis points to full year revenue growth.  Looking at the segments. We continue to expect full year Technology & Analytics Solutions revenue to grow low to mid-teens and R&D Solutions revenue to grow mid- to high 20s, while we now expect the CSMS business to be up low single digits.  You saw that we also raised our profit guidance. As a result of the stronger revenue outlook, we've increased our full year adjusted EBITDA guidance by $43 million at the midpoint. Our new full year guidance is $2.950 billion to $3 billion, which represents growth of 23.7% to 25.8%.  Moving to EPS. We adjusted our -- excuse me, we increased our adjusted diluted EPS guidance by $0.18 at the midpoint. Our new guidance range is $8.70 to $8.90, which is growth year-over-year of 35.5% to 38.6%.  Our full year 2021 guidance assumes that June 30 foreign currency rates remain in effect for the second half.  Now to review the revenue guidance for the third quarter. Third quarter revenue is expected to be between $3.290 billion and $3.365 billion, representing growth of 18.1% to 20.8%. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be between $710 million and $730 million, up 17.5% to 20.9%. And finally, adjusted diluted EPS is expected to be between $2.06 and $2.13, growing 26.4% to 30.7%. And again, our third quarter 2021 guidance assumes June 30 foreign currency rates remain in effect for the quarter.  So to summarize, we delivered very strong second quarter results. We had double-digit growth in all key financial metrics. We posted revenue growth of over 20% in our TAS segment and over 50% in R&DS segment. R&DS backlog improved again to $23.9 billion, up 16.7% year-over-year. Next 12 months' revenue from that backlog increased to $6.6 billion. That's up 19.6% year-over-year. We reported another strong quarter of free cash flow. And given the momentum that we see in the business and our strong second quarter results, we're once again raising our full year guidance for revenue, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted diluted EPS.  So with that, let me hand it back over to the operator for questions and answers.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Eric Coldwell with Baird.\nEric Coldwell: I have two questions. Ron, first, congrats on the great cash flow performance year-to-date. I'm just hoping you can give us some more details on where you're making the biggest gains, changes supporting these improvements? And any color commentary on your outlook for the future?  Second question, just COVID-related. It's the typical standard ask: if you could give any insights on COVID revenue in the quarter, bookings, backlog, thoughts on the tail end of 2022, that would be helpful as well.\nRonald Bruehlman: Sure. To your first question, Eric, on cash flow, there are two principal drivers of our strong cash flow performance. The first, of course, would be our earnings growth, which was quite good. But beyond that, we've made substantial progress and continue to make progress in reducing our days sales outstanding. We've had a real focus on that over the past year, bringing down past dues, improving our billing terms with customers, billing sooner because we have substantial unbilled amounts. And all of that has contributed to strong collections.  The one caveat I would say is that some of the COVID-related work does come with some advances that will burn off over time. So we're still targeting to have cash flow in any given year in the range of 80% to 90% of adjusted net income. Now obviously, substantially stronger than that so far this year. I think it's probably about 125% for the first half. And if we can beat that 80% to 90% range, great, but I think that's a good kind of medium-term sort of target for cash flow in a normal environment. But we're very happy with the progress we've made on cash flow and expect cash flow to continue to be strong for the future.\nAri Bousbib: Yes. I mean, Eric, this is -- thank you for highlighting that aspect of our performance in the second quarter. As you know, we were not happy with our cash flow performance back in 2000 -- I guess, in '18, our total yearly free cash flow was $600 million. So just barely half of what the first half performance was this year. In '19, I think it was around $800 million. And last year, in 2020, we bumped that up to $1.3 billion or thereabouts. So we're very, very pleased with our performance, and just for the reasons that Ron highlighted, especially grateful to the finance team for focusing on the management of our receivables, collections and generally, bill-to-cash type of process improvements. That took a lot of efforts but we think we'll continue to pay dividends.  We also remember had committed to investors that we would reduce our leverage ratio from the mid- to high 4s on a net basis to 4 or less by the end of 2022. And I would note that for 2 quarters in a row, we are below that for probably a year earlier. Now again, we might see the average ratio move up and down, depending on circumstances and our spend on M&A and share repurchases. But that's where we are, and we're very pleased with that performance.  The second question you had was on COVID work and how much it represents. I think it's always probably best to look at how much COVID work is in our backlog. And I just want to say that the total -- the large COVID vaccine trials which have represented the bulk of our work in COVID, represent less -- actually much less than 5% of our total backlog. And so that gives you a sense.  And in terms of -- now having said that, we expect COVID work to continue to remain part of our business for the foreseeable future. We expect COVID studies to have a long tail through 2021, well into 2022 and perhaps 2023. There will be a need for vaccines for multiple manufacturers. We still have, in our pipeline, RFPs for vaccine work from different companies around the world. There are new vaccines being developed for the variants. There are alternative vaccines that are being needed for adverse safety events, quality issues, manufacturing delays. And then there are a bunch of novel treatment programs that are targeting specific populations and conditions. So all of that is still in our pipeline. But again, the large vaccine work is less, way less than 5 percentage points of our total backlog including pass-throughs.  So any other commentary you want to make on revenue or impact are really not significant.\nRonald Bruehlman: Well, look, even if you were -- on the revenue side, if you were to pull out all of the COVID-related work, we still have very strong revenue growth, double-digit revenue growth in both the TAS segment and the R&DS segment. So yes, COVID was a contributor in the quarter, but the underlying non-COVID-related work was growing strongly also. And of course, COVID is the reality these days. It's part of the business. We want to participate in that work, and we have been participating in that work.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel.\nShlomo Rosenbaum: I have two questions. One is more of a housekeeping thing. Ron, maybe you could provide the precise organic revenue growth? metrics for each segment, TAS and R&DS.  And then secondly, I wanted to ask you a little bit more about what Ari started out with in terms of the growth in the real-world evidence business. What's the size of the business at this point in time? What was the growth in the quarter? How is that contributing to the overall business growth? And just more detail, it seems like that's a significant differentiator for IQVIA versus a lot of the competition. I thought we could flesh some of that out.\nRonald Bruehlman: Let me take the first question, Shlomo, on organic growth. The contribution of acquisitions in the quarter to our revenue growth was insignificant. If you look back over the past number of quarters, you can see our acquisition activity tailed off quite a bit and is only recently beginning to pick back up. So there's almost no contribution whatsoever of acquisitions to our growth. So organic growth, for all intents and purposes, equals reported growth in those segments.\nNicholas Childs: Yes. And then, Shlomo, on the real-world side, that business is about $1 billion. As we've talked about before, continues to grow double digits. This quarter was high double digits again. Continue to see very, very strong results in that business and continue to deliver for us and drive the pass-through.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of John Kreger with William Blair.\nJohn Kreger: Maybe just a quick follow-up on real-world evidence. I think prior -- previously, this year, you'd talked about doing some significant government COVID tracking work, but that was expected to tail off. What are your current thoughts about the durability of that program? And sort of what are you assuming in your guidance for the year?\nNicholas Childs: John, we're expecting that work to continue through the balance of the year, but it will be less contribution in the second half than the first half. We'll see whether it continues on into 2023 or not. That sort of work tends to be pretty quick burn and rapidly changing, but we do expect some incremental contribution from the government COVID-related work through the balance of the year. Think particular, when you get into the fourth quarter, the compare to last year's fourth quarter when we had a substantial amount of it is going to be negative. But you see overall, for our implied fourth quarter guidance, that it remains very strong for the company as a whole.\nJohn Kreger: Ron, that's helpful. And maybe a follow-up. Can you guys just talk a little bit about the staffing environment? We hear a lot about labor shortage. Just curious if you're seeing any constraints in your ability to recruit and hire and if that's driving any pressure on margins.\nAri Bousbib: Yes. Look, it's no secret that given the strength of the industry backdrop, there's obviously strong competition for talent. And it's also no secret that when people need highly qualified talent, they come after IQVIA talent because they know we train people well, and we've got a broad range of skills and training programs. So -- however, we are confident that we'll continue to be able to attract and retain the talent, simply because we are the premier company in the industry and also, frankly, because we've been investing in our employees, especially during the pandemic. We've been looking after our employees. We didn't restructure. We continue to pay our people well.  Now does it cause a certain amount of anxiety in the industry? And yes, it's true. And has it caused some level of wage inflation? Yes, that is true. There is also a little bit of an uptick in attrition levels as a consequence of all of that. All of that is true. But again, we feel confident. We do not anticipate this to cause any significant -- there will be some level of headwind to our margins, but we have so many programs and productivity measures and process improvement measures in place that we are confident we will overrun. And you could see that our margins have been performing very well and growing faster than we had anticipated.\nRonald Bruehlman: Yes. John, obviously, any cost pressure we're feeling is fully baked into our 2021 guidance.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan.\nTycho Peterson: Ari, on the 16.7% backlog growth, I'm just wondering if you could provide any more color. How much of this, in your view, is kind of pent-up demand, catch-up work? And then any kind of lingering concerns around site accessibility and the variant potentially impacting conversion in the back half of the year?\nAri Bousbib: Well, obviously, you've got a compare issue quarter-over-quarter that's driving some of that -- those just unusually high growth rates. But I think we've got a combination of a lot of factors: one, catch-up work. You're correct. I mean there's a lot of work that was done last year remotely. And we still need to have site document -- on-site document verification activities that need to take place. So that's another boost to our growth. Thirdly, there is the simple fact that projects that were supposed to get started last year were pushed to the right. And so that also has a demand. Fourthly, we've been gaining market share. We've been saying it over and over again. And I think the numbers are pretty clear. Given our consistently higher book-to-bill ratios and the size of our revenues, I think the math clearly will indicate that we are gaining share. And we are now beginning to execute on all of these projects that started with some delay last year. And finally, there is the COVID work. So all of that contributes to this very strong growth rates that we have reported.  Your other question which were operational metrics, site access and so on. Look, we are essentially -- I think we could say about 80% or so or approaching 80% into the site access. Given all the flareups, infection grows in different parts of the world. But our guidance for 2021 takes a lot of factors into account, including site accessibility. We also believe we are at a -- some kind -- at critical mass. In other words, at 80%, we can deliver, with a combination of different methods we have perfected in terms of remote visits and so on. It's good to monitor site access as a metric when it sets in the general recovery, but they don't correlate exactly with revenue recognition. There's many other metrics we track: the site startups, which have essentially returned to the baseline of 2019; patient recruitment, which are running at or above the 2019 averages; patient visits, which are essentially close to the pre-pandemic levels.  So all of those -- bottom line, these metrics provide us with the confidence that the non-COVID trial pipeline is not only being awarded, as exemplified by -- as illustrated by our strong bookings, but also, it's starting to be delivered, meaning the sites are enrolling, the patients are enrolling and the patient visits are taking place. So I hope that clarifies where we are operationally in R&DS.\nTycho Peterson: That's helpful. And then for a follow-up, 2 quick ones. I'm wondering if you can update us on the orchestrated clinical trial rollout, how that's going. And then separately, on the acquisitions. I understand they're not big revenue contributors. I'm just curious if the accretion assumptions have changed. I think you've previously talked about $0.12 accretion from the Q2 acquisition. I just want to make sure that's still case.\nAri Bousbib: You ask about decentralized, right?\nRonald Bruehlman: That's what's -- okay.\nAri Bousbib: Yes. That, we'll see here. Yes. Again, on the acquisition, just to clarify, on the 40% acquisition of the minority Q2 of the lab that we didn't own, there was 0 impact on revenue and EBITDA since we already consolidated as we were 60% owner. But there was this accretion on -- there's accretion on the bottom line. And all of the accretion, you have the exact number for the base -- for Q2?\nRonald Bruehlman: $0.12.\nAri Bousbib: For the balance of the year?\nRonald Bruehlman: For the balance of the year. We put that into our guidance.\nAri Bousbib: That's in the guidance?\nRonald Bruehlman: Yes.\nAri Bousbib: That was already done.\nRonald Bruehlman: That was already done.\nAri Bousbib: By the time. Nothing has changed on -- now I'm not clear on your first question. Was it about the centralized trials, about OCT?\nTycho Peterson: It was about the orchestrated clinical trials, OCT, the suite launch and how that's going.\nAri Bousbib: Okay. Fine. So that's going well. I mentioned in my introductory remarks that every single one of our -- of the top 10 pharma clients is using 1 module of our clinical technology suite and 18 of the top 20. So we are gaining ground and making progress. The -- essentially all of the suites have been launched and most modules are being used, and the sales pipeline continues to increase. We see a lot of interest from our clients for the platform itself and also for individual or suites stand-alone modules. We're seeing interest from all customer segments. I talked about the top 20, but it's also true for the mid- and EVP. We have demands for multiple products within the digital patient suite. Some of that is driving some of the growth that you saw on the TAS business. The CDAS suite, which I talked about in my introductory remarks, is -- the Clinical Data Analytics Suite connects structured and nonstructured data from clinical trials into a central repository that creates one version of the truth that allows predictive analytics to be run, et cetera. It's a key benefit for clients, which, as you know, the big vaccine issue in health care is the interoperability of data between customers, between the people who run the trials, like IQVIA in this case, and various competitive applications and data sources. So the CDAS product eliminates the need to reconnect individual applications to each other. And instead, these applications, they connect directly to CDAS and enables to harmonize the data and provide an intuitive and scalable solution to map multiple clinical data sources, enables us to use AI/ML layers of analytics using this single-data ecosystem. So we are very pleased with the progress. Our clients are beginning to understand the value, and we are beginning to penetrate that customer base. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jack Meehan with Nephron Research.\nJack Meehan: Ari, I was hoping you could give a little bit more color on the progress of OCE to now 109 clients. What's the revenue base for this business? And where do you think you are in the growth curve? Is it still in investment mode? Or has the business turned profitable at this point?\nAri Bousbib: Right. I don't think we disclosed how much it represents. But we've said that so far in 2021, we've had 19 client wins, which brings the total since launch, 3.5 years ago, to 159 client wins. We continue to have a disproportionate share of the wins. I think it's 2 out of 3, and that has been consistent. We are performing well with the large pharma deployments, which we have talked about. I think Roche already has 15,000-or-so users in deployment. So we haven't seen any slowdown in the implementation as a result of COVID other than isolated issues, which we dealt with. We even see some deployments that are -- that have accelerated time lines. So the feedback is overall positive. The field reps are very engaged. All is going better than planned for the launch of OCE, which I remind you, was only 3.5 years ago.\nJack Meehan: Great. And then you started by talking about the strength of the funding environment and the VC activity going on. I was wondering if you're seeing any themes emerge from a therapeutic area perspective and how you thought IQVIA was stacked up for that. And one specific area I was hoping you could weigh in on is Alzheimer's and just whether you think that's an area where you could see new investment coming in.\nAri Bousbib: I think, look, the -- undoubtedly, the area where we see the most funding is oncology, especially those subcategories of oncology where it's been difficult to have effective drugs. So people are pouring a lot of VC funds into oncology.  CNS is another area. And Alzheimer's, yes, we've got quite a few things going on there. Cardiovascular, strong growth as well. So I would say these are the -- and of course, immunology, prompted by what happened with the virus and COVID. There's a lot of interest in immunology, and that also, I would say, is the fourth main area of funding.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Dan Leonard with Wells Fargo.\nDaniel Leonard: So hoping, first, you could elaborate a bit more on your decentralized trial offering and maybe update specifically on Study Hub trends.\nAri Bousbib: Yes. I mean, look, as we mentioned, the decentralized trial opportunity was identified well before COVID. We talked about it before. We used to call it virtual trials, hybrid trials. We talked about it and we felt we were making great progress. And then the pandemic happened, and we saw how critical those capabilities were, and that accelerated the development. Basically, it's a combination of remote technologies and digital -- the part of the clinical trial that can be digitized. So the suite, for us, combined eConsent, which you're familiar with, telemedicine, modules, eCOA, and of course, a lot of digital communication. It basically optimizes and virtualizes the relationships between local labs, health care providers when it's necessary. It sort of establishes a virtual network of investigators and care professionals. And what we do is that we agree on preset terms with the investigators that agreed to participate. We have internally operationalized this business and we have a separate team, a decentralized trial team. For example, we've got decentralized clinical trial, clinical research coordinator that can support the sites in a remote way, help navigate technology. This is new for all of the investigators and certainly for the patients. So we need -- we figured out during the pandemic that we needed a centralized team to assist sort of, kind of a help desk, if you will. There are -- there's also -- so there's kind of a sort of a wide growth service to help patients and sites through the decentralized trial process. We also have research nurses and phlebotomy solutions team that build on our global network to support the decentralized studies. So again, we are moving to -- from -- we moved from the pre-2020 piloting phase where we had, I believe, at the time, sort of 60-or-so small trials that essentially were experimental in nature and people wanted to sort of try it out to a maturing phase. We have added many wins. We've -- so far in 2021, I think we have more than a dozen larger decentralized clinical trials that were won. We added new therapeutic areas. We are working with 5 of the top 10 large pharma clients. And I would note that one of the reasons we were able to win so many, a bigger proportion than anyone else of the COVID work, whether it's therapeutic trials or vaccine trial, was our more advanced decentralized trial capability. And again, we cover probably 10-or-so therapeutic areas, nephrology, oncology, psychiatry, CNS, dermatology, et cetera. And it's moving to a more mature phase, and we will speak more about that in the future. Again, in the context of the very large R&DS business we have, it's still not something that's kind of moving the needle in the numbers. Given the very strong growth that we have, it's not materializing. Ron, do you want to add...\nRonald Bruehlman: Yes. Just to put some numbers around what Ari just said, I think we had 81 trials now that are fully deployed on Study Hub. And there's approaching 250 trials or so that have some piece of Study Hub. And at any given point in time, we'll have close to 1,000 full-service clinical trials going on. So it's a piece of our business -- it's a growing piece of our business, but still not the majority of what we're doing.\nDaniel Leonard: Okay. That's very thorough and helpful. And just a quick follow-up to Jack's question earlier. Possible -- I'm curious if you could frame and size the Alzheimer's opportunity for IQVIA. I remember when something had to come out of backlog a couple of years ago, it was rather sizable and been wondering how sizable things coming into backlog could be.\nAri Bousbib: Yes. I don't think it's -- listen, at the time, our bottle was much smaller. When we came out, it was sizable, but it -- we didn't -- it was, like, seamless. We never felt it. It was not an issue at all, neither when it left nor when it came back partially. So I'm not sure what you're referring to. It's not significant. I don't if we disclosed that, but it's not -- it wouldn't be material and would be in the rounding given the size of our backlog.\nRonald Bruehlman: Yes. The current Alzheimer's contribution of our backlog is not material. Now could there be more coming in the future? Sure, we hope there is, but we'll see.\nOperator: Your next question comes from line Patrick Donnelly with Citi.\nPatrick Donnelly: Ari, you touched on M&A a little bit, and obviously, the cash flow performance, where the leverage is. Can you just talk about kind of the landscape, what the pipeline looks like? Obviously, a lot of activity in the space. And then secondarily, given some of the mergers and movements around the space, are you seeing any disruption opportunity for share gains? Any commentary from customers suggesting this is an opportunity for you guys at the moment?\nAri Bousbib: Yes. I mean the latter part of your question refers to the consolidation. And soon enough, we're going to be the only one standing here that's independent. But we -- look, generally, the clinical trial business is an attractive area. It's a high-growth area. It's something that's, well into the long term, going to deliver superior returns, we believe, as an industry, and that is attracting a lot of interest from buyers, whether it's private equity or other large entities that want to -- are in search of accelerate -- opportunities to accelerate their revenue or profit growth. So that -- all of that is good news for our industry. In terms of what are the consequences strategically, operationally, I think it's pretty clear that -- first of all, we don't need to \"participate.\" Obviously, we look every time, and most of these companies have been shopped to us obviously. We look at these companies. And in cases, we've passed because we think the valuations or our ability to gain share does not require us to buy or to participate in this M&A trend. It's hard to gain a lot when you -- for a CRO to acquire another CRO. I mean there are opportunities to complement capabilities, whether it's therapeutic-wise or geographic-wise, that could be areas of the business, preclinical Phase I, Phase II, Phase III complementary strengths. So again, these are the 3 dimensions: geography, therapy areas or stage in the drug development process that could lend themselves to more or less complementarity overlap. Now the consolidation has taken place thus provide opportunities. As you know, I said before, we have been, like, gaining share significantly so we don't need to do that. It is a fact that when there is a large merger or large acquisition, there is disruption. We believe it ourselves. So there is generally a loss of talent. We are seeing it for -- coming from others. And there is, generally, a desire by customers to keep 2, 3 or 4 providers. And so if providers overlap when they serve the same customer, you can expect that the sponsor will look to further diversify their provider base. So all of this is true. Look, we -- both talent and customers are -- present opportunities, but we're not so focused on this. We just -- we're focused on executing on our strategy. It's worked so far, and we're confident it will continue to work. Other acquisitions, obviously, we're looking at things. As always, there's a rich pipeline always. You've noted we haven't done much last year. We haven't done much this year so far, save for the Q2 minority acquisition. But we are looking at other things, always in the technology space. And we have a rich pipeline. It's just -- it's a binary thing. Acquisition happen or they don't happen. So I can't really talk much about that.\nPatrick Donnelly: No. That's helpful. And maybe just a quick follow-up. CSMS doesn't get the most airtime, but it's nice to see the recovery ongoing. I think you bumped guidance from low single-digit declines to low single-digit growth. Can you just talk about the market recovery going on there and the outlook?\nAri Bousbib: Yes. I mean, look, a lot of clients did not cancel contracts last year because they didn't know how long this was going to last. And while our field reps weren't able to actually be in the field, but many of them remained on the bench with contracts kind of suspended or renegotiated. That caused some disruption. And as we have begun turning the business around but -- so it slipped and went back into the red in terms of revenue growth. But now we're seeing that we are going back -- and I mean, look, this is never going to be a double-digit grower, I don't think. So this is the best it's going to be, single-digit growth. And we are managing it. It's becoming less of a flash point, simply because in the size of our company and the growth of the rest of the business, this is becoming relatively small. Now look, you will recall that we -- shortly after the merger, nearly 5 years ago, we tried to sell it as a whole. We then found that it wouldn't fetch much of a value. And therefore, we pulled the business, integrated it into our regions. It's very integrated now into our commercial operations. There are contracts which is very useful. In fact, I've mentioned before, the decentralized trial business, where we are using nurses from that -- from the CSMS business to help with the virtual aspects for the -- going to visit patients at home and so on. So there's kind of an added value. It's not going to move the needle one way or the other as it used to be in the old Quintiles days or in the early IQVIA days. Okay. Last question, Nick?\nNicholas Childs: Last one, yes.\nOperator: Our last question comes from the line with Sandy Draper with Truist Securities.\nAlexander Draper: This should be a pretty quick one. Ron, just when I look at the third quarter guidance, looking down sequentially, I just want to confirm, I would assume most of that is because of an expected decline in pass-through revenue and R&D. Is anything else...\nRonald Bruehlman: Yes. That's really the driver. You're correct, Sandy.\nAlexander Draper: Okay. That's my question. Congrats.\nAri Bousbib: Thank you, guys.\nNicholas Childs: That's it. Well, thank you, everyone, for joining us today. We look forward to speaking to all of you again on our third quarter call. Me and this team will be available later for any follow-up calls you -- follow-up questions you might have and look forward to talking to you. Thanks, everyone.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Ronald Bruehlman",
            "content": "Yes. Thanks, Ari, and good morning, everyone. Let me first start with revenue. Second quarter revenue of $3.438 billion grew 36.4% on a reported basis and 33.2% at constant currency. First half revenue was $6.847 billion, growing at 29.8% reported and 27% at constant currency.  Our Technology & Analytics Solutions revenue for the second quarter was $1.353 billion. That was up 22% reported and 17.9% at constant currency. For the first half, Tech & Analytics Solutions revenue was $2.701 billion, up 21.3% reported and 17.5% at constant currency.  R&D Solutions second quarter revenue of $1.891 billion was up 53.1% at actual FX rate and 50.7% at constant currency. Now excluding the impact of pass-through, second quarter R&DS revenue grew 44.6% year-over-year. For the first half, revenue in R&D Solutions was up 44.5% reported and 38.5% at constant currency.  CSMS revenue of $194 million in the quarter grew 9.6% reported and 7.3% on a constant currency basis. And that brings the first half CSMS revenue to $387 million, up 3.8% reported and 1.3% at constant currency.  And moving down the P&L and going to adjusted EBITDA. That was $722 million in the second quarter, which represented growth of 49.5%, bringing first half adjusted EBITDA to $1.466 billion, up 40.3% year-over-year. Second quarter GAAP net income was $175 million, and GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.90. For the first half, we had GAAP net income of $387 million or $1.99 per diluted share.  Adjusted net income was $416 million for the second quarter, and adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 80.5% to $2.13. For the first half, adjusted net income was $841 million or $4.32 per share.  Let's turn briefly to R&D Solutions. As Ari mentioned, we delivered another outstanding quarter of net new business. We see backlog grew 16.7% year-over-year to $23.9 billion at June 30. And next 12 months' revenue from backlog at June 30 stood at $6.6 billion, up 19.6% year-over-year.  Okay. Now on to the balance sheet. At June 30, cash and cash equivalents totaled $1.8 billion, and debt was $12.3 billion, which results in net debt of $10.5 billion. Our net leverage ratio at June 30 came in at 3.74x trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA.  Cash flow was again strong in the quarter. Cash flow from operations was $539 billion -- million and CapEx was $145 million, resulting in free cash flow of $394 million. This brought our free cash flow for the first half of 2021 to over $1.1 billion, which is a material improvement over our 2019 and 2020 results.  In the quarter, we repurchased $45 million of our shares, leaving us with $822 million of share repurchase authorization remaining under our latest program.  And now on to guidance. We're raising our full year 2021 revenue guidance by $275 million at the midpoint, reflecting the strong second quarter and the continued operational momentum that we see in the business. Our new revenue guidance is $13.550 billion to $13.700 billion, which is year-over-year growth of 19.3% to 20.6%. I would note there's no FX impact versus our previous guidance. Compared to prior year FX continues to be a tailwind of 150 basis points to full year revenue growth.  Looking at the segments. We continue to expect full year Technology & Analytics Solutions revenue to grow low to mid-teens and R&D Solutions revenue to grow mid- to high 20s, while we now expect the CSMS business to be up low single digits.  You saw that we also raised our profit guidance. As a result of the stronger revenue outlook, we've increased our full year adjusted EBITDA guidance by $43 million at the midpoint. Our new full year guidance is $2.950 billion to $3 billion, which represents growth of 23.7% to 25.8%.  Moving to EPS. We adjusted our -- excuse me, we increased our adjusted diluted EPS guidance by $0.18 at the midpoint. Our new guidance range is $8.70 to $8.90, which is growth year-over-year of 35.5% to 38.6%.  Our full year 2021 guidance assumes that June 30 foreign currency rates remain in effect for the second half.  Now to review the revenue guidance for the third quarter. Third quarter revenue is expected to be between $3.290 billion and $3.365 billion, representing growth of 18.1% to 20.8%. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be between $710 million and $730 million, up 17.5% to 20.9%. And finally, adjusted diluted EPS is expected to be between $2.06 and $2.13, growing 26.4% to 30.7%. And again, our third quarter 2021 guidance assumes June 30 foreign currency rates remain in effect for the quarter.  So to summarize, we delivered very strong second quarter results. We had double-digit growth in all key financial metrics. We posted revenue growth of over 20% in our TAS segment and over 50% in R&DS segment. R&DS backlog improved again to $23.9 billion, up 16.7% year-over-year. Next 12 months' revenue from that backlog increased to $6.6 billion. That's up 19.6% year-over-year. We reported another strong quarter of free cash flow. And given the momentum that we see in the business and our strong second quarter results, we're once again raising our full year guidance for revenue, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted diluted EPS.  So with that, let me hand it back over to the operator for questions and answers. Sure. To your first question, Eric, on cash flow, there are two principal drivers of our strong cash flow performance. The first, of course, would be our earnings growth, which was quite good. But beyond that, we've made substantial progress and continue to make progress in reducing our days sales outstanding. We've had a real focus on that over the past year, bringing down past dues, improving our billing terms with customers, billing sooner because we have substantial unbilled amounts. And all of that has contributed to strong collections.  The one caveat I would say is that some of the COVID-related work does come with some advances that will burn off over time. So we're still targeting to have cash flow in any given year in the range of 80% to 90% of adjusted net income. Now obviously, substantially stronger than that so far this year. I think it's probably about 125% for the first half. And if we can beat that 80% to 90% range, great, but I think that's a good kind of medium-term sort of target for cash flow in a normal environment. But we're very happy with the progress we've made on cash flow and expect cash flow to continue to be strong for the future. Well, look, even if you were -- on the revenue side, if you were to pull out all of the COVID-related work, we still have very strong revenue growth, double-digit revenue growth in both the TAS segment and the R&DS segment. So yes, COVID was a contributor in the quarter, but the underlying non-COVID-related work was growing strongly also. And of course, COVID is the reality these days. It's part of the business. We want to participate in that work, and we have been participating in that work. Let me take the first question, Shlomo, on organic growth. The contribution of acquisitions in the quarter to our revenue growth was insignificant. If you look back over the past number of quarters, you can see our acquisition activity tailed off quite a bit and is only recently beginning to pick back up. So there's almost no contribution whatsoever of acquisitions to our growth. So organic growth, for all intents and purposes, equals reported growth in those segments. Yes. John, obviously, any cost pressure we're feeling is fully baked into our 2021 guidance. That's what's -- okay. $0.12. For the balance of the year. We put that into our guidance. Yes. That was already done. Yes. Just to put some numbers around what Ari just said, I think we had 81 trials now that are fully deployed on Study Hub. And there's approaching 250 trials or so that have some piece of Study Hub. And at any given point in time, we'll have close to 1,000 full-service clinical trials going on. So it's a piece of our business -- it's a growing piece of our business, but still not the majority of what we're doing. Yes. The current Alzheimer's contribution of our backlog is not material. Now could there be more coming in the future? Sure, we hope there is, but we'll see. Yes. That's really the driver. You're correct, Sandy."

            "name": "Ari Bousbib",
            "content": "Thank you, Nick, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining today. This morning, we reported second quarter results with outstanding double-digit growth in all key financial metrics. Following the strong performance, we've once again raised our guidance for the year. As you recall, we're tracking ahead of our pre-COVID V 22 financial plan.  The health of the life sciences industry continues to strengthen. New clinical trial starts are trending well above recent historical figures. They are up 22% versus 2020 levels and up 7% compared to 2019. The pipeline of late-stage molecules continues to expand to record numbers, indicating a large backlog of potential launches, some of which have been pushed to the right during the pandemic last year.  And finally, biotech funding continues to increase significantly. According to the National Venture Capital Association, funding totaled $25 billion in the first half of 2021. This represents an increase of 64% compared to the first half of 2020, which itself was already a record first half year.  During 2020, the pandemic disrupted execution of clinical trials and businesses requiring face-to-face interactions. But at the same time, it accelerated change in the industry. It created new demand for new services. And IQVIA is uniquely positioned to deliver based on the differentiated capabilities such as data analytics, advanced technology offerings, and of course, our deep scientific and therapeutic expertise, all of which capabilities were highlighted to our clients during the pandemic.  We are confident that these capabilities will continue to drive strong demand for both our clinical and commercial offerings in 2021 into 2022 and beyond.  As we begin thinking about our plans during 2022, I am pleased to announce that we will be hosting an investor conference in New York City on November 16, where we will update you on our V 22 progress and share our plans for the next phase in IQVIA's evolution. Nick and the team will, of course, provide more details once all the logistics are set and available.  With that, let's review the second quarter in more detail. Revenue for the second quarter grew 36.4% on a reported basis and 33.2% at constant currency. This represents growth that was $176 million above the midpoint of our guidance range. About 40% of this beat came from strong operational performance, and the remainder was from higher pass-throughs.  Second quarter adjusted EBITDA grew 49.5%, reflecting the revenue growth drop-through as well as productivity measures. The $20 million beat above the midpoint of our guidance range was entirely due to the stronger operational performance. Second quarter adjusted diluted EPS of $2.13 grew 80.5%. That was 8% above the midpoint of our guidance range and was driven entirely by the adjusted EBITDA drop-through.  Let me provide a little more update and color on the business during the quarter. Starting with our real-world evidence business. It once again performed well, strengthening its leadership position. This included a recent win with a top 20 pharma client to develop an ophthalmology evidence platform for upcoming product launches. The platform integrates primary and secondary data and layers on AI/ML tools to monitor patient safety in realtime. This will allow this client to add new products and indications to the platform without initiating new studies. This, of course, will save critical amounts of time and money while also reducing the burden on patients and sites.  Turning to our commercial technology business. It continues to increase penetration among top 10 life science companies and emerging biopharma clients. A top 5 pharma client entered during the quarter into a commercial agreement to leverage the IQVIA human data science cloud as part of their core data and digital strategy for one of their large therapeutic areas. This client plans to roll out this platform in over 50 countries to centralize all of their fragmented data assets, resolve data management complexities and improve speed to insights.  Our orchestrated customer engagement offering, OCE, gained additional ground this quarter as 9 new clients adopted the platform for commercial operations, including 2 wins with large biotech clients. One of these OCE biotech clients has the potential for a global rollout to over 20 countries. The other large biotech win represents a competitive win back of the customer-facing team in the U.S. To date, we have 159 client wins for OCE.  Our clinical technology solutions team continued our path to innovation in decentralized clinical trials with the introduction of IQVIA's Clinical Data Analytics Suite or CDAS. This solution builds on our human data science cloud platform, provides life science companies with new approaches to data use and harmonization as well as producing AI/ML and analytics-based insights. As an open scalable cloud platform, CDAS seamlessly works with sponsors' existing data archive and systems. We now have all of the top 10 and 18 out of the top 20 pharma clients using at least one of the several modules within our clinical technology suite.  By connecting the right technology with the right data sources, IQVIA is enabling customers to identify new opportunities to maximize product value, get to market faster, improve departmental and business alignment and reduce costs.  Switching to our R&DS business. During the quarter, it continued to build on its strong momentum, with over $2.5 billion of net new bookings on a 606 basis. In the quarter, we achieved a contracted net book-to-bill ratio of 1.34 including pass-throughs and 1.37 excluding pass-throughs. As of June 30, our LTM contracted book-to-bill ratio was 1.45 including pass-throughs and 1.40 excluding pass-throughs.  Our contracted backlog in R&DS including pass-throughs grew 16.7% year-over-year to $23.9 billion as of June 30, 2021. As a result, our next 12 months' revenue from backlog increased to $6.6 billion, which is up 19.6% year-over-year.  I want to highlight the lab business, which continues to be a key driver of growth and, therefore, will remain an area of strong investments for IQVIA. You'll recall that on April 1, we completed the acquisition of the remaining interest in Q2 Solutions from Quest Diagnostics. Following this transaction, we announced our plans to expand our laboratory operation in Scotland to bolster our investment in cutting-edge technology, including next-generation genomic sequencing and testing.  Also in the quarter, we agreed to acquire Myriad RBM, adding to our capabilities in the lab. RBM specializes in biomarker detection and quantification testing that supports early- and late-phase drug development in key therapeutic areas such as oncology, CNS and immunology. This acquisition fits nicely into our strategy to develop specialized testing and precision medicine to help support drug development with state-of-the-art solutions. These actions further demonstrate our commitment to advancing outcomes in this space, and we are excited to continue to grow and innovate in the lab business. The Myriad RBM transaction is expected to close sometime in the third quarter.  I'll now turn it over to Ron for more details on our financial performance in the quarter. Ron? Yes. I mean, Eric, this is -- thank you for highlighting that aspect of our performance in the second quarter. As you know, we were not happy with our cash flow performance back in 2000 -- I guess, in '18, our total yearly free cash flow was $600 million. So just barely half of what the first half performance was this year. In '19, I think it was around $800 million. And last year, in 2020, we bumped that up to $1.3 billion or thereabouts. So we're very, very pleased with our performance, and just for the reasons that Ron highlighted, especially grateful to the finance team for focusing on the management of our receivables, collections and generally, bill-to-cash type of process improvements. That took a lot of efforts but we think we'll continue to pay dividends.  We also remember had committed to investors that we would reduce our leverage ratio from the mid- to high 4s on a net basis to 4 or less by the end of 2022. And I would note that for 2 quarters in a row, we are below that for probably a year earlier. Now again, we might see the average ratio move up and down, depending on circumstances and our spend on M&A and share repurchases. But that's where we are, and we're very pleased with that performance.  The second question you had was on COVID work and how much it represents. I think it's always probably best to look at how much COVID work is in our backlog. And I just want to say that the total -- the large COVID vaccine trials which have represented the bulk of our work in COVID, represent less -- actually much less than 5% of our total backlog. And so that gives you a sense.  And in terms of -- now having said that, we expect COVID work to continue to remain part of our business for the foreseeable future. We expect COVID studies to have a long tail through 2021, well into 2022 and perhaps 2023. There will be a need for vaccines for multiple manufacturers. We still have, in our pipeline, RFPs for vaccine work from different companies around the world. There are new vaccines being developed for the variants. There are alternative vaccines that are being needed for adverse safety events, quality issues, manufacturing delays. And then there are a bunch of novel treatment programs that are targeting specific populations and conditions. So all of that is still in our pipeline. But again, the large vaccine work is less, way less than 5 percentage points of our total backlog including pass-throughs.  So any other commentary you want to make on revenue or impact are really not significant. Yes. Look, it's no secret that given the strength of the industry backdrop, there's obviously strong competition for talent. And it's also no secret that when people need highly qualified talent, they come after IQVIA talent because they know we train people well, and we've got a broad range of skills and training programs. So -- however, we are confident that we'll continue to be able to attract and retain the talent, simply because we are the premier company in the industry and also, frankly, because we've been investing in our employees, especially during the pandemic. We've been looking after our employees. We didn't restructure. We continue to pay our people well.  Now does it cause a certain amount of anxiety in the industry? And yes, it's true. And has it caused some level of wage inflation? Yes, that is true. There is also a little bit of an uptick in attrition levels as a consequence of all of that. All of that is true. But again, we feel confident. We do not anticipate this to cause any significant -- there will be some level of headwind to our margins, but we have so many programs and productivity measures and process improvement measures in place that we are confident we will overrun. And you could see that our margins have been performing very well and growing faster than we had anticipated. Well, obviously, you've got a compare issue quarter-over-quarter that's driving some of that -- those just unusually high growth rates. But I think we've got a combination of a lot of factors: one, catch-up work. You're correct. I mean there's a lot of work that was done last year remotely. And we still need to have site document -- on-site document verification activities that need to take place. So that's another boost to our growth. Thirdly, there is the simple fact that projects that were supposed to get started last year were pushed to the right. And so that also has a demand. Fourthly, we've been gaining market share. We've been saying it over and over again. And I think the numbers are pretty clear. Given our consistently higher book-to-bill ratios and the size of our revenues, I think the math clearly will indicate that we are gaining share. And we are now beginning to execute on all of these projects that started with some delay last year. And finally, there is the COVID work. So all of that contributes to this very strong growth rates that we have reported.  Your other question which were operational metrics, site access and so on. Look, we are essentially -- I think we could say about 80% or so or approaching 80% into the site access. Given all the flareups, infection grows in different parts of the world. But our guidance for 2021 takes a lot of factors into account, including site accessibility. We also believe we are at a -- some kind -- at critical mass. In other words, at 80%, we can deliver, with a combination of different methods we have perfected in terms of remote visits and so on. It's good to monitor site access as a metric when it sets in the general recovery, but they don't correlate exactly with revenue recognition. There's many other metrics we track: the site startups, which have essentially returned to the baseline of 2019; patient recruitment, which are running at or above the 2019 averages; patient visits, which are essentially close to the pre-pandemic levels.  So all of those -- bottom line, these metrics provide us with the confidence that the non-COVID trial pipeline is not only being awarded, as exemplified by -- as illustrated by our strong bookings, but also, it's starting to be delivered, meaning the sites are enrolling, the patients are enrolling and the patient visits are taking place. So I hope that clarifies where we are operationally in R&DS. You ask about decentralized, right? Yes. That, we'll see here. Yes. Again, on the acquisition, just to clarify, on the 40% acquisition of the minority Q2 of the lab that we didn't own, there was 0 impact on revenue and EBITDA since we already consolidated as we were 60% owner. But there was this accretion on -- there's accretion on the bottom line. And all of the accretion, you have the exact number for the base -- for Q2? For the balance of the year? That's in the guidance? That was already done. By the time. Nothing has changed on -- now I'm not clear on your first question. Was it about the centralized trials, about OCT? Okay. Fine. So that's going well. I mentioned in my introductory remarks that every single one of our -- of the top 10 pharma clients is using 1 module of our clinical technology suite and 18 of the top 20. So we are gaining ground and making progress. The -- essentially all of the suites have been launched and most modules are being used, and the sales pipeline continues to increase. We see a lot of interest from our clients for the platform itself and also for individual or suites stand-alone modules. We're seeing interest from all customer segments. I talked about the top 20, but it's also true for the mid- and EVP. We have demands for multiple products within the digital patient suite. Some of that is driving some of the growth that you saw on the TAS business. The CDAS suite, which I talked about in my introductory remarks, is -- the Clinical Data Analytics Suite connects structured and nonstructured data from clinical trials into a central repository that creates one version of the truth that allows predictive analytics to be run, et cetera. It's a key benefit for clients, which, as you know, the big vaccine issue in health care is the interoperability of data between customers, between the people who run the trials, like IQVIA in this case, and various competitive applications and data sources. So the CDAS product eliminates the need to reconnect individual applications to each other. And instead, these applications, they connect directly to CDAS and enables to harmonize the data and provide an intuitive and scalable solution to map multiple clinical data sources, enables us to use AI/ML layers of analytics using this single-data ecosystem. So we are very pleased with the progress. Our clients are beginning to understand the value, and we are beginning to penetrate that customer base. Thank you. Right. I don't think we disclosed how much it represents. But we've said that so far in 2021, we've had 19 client wins, which brings the total since launch, 3.5 years ago, to 159 client wins. We continue to have a disproportionate share of the wins. I think it's 2 out of 3, and that has been consistent. We are performing well with the large pharma deployments, which we have talked about. I think Roche already has 15,000-or-so users in deployment. So we haven't seen any slowdown in the implementation as a result of COVID other than isolated issues, which we dealt with. We even see some deployments that are -- that have accelerated time lines. So the feedback is overall positive. The field reps are very engaged. All is going better than planned for the launch of OCE, which I remind you, was only 3.5 years ago. I think, look, the -- undoubtedly, the area where we see the most funding is oncology, especially those subcategories of oncology where it's been difficult to have effective drugs. So people are pouring a lot of VC funds into oncology.  CNS is another area. And Alzheimer's, yes, we've got quite a few things going on there. Cardiovascular, strong growth as well. So I would say these are the -- and of course, immunology, prompted by what happened with the virus and COVID. There's a lot of interest in immunology, and that also, I would say, is the fourth main area of funding. Yes. I mean, look, as we mentioned, the decentralized trial opportunity was identified well before COVID. We talked about it before. We used to call it virtual trials, hybrid trials. We talked about it and we felt we were making great progress. And then the pandemic happened, and we saw how critical those capabilities were, and that accelerated the development. Basically, it's a combination of remote technologies and digital -- the part of the clinical trial that can be digitized. So the suite, for us, combined eConsent, which you're familiar with, telemedicine, modules, eCOA, and of course, a lot of digital communication. It basically optimizes and virtualizes the relationships between local labs, health care providers when it's necessary. It sort of establishes a virtual network of investigators and care professionals. And what we do is that we agree on preset terms with the investigators that agreed to participate. We have internally operationalized this business and we have a separate team, a decentralized trial team. For example, we've got decentralized clinical trial, clinical research coordinator that can support the sites in a remote way, help navigate technology. This is new for all of the investigators and certainly for the patients. So we need -- we figured out during the pandemic that we needed a centralized team to assist sort of, kind of a help desk, if you will. There are -- there's also -- so there's kind of a sort of a wide growth service to help patients and sites through the decentralized trial process. We also have research nurses and phlebotomy solutions team that build on our global network to support the decentralized studies. So again, we are moving to -- from -- we moved from the pre-2020 piloting phase where we had, I believe, at the time, sort of 60-or-so small trials that essentially were experimental in nature and people wanted to sort of try it out to a maturing phase. We have added many wins. We've -- so far in 2021, I think we have more than a dozen larger decentralized clinical trials that were won. We added new therapeutic areas. We are working with 5 of the top 10 large pharma clients. And I would note that one of the reasons we were able to win so many, a bigger proportion than anyone else of the COVID work, whether it's therapeutic trials or vaccine trial, was our more advanced decentralized trial capability. And again, we cover probably 10-or-so therapeutic areas, nephrology, oncology, psychiatry, CNS, dermatology, et cetera. And it's moving to a more mature phase, and we will speak more about that in the future. Again, in the context of the very large R&DS business we have, it's still not something that's kind of moving the needle in the numbers. Given the very strong growth that we have, it's not materializing. Ron, do you want to add... Yes. I don't think it's -- listen, at the time, our bottle was much smaller. When we came out, it was sizable, but it -- we didn't -- it was, like, seamless. We never felt it. It was not an issue at all, neither when it left nor when it came back partially. So I'm not sure what you're referring to. It's not significant. I don't if we disclosed that, but it's not -- it wouldn't be material and would be in the rounding given the size of our backlog. Yes. I mean the latter part of your question refers to the consolidation. And soon enough, we're going to be the only one standing here that's independent. But we -- look, generally, the clinical trial business is an attractive area. It's a high-growth area. It's something that's, well into the long term, going to deliver superior returns, we believe, as an industry, and that is attracting a lot of interest from buyers, whether it's private equity or other large entities that want to -- are in search of accelerate -- opportunities to accelerate their revenue or profit growth. So that -- all of that is good news for our industry. In terms of what are the consequences strategically, operationally, I think it's pretty clear that -- first of all, we don't need to \"participate.\" Obviously, we look every time, and most of these companies have been shopped to us obviously. We look at these companies. And in cases, we've passed because we think the valuations or our ability to gain share does not require us to buy or to participate in this M&A trend. It's hard to gain a lot when you -- for a CRO to acquire another CRO. I mean there are opportunities to complement capabilities, whether it's therapeutic-wise or geographic-wise, that could be areas of the business, preclinical Phase I, Phase II, Phase III complementary strengths. So again, these are the 3 dimensions: geography, therapy areas or stage in the drug development process that could lend themselves to more or less complementarity overlap. Now the consolidation has taken place thus provide opportunities. As you know, I said before, we have been, like, gaining share significantly so we don't need to do that. It is a fact that when there is a large merger or large acquisition, there is disruption. We believe it ourselves. So there is generally a loss of talent. We are seeing it for -- coming from others. And there is, generally, a desire by customers to keep 2, 3 or 4 providers. And so if providers overlap when they serve the same customer, you can expect that the sponsor will look to further diversify their provider base. So all of this is true. Look, we -- both talent and customers are -- present opportunities, but we're not so focused on this. We just -- we're focused on executing on our strategy. It's worked so far, and we're confident it will continue to work. Other acquisitions, obviously, we're looking at things. As always, there's a rich pipeline always. You've noted we haven't done much last year. We haven't done much this year so far, save for the Q2 minority acquisition. But we are looking at other things, always in the technology space. And we have a rich pipeline. It's just -- it's a binary thing. Acquisition happen or they don't happen. So I can't really talk much about that. Yes. I mean, look, a lot of clients did not cancel contracts last year because they didn't know how long this was going to last. And while our field reps weren't able to actually be in the field, but many of them remained on the bench with contracts kind of suspended or renegotiated. That caused some disruption. And as we have begun turning the business around but -- so it slipped and went back into the red in terms of revenue growth. But now we're seeing that we are going back -- and I mean, look, this is never going to be a double-digit grower, I don't think. So this is the best it's going to be, single-digit growth. And we are managing it. It's becoming less of a flash point, simply because in the size of our company and the growth of the rest of the business, this is becoming relatively small. Now look, you will recall that we -- shortly after the merger, nearly 5 years ago, we tried to sell it as a whole. We then found that it wouldn't fetch much of a value. And therefore, we pulled the business, integrated it into our regions. It's very integrated now into our commercial operations. There are contracts which is very useful. In fact, I've mentioned before, the decentralized trial business, where we are using nurses from that -- from the CSMS business to help with the virtual aspects for the -- going to visit patients at home and so on. So there's kind of an added value. It's not going to move the needle one way or the other as it used to be in the old Quintiles days or in the early IQVIA days. Okay. Last question, Nick? Thank you, guys."

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker's remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Andrew Markwick, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasury. Mr. Markwick, please begin your conference.\nAndrew Markwick: Thank you, Casey. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our First Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. With me today are, Ari Bousbib, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Ron Bruehlman, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Eric Sherbet, Executive Vice President and General Counsel; Nick Childs, Senior Vice President, Financial Planning and Analysis, and newcomer for this call, Bryan Stengel, Associate Director, Investor Relations and Bryan has succeeded [indiscernible] HealthTech. Today we will be referencing a presentation that will be visible during this call for those of you on our webcast. This presentation will also be available following this call on the Events and Presentations section of our IQVIA Investor Relations website at ir.iqvia.com. Before we begin, I would like to caution listeners that certain information discussed by management during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those stated or implied by forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties associated with the company's business, which are discussed in the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings. In addition, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures on this call, which should be considered a supplement to and not a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the comparable GAAP measures is included in the press release and conference call presentation. I would now like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Ari Bousbib.\nAri Bousbib : Good morning everyone and thank you, Andrew. Welcome and thank you for joining us today. This morning we reported first quarter results with strong double-digit growth in all key financial metrics and as a result of this performance and an improved outlook for the rest of the year, we have once again raised our guidance. The 2021 guidance that we provided to you last quarter was already within reach of our original pre-COVID plans for 2021. Our revised guidance today significantly exceed those original plans. In many ways, 2020 was a reset year for our company and also for the industry. We've been saying for a long time that the traditional timelines for the development of new drugs are too long. The speed at which COVID vaccines were developed in 2020 has obviously raised the bar in terms of what expectations should be. The crisis accelerated the adoption of new technologies and we believe it will force a lasting change in how innovative medicines are developed and commercialize. All of this has made IQVIA even more relevant to our clients and has highlighted the power of our differentiated offerings. The deep client engagements that we had during the pandemic demonstrated how uniquely positioned we are to bring new insights and expertise that can improve drug development and commercial fine lines. What is also becoming clear is that there is a lot of pent-up demand due to one, the many trials that were slowed down or temporary pushed to the right and two, the trials that did not get started as they were crowded out by the COVID resolution efforts on which everyone was focused. These pent-up demand across therapy areas, combined with record levels of biotech funding provides a very strong backdrop for our industry. As a result of these favorable conditions, we've started the process of revisiting our Vision 2022 goals. We plan to update you later this year on our Vision 2022 progress and lay the groundwork for the next phase of our journey. We may do this at an Investor Conference later this year, especially if we are able to hold one in-person, so stay tuned for more information. For now, let's review the quarter. Revenue for the first quarter grew 24% on reported basis and 21% at constant currency was $209 million above the high end of our guidance range. About half of these beats came from strong operational performance and half was from higher pass-throughs. First quarter adjusted EBITDA grew 32% reflecting our revenue growth and productivity measures. The $69 million beat above the high end of our guidance range was entirely due to the stronger organic revenue performance. First quarter adjusted diluted EPS of $2.18 grew 45%. The beat here entirely reflects the adjusted EBITDA drop-through. A little bit more color on the business. Our commercial technology presence continues to grow as we launch new offerings in the market. During the quarter, a top 10 pharma client deployed our next best action solution in 14 countries. This tool is a SaaS-based technology platform that optimizes our client salesforce effectiveness. It increases the success of their marketing activities by providing automated sales call recommendations for the field based on advanced artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms. Our base OCE and CRM win rate remained strong. We added another 10 new clients this quarter and now have 150 clients deploying about 70,000 users. Our eCOA technology platform or electronic clinical outcomes assessment tool, which is used by our Real World as well as R&DS teams is also experiencing strong demand. This cloud-based platform utilizes a user-friendly interface to collect clinical data directly from patients. We launched this solution during 2019 and the team is seeing strong user acceptance. To date, we've been awarded over 125 studies with over 300,000 patients enrolled and over 4 million surveys completed. Moving now to R&DS. We continue to build on our strong bookings momentum in our R&DS business. In the first quarter, we achieved a contracted net book-to-bill ratio of 1.41 including pass-throughs and 1.41 excluding pass-throughs. At March 31, our LTM contracted book-to-bill ratio was 1.52 including pass-throughs and 1.45 excluding pass-throughs. These numbers are all the more impressive obviously given our strong revenue growth. Our contracted backlog in R&DS including pass-throughs grew 18.3% year-over-year to $23.2 billion at March 31, 2021. As a result, our next 12 months' revenue from backlog increased by over $600 million sequentially to $6.5 billion that's up 31.1% year-over-year. The R&DS team is building on the success we experienced in 2020 with our hybrid virtual trial offering or [indiscernible] now decentralized trials. In the first quarter, we won decentralized trials in new therapeutic areas including cardiovascular and metabolic disorders. We are working with 5 of the top 10 pharma clients and to date, we've recruited almost 170,000 patients using our advanced decentralized trial solution. Finally, you saw that on April 1, we completed the acquisition of the remaining interest in Q Squared Solutions from QUEST Diagnostics. As you know, Q Squared is an industry-leading laboratory service provider for clinical trials with global capabilities across safety, bioanalytical, vaccine, genomics and bioanalytical testing along with best-in-class technology in bio specimen and consent lifecycle management. These transactions streamline strategic decision making for us and gives us the flexibility to build our greater bioanalytical, genomic and bio market capability, as we see increased attractive growth opportunities in this expanding market. With that I will turn it over to Ron for more details on our financial performance. Ron?\nRon Bruehlman : Thanks Ari, and good morning everyone. As Ari mentioned, this is a very strong quarter. I would start first by giving you some more detail on revenue. First quarter revenue of $3.409 billion grew 23.8% on a reported basis and 21.4% at constant currency. Technology & Analytics Solutions revenue for the first quarter was $1.348 billion, which was up 20.7% reported and 17.1% at constant currency. R&D Solutions, first quarter revenue of $1.868 billion improved 29.6% at actual FX rate and 28.1% at constant currency. Pass-through revenues were a tailwind of 770 basis points to the R&DS revenue growth rate in the quarter. CSMS revenue of $193 million were down 1.5% reported and 4.1% on a constant currency basis. Moving down the P&L, adjusted EBITDA was $744 million for the quarter, representing growth of 32.4%. Margins expanded on 140 basis points despite significant headwinds from higher pass-through revenue and lower margin COVID work. GAAP net income was $212 million and GAAP diluted earnings per share were $1.9. Adjusted net income was $425 million for the first quarter and adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 45.3% to $2.18. R&D Solutions delivered another exceptional quarter of net new business, backlog was up 18.3% year-over-year at $23.2 billion at March 31. Next 12 months' revenue was already mentioned from backlog grew significantly and currently stands at $6.5 billion, up 31.1% year-over-year and of course this metric now includes the first quarter of 2022, which is a further indication that we see the momentum of the business continuing beyond this year. Now, let us review the balance sheet. At March 31, cash-and-cash equivalents totaled $2.3 billion and debt was $12.2 billion resulting in net debt of $9.9 billion. Our net leverage ratio at March 31 improved to 3.9 times trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA marking the first time since just following the merger that this ratio was below 4 times and this is particularly noteworthy, you may recall that in 2019, when we gave you our 3-year guidance, we committed to deleverage to 4 turns or below exiting 2022. We are pleased to have achieved this target entering 2021. First quarter cash flow, free cash flow in particular with very strong cash flow from operations was $867 million, CapEx was $149 million, resulting in free cash flow of $718 million. We repurchased $50 million of our shares in the quarter. Which leaves us with $867 million of share repurchase authorization remaining under the program. Now let's turn to guidance. You'll recall that back on April 1 when we announced the acquisition of QUEST 40% interest in our Q Squared joint venture, we raised our 2021 EPS guidance by $0.12 to reflect the elimination of QUEST minority interest in the joint venture's earnings. We wrapped revenue and adjusted EBITDA guidance unchanged, of course because we already consolidated the financials for the joint venture prior to the transaction. Well, today we're revising our guidance upward again as follows. We are raising our full-year 2021 revenue guidance, both at the low and the high end of the range resulting in an increase of $625 million at the midpoint of the range. The new revenue guidance is $13.200 billion to $13.500 billion, which represents a year-over-year growth of 16.2% to 18.8%. This increased guidance range reflects the first quarter strength and the continued operational momentum that we see in the business and also absorbed FX headwind versus our previous guidance. Now compared to the prior year, FX is expected to be a tailwind of about 150 basis point the full-year revenue growth. From a segment perspective, we now expect full year Technology & Analytics Solutions revenue to grow at a low- to mid-teens percentage rate and R&D Solutions to grow in the low- to mid-20s. Our previous expectations that revenue in the CSMS business would be slightly down remains unchanged. We're also raising our full-year profit guidance. As a result of stronger revenue outlook, we've increased it pre-adjusted EBITDA guidance at both the low and high end of the range resulting in an increase of $133 million at the midpoint. Our new full-year guidance, it's $2.900 billion to $2.955 billion, which represents year-over-year growth of 21.6% to 24.4%. During the EPS, I mentioned the Q Squared transaction on April 1, as a result of that, we raised our adjusted diluted EPS guidance by $0.12 to a new range of $7.89 to $8.20. We are now raising both the low and the high end of that guidance range, resulting in a new adjusted diluted EPS guidance of $8.50 to $8.75 or year-over-year growth of 32.4% to 36.3%. Little bit of detail on the P&L interest expense is expected to be approximately $400 million for the year, operational depreciation and amortization is still expected to be somewhat over $400 million and we're continuing to assume an effective tax rate of approximately 20% for the full year. This guidance assumes that a current foreign currency exchange rates remain in effect for the rest of the year. Now let's turn to the second quarter guidance, assuming FX rates remain constant through the end of the quarter, second quarter revenue is expected to be between $3.225 billion to $3.300 billion which represents reported growth of 27.9% to 30.9%. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $690 million and $715 million, which represents reported growth of 42.9% or 48.0% and finally, adjusted diluted EPS is expected to be between $2 and $2.10, up 69.5% to 78%. So to summarize, we delivered very strong first quarter results, once again reporting double-digit growth in all key financial metrics. This included revenue growth of over 20% in both our TAS and R&DS segments. R&DS backlog improved to $23.2 billion, up 18% year-over-year. Next 12-month revenue from that backlog increased to $6.5 billion, up 31% year-over-year. Free cash flow was strong again this quarter, net leverage improved to 3.9 times trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA and finally, given the strong momentum we see in the business, we are once again raising our full-year guidance for revenue adjusted EBITDA and adjusted diluted EPS. Before we open the call up for Q&A, I'd like to make you aware of a couple of leadership changes within IQVIA finance organization. Andrew Markwick who has led our Investor Relations function for the past 4 years and very capably, I think you'll agree, is moving on to come CFO of the R&DS unit. Nick Childs, who currently runs our Corporate FP&A function will take over as SVP of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Nick has been and as well for over 3 years and has a very deep knowledge of the company in our financials and he will be succeeded by Mike Fedock who has served as CFO of the R&DS unit for the past 2 years. Finally, those of you on the fixed income side, know that Andrew has also served as our treasurer for the past couple of years and Manny Korakis who is our Corporate Controller will also assume leadership of the treasury function going forward. Now, rest assured, Andrew will stay around for a few days to finish up the quarter and take all your questions and to assure a smooth transition to both Nick and Manny. And with that, let me hand it back over to Casey, who will open the call for Q&A.\nOperator: Great, Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And your first question here comes from the line of Robert Jones from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead, your line is now open.\nRobert Jones: Great, good morning. Congrats to everyone and especially, Andrew, hopefully, we will still get to communicate and you will miss having to talk to all of us all the time. I was going to ask already about the long-term guidance, but I think it sounds like, I can anticipate the answer will be wait till later this year. Obviously, the updated revenue guidance today, it looks like it's a CAGR of 9% to 10% off of 19, so it sounds like, if I heard you right, we'll get more on that later. So instead, maybe I'll just go back to a bigger industry question around M&A, Ron, you mentioned getting the leverage below the target that you guys had set out and clearly there is a ton of activity in this space right now. So, I'm curious as you look at the business and you look at some of the movement around you in the space in what your competitors are doing, do you feel like there are capabilities that you really need to go out and buy to enhance or build out what you're already doing or do you think IQVIA is in a pretty formidable competitive standpoint where it is today?\nAri Bousbib : All right, well Robert, lots of questions here, and I would not mind that your long-term question either, but the reason why we think we need to update our long-term guidance, as you will recall in June 2019, we shared our three-year planning process and the goals that we set for ourselves, we had called both on the topline and on the productivity measures and the continued efforts to re-engineer the company and make it more efficient and we set some targets in terms of top line and bottom line growth at the time. Now, obviously, lot has happened, 2020 as I said in my introductory remarks was a largely a reset year; and therefore, we feel it's appropriate to pause and update you on the progress we've made and look -- I think [indiscernible] likely grow through those numbers in 2022 to give you some more precision. We feel that we need to complete our planning process and then when we are ready later this year, we hopefully have an investor conference similar to what we had in June 2019 and then update 2022 and obviously try to give you the sense for the new maybe 2025 targets. So that's what the long-term strategy and goals. With respect to M&A activity in the sector, look we are not surprised, since, the merger that the IMS and Quintiles back in 2016, now we are approaching the fifth year anniversary, a lots of activity has occurred, we believe strong into reactions to what we did. We disturbed and disrupted the industry, which was the goal of the merger, we believe we are accomplishing the goals we have set for ourselves at the time. We believe this strategy was right, the strategic rationale was right and hence the flurry of activity to try to acquire those capabilities any way possible. And that barring the ability to acquire those technology data and analytics capabilities, then CROs are compelled to either sell themselves or merge, and that's all I'll say on what's happening. With respect to our own M&A activity, we've said before that we were interested in deploying capital to acquire strategically compelling companies that added capabilities, we've done that mostly in the technology area to accelerate the growth of our technology business and the acquisition of those capabilities. We will of course look every time that in assets that is within our businesses is to tap for sale and you probably all know with those have been or are and we look and we do the work in every case we are fast so far. So that's all I will say, I mean, we've said before that we have -- look we have a lot of liquidity, right. We have now between the $2.3 billion at the end of the quarter and 1.5 billion of untapped revolver capacity that's $3.8 billion, obviously we used $760 million of that on April 1 for the acquisition of the minority stake in the lab business which we are very, very excited about. And so we have a little over $3 billion of cash on that deployable, and we would rather spend it A, on internal development; B, on strategic acquisitions and barring all of that, we would invest the balance of available cash by redistributing to shareholders via share repurchase as we've done historically.\nAndrew Markwick : Thanks, Robert.\nRobert Jones: Thanks, Ari.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Eric Coldwell from Baird. Please go ahead, your line is now open.\nEric Coldwell: Hey, thanks very much. Good morning. A lot of things we could hit on here, but I know I'm going to get inbounds on the COVID stats for the quarter in the year. If you'll bear with me on this, I know it gets laborious but would it be possible if -- sorry if I missed it to update the number of the trials you've been awarded to date in COVID, any insights into the percent of revenue in Q1 or your outlook for the year related specifically to COVID vaccines or therapeutics, maybe something on the percent of backlog that is represented by COVID or any comments on the pipeline of activity around COVID studies that would be great. Thank you so much.\nAri Bousbib : Thank you, Eric. So look on the number of trials, I have no collection of the number of trials, I can tell you though the most relevant impacts from COVID are obviously the COVID vaccine trials, which are large and fast burning as you know, and so that's really what moves the needle. We've got a lots of a small COVID-related activity all around the company, but that doesn't move the needle, what moves the needle are these COVID vaccine trials and as you know of the five Phase 3 large vaccine trials funded by Operation Warp Speed, we've had work on four of them. Now, we haven't done the full clinical trial on all four of them. We've done it on two of them and the other one is on the third one, we've got the pharmacovigilance work and on the other one, we have the lab work. So those are the ones that have had the most impact. With respect to the impact on the first quarter excluding these work, R&DS revenue grew mid-teens. So that's the impact in the first quarter. What was your other question -- that you also pointed out that the COVID work has had an impact on the first quarter growth as for the forecast as well. As you know, we've said that on previous earnings calls, we've had demand from governments around the world, in the US, the FDA, in Europe, in Asia as well and those have also provided high growth in the first quarter. Without those activities, the cash revenue growth would have been in the high single digits. So, roughly, I think you could say that COVID contributed all these large fast burning COVID work and it also contributed about half of the total company revenue growth. What was your question on the, I guess on the R&DS backlog you asked. What it is as a portion of the backlog? If I recall, Andrew, correct me if I'm wrong, if we look at the service backlog in R&DS, it is in the high single digits.\nAndrew Markwick : Yes, that's correct.\nAri Bousbib : Yes. So that's what it represents. Now, it does have a much longer tail than we would have thought. It is certain it is going to remain with us through 2021 and well into 2022. There are many reasons for that. There are many vaccines for multiple manufacturers that are being developed to meet global demand. We are still responding to RFPs for vaccines around the world in many other countries that want to develop their own vaccines. There are follow-up studies for adapting the vaccines for the mutations of the virus. There are alternative versions of the vaccine that will be needed in case of adverse safety events or in case of quality and manufacturing issues and then there are bunch of novel treatment programs that are targeted at specific populations, specific conditions and then there is a lot of safety monitoring work, that is also in the pipe. So again, the first point that I understand, the context of your question the COVID-related work is not going away anytime soon, and is here for a while, we're very happy that we have our fair share of that market. What I also should say because I know if you didn't ask the question, you're going to ask it soon that the RFP pipeline across the board is very strong, well beyond COVID. In fact, our pipeline of qualified RFPs is approaching $25 billion if I remember correctly.\nAndrew Markwick : 23.\nAri Bousbib : 23, okay. It's over $23 billion and it's growing double-digits, both in volume and in value. Again, bear in mind, as I said in my introductory remarks that the work that should have happened in 2020 on all of those other trials that were either about to start or starting all in flight, lots of it was kind of slowed down or pushed to the right. So because of that we've got that pent-up demand that's coming out. And Number 2, lots of projects that normally would have come in will displace, crowded out by the efforts that everyone puts on trying to resolve the COVID situation and so all of that is coming through, and we are confident that both because the COVID work is not going the way in a sharp manner. And number 2, because we've got all of these other activity, there has been bubbling up. We are confident in our guidance for this year and continued strong momentum for the business well beyond COVID.\nEric Coldwell: Thanks, Ari.\nAndrew Markwick : Thank you, I appreciate it.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Shlomo Rosenbaum from Stifel. Please go ahead, your line is now open.\nShlomo Rosenbaum: Hi, thank you very much. Ari, if you don't mind, I'm going to try and slip in a few. First, I want to ask you if you could talk a little bit about the Real World evidence trends and update us and how that's going that's been a very strong growing in the past. Number 2, just wanted to ask you for a little bit more detail on how you accelerate the growth in net Q2 business by owning all of it. And then finally, I mean how do you do an encore for a quarter like this. I mean can you talk about the discussion about the business momentum, continuing it's such a strong quarter it's hard to believe that you'll be able to improve the partners and I know I've asked a lot but going to kind of put them out there.\nAri Bousbib : Yes. Thank you, Shlomo. Well, look, we are not suggesting we are going to have the 25% growth or whatever that we showed here on the ongoing basis that's not the normal all these and I will explain why, in response to Eric question was a little back of that large fast burning vaccine work for COVID had on our business. Now, excluding all of that, the business has strong momentum. You will recall, we gave guidance for where we wanted to get as a company. By the end of 2022, when we faced high single digits was going to be a new normal where we believe we are going to be above that excluding all of the disruption and the unusual bubbles. So, again excluding that fast burning work that we had in the first quarter, the R&DS business grew mid double-digits and the TAS business grew high single digits excluding the COVID related work. So that is very, very comfortable with. The rest of the year obviously would be higher than that again because we have the trailing impact of COVID we think one into 2022 and the pent-up demand that needs to be caught up. So, all of that helps build momentum. With respect to your specific question on Real World, it is strong double-digit growth in Q1. I mentioned all the -- we spoke last time about the care registry for the FDA. We spoke about the patient monitoring efforts, the deployment of our advance, we now have over a 1 billion patient lives in our database and we've continued to [indiscernible] platform for clients with the deploying our eCOA platform, which helps collect clinical data directly from patients. We are seeing extremely strong demand on Real World, obviously this is just getting started now that we are seeing demand to track patient populations in terms of people who had the virus in terms of surveilling patients that actually took the vaccines and monitoring for potential adverse effects, etcetera. So, all of that plays right smack in the center of both our capabilities are in Real World.\nAndrew Markwick : Thank you, Shlomo.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of John Kreger from William Blair. Please go ahead, your line is now open.\nJohn Kreger: Thanks very much. Hey Ari, just maybe a follow-up, I think last quarter you talked about your assumption within TAS, you assumed RWE COVID work would really sort of fall off I think in the second quarter. Do you still feel that way or do you think this is going to continue to be strong throughout the year?\nAri Bousbib : Yes, I mean, look, it's going to continue longer than we expected that's why I said in response to an earlier question, we were not assuming that we would continue at the time and that was the basis of our guidance for the year. The reason we are updating the guidance and increasing it so much is A, to reflect the performance in the first quarter -- the over performance but also to reflect our revised expectation that this work is going to continue for the balance of the year. It will not be at the same level as it was in the first quarter or the fourth quarter and will gradually start declining, but -- it is still significant for the balance of the year and importantly into 2022.\nJohn Kreger: And Ron, a question for you. I believe gross margin year-over-year was down something like 90 basis points. Was that I'll driven by the higher pass-throughs in R&DS?\nRon Bruehlman : Yes, I still think it's a higher pass-throughs in R&DS and some of the COVID work is inherently a little bit low in margin in some of the other work. So those are the key reasons.\nAri Bousbib : But our operating margins are up.\nRon Bruehlman : Yes, our operating margins are up, our EBITDA margins up 140 basis points in the quarter, so despite that overall very strong performance, obviously at the leverage of the higher volumes and we didn't increase cost accordingly.\nJohn Kreger: Great, thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson from JPMorgan. Please go ahead, your line is now open.\nTycho Peterson: Hey, thanks. I want to go back to one of the original question just on the M&A in the space you've got three competitors now all tied up with mergers. I'm just curious, what are you hearing from customers, how do you think about the opportunity to maybe pick up share in environment where there is a lot of distraction in churn. Can you maybe just talk to those dynamics?\nAri Bousbib : Okay. you look, whatever I say here is just we know opinions and the little bit of an educated set of observations based on, as you said, improve some clients and being having our fingers on the pulse of the industry. Look, we were already gaining share and we're not counting on others to be weaker than they were in order to gain share. We are largely, our market share gains, which I think are evident are the result of our unique differentiated capabilities and offerings. So, that's number one. We don't spend that much time roofing at what other people do in the industry. We focus on our strategy and building out our capabilities and trying to persuade customers that they should go with us and we are successful doing that. Now, If I look out, obviously I can't miss the activity, you will recall that IMC Research and Inventiv merged in order to form Syneos, LabCorp bought Chiltern, PRA bought Symphony Health, ICON is merging with PRA. PPD selling itself to TMO, what else, LabCorp is exploring strategic alternatives, whatever that means. So, a lots of activity and I probably missing some, but generally, in the CRO business, there are very few cases where there is synergy between two CROs, very few cases. If someone is largely present in Phase 1 or preclinical and Phase 1 and somewhat that is stronger in Phase 2, Phase 3 that maybe you could sell this complementarity and value. Someone is very strong in the US, very weak in Asia and someone else is very strong in Asia, very weak in US then you can see there is geographic complementarity, and there is value. But in most cases they're serving the same client base and in many cases including for the people that I just mentioned who are merging, there are clients where the two of them are the preferred providers for applying. So what do you think is going to happen. The client is going to remain with one provider. So, we are going to have negative synergy -- dyssynergy on the revenue side. Yes, you always have cost benefits because you don't need two CEOs, two CFOs, two General Counsel's etcetera, etcetera. But largely, this is a project-based business. You still need a different team for every project. So, the level of scalability as a result of the merger and the efficiency because you put two CROs together is extremely limited. So I don't see that much value there and then don't come back to me if I have -- we are buying CRO and telling why you are buying the CRO. Again, that could be cases where it does make sense again because the complementarity are indeed complementary or because the customer coverage is complementary, etcetera. So again, we want to focus on what we do. Clearly, the company in a merger situation is weakened, we experienced it ourselves. Despite the fact that we were doing a merger between two totally different companies that we're bringing very rich capabilities to each other, but the merger, no doubt about it, is disruptive, the sale is disruptive, balance, fees, we've experienced it, so we know what is going to happen. Obviously, each an opportunity for us. Again, we're not counting on that, we are gaining share regardless.\nAndrew Markwick : Thank you.\nTycho Peterson: Okay. And then one follow-up, speaking of things you are buying on the Q2 Solutions, I just would like a little more color. I mean you mentioned that streamlines decision making, you can build out greater bio analytical capabilities, but can you just talk a bit more on the rationale for bringing that back in-house and I know you had a question earlier on how you can scale it up, I didn't hear an answer to that as well.\nAri Bousbib : Yes, I mean, look, we owned 60% and was managed jointly we had joint venture, but mostly I think it has been run largely by outside in terms of the management, it fit into the clinical trial process, the companies who put together originally both were relatively weak in this space. It was turned around, improved, it's a strong business, those capabilities are extremely sought after, the market is becoming more and more attractive. There has been back to the M&A question. There are number of a very attractive highly specialized biologic genomics related labs that came up for sale, and we were unable to proceed decision making, ability to focus, etcetera, and all of that I think will be for see it going forward. So, we as a business that we like it's a growth business, is an attractive business and we want to invest in it and when and if there are acquisitions in this space, we would seriously look at them and be able to move faster. Now also compelling in passing that might say it was a financially no-brainer kinds of transactions for us.\nTycho Peterson: Thanks, Ari.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Donnelly from Citi. Please go ahead, your line is now open.\nPatrick Donnelly: Hey guys, thanks for taking the question. Ari, maybe just on the OCE business. It's not the biggest piece of revenue yet, but a nice growth opportunity. I think you talked about 10 ads this quarter, can you just talk about how that business is looking in the face of the pandemic, what you're expecting as we go through the rest of the year and just the competitive environment there?\nAri Bousbib : Well, look, we continue to win in the marketplace at about the same pace, I mentioned we had 10 clients win so far in 2021. We have 150 since launch. The large client deployments are going very well, now implementations went well despite the COVID environment last year that will build any slowdowns, in fact some deployments are seeing accelerated timelines, everything is on schedule. I know if you just go to disclose the names of the clients, and now in this business, I'm not sure. The feedback is very positive generally, the field reps are very engaged, way of course the Roche global deployments [indiscernible] international operation, the AstraZeneca U.S. deployment, all of that is largely on target, very good positive feedback, you know that we see is rather revolutionary compared to other offerings in the market. It's not just a CRM, it's platformed on force.com and the Lightning platform. It's a very collaborative tool, utilizes AI and machine learning to integrate various functions within the pharma companies, commercial operations, enables faster integration of data and therefore faster deployments. It links the have-to providers and the suite data for a better view of the doctor and all of that again optimizes our client salesforce effectiveness. And then since then obviously, we are adding modules that are based on the OCE platform, we've got HCP engagement management, we've got OCE optimizer's, we've got the Next Best Action, all of those are enhancing functional capabilities that our clients are buying and that helps grow the business even faster.\nPatrick Donnelly: Great, thanks Ari.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Sandy Draper from Truist Securities, please go ahead, your line is now open.\nSandy Draper: Thanks very much. Just maybe one quick clarification and then a broader one. First one, the comments you made about the growth rates, was that constant currency or is that reported?\nAndrew Markwick : Okay Sandy, Yes, the growth rates we've given to the guidance on a reported basis.\nSandy Draper: Okay. So like the low-teens and mid-20s, that was reported. Okay, great.\nAri Bousbib : The FX impact is slightly positive during the course of the year but engagement a big driver and it remains same as the year goes on.\nSandy Draper: Super, that helps. And then maybe more broadly for whoever wants to take it. Obviously business is going really well. As you said Ari, it looks like the target is higher, it seems to me, may be one of the biggest challenges, you're going to have, because you said a lot of this is the service business and obviously some of the software is software can scale, but how do you think about -- do you have to change anything about hiring, think about where you're going for people, are you worried about wage pressure but it's clearly you're going to have to add a lot of people to continue to build to get to the growth you're doing? So we just love your thoughts on hiring wage inflation and how you manage adding that many people in what's a very positive, but also competitive labor market. Thanks.\nAri Bousbib : It's a great, great question, and you know you are touching on one of the obviously the biggest operational challenges we have and that's a natural challenge when you're growing and you're in service industry and you're right, the software-based business or the data subscription business, they are growing, but not at the pace that the services business is growing and in aggregate in relative terms, we are still going to need to hire people. Now two observations, number one, in early 2020 and 2019 early 2020 in anticipation of continued growth, we already had hired a lot of people. We did not restructure people in 2020. We kept people and even while they weren't working and we paid them, they are here and they are now working and delivering. So we haven't had to hire more people as much as you might think relative to our workforce last year and it's part of the reason why we are having nice margin expansion here. Second observation is we talked before about merger of competitors, obviously this is going to lead to some talent bleed and availability and we are in fact being approached and talent there but, Yes, I mean wage inflation that's true across industries and certainly in our industry as well. So we have to deal with that. You know that we have a program to a continue to seek efficiencies, scale whether it's through consolidation of activities, using our offshore centers, automation of processes, etcetera. And we have a lot of programs to create cost efficiencies that again the purpose of which is to continue to be able to deliver margin expansion, even as we've got wage inflation. Ron.\nRon Bruehlman : And one more thing Sandy, anticipated wage inflation is fully factored into our guidance.\nSandy Draper: Yes.\nRon Bruehlman : Sorry Sandy go ahead.\nSandy Draper: No, I just say thanks for taking the question.\nRon Bruehlman : Okay. Thanks Sandy, it was pleasure.\nAndrew Markwick : I think we took our time to probably just one more question before we get to the top of the hour.\nOperator: Great, thank you. Your next question comes from the line of the Elizabeth Anderson from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead, your line is now open.\nElizabeth Anderson: Hi guys, thanks so much for the question and squeezing me in. I must say free cash flow was very strong in the first quarter. I just wanted, how you thought that would continue the piece across the year. I mean obviously last year was extraordinary for variety of reasons, including on the free cash flow front, so I just wanted to see sort of how you guys are thinking about the pace as we move through the rest of the year. Thanks.\nAri Bousbib : Ron?\nRon Bruehlman : Hi. Elizabeth and thanks for the question. Look, we did have very strong cash flow. It's not a coincidence, since the start of the pandemic, we've been focusing a lot on that, on collections, not letting accounts receivable slid past due, we've been successful in working down our overdue and negotiating contracts with better billing terms with customers and you're also seeing, although there has been pressure from the industry from clients to extend billing term that's kind of winding down, there is a one-time impact and then you hit steady state. Now having said that, look cash flow is lumpy, so, I'm not going to promise that we're going to have $700 million of free cash flow every quarter. It tends to go up and down, but we have fundamentally shifted our emphasis on improving cash flow, and you've seen that over the past year. Just as a general guidance, help from the guidance, you would expect free cash flow in an average year be between 80% and 90% of adjusted net income and keep in mind that our adjusted net income is growing quite strong at least. Our cash flow will grow on that basis, but in any given quarter or any given year or even it may differ from that. Cash flow is not like earnings, it is not as smooth, it goes up and down, but yes, we have seen improvement and we expect continued strong cash flow going forward, but expect to normal volatility that any company is going to have in cash flow.\nAri Bousbib : Quarter-to-quarter.\nRon Bruehlman : Quarter-to-quarter, correct.\nAndrew Markwick : I think let's try and squeeze in one more quick one as well, before we end.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Dave Windley from Jefferies. Please go ahead, your line is now open.\nDave Windley: Hi, thanks for squeezing me and I appreciate it. Ari, I thought maybe the most impressive important number in the quarter was the $6.5 billion in next 12 months backlog that's such a big sequential increase, I think it's the biggest since you merged and I know you said earlier in the call that it's clearly -- bookings were very strong that layers in, you're rolling forward to the next quarter -- it's an outsized improvement and gives great visibility for the next 12 months and I wondered if there was also something to be read into that either that sites in patient recruitment are opening up and there is a greater comfort level that has -- might see a cooperation on that and/or some of your tools for -- I wondered if you could just add some color to how that outlook is improving so dramatically.\nAri Bousbib : Thanks so much for that question, and, yes, you're absolutely right and your observation there has been a dramatic sequential improvement in our next 12 months revenue growth outlook for the R&DS business by over $600 million and this is the result of our continued strong net new bookings performance as well as again as you pointed out correctly steadily improving clinical trial recovery landscape. Now, by the way this metric of next 12 month, now includes the first quarter of 2022, which is again an encouraging sign. As you also point out continued strength well beyond this year. Now in terms of the improvements that we're seeing in terms of accessibility to sites and so on, so forth; recall that we had in the Q1 earnings call just a year ago, 20% of our size were accessible. In the Q2 call, it was 53%, Q3 was about 70%, Q4 was slightly above 70% and now it's higher than that and trending up as well. I think it's in the 75% and 76% range. Our guidance for 2021 picks many factors into account with respect to next 12 months revenue from the backlog, we do this project by project, right. It's a bottom-up process where we evaluate the expected revenue burn for each project for the next 12 months. So, it's an extremely precise exercise and I think a very relevant measure, an indication of the visibility on our business is going forward. But beyond access to site, the site startup activity is actually above the 2019 level. So site startup activity is a very strong indication of revenue balloon going forward and that's above pre-pandemic levels. Patient recruitment it's -- patient visits same thing very close to pre-pandemic levels and trending up. So, bottom line is these metrics provide a strong confidence that the trial pipeline and I'm talking now about the non-COVID trail pipeline, the one that's being awarded or that was awarded and pushed to the right is starting to be delivered with sites enrolling, patients enrolling and patients visits. So you're absolutely correct and thank you for bringing up the question. I hope that you're going to draw the conclusion.\nDave Windley: I appreciate your pass time a little bit, but that's very, very helpful. Thank you.\nAri Bousbib : Thank you, Dave.\nAndrew Markwick : Thanks for the question, Dave. And thank you everyone for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you again on our second quarter 2021 earnings call. The team will be available to take any follow-up questions you might have for the rest of the day. Thank you, everyone.\nOperator: And this concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Ron Bruehlman",
            "content": "Thanks Ari, and good morning everyone. As Ari mentioned, this is a very strong quarter. I would start first by giving you some more detail on revenue. First quarter revenue of $3.409 billion grew 23.8% on a reported basis and 21.4% at constant currency. Technology & Analytics Solutions revenue for the first quarter was $1.348 billion, which was up 20.7% reported and 17.1% at constant currency. R&D Solutions, first quarter revenue of $1.868 billion improved 29.6% at actual FX rate and 28.1% at constant currency. Pass-through revenues were a tailwind of 770 basis points to the R&DS revenue growth rate in the quarter. CSMS revenue of $193 million were down 1.5% reported and 4.1% on a constant currency basis. Moving down the P&L, adjusted EBITDA was $744 million for the quarter, representing growth of 32.4%. Margins expanded on 140 basis points despite significant headwinds from higher pass-through revenue and lower margin COVID work. GAAP net income was $212 million and GAAP diluted earnings per share were $1.9. Adjusted net income was $425 million for the first quarter and adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 45.3% to $2.18. R&D Solutions delivered another exceptional quarter of net new business, backlog was up 18.3% year-over-year at $23.2 billion at March 31. Next 12 months' revenue was already mentioned from backlog grew significantly and currently stands at $6.5 billion, up 31.1% year-over-year and of course this metric now includes the first quarter of 2022, which is a further indication that we see the momentum of the business continuing beyond this year. Now, let us review the balance sheet. At March 31, cash-and-cash equivalents totaled $2.3 billion and debt was $12.2 billion resulting in net debt of $9.9 billion. Our net leverage ratio at March 31 improved to 3.9 times trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA marking the first time since just following the merger that this ratio was below 4 times and this is particularly noteworthy, you may recall that in 2019, when we gave you our 3-year guidance, we committed to deleverage to 4 turns or below exiting 2022. We are pleased to have achieved this target entering 2021. First quarter cash flow, free cash flow in particular with very strong cash flow from operations was $867 million, CapEx was $149 million, resulting in free cash flow of $718 million. We repurchased $50 million of our shares in the quarter. Which leaves us with $867 million of share repurchase authorization remaining under the program. Now let's turn to guidance. You'll recall that back on April 1 when we announced the acquisition of QUEST 40% interest in our Q Squared joint venture, we raised our 2021 EPS guidance by $0.12 to reflect the elimination of QUEST minority interest in the joint venture's earnings. We wrapped revenue and adjusted EBITDA guidance unchanged, of course because we already consolidated the financials for the joint venture prior to the transaction. Well, today we're revising our guidance upward again as follows. We are raising our full-year 2021 revenue guidance, both at the low and the high end of the range resulting in an increase of $625 million at the midpoint of the range. The new revenue guidance is $13.200 billion to $13.500 billion, which represents a year-over-year growth of 16.2% to 18.8%. This increased guidance range reflects the first quarter strength and the continued operational momentum that we see in the business and also absorbed FX headwind versus our previous guidance. Now compared to the prior year, FX is expected to be a tailwind of about 150 basis point the full-year revenue growth. From a segment perspective, we now expect full year Technology & Analytics Solutions revenue to grow at a low- to mid-teens percentage rate and R&D Solutions to grow in the low- to mid-20s. Our previous expectations that revenue in the CSMS business would be slightly down remains unchanged. We're also raising our full-year profit guidance. As a result of stronger revenue outlook, we've increased it pre-adjusted EBITDA guidance at both the low and high end of the range resulting in an increase of $133 million at the midpoint. Our new full-year guidance, it's $2.900 billion to $2.955 billion, which represents year-over-year growth of 21.6% to 24.4%. During the EPS, I mentioned the Q Squared transaction on April 1, as a result of that, we raised our adjusted diluted EPS guidance by $0.12 to a new range of $7.89 to $8.20. We are now raising both the low and the high end of that guidance range, resulting in a new adjusted diluted EPS guidance of $8.50 to $8.75 or year-over-year growth of 32.4% to 36.3%. Little bit of detail on the P&L interest expense is expected to be approximately $400 million for the year, operational depreciation and amortization is still expected to be somewhat over $400 million and we're continuing to assume an effective tax rate of approximately 20% for the full year. This guidance assumes that a current foreign currency exchange rates remain in effect for the rest of the year. Now let's turn to the second quarter guidance, assuming FX rates remain constant through the end of the quarter, second quarter revenue is expected to be between $3.225 billion to $3.300 billion which represents reported growth of 27.9% to 30.9%. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $690 million and $715 million, which represents reported growth of 42.9% or 48.0% and finally, adjusted diluted EPS is expected to be between $2 and $2.10, up 69.5% to 78%. So to summarize, we delivered very strong first quarter results, once again reporting double-digit growth in all key financial metrics. This included revenue growth of over 20% in both our TAS and R&DS segments. R&DS backlog improved to $23.2 billion, up 18% year-over-year. Next 12-month revenue from that backlog increased to $6.5 billion, up 31% year-over-year. Free cash flow was strong again this quarter, net leverage improved to 3.9 times trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA and finally, given the strong momentum we see in the business, we are once again raising our full-year guidance for revenue adjusted EBITDA and adjusted diluted EPS. Before we open the call up for Q&A, I'd like to make you aware of a couple of leadership changes within IQVIA finance organization. Andrew Markwick who has led our Investor Relations function for the past 4 years and very capably, I think you'll agree, is moving on to come CFO of the R&DS unit. Nick Childs, who currently runs our Corporate FP&A function will take over as SVP of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Nick has been and as well for over 3 years and has a very deep knowledge of the company in our financials and he will be succeeded by Mike Fedock who has served as CFO of the R&DS unit for the past 2 years. Finally, those of you on the fixed income side, know that Andrew has also served as our treasurer for the past couple of years and Manny Korakis who is our Corporate Controller will also assume leadership of the treasury function going forward. Now, rest assured, Andrew will stay around for a few days to finish up the quarter and take all your questions and to assure a smooth transition to both Nick and Manny. And with that, let me hand it back over to Casey, who will open the call for Q&A. Yes, I still think it's a higher pass-throughs in R&DS and some of the COVID work is inherently a little bit low in margin in some of the other work. So those are the key reasons. Yes, our operating margins are up, our EBITDA margins up 140 basis points in the quarter, so despite that overall very strong performance, obviously at the leverage of the higher volumes and we didn't increase cost accordingly. And one more thing Sandy, anticipated wage inflation is fully factored into our guidance. Sorry Sandy go ahead. Okay. Thanks Sandy, it was pleasure. Hi. Elizabeth and thanks for the question. Look, we did have very strong cash flow. It's not a coincidence, since the start of the pandemic, we've been focusing a lot on that, on collections, not letting accounts receivable slid past due, we've been successful in working down our overdue and negotiating contracts with better billing terms with customers and you're also seeing, although there has been pressure from the industry from clients to extend billing term that's kind of winding down, there is a one-time impact and then you hit steady state. Now having said that, look cash flow is lumpy, so, I'm not going to promise that we're going to have $700 million of free cash flow every quarter. It tends to go up and down, but we have fundamentally shifted our emphasis on improving cash flow, and you've seen that over the past year. Just as a general guidance, help from the guidance, you would expect free cash flow in an average year be between 80% and 90% of adjusted net income and keep in mind that our adjusted net income is growing quite strong at least. Our cash flow will grow on that basis, but in any given quarter or any given year or even it may differ from that. Cash flow is not like earnings, it is not as smooth, it goes up and down, but yes, we have seen improvement and we expect continued strong cash flow going forward, but expect to normal volatility that any company is going to have in cash flow. Quarter-to-quarter, correct."

            "name": "Ari Bousbib",
            "content": "Good morning everyone and thank you, Andrew. Welcome and thank you for joining us today. This morning we reported first quarter results with strong double-digit growth in all key financial metrics and as a result of this performance and an improved outlook for the rest of the year, we have once again raised our guidance. The 2021 guidance that we provided to you last quarter was already within reach of our original pre-COVID plans for 2021. Our revised guidance today significantly exceed those original plans. In many ways, 2020 was a reset year for our company and also for the industry. We've been saying for a long time that the traditional timelines for the development of new drugs are too long. The speed at which COVID vaccines were developed in 2020 has obviously raised the bar in terms of what expectations should be. The crisis accelerated the adoption of new technologies and we believe it will force a lasting change in how innovative medicines are developed and commercialize. All of this has made IQVIA even more relevant to our clients and has highlighted the power of our differentiated offerings. The deep client engagements that we had during the pandemic demonstrated how uniquely positioned we are to bring new insights and expertise that can improve drug development and commercial fine lines. What is also becoming clear is that there is a lot of pent-up demand due to one, the many trials that were slowed down or temporary pushed to the right and two, the trials that did not get started as they were crowded out by the COVID resolution efforts on which everyone was focused. These pent-up demand across therapy areas, combined with record levels of biotech funding provides a very strong backdrop for our industry. As a result of these favorable conditions, we've started the process of revisiting our Vision 2022 goals. We plan to update you later this year on our Vision 2022 progress and lay the groundwork for the next phase of our journey. We may do this at an Investor Conference later this year, especially if we are able to hold one in-person, so stay tuned for more information. For now, let's review the quarter. Revenue for the first quarter grew 24% on reported basis and 21% at constant currency was $209 million above the high end of our guidance range. About half of these beats came from strong operational performance and half was from higher pass-throughs. First quarter adjusted EBITDA grew 32% reflecting our revenue growth and productivity measures. The $69 million beat above the high end of our guidance range was entirely due to the stronger organic revenue performance. First quarter adjusted diluted EPS of $2.18 grew 45%. The beat here entirely reflects the adjusted EBITDA drop-through. A little bit more color on the business. Our commercial technology presence continues to grow as we launch new offerings in the market. During the quarter, a top 10 pharma client deployed our next best action solution in 14 countries. This tool is a SaaS-based technology platform that optimizes our client salesforce effectiveness. It increases the success of their marketing activities by providing automated sales call recommendations for the field based on advanced artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms. Our base OCE and CRM win rate remained strong. We added another 10 new clients this quarter and now have 150 clients deploying about 70,000 users. Our eCOA technology platform or electronic clinical outcomes assessment tool, which is used by our Real World as well as R&DS teams is also experiencing strong demand. This cloud-based platform utilizes a user-friendly interface to collect clinical data directly from patients. We launched this solution during 2019 and the team is seeing strong user acceptance. To date, we've been awarded over 125 studies with over 300,000 patients enrolled and over 4 million surveys completed. Moving now to R&DS. We continue to build on our strong bookings momentum in our R&DS business. In the first quarter, we achieved a contracted net book-to-bill ratio of 1.41 including pass-throughs and 1.41 excluding pass-throughs. At March 31, our LTM contracted book-to-bill ratio was 1.52 including pass-throughs and 1.45 excluding pass-throughs. These numbers are all the more impressive obviously given our strong revenue growth. Our contracted backlog in R&DS including pass-throughs grew 18.3% year-over-year to $23.2 billion at March 31, 2021. As a result, our next 12 months' revenue from backlog increased by over $600 million sequentially to $6.5 billion that's up 31.1% year-over-year. The R&DS team is building on the success we experienced in 2020 with our hybrid virtual trial offering or [indiscernible] now decentralized trials. In the first quarter, we won decentralized trials in new therapeutic areas including cardiovascular and metabolic disorders. We are working with 5 of the top 10 pharma clients and to date, we've recruited almost 170,000 patients using our advanced decentralized trial solution. Finally, you saw that on April 1, we completed the acquisition of the remaining interest in Q Squared Solutions from QUEST Diagnostics. As you know, Q Squared is an industry-leading laboratory service provider for clinical trials with global capabilities across safety, bioanalytical, vaccine, genomics and bioanalytical testing along with best-in-class technology in bio specimen and consent lifecycle management. These transactions streamline strategic decision making for us and gives us the flexibility to build our greater bioanalytical, genomic and bio market capability, as we see increased attractive growth opportunities in this expanding market. With that I will turn it over to Ron for more details on our financial performance. Ron? All right, well Robert, lots of questions here, and I would not mind that your long-term question either, but the reason why we think we need to update our long-term guidance, as you will recall in June 2019, we shared our three-year planning process and the goals that we set for ourselves, we had called both on the topline and on the productivity measures and the continued efforts to re-engineer the company and make it more efficient and we set some targets in terms of top line and bottom line growth at the time. Now, obviously, lot has happened, 2020 as I said in my introductory remarks was a largely a reset year; and therefore, we feel it's appropriate to pause and update you on the progress we've made and look -- I think [indiscernible] likely grow through those numbers in 2022 to give you some more precision. We feel that we need to complete our planning process and then when we are ready later this year, we hopefully have an investor conference similar to what we had in June 2019 and then update 2022 and obviously try to give you the sense for the new maybe 2025 targets. So that's what the long-term strategy and goals. With respect to M&A activity in the sector, look we are not surprised, since, the merger that the IMS and Quintiles back in 2016, now we are approaching the fifth year anniversary, a lots of activity has occurred, we believe strong into reactions to what we did. We disturbed and disrupted the industry, which was the goal of the merger, we believe we are accomplishing the goals we have set for ourselves at the time. We believe this strategy was right, the strategic rationale was right and hence the flurry of activity to try to acquire those capabilities any way possible. And that barring the ability to acquire those technology data and analytics capabilities, then CROs are compelled to either sell themselves or merge, and that's all I'll say on what's happening. With respect to our own M&A activity, we've said before that we were interested in deploying capital to acquire strategically compelling companies that added capabilities, we've done that mostly in the technology area to accelerate the growth of our technology business and the acquisition of those capabilities. We will of course look every time that in assets that is within our businesses is to tap for sale and you probably all know with those have been or are and we look and we do the work in every case we are fast so far. So that's all I will say, I mean, we've said before that we have -- look we have a lot of liquidity, right. We have now between the $2.3 billion at the end of the quarter and 1.5 billion of untapped revolver capacity that's $3.8 billion, obviously we used $760 million of that on April 1 for the acquisition of the minority stake in the lab business which we are very, very excited about. And so we have a little over $3 billion of cash on that deployable, and we would rather spend it A, on internal development; B, on strategic acquisitions and barring all of that, we would invest the balance of available cash by redistributing to shareholders via share repurchase as we've done historically. Thank you, Eric. So look on the number of trials, I have no collection of the number of trials, I can tell you though the most relevant impacts from COVID are obviously the COVID vaccine trials, which are large and fast burning as you know, and so that's really what moves the needle. We've got a lots of a small COVID-related activity all around the company, but that doesn't move the needle, what moves the needle are these COVID vaccine trials and as you know of the five Phase 3 large vaccine trials funded by Operation Warp Speed, we've had work on four of them. Now, we haven't done the full clinical trial on all four of them. We've done it on two of them and the other one is on the third one, we've got the pharmacovigilance work and on the other one, we have the lab work. So those are the ones that have had the most impact. With respect to the impact on the first quarter excluding these work, R&DS revenue grew mid-teens. So that's the impact in the first quarter. What was your other question -- that you also pointed out that the COVID work has had an impact on the first quarter growth as for the forecast as well. As you know, we've said that on previous earnings calls, we've had demand from governments around the world, in the US, the FDA, in Europe, in Asia as well and those have also provided high growth in the first quarter. Without those activities, the cash revenue growth would have been in the high single digits. So, roughly, I think you could say that COVID contributed all these large fast burning COVID work and it also contributed about half of the total company revenue growth. What was your question on the, I guess on the R&DS backlog you asked. What it is as a portion of the backlog? If I recall, Andrew, correct me if I'm wrong, if we look at the service backlog in R&DS, it is in the high single digits. Yes. So that's what it represents. Now, it does have a much longer tail than we would have thought. It is certain it is going to remain with us through 2021 and well into 2022. There are many reasons for that. There are many vaccines for multiple manufacturers that are being developed to meet global demand. We are still responding to RFPs for vaccines around the world in many other countries that want to develop their own vaccines. There are follow-up studies for adapting the vaccines for the mutations of the virus. There are alternative versions of the vaccine that will be needed in case of adverse safety events or in case of quality and manufacturing issues and then there are bunch of novel treatment programs that are targeted at specific populations, specific conditions and then there is a lot of safety monitoring work, that is also in the pipe. So again, the first point that I understand, the context of your question the COVID-related work is not going away anytime soon, and is here for a while, we're very happy that we have our fair share of that market. What I also should say because I know if you didn't ask the question, you're going to ask it soon that the RFP pipeline across the board is very strong, well beyond COVID. In fact, our pipeline of qualified RFPs is approaching $25 billion if I remember correctly. 23, okay. It's over $23 billion and it's growing double-digits, both in volume and in value. Again, bear in mind, as I said in my introductory remarks that the work that should have happened in 2020 on all of those other trials that were either about to start or starting all in flight, lots of it was kind of slowed down or pushed to the right. So because of that we've got that pent-up demand that's coming out. And Number 2, lots of projects that normally would have come in will displace, crowded out by the efforts that everyone puts on trying to resolve the COVID situation and so all of that is coming through, and we are confident that both because the COVID work is not going the way in a sharp manner. And number 2, because we've got all of these other activity, there has been bubbling up. We are confident in our guidance for this year and continued strong momentum for the business well beyond COVID. Yes. Thank you, Shlomo. Well, look, we are not suggesting we are going to have the 25% growth or whatever that we showed here on the ongoing basis that's not the normal all these and I will explain why, in response to Eric question was a little back of that large fast burning vaccine work for COVID had on our business. Now, excluding all of that, the business has strong momentum. You will recall, we gave guidance for where we wanted to get as a company. By the end of 2022, when we faced high single digits was going to be a new normal where we believe we are going to be above that excluding all of the disruption and the unusual bubbles. So, again excluding that fast burning work that we had in the first quarter, the R&DS business grew mid double-digits and the TAS business grew high single digits excluding the COVID related work. So that is very, very comfortable with. The rest of the year obviously would be higher than that again because we have the trailing impact of COVID we think one into 2022 and the pent-up demand that needs to be caught up. So, all of that helps build momentum. With respect to your specific question on Real World, it is strong double-digit growth in Q1. I mentioned all the -- we spoke last time about the care registry for the FDA. We spoke about the patient monitoring efforts, the deployment of our advance, we now have over a 1 billion patient lives in our database and we've continued to [indiscernible] platform for clients with the deploying our eCOA platform, which helps collect clinical data directly from patients. We are seeing extremely strong demand on Real World, obviously this is just getting started now that we are seeing demand to track patient populations in terms of people who had the virus in terms of surveilling patients that actually took the vaccines and monitoring for potential adverse effects, etcetera. So, all of that plays right smack in the center of both our capabilities are in Real World. Yes, I mean, look, it's going to continue longer than we expected that's why I said in response to an earlier question, we were not assuming that we would continue at the time and that was the basis of our guidance for the year. The reason we are updating the guidance and increasing it so much is A, to reflect the performance in the first quarter -- the over performance but also to reflect our revised expectation that this work is going to continue for the balance of the year. It will not be at the same level as it was in the first quarter or the fourth quarter and will gradually start declining, but -- it is still significant for the balance of the year and importantly into 2022. But our operating margins are up. Okay. you look, whatever I say here is just we know opinions and the little bit of an educated set of observations based on, as you said, improve some clients and being having our fingers on the pulse of the industry. Look, we were already gaining share and we're not counting on others to be weaker than they were in order to gain share. We are largely, our market share gains, which I think are evident are the result of our unique differentiated capabilities and offerings. So, that's number one. We don't spend that much time roofing at what other people do in the industry. We focus on our strategy and building out our capabilities and trying to persuade customers that they should go with us and we are successful doing that. Now, If I look out, obviously I can't miss the activity, you will recall that IMC Research and Inventiv merged in order to form Syneos, LabCorp bought Chiltern, PRA bought Symphony Health, ICON is merging with PRA. PPD selling itself to TMO, what else, LabCorp is exploring strategic alternatives, whatever that means. So, a lots of activity and I probably missing some, but generally, in the CRO business, there are very few cases where there is synergy between two CROs, very few cases. If someone is largely present in Phase 1 or preclinical and Phase 1 and somewhat that is stronger in Phase 2, Phase 3 that maybe you could sell this complementarity and value. Someone is very strong in the US, very weak in Asia and someone else is very strong in Asia, very weak in US then you can see there is geographic complementarity, and there is value. But in most cases they're serving the same client base and in many cases including for the people that I just mentioned who are merging, there are clients where the two of them are the preferred providers for applying. So what do you think is going to happen. The client is going to remain with one provider. So, we are going to have negative synergy -- dyssynergy on the revenue side. Yes, you always have cost benefits because you don't need two CEOs, two CFOs, two General Counsel's etcetera, etcetera. But largely, this is a project-based business. You still need a different team for every project. So, the level of scalability as a result of the merger and the efficiency because you put two CROs together is extremely limited. So I don't see that much value there and then don't come back to me if I have -- we are buying CRO and telling why you are buying the CRO. Again, that could be cases where it does make sense again because the complementarity are indeed complementary or because the customer coverage is complementary, etcetera. So again, we want to focus on what we do. Clearly, the company in a merger situation is weakened, we experienced it ourselves. Despite the fact that we were doing a merger between two totally different companies that we're bringing very rich capabilities to each other, but the merger, no doubt about it, is disruptive, the sale is disruptive, balance, fees, we've experienced it, so we know what is going to happen. Obviously, each an opportunity for us. Again, we're not counting on that, we are gaining share regardless. Yes, I mean, look, we owned 60% and was managed jointly we had joint venture, but mostly I think it has been run largely by outside in terms of the management, it fit into the clinical trial process, the companies who put together originally both were relatively weak in this space. It was turned around, improved, it's a strong business, those capabilities are extremely sought after, the market is becoming more and more attractive. There has been back to the M&A question. There are number of a very attractive highly specialized biologic genomics related labs that came up for sale, and we were unable to proceed decision making, ability to focus, etcetera, and all of that I think will be for see it going forward. So, we as a business that we like it's a growth business, is an attractive business and we want to invest in it and when and if there are acquisitions in this space, we would seriously look at them and be able to move faster. Now also compelling in passing that might say it was a financially no-brainer kinds of transactions for us. Well, look, we continue to win in the marketplace at about the same pace, I mentioned we had 10 clients win so far in 2021. We have 150 since launch. The large client deployments are going very well, now implementations went well despite the COVID environment last year that will build any slowdowns, in fact some deployments are seeing accelerated timelines, everything is on schedule. I know if you just go to disclose the names of the clients, and now in this business, I'm not sure. The feedback is very positive generally, the field reps are very engaged, way of course the Roche global deployments [indiscernible] international operation, the AstraZeneca U.S. deployment, all of that is largely on target, very good positive feedback, you know that we see is rather revolutionary compared to other offerings in the market. It's not just a CRM, it's platformed on force.com and the Lightning platform. It's a very collaborative tool, utilizes AI and machine learning to integrate various functions within the pharma companies, commercial operations, enables faster integration of data and therefore faster deployments. It links the have-to providers and the suite data for a better view of the doctor and all of that again optimizes our client salesforce effectiveness. And then since then obviously, we are adding modules that are based on the OCE platform, we've got HCP engagement management, we've got OCE optimizer's, we've got the Next Best Action, all of those are enhancing functional capabilities that our clients are buying and that helps grow the business even faster. The FX impact is slightly positive during the course of the year but engagement a big driver and it remains same as the year goes on. It's a great, great question, and you know you are touching on one of the obviously the biggest operational challenges we have and that's a natural challenge when you're growing and you're in service industry and you're right, the software-based business or the data subscription business, they are growing, but not at the pace that the services business is growing and in aggregate in relative terms, we are still going to need to hire people. Now two observations, number one, in early 2020 and 2019 early 2020 in anticipation of continued growth, we already had hired a lot of people. We did not restructure people in 2020. We kept people and even while they weren't working and we paid them, they are here and they are now working and delivering. So we haven't had to hire more people as much as you might think relative to our workforce last year and it's part of the reason why we are having nice margin expansion here. Second observation is we talked before about merger of competitors, obviously this is going to lead to some talent bleed and availability and we are in fact being approached and talent there but, Yes, I mean wage inflation that's true across industries and certainly in our industry as well. So we have to deal with that. You know that we have a program to a continue to seek efficiencies, scale whether it's through consolidation of activities, using our offshore centers, automation of processes, etcetera. And we have a lot of programs to create cost efficiencies that again the purpose of which is to continue to be able to deliver margin expansion, even as we've got wage inflation. Ron. Ron? Quarter-to-quarter. Thanks so much for that question, and, yes, you're absolutely right and your observation there has been a dramatic sequential improvement in our next 12 months revenue growth outlook for the R&DS business by over $600 million and this is the result of our continued strong net new bookings performance as well as again as you pointed out correctly steadily improving clinical trial recovery landscape. Now, by the way this metric of next 12 month, now includes the first quarter of 2022, which is again an encouraging sign. As you also point out continued strength well beyond this year. Now in terms of the improvements that we're seeing in terms of accessibility to sites and so on, so forth; recall that we had in the Q1 earnings call just a year ago, 20% of our size were accessible. In the Q2 call, it was 53%, Q3 was about 70%, Q4 was slightly above 70% and now it's higher than that and trending up as well. I think it's in the 75% and 76% range. Our guidance for 2021 picks many factors into account with respect to next 12 months revenue from the backlog, we do this project by project, right. It's a bottom-up process where we evaluate the expected revenue burn for each project for the next 12 months. So, it's an extremely precise exercise and I think a very relevant measure, an indication of the visibility on our business is going forward. But beyond access to site, the site startup activity is actually above the 2019 level. So site startup activity is a very strong indication of revenue balloon going forward and that's above pre-pandemic levels. Patient recruitment it's -- patient visits same thing very close to pre-pandemic levels and trending up. So, bottom line is these metrics provide a strong confidence that the trial pipeline and I'm talking now about the non-COVID trail pipeline, the one that's being awarded or that was awarded and pushed to the right is starting to be delivered with sites enrolling, patients enrolling and patients visits. So you're absolutely correct and thank you for bringing up the question. I hope that you're going to draw the conclusion. Thank you, Dave."

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Nick Childs, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasury. Mr. Childs, please begin your conference.\nNick Childs: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our fourth quarter 2022 earnings call. With me today are Ari Bousbib, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Ron Bruehlman, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Eric Sherbet, Executive Vice President and General Counsel; Mike Fedock, Senior Vice President, Financial Planning and Analysis; and Gustavo Perrone, Senior Director, Investor Relations. Today, we will be referencing a presentation that will be visible during this call for those of you on our webcast. This presentation will also be available following this call in the Events and Presentations section of our IQVIA Investor Relations Web site at ir.iqvia.com. Before we begin, I would like to caution listeners that certain information discussed by management during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. The actual results could differ materially from those stated or implied by forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties associated with the company's business, which are discussed in the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings. In addition, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures on this call, which should be considered a supplement to and not a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the comparable GAAP measures is included in the press release and conference call presentation. I would now like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO.\nAri Bousbib: Thank you, Nick, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today to discuss our fourth quarter and full-year results. As we close 2022, we are very proud of what we've achieved at IQVIA. It was a record year for our R&DS business, we achieved bookings of $10.8 billion, which was the highest ever, our backlog stands now at a record $27.2 billion, and the business added over 275 new customers in the year. We improved access to critical research; we've expanded our decentralized clinical trial capabilities by launching the first self-collection safety lab panel for U.S. clinical trial participants in collaboration with Tasso. Our DCT program achieved GDPR validation in Europe, marking the first time a DCT offering received this data privacy validation. And our connected devices business added 50 new customers, including wins with two top-10 pharma companies. We made significant advancements as well in our real world business. We increased the number of active data sources by more than 30% across more than 50 countries, and we enhanced access to real world data for European and U.S. regulators through our partnerships with European Medicines Agency and the Real-World Alliance. We expanded our digital marketing capabilities with the acquisition of Lasso Marketing, which offers a technology purpose-built for healthcare marketers to execute digital campaigns. We deployed capital of $3.7 billion during the year. This included $1.3 billion in acquisitions, $1.2 billion in share repurchase, $700 million in CapEx, and repayment of $510 million of debt. At the same time, we were able to reduce our net leverage ratio to 3.45 times adjusted EBITDA. 2022 also marked the end of our Vision 22 three-year strategic plan. No one could have predicted the volatile macro environment we would have to operate in during this period. Despite the many headwinds we have faced, since 2019, when we set these goals, we in fact exceeded our Vision 2022 goals. I am proud of the resilience, resourcefulness, and creativity that our employees around the world demonstrate every day in support of IQVIA's mission. It is these attributes that allowed our company to deliver on the commitments we made to you in 2019. And as you know, since the beginning of '22, the industry has been reporting a slowdown in demand for clinical and commercial services caused by reductions in biotech funding, as well as the higher interest rate environment and macro economic uncertainty. As we've discussed before, while we've of course seen anecdotal evidence of these concerns we, at IQVIA, remain confident that the fundamentals of our industry and the demand from our clients remain healthy. And, in fact, we remain confident in our ability to deliver on our 2025 goals. As we begin 2023, there are more molecules in development than at any other time in history. Our RFP flow was up 13% for the full-year. We, in fact, saw acceleration in Q4 to 22%, with double-digit growth in all three segments; large, midsize, and EBP segments. Our net new business reached a record $3.1 billion in Q4, which is up 29% versus prior year. For the full-year, we achieved bookings of $10.8 billion despite the large COVID bookings we had in 2021 that didn't repeat in 2022. And yes, in our commercial business, while we are seeing some short-term fluctuations in discretionary spend categories such as, for example, consulting, demand for our commercial services nonetheless remains on a favorable growth trend. Finally, let me just acknowledge and congratulate our employees around the world for the nice recognition the company received last week. IQVIA was named to Fortune's list of the World's Most Admired Companies for the sixth consecutive year. Importantly, once again, we earned the first place ranking within our industry group. We also rank number one in seven out of nine categories, including innovation, people management, use of corporate assets, social responsibility, quality of products and services, global competitiveness, and long-term investment value. Turning now to the results for the quarter, revenue for the fourth quarter grew 2.8% on a reported basis, 7% at constant currency compared to last year. And excluding COVID-related work from both periods, we grew the top line 10% at constant currency on an organic basis. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA increased 11.1%, reflecting our strong revenue growth and ongoing cost management discipline. Fourth quarter adjusted diluted EPS, of $2.78, grew 9% driven by our adjusted EBITDA growth. Few highlights of business activity this quarter; in our technology business, IQVIA recently entered into a milestone agreement with Alibaba Cloud to collaborate in China. Through this collaboration, IQVIA will be the first company to make its Salesforce-based products available on Alibaba Cloud and the only life sciences provider to have a full Salesforce-based ecosystem of products hosted locally and designed to be compliant with China's data residency and privacy regulations. Through our partnership with Alibaba Cloud and Salesforce, IQVIA will continue to extend the OCE suite, delivering innovative capabilities tailored to meet China's specific market needs. As you know, IQVIA's Human Data Science Cloud offers clients a combination of extensive data networks, data integration, and embedded intelligence, all of which help our clients deal with the challenge of increased data complexity and volume. A top-10 pharma awarded IQVIA our largest ever commercial managed services deal where we will take responsibility for managing the end-to-end commercial analytics for all their commercial brands globally. Personalization of care is becoming a focus of our customers' commercial strategy. This quarter, IQVIA was awarded a major patient support program by a top-10 pharma for their [indiscernible] cardiology product displacing the incumbent vendor. And once again validating IQVIA's uniquely differentiated integrated domain expertise, services, and technology platform. As I previously highlighted, demand from our EBP customers has remained high despite the funding levels returning essentially to pre-pandemic levels. As an example, a U.S. based emerging biopharma company recently selected IQVIA to be their end-to-end clinical to commercial partner. IQVIA was selected due to the breath of capabilities, our domain expertise, strong resources and technology such as OCE. IQVIA will support all aspects of their first commercial launch as well as provide clinical trial services for their future indications. In another example, Biostage which is a biotech company developing regenerative medicine treatment selected IQVIA to manage its first clinical trial of their esophageal implant product. Current treatment options for patients diagnosed with esophageal cancer result in only 20% survival at 5 years. In the first use of the implant, the trial demonstrated that the product was able to successfully regenerate tissue to restore the functionality of the esophagus. IQVIA was selected due to our dedicated gastrointestinal team, and our ability and expertise running the most complex cutting-edge cell and gene therapy trials. Within our RNVS, we also signed a long-term collaboration with Clalit, the largest health services provider in Israel to launch the first Prime Site in the region. The collaboration combines IQVIA and Clalit's capabilities in clinical trial delivery, real world research data, and genomics. Clalit operates a network of 14 hospitals and more than 1600 primary care clinics with special expertise in oncology, pediatric rare disease, and genomics. In Oncology, which remains the largest therapeutic area for R&D outsourcing, we continue to experience strong double digit year-over-year growth in bookings. As an example, we expanded one of our preferred partnerships with a top global pharma which awarded IQVIA a large early and late stage trial in multiple oncology indications. We were selected because of our analytics to optimize protocol development, site selection, and operational planning including our ability to recruit patients meeting their diversity targets. So, overall, the R&DS business continues the strong momentum. You saw we achieved new bookings of $3.1 billion in the quarter, the highest in our history. This translated into a quarterly book-to-bill of 1.51 including pass throughs. And excluding pass throughs, the business delivered almost $2 billion of total net new business in the quarter with a book-to-bill ratio of 1.30. For the full-year, our contracted book-to-bill ratio was 1.36 including pass throughs and 1.33 excluding pass throughs. I will now turn it over to Ron for more details on our financial performance.\nRon Bruehlman: Thanks, Ari, and good morning, everyone. Let's start by reviewing revenue. Fourth quarter revenue of $739 million grew 2.8% on a reported basis and 7% at constant currency. In the quarter, COVID-related revenues were approximately $190 million which was down about $150 million versus the fourth quarter of 2021. In our base business, that is excluding all COVID-related work from both this year and last, organic growth at constant currency was 10%. Technology & Analytics Solutions revenue for the fourth quarter was $1,499 million, up 0.2% reported and 4.7% at constant currency. Excluding all COVID-related work, organic growth at constant currency in TAS was 7%. R&D Solutions fourth quarter revenue of $2,058 million was up 5.9% reported and 9.3% at constant currency. Excluding all COVID-related work, organic growth at constant currency in R&DS was 14%. Finally, Contract Sales & Medical Solutions or CSMS fourth quarter revenue of $182 million declined 7.1% reported, but grew 2% at constant currency. Excluding all COVID-related work, organic growth at constant currency in CSMS was also 2%. For the full-year, revenue was $14,410 million growing at 3.9% on a reported basis and 7.8% at constant currency. COVID-related revenues totaled approximately $1 billion for the year. In our base business, again that's excluding all COVID-related work, organic growth at constant currency was 13%. For the full-year, Technology & Analytics Solutions revenue $5,746 million, up 3.8% reported and 8.7% at constant currency. Excluding all COVID-related work, organic growth at constant currency in TAS was 10% for the year. Full-year revenue in R&D Solutions was $7,921 million growing 4.8% reported and 7.7% at constant currency. Excluding all COVID-related work, organic growth at constant currency in R&DS was 17%. Full-year CSMS revenue was $743 million which was down 5.2% reported, but grew 2.7% at constant currency. Excluding all COVID-related work, organic growth at constant currency in CSMS was 4% for the year. Now let's move down the P&L. Adjusted EBITDA was $920 million for the fourth quarter, representing growth of 11.1% while full-year adjusted EBITDA was $3,346 million which was up 10.7% year-over-year. Fourth quarter GAAP net income was $227 million. And GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.20. Full-year GAAP net income was $1,091 million or $5.72 of earnings per diluted share. Adjusted net income was $524 million in the fourth quarter. And adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 9% to $2.78. For the full-year, adjusted net income was $1,937 million. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $10.16. Up 12.5% year-over-year. Now as Ari reviewed, R&D Solutions delivered another outstanding quarterly booking. Our backlog at December 31 stood at a record $27.2 billion which was up 9.6% year-over-year on a reported basis and 11.6% adjusting for the impact of foreign exchange. Without that impact of foreign exchange, year-over-year backlog would have been about $500 million higher. Full-year net new business increased $10.8 billion, growing 6.2% year-over-year on a reported basis. It increased to $10.8 billion I should say, growing 6.2% year-over-year on a reported despite a significant amount of COVID bookings we had in 2021 that didn't repeat in 2022. Now reviewing the balance sheet, as of December 31, cash and cash equivalence totaled $1,216 million, and gross debt was $12,747 million. And that resulted in net debt of $11,531 million. Our net leverage ratio ended the year at 3.45 times trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA. Fourth quarter cash flow from operations was $560 million. And CapEx was $171 million which resulted in a free cash flow of $389 million for the quarter. Now as we shared on our last earnings call, early in the fourth quarter we retired $510 million of variable rate U.S. dollar term loan that was scheduled to mature in early 2024. At the end of the year, we entered into a $1 billion of floating to fixed interest rates swap to further limit our exposure to changes in interest rates. And with these changes, our debt structure at yearend was 66% fixed. And we expect this to drop to about 58% fixed at the end of Q1 when as you know we have $1 billion swap expiring. December 31 marked the end of our Vision 2022 three-year plan and as already mentioned, we exceeded our commitments and here are a few highlights. We achieved a compound average growth rate for revenue of 9.1% reported in 10.2% adjusted for the impact of foreign exchange. This achievement exceeded the high-end of our goal range of 7% to 10%. Our three-year CAGR for adjusted EBITDA was 11.7%, exceeding our goal of 8% to 11%. And for adjusted diluted earnings per share, the average growth rate was 16.7% consistent with our goal of double-digit growth. Finally, our net leverage ratio exiting 2022 of 3.4 times trailing 12 month adjusted EBITDA compared favorably to our goal of 3.5x to 4x. Okay, let's turn now to 2023 guidance. For the full-year 2023, we expect total revenue to be between $15.150 billion and $15.400 billion representing year-over-year growth of 5.1% to 6.9%. This revenue growth includes about 100 basis points of contribution from M&A activity and a very slight FX tailwind of approximately 10 basis points versus the prior-year. Adjusting for the COVID-related work step-down which we anticipate to be approximately $600 million, the contribution of acquisitions and the FX tailwind, our guidance implies 9% to 11% underlying organic revenue growth at constant currency. Our adjusted EBITDA guidance is $3.625 billion to $3.695 billion, our growth of 8.3% to 10.4%. Our adjusted diluted EPS guidance is $10.26 to $10.56 representing year-over-year growth of 1% to 3.9%. Our EPS guidance includes about $615 million of interest expense, just under $550 million of operational D&A and effective income tax rate of approximately 21%, which is about a point higher than it otherwise would have been because of the increase in the U.K. corporate tax rate from 19% to 25%. And finally, our EPS guidance assumes an average diluted share count slightly above 190 million shares. Adjusting for the year-over-year impact of the one-time step-up in interest rates and the higher U.K. tax rate, our guidance implies adjusted EPS growth of 11% to 14%. This guidance assumes about $2 billion of cash deployment split evenly between acquisitions and debt retirement and regarding the latter, we expect to retire remaining term debt maturing in March 2024, towards the end of the year; that is the end of '23. Based on these assumptions and our guidance, our net leverage ratio should drop to below three times adjusted EBITDA by the end of 2023. Finally, our guidance assumes that foreign currency rates as of February 8th continue for the balance of the year. Now, I know there are a lot of moving pieces in our guidance. So, let me share some additional color on the revenue and adjusted EPS dynamics in 2023. As I mentioned earlier, we anticipate that COVID-related revenue will step down by approximately $600 million versus 2022. And I should highlight that about 40% of this step-down will occur in the first quarter. Now, it will more than compensate for this headwind during the course of the year as we project revenue to grow between 9% and 11% organically at constant currency excluding COVID-related work. As I also mentioned previously, our full-year guidance includes about 100 basis points of M&A contribution and a very slight tailwind from foreign exchange of 10 basis points. That said, it's important to point out that we will actually experience a headwind from FX in the first-half. Now at the segment level, we expect revenue growth to be 6% to 8% reported, this includes a year-over-year step-down in COVID-related work underlying organic growth for TAS that is adjusting for the step-down and COVID work, FX and acquisition impacts will be 7% to 9%. R&DS revenue will grow 5% to 7% reported. This reflects an even more significant year-over-year step-down in COVID-related work, underlying organic growth for R&DS, again adjusting for COVID-related work, FX, and acquisition impact will be 10% to 12%. And finally, in CSMS, revenue growth is expected to be flat reported, and approximately two percentage points organic excluding COVID-related work and FX impacts. On adjusted EPS, we will experience the year-over-year impact of the step up in the interest rates and an increase in the U.K. corporate tax rate that I mentioned. Together, these non-operational items are expected to impact growth by approximately 10 percentage points year-over-year. Excluding these items, we expect to deliver strong results with 11% to 14% adjusted EPS growth. It's important to note that the year-over-year increase in interest expense step up will be most pronounced in the first-half, while the operational tailwind from our cost cutting and productivity initiatives will be skewed towards the second-half of the year. And as these timing issues are relevant to our first quarter guidance, the first quarter will be the toughest comparison versus the prior year primarily due to four factors. Number one, the largest headwind from FX, despite FX being a tailwind for the year; number two, the largest year-over-year COVID-related step-down; third, the toughest interest expense comparison; and finally fourth, the phasing during the year of the benefits of our productivity initiatives which will increase as we progress through the year. So, as a result, in Q1, we expect revenues to be between $3.570 billion and $3.640 billion or growth at 2.4% to 4.3% on a constant currency basis, and 0.1% to 2% on a reported basis. Excluding COVID-related work, we expect organic revenue growth at constant currency to be between 9% and 11%. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $835 million and $860 million, which is up 2.8% to 5.9%. And finally, adjusted diluted EPS is expected to be between $2.35 and $2.46, declining 4.9% to 0.4%. Excluding the step up of the interest expense and the tax rate in the U.K., we expect adjusted diluted EPS to grow between 6% and 10% in the first quarter. Again, our guidance assumes that foreign currency rates, as of February 8, continue for the balance of the year. So, to summarize, Q4 was another strong quarter capping a successful year. For the full-year, revenue grew 13% organic at constant currency excluding COVID-related work, and adjusted EPS was up 13%. Underlying demand in the industry and our business remain healthy, with RFP growth accelerating in Q4 and recording bookings in R&DS. During 2022, we repurchased almost $1.2 billion of our shares, and retired $500 million of our variable rate term debt, while reducing our net debt leverage ratio to 3.4 times. We exceeded our Vision 2022 commitments despite the volatile macro environment. And lastly, we're projecting strong operating performance again in 2023, with 9% to 11% organic revenue growth at constant currency excluding COVID-related work, and 11% to 14% adjusted EPS growth excluding non-operational headwinds. And with that, let me hand it back over to the operator for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Dan Leonard with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nDan Leonard: Thank you. So, I'll just start off, Ari, you mentioned continued confidence in the 2025 goals. You're guiding 5% to 7% of revenue growth in '23. I think the CAGR through '25 was a double-digit number. So, could you bridge from the 2023 result to the acceleration anticipated thereafter? Thank you.\nAri Bousbib: Yes, thank you very much, Dan. Look, when we say we are on the same trajectory we were on when we set our '25 goals, we -- it continues to be true operationally. Obviously, we assumed foreign currency rates that were different. I think we lost -- I don't know the exact number any longer, but we probably lost $500 million in revenue just in 2022, so -- to FX. So, look, I don't know about revenue; it'll be close. Maybe not 20, but it'll be close. On EBITDA and on earnings per share, we're very confident that we will achieve those goals. Again, the -- what we are facing, first of all, you're seeing the EBTIDA is certainly, clearly on that trajectory unchanged despite everything else. And EPS is just as we said in our introductory remarks, a one-time step up that hopefully won't replicate. If anything, I think the world expects rates to either stabilize or start declining afterwards, in '24 and '25, so that would be even a tailwind. But certainly the step-up is one-time. And after that, we fully expect the resume very strong double-digit as we experienced. I remind you we delivered over 16% compound earnings per share rate of growth rate over the year 2022 period -- three-year period. Thank you.\nDan Leonard: Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Eric Coldwell with Baird. Your line is open.\nEric Coldwell: Thank you. Good morning. So, I wanted to hit on R&DS bookings first. Difficult to ask the question in a way that's easy to answer, but I'd like you to step back and think about your fourth quarter strong bookings, your '22 bookings. Do you have a sense how much was, if you will, normal opportunities versus, say, competitive takeaways, rescue wins, or incremental share capture that you might have gained through higher hit rates through the year? Just trying to get a sense of where the market was versus what IQV did additionally on top of that, if that makes sense.\nAri Bousbib: Yes. Yes, well, it's really hard because we don't have the perspective of time and clear data from competitors yet. And we will know a little bit more after we read your report on how CROs did when everyone has reported. So, I'm looking forward to that read. But look, we've been on a momentum certainly since the merger to gain market share. And I think it's clear that we have been gaining market share. We know we are gaining market share because we are displacing competitors. I don't think rescue studies played a role. Of course, we have the anecdotal here and there, but not more or less than in history. And things happen, and the study doesn't go well with a certain approach. And at some point in time, the sponsor decides that they want to switch CROs, it's a very difficult and cumbersome exercise, and no one wants to do that, but it does happen. I don't think it's happened more than in the past, unless you're including rescue studies that were at the beginning and that for a reason or another the sponsor decided to switch CROs. And that I would include in the category of market share gains. The market continues to be strong. The underlying demand, all the indicators that we see, and we kept repeating it ad nauseam during 2022 despite everyone else being on the other side and suggesting that the world was falling apart because of biotech funding levels returning to what I considered to be very strong levels, but nevertheless, lower levels than they were during the pandemic. We haven't seen any delays in decision-making, we haven't seen any signs that demand was slowing down. Quite the opposite, I mentioned that our RFP flow is very strong. I can give you even more -- I've got some more data here on the, if you'd like, the -- our --\nEric Coldwell: Yes. The answer would always be yes, multi-core data.\nAri Bousbib: So, I kind of -- I get that. Yes, the -- again, overall RFP flow was very strong. We said 13% for the full-year, and over 20% in the fourth quarter, so, if anything, accelerating. Our qualified pipeline at the end of the year was up over 20%, and that is really the pipeline that we consider real. The awards, by the way, which is kind of an early indicator of what will happen in the future; awards, I remind you, we stopped at -- we have essentially one, but we have not yet contracted for and not booked for. The awards were up -- actually, the absolute number in Q4 was the highest ever, and it was up 9% year-over-year. So, we mentioned the book-to-bill ratio, the backlog, which itself is up just under 10% year-over-year, and 11.6% excluding FX. So, I don't know what else to share. We've got our solid numbers here that support healthy demand for clinical trial services. And then, on top of that you can add our market share gains, and I think that explains it. Thank you, Eric.\nEric Coldwell: And Ron, if I could just have one quick technical item here, can you confirm that there are no share repurchases built into the guidance? And I know you talked about the $2 billion capital deployment and the split between debt and M&A. But is there any current thinking on taking some advantage of that authorization that you have on the repurchase side?\nRon Bruehlman: I can confirm that there is no share repurchase baked into our guidance. We're right now assuming $2 billion of capital deployment split evenly between M&A and debt reduction. Well, might we repurchase some shares during the year? Sure, that that's our assumption going in, and the guidance that we gave is that we're not. And we'll devote the capital to debt reduction instead. But that could always change with circumstances.\nEric Coldwell: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Anne Samuel with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Anne Samuel with JPMorgan, your line is open.\nAri Bousbib: Okay, next question, please.\nOperator: Your next question is from Justin Bowers with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nJustin Bowers: Hi, good morning, everyone. Just pivoting from RDS, Ari, you talked a lot about some strong momentum in commercial managed services. Just want to -- wondering if you could expand about some of the strength there, and also is that isolated just in TAS or is that also in the CTMS business?\nAri Bousbib: You mean CSMS, right, the Contract Sales --?\nJustin Bowers: Sorry, the CSMS?\nAri Bousbib: Yes.\nJustin Bowers: Yes, that's what I --\nAri Bousbib: No, I mean, CSMS is a relatively slow grower, so I mean I would put that aside. The TAS growth has been consistent. We're pleased, obviously, to see that it continued to grow. You saw that excluding the COVID step down, and we had a fair -- I would say a large share of COVID work during the pandemic, so that's stepping down. And excluding that, we had growth of 7% in Q4, and 10% for the full-year. Quarter-to-quarter it could vary. I think the first-half was more or less around 10% growth, third quarter was 12%, we had the -- activity that was -- that came in earlier than we thought. And the fourth quarter was 7%, so, overall, very good growth in Q4. We guided 7% to 9% for next year. Again, this is consistent -- again excluding COVID acquisitions and FX, this is consistent with the underlying operating momentum that we've had in TAS, and that we've guided to, which is a high single-digit. So, the real -- the fast growers in this business are technology and real-world, and that's where I mentioned a few very significant achievements and a few significant awards with clients. Both considered to be strong drivers of growth as we continue to find innovative ways to utilize real-world evidence for clients and deploy more of our technology solutions. The piece of the business that it perhaps more exposed to the economic whims and budget expansions or restrictions by clients is the more discretionary spend, like the analytics and the consulting work. We saw, usually at the end, almost -- just to share a little bit more color, we usually have at the end of the year an acceleration in this business, and we didn't see that in December. And the reason for that is, historically, clients like to spend more towards the end of the year, and they do kind of last-minute purchases, and they kind of utilize their budgets, if you will. And we didn't see that so much this year. And I -- again, I don't know whether people are kind of being more cautious or anything, but -- and mostly, again, it was in the consulting area and analytics, which tends to be short cycle, short-term, and more discretionary. But the underlying growth is driven by real-world and technology, both of which are longer-term decisions and are not so subject to cyclical economic changes. And then, of course, the last piece is the data business, which is flat and continues flat to low single digits, one-ish percent, and that continues where it is. And when you do the math, basically that's what yields your high single-digit growth for the segment. Thank you for your question.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Jack Meehan with Nephron. Your line is open.\nJack Meehan: Thank you. Good morning. Ari, so, I know you sound bullish around the funding trend that you've seen over the last year. Wanted to ask about funding in a different way, just what were you seeing in terms of cancellations around your end? Was there anything notable about that relative to the last couple of years?\nAri Bousbib: Nothing.\nJack Meehan: Short and sweet. Yes, has there been any rumbling around restructuring at any of your important clients? I guess just like how are you building just sort of a macro into your outlook for the R&D segment this year?\nAri Bousbib: Okay, and once again in terms of demand, no signs that we can see that our clients are somehow delaying, canceling, postponing clinical trial development work that was planned before. So, we don't see anything, no unusual cancellation activity, no unusual postponements, nothing. We've been saying this essentially for 12 months exactly. In terms of factoring the macro environment, if you want to expand your question, then that's a different discussion. We've got -- we are a large, powerful ship navigating extremely stormy waters. The engine continues to be very strong, that's the demand, and certainly our operating momentum in our organization. But the winds in the form of interest expense, in the form of wage inflation, in the form of wars in foreign theaters that affect our ability to do work in certain sides, in the form of continued COVID issues in China which are expected to delay our return to normal operating mode in clinical sites; all of those and more are these winds that I'm -- winds and stormy waters that I'm referring to that are macro factors. Some of which we can do something about. For example, wage inflation we are addressing by trying to manage our workforce more tightly, by increasing and accelerating our productivity initiatives, by looking at maintaining and accelerating our cost cutting discipline. And we've launched that effect that towards the end of last year, a new program to again bring forward many field overhead rationalizations and economies of scope and outsourcing and offshoring decisions that were scheduled to occur over the '22 to '25 planning period and we are accelerating all of that into 2023. So, as Ron mentioned, the benefits of those will begin showing towards the latter part of the year, but the work is ongoing. So, that's how we are trying to address those macro factors that are not -- that are somehow that we can offset with action on our side. With respect to interest, shortest one-time step-up in the interest expense, we're kind of limited in what we can do. But we certainly, as you saw started reducing our debt levels, and we entered into swaps. We're trying to address that in capital markets, we will probably towards the end of the year retire another $1 billion of debt, the tranche that would normally turnout in 2024. We'll do that in the latter part of the year. And for now, as Eric remind us we do not have any share repurchase plan this year, because we're diverting our cash flow now, if our cash flow is very strong and circumstances were to change, obviously, we will adjust those decisions. But that's what we're doing to address the macro factor. Thank you very much.\nJack Meehan: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Luke Sergott with Barclays. Your line is open.\nLuke Sergott: Hey guys, thanks. Can you one clean-up here on the COVID, can you give us a sense of the how you're expecting that the roll-off in 1Q between the two segment between TAS and RDS, just from a modeling perspective?\nAri Bousbib: Yes, Jack, it's I think I'd said overall of the $600 million COVID step-down year-over-year, about 40% of it would be in Q1, though, will be fairly substantial impacts in both of the segments there. And I would say about a third of the impact would be in TAS, [Jack] [Ph], and about two-thirds in R&D, that's kind of how you should think about it by quarter and for the full-year, it's above that roughly.\nLuke Sergott: All right, great. Thanks. It's really helpful. And lastly, here on front on the free cash flow. So, I mean, I understand a ton of moving parts here on for the year. But can you give us a sense of what you're targeting for '23 and as a percentage of EBITDA conversion?\nAri Bousbib: We always talked about it as a percentage of adjusted net income. And we target typically between 80% and 90% free cash flow adjusted net income, that's where we were for the full-year 2022. And look the only thing I would caution on that is in any given year, it could vary from that because cash flow is based on point-to-point of the balance sheet. It's not like, an accrual concept or anything like that. So, of course, you could be higher or lower, we were substantially higher than that in 2021. And we're right in the range in 2022. And I would say just as a kind of a target you should think of as being in the 80% to 90% of adjusted net income range, but recognizing that we could deviate from that in any given year.\nLuke Sergott: All right, thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Sandy Draper with Guggenheim. Your line is open.\nSandy Draper: Thanks very much. Question for you, Ari to sort of engage in your crystal ball a little bit longer-term because I know you're talking certainly a lot more of the biopharma CEOs and than I am, when I look back at sort of what I heard at JPMorgan, Davos, just other things around, how pharma is looking at the next three to five even 10 years, especially with the Inflation Reduction Act, I hear sort of conflicting messages from about are people going to invest more, hey, we want to get away from or be more diversified and not so concentrated in one or two blockbuster drugs and so we want to get more drugs out there. We are going to and so there is more trials we're going to pull back, I just love to hear what you're hearing or what you're thinking about what your customers are looking at not really, from the economic perspective about the current macro environment, but with how their portfolios are, how concentrated they are and few really big drugs, and what the Inflation Reduction Act means. Would love to hear your thoughts on that? Thanks.\nAri Bousbib: Yes, thank you. Yes, I mean look, the Inflation Reduction Act of just similar to, what they decided to name it. It's very is influx right now, there's a lot of work to be done in finalizing the details of the legislation; we actually spend a lot of time with our clients trying to explain to them what's in it. Not that we understand it entirely, because many of the provisions, first of all, haven't been detailed enough or specific enough. And we don't know how it's going to work. And a lot of it is still subject to negotiations. Many of the provisions anyway, won't kick in until later in the decade, and again, some parts of the inflations are undefined, many of the rules and regulations are still under discussion. So, generally, the statements from pharma CEOs, when I speak to them about this is that, it's harmful to innovation and to patients because anytime you start curbing the economics or you try to start a curbing the economics for drug development, even if it's long-term and even if it's the effect, if any, before any other administration changes these things, it'll be seen 15 years from now, it could at least conceptually, the pharma companies to decide, well, it's not as attractive, so I'm going to drop this program or that program, when I factor in different types of pricing and so on, so forth, or reimbursements. But again this is not how pharma works. Despite the [indiscernible] pharma is motivated by healing people. And the R&D, all of the R&D Heads at Pharma companies that I know and my colleagues speak to day in and day out, their motivation, what makes them come to work every day is they are going to come up with a drug to cure pancreatic cancer and to cure breast cancer and to cure diabetes, et cetera, et cetera. So, this is the underlying motivation. And the model is predicated on pharmaceuticals doing good for society. So, the notion that people are going to cancel the program, because the economic zone gets attractive, yes at the margins. That's a general observation. Second observation in my conversations with clients is that a lot of and that's a trend that that's independent of the Inflation Reduction Act, a lot of the focus is on trying to address more specific diseases, rare diseases, subcategories within subcategories in oncology, I mentioned before oncology is probably and it continues to be the largest and strongest grower in our business in terms of the demand for clinical trials, and drug development work. So, that's just not going away until the diseases go away, which we all hope for, drug development is here to stay. And pretty much in the same model. Again, the focus on addressing previously untouched obviously is much smaller markets. That continues, and that as you know plays to our strength and capability. So, I mean, that's the bit of color on my conversation. So, yes, I mean it's a general cloud and at a conference like Davos, you could expect to hear such things. But in practice that is not changing very much day-to-day how our plants operate and make decisions with respect to their investment programs. Thank you.\nSandy Draper: Got it. Thanks, Ari.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Elizabeth Anderson with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nElizabeth Anderson: Hi, guys. Thanks so much for the question. I was wondering if you could comment on sort of the degree of pricing that you're sort of getting on new contracts and that are going into bookings and also sort of the degree of wage inflation you're currently experiencing as your labor force. Thank you.\nAri Bousbib: Okay, I will take the second part of the question first, yes, we are experiencing significant wage inflation, the skill sets that we are looking for are scarce and in high demand, we're looking for people who have healthcare expertise, who have data science expertise, who have software development expertise, or a combination of all three, and that these skills are in very high demand. Secondly, frankly, we are a hunting ground for competitors of all kinds in the healthcare sector, in the tech sector, and in the data science sector. And as a result, we are compelled to raise our compensation programs, and that causes inflation. So, you have the general inflation out there, plus reasons there are specific idiosyncratic to our business and to our company. Now, I mentioned before that, despite that, you can see that we are growing our margins. So, we are addressing it, and that's true, essentially cost management programs meaning, we do more work in lower cost areas, et cetera. Now, I get into the first part of your question, which is pricing, are we able to offset those costs increases with pricing generally, in the commercial sector for shorter cycle businesses? Theoretically, yes, and we are when we can, but it's always a negotiation with clients. And it's a competitive market out there, you got a lot of smaller competitors who are fighting for the slice of the pie. And often, we got to defend against that. And so, our pricing flexibility is limited, it does exist in theory on the commercial side. In R&D, as in for clinical trials, yes, of course, rates have to reflect what the labor cost is. And again, that's also subject to negotiation. But we do transfer at least a portion of those wage raises to our clients in the form of rates that are applied to determine pricing for a clinical trial. But I remind you that the clinical trial business is a long-term, long cycle business, meaning that what we booked today, which may reflect some level of price increase, won't be realized into revenues until the next, the one to four or five years. So, what we are delivering in revenue today, and tomorrow was sold several years ago at different, under different labor cost assumptions. So, there is a delay, if you will, in the clinical trial business, because of the long cycle nature of the business. There are contracts where we have escalation clauses for inflation, but they never envisioned the type of inflation that we are facing in some of the markets. So, that's the picture on pricing. Thank you very much, Elizabeth.\nElizabeth Anderson: That's very helpful. Thank you, sir.\nAri Bousbib: Thank you.\nNick Childs: One more question.\nOperator: Your final question comes from the line of Charles Rhyee with Cowen. Your line is open.\nCharles Rhyee: Great, thanks for taking the question. Maybe Ron, just I might have missed it, but when you talk about the impact EPS from these buckets, can you kind of break down for us the relative contribution between the higher tax rate, interest expense, et cetera, that makes up sort of that delta on EPS growth and then if you think about for this year, yes, for the EPS?\nAri Bousbib: Yes, well look the U.K. corporate tax rate increase, added about a percentage point to our overall effective tax rate. So, you start with that, but most of the impact year-over-year is coming from interest expense. So, we were, I think slightly over $400 million in interest expense in 2022. We told you about $615 million in 2023. So, you can do the math on that, then with 190 -- roughly 190 million shares and figure out what the impact is, it's principally coming out of that and that's why we excluded those two items and showed you that absent those are EPS growth rate underlying operational was still very strong double-digit.\nCharles Rhyee: And that assumes the debt pay down assumptions and going into swap agreements or is that, if you do those things through the course of the year, okay?\nAri Bousbib: Yes, all of that is baked into our assumptions.\nCharles Rhyee: All right, great.\nNick Childs: Thank you.\nOperator: I will now turn the call back over to Mr. Childs.\nNick Childs: Okay. Thank you everyone for joining us today. We look forward to speaking to you again on our next earnings call. Myself and the team will be available the rest of the day for any follow-up questions you might have.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Ron Bruehlman",
            "content": "Thanks, Ari, and good morning, everyone. Let's start by reviewing revenue. Fourth quarter revenue of $739 million grew 2.8% on a reported basis and 7% at constant currency. In the quarter, COVID-related revenues were approximately $190 million which was down about $150 million versus the fourth quarter of 2021. In our base business, that is excluding all COVID-related work from both this year and last, organic growth at constant currency was 10%. Technology & Analytics Solutions revenue for the fourth quarter was $1,499 million, up 0.2% reported and 4.7% at constant currency. Excluding all COVID-related work, organic growth at constant currency in TAS was 7%. R&D Solutions fourth quarter revenue of $2,058 million was up 5.9% reported and 9.3% at constant currency. Excluding all COVID-related work, organic growth at constant currency in R&DS was 14%. Finally, Contract Sales & Medical Solutions or CSMS fourth quarter revenue of $182 million declined 7.1% reported, but grew 2% at constant currency. Excluding all COVID-related work, organic growth at constant currency in CSMS was also 2%. For the full-year, revenue was $14,410 million growing at 3.9% on a reported basis and 7.8% at constant currency. COVID-related revenues totaled approximately $1 billion for the year. In our base business, again that's excluding all COVID-related work, organic growth at constant currency was 13%. For the full-year, Technology & Analytics Solutions revenue $5,746 million, up 3.8% reported and 8.7% at constant currency. Excluding all COVID-related work, organic growth at constant currency in TAS was 10% for the year. Full-year revenue in R&D Solutions was $7,921 million growing 4.8% reported and 7.7% at constant currency. Excluding all COVID-related work, organic growth at constant currency in R&DS was 17%. Full-year CSMS revenue was $743 million which was down 5.2% reported, but grew 2.7% at constant currency. Excluding all COVID-related work, organic growth at constant currency in CSMS was 4% for the year. Now let's move down the P&L. Adjusted EBITDA was $920 million for the fourth quarter, representing growth of 11.1% while full-year adjusted EBITDA was $3,346 million which was up 10.7% year-over-year. Fourth quarter GAAP net income was $227 million. And GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.20. Full-year GAAP net income was $1,091 million or $5.72 of earnings per diluted share. Adjusted net income was $524 million in the fourth quarter. And adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 9% to $2.78. For the full-year, adjusted net income was $1,937 million. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $10.16. Up 12.5% year-over-year. Now as Ari reviewed, R&D Solutions delivered another outstanding quarterly booking. Our backlog at December 31 stood at a record $27.2 billion which was up 9.6% year-over-year on a reported basis and 11.6% adjusting for the impact of foreign exchange. Without that impact of foreign exchange, year-over-year backlog would have been about $500 million higher. Full-year net new business increased $10.8 billion, growing 6.2% year-over-year on a reported basis. It increased to $10.8 billion I should say, growing 6.2% year-over-year on a reported despite a significant amount of COVID bookings we had in 2021 that didn't repeat in 2022. Now reviewing the balance sheet, as of December 31, cash and cash equivalence totaled $1,216 million, and gross debt was $12,747 million. And that resulted in net debt of $11,531 million. Our net leverage ratio ended the year at 3.45 times trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA. Fourth quarter cash flow from operations was $560 million. And CapEx was $171 million which resulted in a free cash flow of $389 million for the quarter. Now as we shared on our last earnings call, early in the fourth quarter we retired $510 million of variable rate U.S. dollar term loan that was scheduled to mature in early 2024. At the end of the year, we entered into a $1 billion of floating to fixed interest rates swap to further limit our exposure to changes in interest rates. And with these changes, our debt structure at yearend was 66% fixed. And we expect this to drop to about 58% fixed at the end of Q1 when as you know we have $1 billion swap expiring. December 31 marked the end of our Vision 2022 three-year plan and as already mentioned, we exceeded our commitments and here are a few highlights. We achieved a compound average growth rate for revenue of 9.1% reported in 10.2% adjusted for the impact of foreign exchange. This achievement exceeded the high-end of our goal range of 7% to 10%. Our three-year CAGR for adjusted EBITDA was 11.7%, exceeding our goal of 8% to 11%. And for adjusted diluted earnings per share, the average growth rate was 16.7% consistent with our goal of double-digit growth. Finally, our net leverage ratio exiting 2022 of 3.4 times trailing 12 month adjusted EBITDA compared favorably to our goal of 3.5x to 4x. Okay, let's turn now to 2023 guidance. For the full-year 2023, we expect total revenue to be between $15.150 billion and $15.400 billion representing year-over-year growth of 5.1% to 6.9%. This revenue growth includes about 100 basis points of contribution from M&A activity and a very slight FX tailwind of approximately 10 basis points versus the prior-year. Adjusting for the COVID-related work step-down which we anticipate to be approximately $600 million, the contribution of acquisitions and the FX tailwind, our guidance implies 9% to 11% underlying organic revenue growth at constant currency. Our adjusted EBITDA guidance is $3.625 billion to $3.695 billion, our growth of 8.3% to 10.4%. Our adjusted diluted EPS guidance is $10.26 to $10.56 representing year-over-year growth of 1% to 3.9%. Our EPS guidance includes about $615 million of interest expense, just under $550 million of operational D&A and effective income tax rate of approximately 21%, which is about a point higher than it otherwise would have been because of the increase in the U.K. corporate tax rate from 19% to 25%. And finally, our EPS guidance assumes an average diluted share count slightly above 190 million shares. Adjusting for the year-over-year impact of the one-time step-up in interest rates and the higher U.K. tax rate, our guidance implies adjusted EPS growth of 11% to 14%. This guidance assumes about $2 billion of cash deployment split evenly between acquisitions and debt retirement and regarding the latter, we expect to retire remaining term debt maturing in March 2024, towards the end of the year; that is the end of '23. Based on these assumptions and our guidance, our net leverage ratio should drop to below three times adjusted EBITDA by the end of 2023. Finally, our guidance assumes that foreign currency rates as of February 8th continue for the balance of the year. Now, I know there are a lot of moving pieces in our guidance. So, let me share some additional color on the revenue and adjusted EPS dynamics in 2023. As I mentioned earlier, we anticipate that COVID-related revenue will step down by approximately $600 million versus 2022. And I should highlight that about 40% of this step-down will occur in the first quarter. Now, it will more than compensate for this headwind during the course of the year as we project revenue to grow between 9% and 11% organically at constant currency excluding COVID-related work. As I also mentioned previously, our full-year guidance includes about 100 basis points of M&A contribution and a very slight tailwind from foreign exchange of 10 basis points. That said, it's important to point out that we will actually experience a headwind from FX in the first-half. Now at the segment level, we expect revenue growth to be 6% to 8% reported, this includes a year-over-year step-down in COVID-related work underlying organic growth for TAS that is adjusting for the step-down and COVID work, FX and acquisition impacts will be 7% to 9%. R&DS revenue will grow 5% to 7% reported. This reflects an even more significant year-over-year step-down in COVID-related work, underlying organic growth for R&DS, again adjusting for COVID-related work, FX, and acquisition impact will be 10% to 12%. And finally, in CSMS, revenue growth is expected to be flat reported, and approximately two percentage points organic excluding COVID-related work and FX impacts. On adjusted EPS, we will experience the year-over-year impact of the step up in the interest rates and an increase in the U.K. corporate tax rate that I mentioned. Together, these non-operational items are expected to impact growth by approximately 10 percentage points year-over-year. Excluding these items, we expect to deliver strong results with 11% to 14% adjusted EPS growth. It's important to note that the year-over-year increase in interest expense step up will be most pronounced in the first-half, while the operational tailwind from our cost cutting and productivity initiatives will be skewed towards the second-half of the year. And as these timing issues are relevant to our first quarter guidance, the first quarter will be the toughest comparison versus the prior year primarily due to four factors. Number one, the largest headwind from FX, despite FX being a tailwind for the year; number two, the largest year-over-year COVID-related step-down; third, the toughest interest expense comparison; and finally fourth, the phasing during the year of the benefits of our productivity initiatives which will increase as we progress through the year. So, as a result, in Q1, we expect revenues to be between $3.570 billion and $3.640 billion or growth at 2.4% to 4.3% on a constant currency basis, and 0.1% to 2% on a reported basis. Excluding COVID-related work, we expect organic revenue growth at constant currency to be between 9% and 11%. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $835 million and $860 million, which is up 2.8% to 5.9%. And finally, adjusted diluted EPS is expected to be between $2.35 and $2.46, declining 4.9% to 0.4%. Excluding the step up of the interest expense and the tax rate in the U.K., we expect adjusted diluted EPS to grow between 6% and 10% in the first quarter. Again, our guidance assumes that foreign currency rates, as of February 8, continue for the balance of the year. So, to summarize, Q4 was another strong quarter capping a successful year. For the full-year, revenue grew 13% organic at constant currency excluding COVID-related work, and adjusted EPS was up 13%. Underlying demand in the industry and our business remain healthy, with RFP growth accelerating in Q4 and recording bookings in R&DS. During 2022, we repurchased almost $1.2 billion of our shares, and retired $500 million of our variable rate term debt, while reducing our net debt leverage ratio to 3.4 times. We exceeded our Vision 2022 commitments despite the volatile macro environment. And lastly, we're projecting strong operating performance again in 2023, with 9% to 11% organic revenue growth at constant currency excluding COVID-related work, and 11% to 14% adjusted EPS growth excluding non-operational headwinds. And with that, let me hand it back over to the operator for Q&A. I can confirm that there is no share repurchase baked into our guidance. We're right now assuming $2 billion of capital deployment split evenly between M&A and debt reduction. Well, might we repurchase some shares during the year? Sure, that that's our assumption going in, and the guidance that we gave is that we're not. And we'll devote the capital to debt reduction instead. But that could always change with circumstances."

            "content": "Thank you, Nick, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today to discuss our fourth quarter and full-year results. As we close 2022, we are very proud of what we've achieved at IQVIA. It was a record year for our R&DS business, we achieved bookings of $10.8 billion, which was the highest ever, our backlog stands now at a record $27.2 billion, and the business added over 275 new customers in the year. We improved access to critical research; we've expanded our decentralized clinical trial capabilities by launching the first self-collection safety lab panel for U.S. clinical trial participants in collaboration with Tasso. Our DCT program achieved GDPR validation in Europe, marking the first time a DCT offering received this data privacy validation. And our connected devices business added 50 new customers, including wins with two top-10 pharma companies. We made significant advancements as well in our real world business. We increased the number of active data sources by more than 30% across more than 50 countries, and we enhanced access to real world data for European and U.S. regulators through our partnerships with European Medicines Agency and the Real-World Alliance. We expanded our digital marketing capabilities with the acquisition of Lasso Marketing, which offers a technology purpose-built for healthcare marketers to execute digital campaigns. We deployed capital of $3.7 billion during the year. This included $1.3 billion in acquisitions, $1.2 billion in share repurchase, $700 million in CapEx, and repayment of $510 million of debt. At the same time, we were able to reduce our net leverage ratio to 3.45 times adjusted EBITDA. 2022 also marked the end of our Vision 22 three-year strategic plan. No one could have predicted the volatile macro environment we would have to operate in during this period. Despite the many headwinds we have faced, since 2019, when we set these goals, we in fact exceeded our Vision 2022 goals. I am proud of the resilience, resourcefulness, and creativity that our employees around the world demonstrate every day in support of IQVIA's mission. It is these attributes that allowed our company to deliver on the commitments we made to you in 2019. And as you know, since the beginning of '22, the industry has been reporting a slowdown in demand for clinical and commercial services caused by reductions in biotech funding, as well as the higher interest rate environment and macro economic uncertainty. As we've discussed before, while we've of course seen anecdotal evidence of these concerns we, at IQVIA, remain confident that the fundamentals of our industry and the demand from our clients remain healthy. And, in fact, we remain confident in our ability to deliver on our 2025 goals. As we begin 2023, there are more molecules in development than at any other time in history. Our RFP flow was up 13% for the full-year. We, in fact, saw acceleration in Q4 to 22%, with double-digit growth in all three segments; large, midsize, and EBP segments. Our net new business reached a record $3.1 billion in Q4, which is up 29% versus prior year. For the full-year, we achieved bookings of $10.8 billion despite the large COVID bookings we had in 2021 that didn't repeat in 2022. And yes, in our commercial business, while we are seeing some short-term fluctuations in discretionary spend categories such as, for example, consulting, demand for our commercial services nonetheless remains on a favorable growth trend. Finally, let me just acknowledge and congratulate our employees around the world for the nice recognition the company received last week. IQVIA was named to Fortune's list of the World's Most Admired Companies for the sixth consecutive year. Importantly, once again, we earned the first place ranking within our industry group. We also rank number one in seven out of nine categories, including innovation, people management, use of corporate assets, social responsibility, quality of products and services, global competitiveness, and long-term investment value. Turning now to the results for the quarter, revenue for the fourth quarter grew 2.8% on a reported basis, 7% at constant currency compared to last year. And excluding COVID-related work from both periods, we grew the top line 10% at constant currency on an organic basis. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA increased 11.1%, reflecting our strong revenue growth and ongoing cost management discipline. Fourth quarter adjusted diluted EPS, of $2.78, grew 9% driven by our adjusted EBITDA growth. Few highlights of business activity this quarter; in our technology business, IQVIA recently entered into a milestone agreement with Alibaba Cloud to collaborate in China. Through this collaboration, IQVIA will be the first company to make its Salesforce-based products available on Alibaba Cloud and the only life sciences provider to have a full Salesforce-based ecosystem of products hosted locally and designed to be compliant with China's data residency and privacy regulations. Through our partnership with Alibaba Cloud and Salesforce, IQVIA will continue to extend the OCE suite, delivering innovative capabilities tailored to meet China's specific market needs. As you know, IQVIA's Human Data Science Cloud offers clients a combination of extensive data networks, data integration, and embedded intelligence, all of which help our clients deal with the challenge of increased data complexity and volume. A top-10 pharma awarded IQVIA our largest ever commercial managed services deal where we will take responsibility for managing the end-to-end commercial analytics for all their commercial brands globally. Personalization of care is becoming a focus of our customers' commercial strategy. This quarter, IQVIA was awarded a major patient support program by a top-10 pharma for their [indiscernible] cardiology product displacing the incumbent vendor. And once again validating IQVIA's uniquely differentiated integrated domain expertise, services, and technology platform. As I previously highlighted, demand from our EBP customers has remained high despite the funding levels returning essentially to pre-pandemic levels. As an example, a U.S. based emerging biopharma company recently selected IQVIA to be their end-to-end clinical to commercial partner. IQVIA was selected due to the breath of capabilities, our domain expertise, strong resources and technology such as OCE. IQVIA will support all aspects of their first commercial launch as well as provide clinical trial services for their future indications. In another example, Biostage which is a biotech company developing regenerative medicine treatment selected IQVIA to manage its first clinical trial of their esophageal implant product. Current treatment options for patients diagnosed with esophageal cancer result in only 20% survival at 5 years. In the first use of the implant, the trial demonstrated that the product was able to successfully regenerate tissue to restore the functionality of the esophagus. IQVIA was selected due to our dedicated gastrointestinal team, and our ability and expertise running the most complex cutting-edge cell and gene therapy trials. Within our RNVS, we also signed a long-term collaboration with Clalit, the largest health services provider in Israel to launch the first Prime Site in the region. The collaboration combines IQVIA and Clalit's capabilities in clinical trial delivery, real world research data, and genomics. Clalit operates a network of 14 hospitals and more than 1600 primary care clinics with special expertise in oncology, pediatric rare disease, and genomics. In Oncology, which remains the largest therapeutic area for R&D outsourcing, we continue to experience strong double digit year-over-year growth in bookings. As an example, we expanded one of our preferred partnerships with a top global pharma which awarded IQVIA a large early and late stage trial in multiple oncology indications. We were selected because of our analytics to optimize protocol development, site selection, and operational planning including our ability to recruit patients meeting their diversity targets. So, overall, the R&DS business continues the strong momentum. You saw we achieved new bookings of $3.1 billion in the quarter, the highest in our history. This translated into a quarterly book-to-bill of 1.51 including pass throughs. And excluding pass throughs, the business delivered almost $2 billion of total net new business in the quarter with a book-to-bill ratio of 1.30. For the full-year, our contracted book-to-bill ratio was 1.36 including pass throughs and 1.33 excluding pass throughs. I will now turn it over to Ron for more details on our financial performance. Yes, thank you very much, Dan. Look, when we say we are on the same trajectory we were on when we set our '25 goals, we -- it continues to be true operationally. Obviously, we assumed foreign currency rates that were different. I think we lost -- I don't know the exact number any longer, but we probably lost $500 million in revenue just in 2022, so -- to FX. So, look, I don't know about revenue; it'll be close. Maybe not 20, but it'll be close. On EBITDA and on earnings per share, we're very confident that we will achieve those goals. Again, the -- what we are facing, first of all, you're seeing the EBTIDA is certainly, clearly on that trajectory unchanged despite everything else. And EPS is just as we said in our introductory remarks, a one-time step up that hopefully won't replicate. If anything, I think the world expects rates to either stabilize or start declining afterwards, in '24 and '25, so that would be even a tailwind. But certainly the step-up is one-time. And after that, we fully expect the resume very strong double-digit as we experienced. I remind you we delivered over 16% compound earnings per share rate of growth rate over the year 2022 period -- three-year period. Thank you. Yes. Yes, well, it's really hard because we don't have the perspective of time and clear data from competitors yet. And we will know a little bit more after we read your report on how CROs did when everyone has reported. So, I'm looking forward to that read. But look, we've been on a momentum certainly since the merger to gain market share. And I think it's clear that we have been gaining market share. We know we are gaining market share because we are displacing competitors. I don't think rescue studies played a role. Of course, we have the anecdotal here and there, but not more or less than in history. And things happen, and the study doesn't go well with a certain approach. And at some point in time, the sponsor decides that they want to switch CROs, it's a very difficult and cumbersome exercise, and no one wants to do that, but it does happen. I don't think it's happened more than in the past, unless you're including rescue studies that were at the beginning and that for a reason or another the sponsor decided to switch CROs. And that I would include in the category of market share gains. The market continues to be strong. The underlying demand, all the indicators that we see, and we kept repeating it ad nauseam during 2022 despite everyone else being on the other side and suggesting that the world was falling apart because of biotech funding levels returning to what I considered to be very strong levels, but nevertheless, lower levels than they were during the pandemic. We haven't seen any delays in decision-making, we haven't seen any signs that demand was slowing down. Quite the opposite, I mentioned that our RFP flow is very strong. I can give you even more -- I've got some more data here on the, if you'd like, the -- our -- So, I kind of -- I get that. Yes, the -- again, overall RFP flow was very strong. We said 13% for the full-year, and over 20% in the fourth quarter, so, if anything, accelerating. Our qualified pipeline at the end of the year was up over 20%, and that is really the pipeline that we consider real. The awards, by the way, which is kind of an early indicator of what will happen in the future; awards, I remind you, we stopped at -- we have essentially one, but we have not yet contracted for and not booked for. The awards were up -- actually, the absolute number in Q4 was the highest ever, and it was up 9% year-over-year. So, we mentioned the book-to-bill ratio, the backlog, which itself is up just under 10% year-over-year, and 11.6% excluding FX. So, I don't know what else to share. We've got our solid numbers here that support healthy demand for clinical trial services. And then, on top of that you can add our market share gains, and I think that explains it. Thank you, Eric. Okay, next question, please. You mean CSMS, right, the Contract Sales --? Yes. No, I mean, CSMS is a relatively slow grower, so I mean I would put that aside. The TAS growth has been consistent. We're pleased, obviously, to see that it continued to grow. You saw that excluding the COVID step down, and we had a fair -- I would say a large share of COVID work during the pandemic, so that's stepping down. And excluding that, we had growth of 7% in Q4, and 10% for the full-year. Quarter-to-quarter it could vary. I think the first-half was more or less around 10% growth, third quarter was 12%, we had the -- activity that was -- that came in earlier than we thought. And the fourth quarter was 7%, so, overall, very good growth in Q4. We guided 7% to 9% for next year. Again, this is consistent -- again excluding COVID acquisitions and FX, this is consistent with the underlying operating momentum that we've had in TAS, and that we've guided to, which is a high single-digit. So, the real -- the fast growers in this business are technology and real-world, and that's where I mentioned a few very significant achievements and a few significant awards with clients. Both considered to be strong drivers of growth as we continue to find innovative ways to utilize real-world evidence for clients and deploy more of our technology solutions. The piece of the business that it perhaps more exposed to the economic whims and budget expansions or restrictions by clients is the more discretionary spend, like the analytics and the consulting work. We saw, usually at the end, almost -- just to share a little bit more color, we usually have at the end of the year an acceleration in this business, and we didn't see that in December. And the reason for that is, historically, clients like to spend more towards the end of the year, and they do kind of last-minute purchases, and they kind of utilize their budgets, if you will. And we didn't see that so much this year. And I -- again, I don't know whether people are kind of being more cautious or anything, but -- and mostly, again, it was in the consulting area and analytics, which tends to be short cycle, short-term, and more discretionary. But the underlying growth is driven by real-world and technology, both of which are longer-term decisions and are not so subject to cyclical economic changes. And then, of course, the last piece is the data business, which is flat and continues flat to low single digits, one-ish percent, and that continues where it is. And when you do the math, basically that's what yields your high single-digit growth for the segment. Thank you for your question. Nothing. Okay, and once again in terms of demand, no signs that we can see that our clients are somehow delaying, canceling, postponing clinical trial development work that was planned before. So, we don't see anything, no unusual cancellation activity, no unusual postponements, nothing. We've been saying this essentially for 12 months exactly. In terms of factoring the macro environment, if you want to expand your question, then that's a different discussion. We've got -- we are a large, powerful ship navigating extremely stormy waters. The engine continues to be very strong, that's the demand, and certainly our operating momentum in our organization. But the winds in the form of interest expense, in the form of wage inflation, in the form of wars in foreign theaters that affect our ability to do work in certain sides, in the form of continued COVID issues in China which are expected to delay our return to normal operating mode in clinical sites; all of those and more are these winds that I'm -- winds and stormy waters that I'm referring to that are macro factors. Some of which we can do something about. For example, wage inflation we are addressing by trying to manage our workforce more tightly, by increasing and accelerating our productivity initiatives, by looking at maintaining and accelerating our cost cutting discipline. And we've launched that effect that towards the end of last year, a new program to again bring forward many field overhead rationalizations and economies of scope and outsourcing and offshoring decisions that were scheduled to occur over the '22 to '25 planning period and we are accelerating all of that into 2023. So, as Ron mentioned, the benefits of those will begin showing towards the latter part of the year, but the work is ongoing. So, that's how we are trying to address those macro factors that are not -- that are somehow that we can offset with action on our side. With respect to interest, shortest one-time step-up in the interest expense, we're kind of limited in what we can do. But we certainly, as you saw started reducing our debt levels, and we entered into swaps. We're trying to address that in capital markets, we will probably towards the end of the year retire another $1 billion of debt, the tranche that would normally turnout in 2024. We'll do that in the latter part of the year. And for now, as Eric remind us we do not have any share repurchase plan this year, because we're diverting our cash flow now, if our cash flow is very strong and circumstances were to change, obviously, we will adjust those decisions. But that's what we're doing to address the macro factor. Thank you very much. Yes, Jack, it's I think I'd said overall of the $600 million COVID step-down year-over-year, about 40% of it would be in Q1, though, will be fairly substantial impacts in both of the segments there. And I would say about a third of the impact would be in TAS, [Jack] [Ph], and about two-thirds in R&D, that's kind of how you should think about it by quarter and for the full-year, it's above that roughly. We always talked about it as a percentage of adjusted net income. And we target typically between 80% and 90% free cash flow adjusted net income, that's where we were for the full-year 2022. And look the only thing I would caution on that is in any given year, it could vary from that because cash flow is based on point-to-point of the balance sheet. It's not like, an accrual concept or anything like that. So, of course, you could be higher or lower, we were substantially higher than that in 2021. And we're right in the range in 2022. And I would say just as a kind of a target you should think of as being in the 80% to 90% of adjusted net income range, but recognizing that we could deviate from that in any given year. Yes, thank you. Yes, I mean look, the Inflation Reduction Act of just similar to, what they decided to name it. It's very is influx right now, there's a lot of work to be done in finalizing the details of the legislation; we actually spend a lot of time with our clients trying to explain to them what's in it. Not that we understand it entirely, because many of the provisions, first of all, haven't been detailed enough or specific enough. And we don't know how it's going to work. And a lot of it is still subject to negotiations. Many of the provisions anyway, won't kick in until later in the decade, and again, some parts of the inflations are undefined, many of the rules and regulations are still under discussion. So, generally, the statements from pharma CEOs, when I speak to them about this is that, it's harmful to innovation and to patients because anytime you start curbing the economics or you try to start a curbing the economics for drug development, even if it's long-term and even if it's the effect, if any, before any other administration changes these things, it'll be seen 15 years from now, it could at least conceptually, the pharma companies to decide, well, it's not as attractive, so I'm going to drop this program or that program, when I factor in different types of pricing and so on, so forth, or reimbursements. But again this is not how pharma works. Despite the [indiscernible] pharma is motivated by healing people. And the R&D, all of the R&D Heads at Pharma companies that I know and my colleagues speak to day in and day out, their motivation, what makes them come to work every day is they are going to come up with a drug to cure pancreatic cancer and to cure breast cancer and to cure diabetes, et cetera, et cetera. So, this is the underlying motivation. And the model is predicated on pharmaceuticals doing good for society. So, the notion that people are going to cancel the program, because the economic zone gets attractive, yes at the margins. That's a general observation. Second observation in my conversations with clients is that a lot of and that's a trend that that's independent of the Inflation Reduction Act, a lot of the focus is on trying to address more specific diseases, rare diseases, subcategories within subcategories in oncology, I mentioned before oncology is probably and it continues to be the largest and strongest grower in our business in terms of the demand for clinical trials, and drug development work. So, that's just not going away until the diseases go away, which we all hope for, drug development is here to stay. And pretty much in the same model. Again, the focus on addressing previously untouched obviously is much smaller markets. That continues, and that as you know plays to our strength and capability. So, I mean, that's the bit of color on my conversation. So, yes, I mean it's a general cloud and at a conference like Davos, you could expect to hear such things. But in practice that is not changing very much day-to-day how our plants operate and make decisions with respect to their investment programs. Thank you. Okay, I will take the second part of the question first, yes, we are experiencing significant wage inflation, the skill sets that we are looking for are scarce and in high demand, we're looking for people who have healthcare expertise, who have data science expertise, who have software development expertise, or a combination of all three, and that these skills are in very high demand. Secondly, frankly, we are a hunting ground for competitors of all kinds in the healthcare sector, in the tech sector, and in the data science sector. And as a result, we are compelled to raise our compensation programs, and that causes inflation. So, you have the general inflation out there, plus reasons there are specific idiosyncratic to our business and to our company. Now, I mentioned before that, despite that, you can see that we are growing our margins. So, we are addressing it, and that's true, essentially cost management programs meaning, we do more work in lower cost areas, et cetera. Now, I get into the first part of your question, which is pricing, are we able to offset those costs increases with pricing generally, in the commercial sector for shorter cycle businesses? Theoretically, yes, and we are when we can, but it's always a negotiation with clients. And it's a competitive market out there, you got a lot of smaller competitors who are fighting for the slice of the pie. And often, we got to defend against that. And so, our pricing flexibility is limited, it does exist in theory on the commercial side. In R&D, as in for clinical trials, yes, of course, rates have to reflect what the labor cost is. And again, that's also subject to negotiation. But we do transfer at least a portion of those wage raises to our clients in the form of rates that are applied to determine pricing for a clinical trial. But I remind you that the clinical trial business is a long-term, long cycle business, meaning that what we booked today, which may reflect some level of price increase, won't be realized into revenues until the next, the one to four or five years. So, what we are delivering in revenue today, and tomorrow was sold several years ago at different, under different labor cost assumptions. So, there is a delay, if you will, in the clinical trial business, because of the long cycle nature of the business. There are contracts where we have escalation clauses for inflation, but they never envisioned the type of inflation that we are facing in some of the markets. So, that's the picture on pricing. Thank you very much, Elizabeth. Thank you. Yes, well look the U.K. corporate tax rate increase, added about a percentage point to our overall effective tax rate. So, you start with that, but most of the impact year-over-year is coming from interest expense. So, we were, I think slightly over $400 million in interest expense in 2022. We told you about $615 million in 2023. So, you can do the math on that, then with 190 -- roughly 190 million shares and figure out what the impact is, it's principally coming out of that and that's why we excluded those two items and showed you that absent those are EPS growth rate underlying operational was still very strong double-digit. Yes, all of that is baked into our assumptions."

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. Thank you. I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Nick Childs, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasurer. Mr. Childs, you may begin your conference.\nNick Childs: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our third quarter 2022 earnings call. With me today are Ari Bousbib, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Ron Bruehlman, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Eric Sherbet, Executive Vice President and General Counsel; Mike Fedock, Senior Vice President, Financial Planning and Analysis; and Gustavo Perrone, Senior Director, Investor Relations who has succeeded Brian [ph]. Today we will be referencing a presentation that will be visible during this call for those of you on our webcast. This presentation will also be available following this call in the Events and Presentations section of our IQVIA Investor Relations website at ir.iqvia.com. Before we begin, I would like to caution listeners that certain information discussed by management during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those stated or implied by forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties associated with the company\u2019s business, which are discussed in the company\u2019s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings. In addition, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures on this call, which should be considered a supplement to and not a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the comparable GAAP measures is included in the press release and conference call presentation. I would now like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Ari Bousbib.\nAri Bousbib: Thank you Nick, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today to discuss our third quarter results. IQVIA delivered another quarter of strong financial results despite market concerns about slowing demand, broader macroeconomic challenges and the various global geopolitical issues. In fact, indicators of demand both from customers and in the market generally remain healthy. Industry clinical trials starts continue to trend ahead of last year, rising almost 7% year-to-date. The pipeline of active early stage and late stage molecules are both up 8% from 2019 pre-pandemic levels. EBP funding, which has been a lingering concern since the beginning of the year when one of our smaller competitors raised alarms. EBP funding improved in fact, in the quarter, according to Bio World, third quarter funding was $18.7 billion, the highest of any quarter this year. Year to date, funding is running at about a $60 billion annual rate, which exceeds the average of the last five years pre-COVID. Our own RFP flow grew mid-teens in Q3 and RFP flow in both the large pharma and EBP segments are up double digits on a year-to-date basis. Our Q3 book-to-bill was 1.39 excluding pass throughs and 1.27 including pass throughs, continuing our strong results from the first half of the year. And as a result, as you saw, our backlog grew 5.4% versus prior year on a reported basis and 9.4% excluding the impact from foreign exchange. As you can tell, we are not experiencing any signs of slowdown in demand. It also helps that we are extremely diversified. Remember, we serve over 10,000 customers in more than a 100 countries, including all top 25 large pharma clients across the spectrum of therapeutic areas. Now, while demand remains very healthy, as you know, and as we have been saying throughout the year, we have been dealing with operational challenges caused by the global macro environment including wage inflation, high levels of attrition, obviously the ongoing Russia-Ukraine disruptions, reoccurring China lockdowns that are still going on and perhaps that's a newer development, some staff shortages at certain investigator sites. As you know, we have been able to overcome all these issues as reflected in our results for the first nine months of the year. Although as we end the year, we are anticipating some minor delays in the timing of deliveries caused by this macro-disruptions and specifically by the bottlenecks that are created by staff shortages at certain sites and that are delaying the execution of our deliveries. This is why we decided to tweak the guidance a little in the final stretch to the end of the year. A notes on our capital location strategy, as a result of persistent high levels of inflation. Interest rates have been increasing sharply. In response, we're adjusting our capital allocation strategy to include some debt pay down, in addition to M&A and share repurchase opportunistically as in the past. In summary, the underlying demand in the industry and in our businesses remained strong and we are managing through the headwinds caused by the factors I just discussed. Now, let's review the third quarter in more detail. Revenue for the third quarter grew 5% on a reported basis and 10.5% at constant currency. The $22 million beat above the meat point of our guidance range was driven by operational upside in both TAS and R&DS services, offset by continued foreign exchange headwinds. Compared to last year and excluding COVID-related work from both periods, our base businesses grew 14% at constant currency on an organic basis. Notably on the same basis the R&DS business was up 18% and TAS was up 12%. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA increased 11.8%, reflecting our strong revenue growth and ongoing cost management discipline, offsetting the headwinds of wage inflation that are persisting in our business. Third quarter adjusted diluted EPS of $2.48 grew 14.3% driven by our adjusted EBITDA growth. Let me provide some color on the business, starting with the commercial and technology side. The exponential increase in industry data access and complexity has created tremendous new opportunities for inside and evidence generation. When making this data usable requires robust information management capabilities and as you know, at IQVIA, we've been building these capabilities for decades. In the call, the top 10 pharma clients selected IQVIA's human data science cloud to power large scale data and analytics programs by centralizing and harmonizing data for 35 large countries across their primary care and specialty medicine portfolio. We continue to advance digital marketing in healthcare. We're deploying a privacy-first open ecosystem that delivers healthcare information in a timely and personalized manner to meet the fast changing needs of the healthcare consumer. In the quarter, IQVIA acquired Lasso Marketing, which developed an operating system that's purpose built for healthcare marketers to coordinate and execute omnichannel digital campaigns from a single platform. In addition, DMD Marketing Solutions, which you will recall, we acquired about a year ago, was recently selected by a top 10 pharma client to bring to market 3 oncology and biological brands using digital insights to deliver personalized brand content to HCPs that are relevant to their practices and interest. Demand for our commercial technology solutions remained strong. This quarter, the top 20 pharma clients selected IQVIA's commercial technology ecosystem suite to transform its commercial operations into an AI-enabled commercial model. The customer will deploy IQVIA's orchestrated customer engagement suite, IQVIA's master data management and orchestrated analytics in more than 30 countries, driving a 20% efficiency gain in customer coverage and boosting the speed and precision of their older management process. In the real-world business, IQVIA continues to lead in innovative study design that combine multiple IQVIA capabilities. For example, in the quarter, we were awarded a multiyear portfolio of real-world studies in psychiatry from a midsized pharma company. We are combining faster data-driven recruitment time lines with a comprehensive home health infrastructure to reduce the burden on both the patients and the site. In another example, we were awarded a significant contract with a major med tech company to identify early markers for organ transplant rejection to a non-interventional study that combines our med tech, real-world and translational sciences capabilities. Moving to RDS. Our decentralized clinical trial, DCT program, has received independent compliance validation from EU General Data Protection Regulation, GDPR, from Trust Arc, which is the leader in GDPR validation. This is a big deal. This program is highly recognized in the industry as it requires 2 separate independent audits. It's a key achievement for IQVIA as it is the first time any DCT offering has received this European data privacy validation. In addition, we've now expanded our DCT capabilities by launching the first self-collection safety lab panel for U.S. clinical trial participants in collaboration with Tasso Inc., a leader in clinical grade blood collection solutions. Participants in clinical trials can now provide a blood specimen for lab testing in the comfort of their own home without the need to visit an investigator site or have a health care professional visit them, expanding our DCT offerings and capabilities. And of course, as you've seen, the overall R&DS business continues its strong momentum with services bookings in the quarter exceeding $2 billion for the first time ever. This translated into a quarterly book-to-bill ratio of 1.39 excluding pass-throughs. And including pass-throughs, the business delivered over $2.5 billion of total net new business in the quarter with a book-to-bill ratio of 1.27. Over the last 12 months, our contracted book-to-bill ratio was 1.35, excluding pass-throughs, and 1.29, including pass-throughs. I will now turn it over to Ron for more details on our financial performance.\nRon Bruehlman: Okay. Thanks, Ari, and good morning, everyone. Let's start by reviewing revenue. Third quarter revenue of $3.562 billion grew 5% on a reported basis and 10.5% at constant currency. In the quarter, COVID-related revenues were approximately $220 million, down about $160 million versus the third quarter of 2021. In our base business, that is excluding all COVID-related work from both this year and last, organic growth at constant currency was 14%. Technology & Analytics Solutions revenue for the third quarter was $1.4 billion, up 4.7% reported and 11.6% at constant currency. Excluding all COVID-related work, organic growth at constant currency in TAS was 12%. R&D Solutions third quarter revenue of $1.979 billion was up 6.8% reported and 10.7% at constant currency. Excluding all COVID-related work, organic growth at constant currency in R&DS was 18%, as Ari mentioned. Finally, Contract Sales & Medical Solutions or CSMS third quarter revenue of $183 million declined 9% reported but grew 1% at constant currency. And excluding all COVID-related work, organic growth at constant currency in CSMS was 3%. Year-to-date revenue was $1.671 billion grew 4.2% on a reported basis and 8.1% at constant currency. COVID-related revenues were about $850 million year-to-date. In our base business, that is excluding all COVID-related work, organic growth at constant currency was 14%. Technology & Analytics Solutions revenue year-to-date was $4.247 billion, up 5.2% reported and 10.3% at constant currency. Excluding all COVID-related work, organic growth at constant currency in Tech & Analytics Solutions was 11%. R&D Solutions year-to-date revenue of $5.863 billion was up 4.5% at actual FX rates and 7.1% at constant currency. But excluding all COVID-related work, organic growth at constant currency in R&DS was 19% year-to-date. Finally, Contract Sales & Medical Solutions or CSMS year-to-date revenue of $561 million declined 4.6% reported and grew 2.9% at constant currency. Excluding all COVID-related work, organic growth at constant currency in CSMS was 5%. Now let's move down the P&L. Adjusted EBITDA was $814 million for the third quarter, representing growth of 11.8% while year-to-date adjusted EBITDA was $2,426 million up 10.6% year-over-year. Third quarter GAAP net income was $283 million and GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.49. Year-to-date GAAP net income was $864 million or $4.52 of earnings per diluted share. Adjusted net income was $470 million for the third quarter and adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 14.3% to $2.48 and year-to-date adjusted net income was $1,413 million or $7.39 per share. Now it's already reviewed, R&D solutions delivered another outstanding quarter of bookings. Our backlog at September 30 stood at a record $25.8 billion, an increase of 5.4% year-over-year on a reported basis and 9.4% adjusting for the impact of foreign exchange. In fact, I might point out that without the impact of foreign exchange, year-over-year backlog would be $900 million higher. Next 12 month revenue from backlog increased to $7.1 billion, growing 2.8% year-over-year on a reported basis and 6.7% adjusting for the impact of foreign exchange. Okay, now reviewing the balance sheet, as of September 30, cash and cash equivalence totalled $1,274 million and gross debt was $12,394 million resulting in net debt of $11,120 million. Our net leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 3.42 times trailing 12 month adjusted EBITDA. Third quarter cash flow from operations was $863 million and CapEx was $165 million resulting in a strong free cash flow result of $698 million for the quarter. You saw in the quarter that we repurchased 150 million of our shares, which puts our year-to-date share repurchase. It's slightly above $1.1 billion and this leaves us with just under $1.4 billion of share repurchase authorization remaining under the current program. Now, as was already discussed earlier, we're adjusting our cash deployment strategy in the light of higher interest rates. Earlier this month, we retired $510 million of variable rate US dollar term loans scheduled to mature early in 2024, and this was in October, so you don't see it in our end of September balance sheet. We will likely retire additional term debt during 2023 while we continue to pursue acquisitions and repurchase shares, as has been our practice since the merger. Now let's turn now to guidance. For the full year 2022, we continue to expect revenue excluding COVID-related work to grow organically at constant currency in the low-to-mid teens. On a reported basis the strengthening of the US dollar has caused over $500 million of full year headwind since our initial guidance last November, and this $500 million includes a further impact since our second quarter earnings release. In addition, as already mentioned, global macro environment challenges such as wage inflation, investigator staff shortages, slower than expected recovery of patient visits, continued lockdowns in China and the still unresolved Russia-Ukraine conflict are persisting and so far, we've been able to offset all these challenges and absorb them in our numbers, but we're forecasting a modest residual impact in pockets of our business during the balance of the year, and we reflected this in the updated values. So for the full year, we now expect revenue to be between $14,325 million and $14,425 million. At the midpoint of our guidance, this represents an adjustment of about a $100 million dollars with roughly two-thirds of this driven by foreign exchange impact and the rest by the global macro environment headwinds I just detailed. Our updated guidance represents year-over-year growth 7.4% to 8.2% at constant currency and 3.2% to 4% on a reported basis. And as a reminder, this equates the low-to-mid teens organic growth at constant currency excluding COVID related work. Our projected revenue growth includes approximately 200 basis points of contribution from M&A. We're also updating our guidance on adjusted EBITDA to reflect the revenue and cost end wins mention. We're now expecting the guidance range to be between -- we are now setting the guidance range to be between $3,330 million and $3,360 million, which represents year-over-year growth of 10.2% to 11.2%. And lastly, we're raising the midpoint of our adjusted EBITDA EPS guidance by $0.05 to reflect updated estimates of costs below the adjusted EBITDA line. We now expect adjusted diluted EPS to be between $10.10 and $10.20, which represents year-over-year growth of 11.8% to 13%. Moving to our fourth quarter guidance, we expect revenue to be between $3,654 million and $3,754 million or growth of 5.5% to 8.2% on a constant currency basis, and 0.5% to 3.2% on a reported basis. Excluding all COVID-related work, we expect organic revenue growth at constant currency to be over 10% at the midpoint of our fourth quarter guidance. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $904 million and $934 million. That's up 9.2% to 12.8% and finally, adjusted diluted EPS is expected to be between $2.72 and $2.82 growing 6.7% to 10.6%. Now, all of our guidance assumes that foreign currency rates as of October 24 continue for the balance of the year. So to summarize before we go to Q&A, the underlying demand in the industry and our business remained very healthy. We delivered strong operational P&L and free cash flow performance in the quarter. Revenue grew mid-teens organically at constant currency excluding COVID related work. Our RDS business continues its strong momentum with services bookings in the quarter exceeding $2 billion for the first time ever. Contracted backlog sits at a new record of $25.8 billion up over 9%, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. We repurchase nearly $150 million of our shares while reducing our net leverage ratio to approximately 3.4 times trailing 12 month adjust EBITDA and finally, we retired at the beginning of the fourth quarter, $510 million of our variable term debt. With that, let me hand it over to the operator to start the Q&A session.\nOperator: [Operator instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Dave Windley with Jefferies.\nDave Windley: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to focus on kind of speed of throughput in RDS. I call it speed of studies and thinking about major buckets that could fall both on the accelerator side and the decelerator side. So you talked about your DCT capabilities, more remote activity that could spur along throughput or recruitment of patients, finding patients that are willing to participate in studies. Maybe, clients that post-COVID are kind of pushing hard to catch up for things that were pushed behind during COVID. And then on the other side, these things that you've highlighted around staff shortages at sites things like that, maybe therapeutic mix in your backlog might be lengthening. That's something that's a trend in the industry. So just seems like, relevant to how quickly you can convert your backlog into revenue or these factors and I wondered, Ari, if you could kind of help us understand the tug of war there and which one's winning?\nAri Bousbib: Well good morning, David. Thank you for the question and there are many elements of response built in your question itself. You clearly know the industry and what's happening very well. Look as a context as you all know in the field, patient visits have not fully recovered to pre-pandemic levels. So that's point number one. I think it was presented at an industry conference recently. I think it was on October 7 Society for Clinical Research Sites Summit, this issue of staff shortages that are affecting investor side operations was flagged as a development industry-wide. So that, if you will, is on the negative now. You're correct to point to DCT has obviously -- the less we require the patient to actually visit the site, the better it is as a counter to this issue. Now we don't see this issue as a sort of permanent or ongoing thing. It happens to be that what we have been dealing with, and we've been talking about from the beginning of the year, which is very high levels of attrition, people have a hard time going back to work. We have a harder time recruiting the skill sets that we require plus the impact on cost of labor that all of that has, all of these factors in combination are a significant -- or the single most important operational challenge we have seen. And as we've mentioned many times, we've been dealing with that and offsetting the impact of these issues with our productivity initiatives and cost-reduction programs. Now we're not the only ones to experience these staff shortages. The sites also have staff shortages as a result of the same factors. And when they have to prioritize dealing with the incoming flow of patients versus dealing with clinical trials. And so that's a development. You mentioned also the complexity of studies as new factors. And I think this is also correct. There is -- the mix, not just in our backlog, I think it's industry-wide that happens to be the evolution of the market, the mix of studies makes it -- makes the factors I just mentioned, even more acute. As you know, recruitment of patients is much more -- is correlated. The difficulty to recruit patient is correlated with the complexity of the study. Now this is an area where we can shine because we've got our data analytics and our technology, and we've proven many times that we are able to address complex studies and recruit patients better than we would have had otherwise. So which side is going to win, it's hard to tell. But look, so far, I mean, through the year, we've been able to address all of those. I mean you've seen our numbers every quarter we have been able to beat our own expectations, and that's because we've been able to address it. We have a very diversified, large-scale company, and we are able to adjust. We're not dependent on one single study. Had we been 1/10 of the size, we would be highly sensitive to a big study win or a big study loss. We're not. We just tweaked a little bit the fourth quarter numbers here just because we want to make sure we anticipate everything and be transparent and put this out to investors. Thank you for your question, Dave.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of John Sourbeer with UBS.\nJohn Sourbeer: I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit more on the inflation and hiring trends. And you also mentioned some attrition in the prepared remarks. Just how do you see this playing out into next year? I know you're not guiding on 2023, but do you see some easing on the trends there? And then on the other side, I guess, how is pricing looking? And are you able to offset any of these pricing -- these inflationary pressures on pricing?\nAri Bousbib: Thank you, John, and a very good question. That is exactly the operational equation that we are dealing with. And again, there's no news here. We've been talking about this throughout the year. We've been saying this is a single most significant operational challenge we're dealing with is talent, talent, talent. And the cost of the talent, recruiting, training, retaining and compensating the talent that we need to execute our studies. The levels of attrition reached record highs. I mean, you're talking about almost 20% sometime in the first part of the year. We have seen those levels of attrition come down and stabilized. Now they're still very high. It's now more in the 16%, 17% type of range and is stabilized there. And we hope that they are going to continue to come down. Obviously, we put in place a very large number of measures to retain people. And those include, not only but they include the compensation -- upward compensation adjustments, which again, places more burden and more -- and create inflation that we have to deal with. This is, as I just mentioned before, the sales issue industry-wide and including at our partner sites where we execute the studies, which is creating the bottlenecks that we talked about for us to execute. So as far as our operations, we don't know how long this attrition issues and employee turnover and headwinds will last. We are dealing with them. I can tell you that many of the cost-cutting and productivity initiative programs that we were planning to launch in '23, we have decided to accelerate and we're starting many of them in this fourth quarter of 2022 in anticipation of potential continuation of some of these employee turnover and wage inflation issues. So we are going to address that as far as our operations. Now you asked the balancing question, which is how are we able to reflect that on pricing. As you know, on the CRO side of the house, it's a long-cycle business. So the contracted backlog that was contracted a year or 2 years, 3 years, 4 years ago, that's still in our backlog sometimes, that is at a certain cost assumptions, which were different than the ones we are facing. There are, in most contracts, cost escalation provisions and clauses that enable us to adjust the rates. But I don't think anyone anticipated 8%, 9% inflation. So we're not fully able to immediately -- there is a delay, if you will, there is a lag between when we are suffering the cost headwind and when we can reflect that into our pricing. Now it's a little less like that in the shorter cycle businesses on the commercial side. But there also we have long-term contracts. We have at least 1 year, 2-year contracts. We've got technology licenses at certain rates. We've got data contracts at certain rates. So it is more likely that we are able to reflect price increases in analytics, in consulting, in services, which are 3, 6 months, 1 year visibility-type contracts and those were able to -- but again, it's not the bulk of the business. So it will happen, and we've got plans to do so, but there is a lag. Thank you, John, for your question.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Sandy Draper with Guggenheim.\nSandy Draper: Thanks very much. I guess, Ari, it'd be helpful to hear some commentary on the TAS side and thinking about the 3 broad buckets you look at TAS. In terms of the demand drivers there, are there -- what do you feel like is improving, staying the same, potentially weakening? Just thinking about some of the commentary or concerns out there around okay, what's happening with the sales force? Is that going to be accelerating in terms of cuts? Has that stabilized, thinking about overall marketing budgets how people are looking at using data and marketing. Just would love some commentary about how you see what's going on in terms of pros and cons and puts and takes on the TAS side as we head into next year?\nAri Bousbib: Yes. Well, Sandy, and thank you for the question. Look, we are very pleased with the continued strong growth that we are seeing in TAS. You heard us, both Ron and myself, report organic constant currency revenue growth, excluding COVID from both years of 12%. That's really, really strong. And you know that the -- if we think about the business in three buckets and the high-growth bucket includes real world and commercial tech and they continue to be strong drivers of growth. We continue to find innovative ways to utilize real-world evidence for clients, as I described in my introductory remarks, and we care to deploy more of our technology solutions. You talked about digital marketing. So it's true that sales forces, sales reps as a demographic in general, are going down. And so any parts of any business that are reliant on physical interactions between sales reps and physicians, those businesses clearly have a downward long-term trends. So people who are dependent on CRM, for example, are going to experience headwinds. Now as I have mentioned many times before, we have been long ago at the forefront of the transition to digital marketing. Interactions with HCPs are now rapidly evolving towards digital interactions. And I mentioned in my introductory remarks, some examples, we made investments in this area. We bought DMD Marketing last year. We bought Lasso this past quarter. These are unique, this is kind of an operating system that enables pharma clients to buy and decide where to place promotional content. This is where the industry is going. We've made investments. We bought technology and companies that we feel are unique and will enable us to claim our fair share of that market. And we are here to support our clients in this transition. So you're absolutely correct. Overall, the traditional mode of going to market is going away. It's a slow trend downwards, but it is downward, but it is more than offset by growth in digital marketing, and that's what we've been investing in, and that's what's growing in our business. Thank you, Sandy.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel.\nShlomo Rosenbaum: This one is actually for Ron. Given the rise in interest rates and your focus on retiring more debt, can you give us a little bit of color as to how we should be thinking of the blended interest rate that we should assume on debt? And are you targeting kind of a leverage ratio instead of the mid-3s, low-3s, like how should we be thinking about this just more of an ongoing basis?\nRon Bruehlman: Yes. Thanks for the question, Shlomo. And it's very topical given the interest rate environment these days. And we haven't provided comprehensive P&L guidance for 2023 at this point. But it's an important enough issue. I want to give you a little bit of color around that in addition to what our strategies are to deal with it. Let's start with the strategies. You saw that we paid down debt in the fourth quarter with a term loan that was coming to $510 million in -- early in 2024 and comparatively expensive, and we'll be looking to pay down some additional term loan debt that near term in maturity as we go through next year. So you'll see us talking about that. As far as our leverage ratio, we have -- that's been gradually trending downward. It was at 3.4 as we exited Q3. I would expect that as we go through next year, we'll hit that or get close to any way that 3 target that we set for the end of 2025. I think we're going to get down to that level sooner rather than later and possibly by the end of next year. Now as far as interest expense goes, look, we're not in the business of forecasting rates. So it's precisely forecasting interest expense depends on what you think is going to happen with rates, but we can give you some help. If we just look at where the market consensus for rates is and kind of project outward from that, we think that in Q4, interest expense will be about $130 million, give or take. And you see that's a fairly substantial step-up from where it has been. And actually, the run rate exiting the year at the very end of the quarter, will be about $140 million per quarter. And if you extend that out, you don't have to be a math major to say it's $560 million is kind of an annual rate exiting the year. And if there are further increases, modest increases in rates as we go into the first quarter, which was what the market is projecting, we'll see then -- then that number could go higher. We also have a swap rolling off at the end of Q3. So you could see interest expense next year getting higher than $560 million, maybe approaching $600 million. We'll see. But you have to keep in mind that this depends on a lot of things. It depends on central rate actions, our cash flow, how we choose to use our cash flow next year and so forth. But this should get you in the ballpark anyway for your models. I know some people have been struggling with that. So I wanted to be a little bit more explicit than we had been in the past when we said count on like $16 million for each 0.25 point of interest in drive, right?\nAri Bousbib: Yes. So I mean, that's the item that we've been working on. And as Ron mentioned, we decided that it was time to retire some of the debt that matures in '24. So we took out 5 10 in just a few weeks ago, a couple of weeks ago. And we're probably going to retire what is maturing in '24. We will retire that in '23. And so we will begin addressing the issue of interest expense. Of course, it's a 1-year issue right? From a comparison standpoint, we likely will have a step-up in interest expense in aggregate for us in '23 versus '22. But from then on, hopefully, rates are going to either stabilize or decrease. If you look at the forecast by the individual governance of the Fed, and you've got these charts with every dots representing each governor's anticipation of rates and they are really all over the map. For 2024, ranging from 2.5% to 5%. So hopefully, at some point, the rates will go down and then it becomes a tailwind, so to speak. But certainly, going to '23, it will be a headwind that we have to address, and we're planning to address and take other actions on other fronts to mitigate that impact.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Justin Bowers with Deutsche Bank.\nJustin Bowers: Just wanted to follow up on the comments around labor. And with -- we're seeing obviously some turnover in -- or some changes in the Bay Area and then some of your clients as well. So I wanted to get a sense of if the labor pressures that you're seeing are isolated in any specific pockets or geographies? And if some of the turnover we're seeing and those other areas provide you an opportunity to either hire talent, notably in TAS or just combat some of the inflation? And then the follow-up to that would be with some of the labor issues at the sites, is there a way to provide us some goal pulse on what the backlog conversion would be over the next 12 months in light of what you're seeing at the site level?\nAri Bousbib: Yes. Thank you very much for your question. Look, given the strength of the industry backdrop, there's obviously competition for TAS. That's number one. That's in addition to the overall context of post-COVID resignations and the inflation that drives an additional component of wage inflation. Now we are actively recruiting and hiring, I mean, thousands of people, the numbers are staggering, the number of people we bring on board in order to meet the incremental demand. And of course, we've had this attrition issue that I mentioned earlier. We have approximately 83,000 employees. We recruit, as I said, thousands and thousands of employees a year. So we do have the capabilities we are focused on it. Now where? Which pockets? Obviously, it's CRAs, its operational people, it's project leadership. It's really front-line execution field skilled professionals. And that's where the issues are. Now because of that, we're seeing margin pressure from the labor cost increases. And -- but you've seen we've expanded our margins. So really, that's because of our productivity initiatives. We do intend to continue this trend. We are not just sitting here and watching the headwinds, we are countering them, and you know that we've done that throughout the year. Now we are -- we made a minus modest adjustment to reflect some labor cost increase that we're not able to offset entirely in the fourth quarter, again, very minor just because there is a lag. You recruit highly skilled and expensive people. It takes a little bit of time before they are actually deployed in the field and productive. And sometimes, you just don't have the time to catch up with the cost reduction programs to offset those increases in costs. Now with respect to the staff shortage at other sites, we don't manage those sites, and it's hard to do the same thing there. I do not, at this point in time, see that these trends are widespread or that they are going to continue in such a way that all of a sudden, the long-term conversion of our backlog is compromised. We do not see that because those staff shortages have been located in pockets. We are operating in a lot of sites and not all of them are experienced globally. And it's mostly some sites -- mostly the sites that have been affected are in the U.S. where we see most of the pressure. Frankly, some of the reasons we've had to make the little -- very modest residual adjustments we made to our fourth quarter numbers is a lot of it is due to the lab business not being able -- not receiving the flow of samples from the sites on the time line that they had been -- that they had expected them. And the reason for that is because there were less patient visits at the site. They were less patient visits at the sites because there was less staff to handle the patients. And so that's what created the bottleneck. And we know it's a specific site. So it's too early for me to say this is a widespread permanent change in the industry. Yes, the studies are more complex and that results into slower conversion by definition, but that was occurring even before COVID and it's not going to be a major step down and [indiscernible]. So, so far, we cannot say that this is going to continue. We think that we'll be able to deal with it in the early part of 2023.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Patrick Donnelly with Citi.\nPatrick Donnelly: Great. Ron, maybe one for you in a similar vein there. You talked about the interest expense, obviously, jumping up with the variable next year. I guess when you think about the different inputs, Ari, you touched on labor costs there as well. When you think about the ability to offset some of that down the P&L, can you just talk about, I guess, the margin structure for next year? Again, you have some of the inflationary pressures. You talked a little bit about pricing throughout the call. But I guess, how do you think about the P&L defensiveness, ability to insulate away from some of that interest expense jumping up on you guys as you get into next year?\nRon Bruehlman: Look, the interest expense is going to be pretty much what it is, and it's going to be based upon rate increases and so forth. And we'll do what we talked about in terms of debt reduction. And really what you're looking for is what can we do up above the EBITDA line and above to offset some of the items below, like interest spend, below the line that we have less control over in the short term. And we see our demand environment, as we laid out today, is fundamentally being very healthy. Yes, we highlighted a few executional challenges due to macro factors, but we don't see them as being permanent. And we see the outlook for next year without getting into guidance for 2023. Obviously, at this point, it's being fundamentally strong on an operating basis. Nothing has changed there. We're going to try to continue to drive cost reduction to offset not just what Ari said about the continued labor pressures, which hopefully will abate, but we can't count on that. But also to help offset some of what we see below the line in interest expense. And we'll be coming out with guidance in the February time frame and lay it all out for you then.\nAri Bousbib: Yes. And again, that's absolutely -- you're absolutely correct, Patrick. We are exactly working on this. I mentioned earlier that we have plans. You will recall when we gave our 20 by '25 targets, which, by the way, are unchanged. Nothing here is, in the slightest, making us deviate from the goals we've set for 2025 for our company, at least with the exception perhaps of the leverage ratio we were targeting 2025 at a leverage ratio of 3. And as Ron mentioned, it's likely will be at 3 well before that. But other than that, our goals are the same. The road to those goals may not always necessarily be a straight line, but the growth haven't changed. Now in support of these goals, we had over the next 3 years, a series of programs and productivity initiatives internally, and we've decided in light of both the increased below-the-line headwinds for '23 and a continued labor inflation, which we are assuming as a given, we decided to accelerate the programs we were supposed to initiate in '23, and we are initiating them in the fourth quarter of '22. So the answer to your question is absolutely yes, and that's the plan.\nOperator: Your final question comes from Elizabeth -- from Luke Sergott with Barclays.\nLuke Sergott: So Ron, a quick one for you. You guys had a big cash quarter. Can you talk about the drivers here? You brought your conversion up to 85%, which is kind of where you guys were targeting, I guess, your long-term range. So is this a good spot to think about the jump off?\nRon Bruehlman: I'm not sure what you mean by the jump off, but...\nLuke Sergott: For '23, sorry.\nRon Bruehlman: Well, look, I think in any given year, we targeted 80% to 90% of adjusted net income for cash flow. But cash flow is inherently volatile. So 1 year, it may be a lot better, 1 year it may be a little bit less. And certainly, from quarter-to-quarter, you see that to a much greater degree. And we had a not so great second quarter and a much better third quarter. And the reason is pretty simple, our collection -- timing of collections, it was just much better in the third quarter than it was in the second quarter. And nothing has fundamentally changed in terms of our cash flow. We're going to continue driving towards maximizing cash flow, trying to minimize our day sales outstanding and remain a strong cash generator. My only comment there is don't put too much weight on the quarter-to-quarter fluctuations because that's the nature of cash flow. It's not like earnings, it's not accrual-based. So it tends to be more volatile and more difficult to predict on a short-term basis.\nLuke Sergott: All right. And then lastly here, I'll leave the staffing shortage question for offline. But can you talk a little bit more about the color of the bookings? Any change in the duration or the size of the average win that you guys are seeing? Anything that would portend on an acceleration or deceleration in an overall project quality and in size?\nAri Bousbib: Absolutely nothing changed at all, okay? Overall, RFP flow is 10% up year-to-date, 15% in Q3. What we call the qualified pipeline, which means it's advanced, it's not early stage, it's not speculative, is up 19% year-over-year. Awards in Q3, the awards are -- should I mention the number? The awards in Q3 are 22% up, second highest quarter ever. Plus 10% sequential growth. I mean, I don't know what else to tell you. I'm looking at every number possible. On the demand side, we see no change. It's widespread, large pharma, EBP. We've been saying this for the -- from the beginning of the year. You guys are not believing us, but the numbers are showing, are -- and I guess everyone else is coming to the story as well.\nOperator: And there are no further questions. Mr. Childs, I will turn the call back over to you.\nNick Childs: Okay. Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. We look forward to speaking to all of you again soon. The team will be available rest of the day to take any follow-up questions you may have. Thanks, everyone.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Ron Bruehlman",
            "content": "Okay. Thanks, Ari, and good morning, everyone. Let's start by reviewing revenue. Third quarter revenue of $3.562 billion grew 5% on a reported basis and 10.5% at constant currency. In the quarter, COVID-related revenues were approximately $220 million, down about $160 million versus the third quarter of 2021. In our base business, that is excluding all COVID-related work from both this year and last, organic growth at constant currency was 14%. Technology & Analytics Solutions revenue for the third quarter was $1.4 billion, up 4.7% reported and 11.6% at constant currency. Excluding all COVID-related work, organic growth at constant currency in TAS was 12%. R&D Solutions third quarter revenue of $1.979 billion was up 6.8% reported and 10.7% at constant currency. Excluding all COVID-related work, organic growth at constant currency in R&DS was 18%, as Ari mentioned. Finally, Contract Sales & Medical Solutions or CSMS third quarter revenue of $183 million declined 9% reported but grew 1% at constant currency. And excluding all COVID-related work, organic growth at constant currency in CSMS was 3%. Year-to-date revenue was $1.671 billion grew 4.2% on a reported basis and 8.1% at constant currency. COVID-related revenues were about $850 million year-to-date. In our base business, that is excluding all COVID-related work, organic growth at constant currency was 14%. Technology & Analytics Solutions revenue year-to-date was $4.247 billion, up 5.2% reported and 10.3% at constant currency. Excluding all COVID-related work, organic growth at constant currency in Tech & Analytics Solutions was 11%. R&D Solutions year-to-date revenue of $5.863 billion was up 4.5% at actual FX rates and 7.1% at constant currency. But excluding all COVID-related work, organic growth at constant currency in R&DS was 19% year-to-date. Finally, Contract Sales & Medical Solutions or CSMS year-to-date revenue of $561 million declined 4.6% reported and grew 2.9% at constant currency. Excluding all COVID-related work, organic growth at constant currency in CSMS was 5%. Now let's move down the P&L. Adjusted EBITDA was $814 million for the third quarter, representing growth of 11.8% while year-to-date adjusted EBITDA was $2,426 million up 10.6% year-over-year. Third quarter GAAP net income was $283 million and GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.49. Year-to-date GAAP net income was $864 million or $4.52 of earnings per diluted share. Adjusted net income was $470 million for the third quarter and adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 14.3% to $2.48 and year-to-date adjusted net income was $1,413 million or $7.39 per share. Now it's already reviewed, R&D solutions delivered another outstanding quarter of bookings. Our backlog at September 30 stood at a record $25.8 billion, an increase of 5.4% year-over-year on a reported basis and 9.4% adjusting for the impact of foreign exchange. In fact, I might point out that without the impact of foreign exchange, year-over-year backlog would be $900 million higher. Next 12 month revenue from backlog increased to $7.1 billion, growing 2.8% year-over-year on a reported basis and 6.7% adjusting for the impact of foreign exchange. Okay, now reviewing the balance sheet, as of September 30, cash and cash equivalence totalled $1,274 million and gross debt was $12,394 million resulting in net debt of $11,120 million. Our net leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 3.42 times trailing 12 month adjusted EBITDA. Third quarter cash flow from operations was $863 million and CapEx was $165 million resulting in a strong free cash flow result of $698 million for the quarter. You saw in the quarter that we repurchased 150 million of our shares, which puts our year-to-date share repurchase. It's slightly above $1.1 billion and this leaves us with just under $1.4 billion of share repurchase authorization remaining under the current program. Now, as was already discussed earlier, we're adjusting our cash deployment strategy in the light of higher interest rates. Earlier this month, we retired $510 million of variable rate US dollar term loans scheduled to mature early in 2024, and this was in October, so you don't see it in our end of September balance sheet. We will likely retire additional term debt during 2023 while we continue to pursue acquisitions and repurchase shares, as has been our practice since the merger. Now let's turn now to guidance. For the full year 2022, we continue to expect revenue excluding COVID-related work to grow organically at constant currency in the low-to-mid teens. On a reported basis the strengthening of the US dollar has caused over $500 million of full year headwind since our initial guidance last November, and this $500 million includes a further impact since our second quarter earnings release. In addition, as already mentioned, global macro environment challenges such as wage inflation, investigator staff shortages, slower than expected recovery of patient visits, continued lockdowns in China and the still unresolved Russia-Ukraine conflict are persisting and so far, we've been able to offset all these challenges and absorb them in our numbers, but we're forecasting a modest residual impact in pockets of our business during the balance of the year, and we reflected this in the updated values. So for the full year, we now expect revenue to be between $14,325 million and $14,425 million. At the midpoint of our guidance, this represents an adjustment of about a $100 million dollars with roughly two-thirds of this driven by foreign exchange impact and the rest by the global macro environment headwinds I just detailed. Our updated guidance represents year-over-year growth 7.4% to 8.2% at constant currency and 3.2% to 4% on a reported basis. And as a reminder, this equates the low-to-mid teens organic growth at constant currency excluding COVID related work. Our projected revenue growth includes approximately 200 basis points of contribution from M&A. We're also updating our guidance on adjusted EBITDA to reflect the revenue and cost end wins mention. We're now expecting the guidance range to be between -- we are now setting the guidance range to be between $3,330 million and $3,360 million, which represents year-over-year growth of 10.2% to 11.2%. And lastly, we're raising the midpoint of our adjusted EBITDA EPS guidance by $0.05 to reflect updated estimates of costs below the adjusted EBITDA line. We now expect adjusted diluted EPS to be between $10.10 and $10.20, which represents year-over-year growth of 11.8% to 13%. Moving to our fourth quarter guidance, we expect revenue to be between $3,654 million and $3,754 million or growth of 5.5% to 8.2% on a constant currency basis, and 0.5% to 3.2% on a reported basis. Excluding all COVID-related work, we expect organic revenue growth at constant currency to be over 10% at the midpoint of our fourth quarter guidance. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $904 million and $934 million. That's up 9.2% to 12.8% and finally, adjusted diluted EPS is expected to be between $2.72 and $2.82 growing 6.7% to 10.6%. Now, all of our guidance assumes that foreign currency rates as of October 24 continue for the balance of the year. So to summarize before we go to Q&A, the underlying demand in the industry and our business remained very healthy. We delivered strong operational P&L and free cash flow performance in the quarter. Revenue grew mid-teens organically at constant currency excluding COVID related work. Our RDS business continues its strong momentum with services bookings in the quarter exceeding $2 billion for the first time ever. Contracted backlog sits at a new record of $25.8 billion up over 9%, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. We repurchase nearly $150 million of our shares while reducing our net leverage ratio to approximately 3.4 times trailing 12 month adjust EBITDA and finally, we retired at the beginning of the fourth quarter, $510 million of our variable term debt. With that, let me hand it over to the operator to start the Q&A session. Yes. Thanks for the question, Shlomo. And it's very topical given the interest rate environment these days. And we haven't provided comprehensive P&L guidance for 2023 at this point. But it's an important enough issue. I want to give you a little bit of color around that in addition to what our strategies are to deal with it. Let's start with the strategies. You saw that we paid down debt in the fourth quarter with a term loan that was coming to $510 million in -- early in 2024 and comparatively expensive, and we'll be looking to pay down some additional term loan debt that near term in maturity as we go through next year. So you'll see us talking about that. As far as our leverage ratio, we have -- that's been gradually trending downward. It was at 3.4 as we exited Q3. I would expect that as we go through next year, we'll hit that or get close to any way that 3 target that we set for the end of 2025. I think we're going to get down to that level sooner rather than later and possibly by the end of next year. Now as far as interest expense goes, look, we're not in the business of forecasting rates. So it's precisely forecasting interest expense depends on what you think is going to happen with rates, but we can give you some help. If we just look at where the market consensus for rates is and kind of project outward from that, we think that in Q4, interest expense will be about $130 million, give or take. And you see that's a fairly substantial step-up from where it has been. And actually, the run rate exiting the year at the very end of the quarter, will be about $140 million per quarter. And if you extend that out, you don't have to be a math major to say it's $560 million is kind of an annual rate exiting the year. And if there are further increases, modest increases in rates as we go into the first quarter, which was what the market is projecting, we'll see then -- then that number could go higher. We also have a swap rolling off at the end of Q3. So you could see interest expense next year getting higher than $560 million, maybe approaching $600 million. We'll see. But you have to keep in mind that this depends on a lot of things. It depends on central rate actions, our cash flow, how we choose to use our cash flow next year and so forth. But this should get you in the ballpark anyway for your models. I know some people have been struggling with that. So I wanted to be a little bit more explicit than we had been in the past when we said count on like $16 million for each 0.25 point of interest in drive, right? Look, the interest expense is going to be pretty much what it is, and it's going to be based upon rate increases and so forth. And we'll do what we talked about in terms of debt reduction. And really what you're looking for is what can we do up above the EBITDA line and above to offset some of the items below, like interest spend, below the line that we have less control over in the short term. And we see our demand environment, as we laid out today, is fundamentally being very healthy. Yes, we highlighted a few executional challenges due to macro factors, but we don't see them as being permanent. And we see the outlook for next year without getting into guidance for 2023. Obviously, at this point, it's being fundamentally strong on an operating basis. Nothing has changed there. We're going to try to continue to drive cost reduction to offset not just what Ari said about the continued labor pressures, which hopefully will abate, but we can't count on that. But also to help offset some of what we see below the line in interest expense. And we'll be coming out with guidance in the February time frame and lay it all out for you then. I'm not sure what you mean by the jump off, but... Well, look, I think in any given year, we targeted 80% to 90% of adjusted net income for cash flow. But cash flow is inherently volatile. So 1 year, it may be a lot better, 1 year it may be a little bit less. And certainly, from quarter-to-quarter, you see that to a much greater degree. And we had a not so great second quarter and a much better third quarter. And the reason is pretty simple, our collection -- timing of collections, it was just much better in the third quarter than it was in the second quarter. And nothing has fundamentally changed in terms of our cash flow. We're going to continue driving towards maximizing cash flow, trying to minimize our day sales outstanding and remain a strong cash generator. My only comment there is don't put too much weight on the quarter-to-quarter fluctuations because that's the nature of cash flow. It's not like earnings, it's not accrual-based. So it tends to be more volatile and more difficult to predict on a short-term basis."

            "content": "Thank you Nick, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today to discuss our third quarter results. IQVIA delivered another quarter of strong financial results despite market concerns about slowing demand, broader macroeconomic challenges and the various global geopolitical issues. In fact, indicators of demand both from customers and in the market generally remain healthy. Industry clinical trials starts continue to trend ahead of last year, rising almost 7% year-to-date. The pipeline of active early stage and late stage molecules are both up 8% from 2019 pre-pandemic levels. EBP funding, which has been a lingering concern since the beginning of the year when one of our smaller competitors raised alarms. EBP funding improved in fact, in the quarter, according to Bio World, third quarter funding was $18.7 billion, the highest of any quarter this year. Year to date, funding is running at about a $60 billion annual rate, which exceeds the average of the last five years pre-COVID. Our own RFP flow grew mid-teens in Q3 and RFP flow in both the large pharma and EBP segments are up double digits on a year-to-date basis. Our Q3 book-to-bill was 1.39 excluding pass throughs and 1.27 including pass throughs, continuing our strong results from the first half of the year. And as a result, as you saw, our backlog grew 5.4% versus prior year on a reported basis and 9.4% excluding the impact from foreign exchange. As you can tell, we are not experiencing any signs of slowdown in demand. It also helps that we are extremely diversified. Remember, we serve over 10,000 customers in more than a 100 countries, including all top 25 large pharma clients across the spectrum of therapeutic areas. Now, while demand remains very healthy, as you know, and as we have been saying throughout the year, we have been dealing with operational challenges caused by the global macro environment including wage inflation, high levels of attrition, obviously the ongoing Russia-Ukraine disruptions, reoccurring China lockdowns that are still going on and perhaps that's a newer development, some staff shortages at certain investigator sites. As you know, we have been able to overcome all these issues as reflected in our results for the first nine months of the year. Although as we end the year, we are anticipating some minor delays in the timing of deliveries caused by this macro-disruptions and specifically by the bottlenecks that are created by staff shortages at certain sites and that are delaying the execution of our deliveries. This is why we decided to tweak the guidance a little in the final stretch to the end of the year. A notes on our capital location strategy, as a result of persistent high levels of inflation. Interest rates have been increasing sharply. In response, we're adjusting our capital allocation strategy to include some debt pay down, in addition to M&A and share repurchase opportunistically as in the past. In summary, the underlying demand in the industry and in our businesses remained strong and we are managing through the headwinds caused by the factors I just discussed. Now, let's review the third quarter in more detail. Revenue for the third quarter grew 5% on a reported basis and 10.5% at constant currency. The $22 million beat above the meat point of our guidance range was driven by operational upside in both TAS and R&DS services, offset by continued foreign exchange headwinds. Compared to last year and excluding COVID-related work from both periods, our base businesses grew 14% at constant currency on an organic basis. Notably on the same basis the R&DS business was up 18% and TAS was up 12%. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA increased 11.8%, reflecting our strong revenue growth and ongoing cost management discipline, offsetting the headwinds of wage inflation that are persisting in our business. Third quarter adjusted diluted EPS of $2.48 grew 14.3% driven by our adjusted EBITDA growth. Let me provide some color on the business, starting with the commercial and technology side. The exponential increase in industry data access and complexity has created tremendous new opportunities for inside and evidence generation. When making this data usable requires robust information management capabilities and as you know, at IQVIA, we've been building these capabilities for decades. In the call, the top 10 pharma clients selected IQVIA's human data science cloud to power large scale data and analytics programs by centralizing and harmonizing data for 35 large countries across their primary care and specialty medicine portfolio. We continue to advance digital marketing in healthcare. We're deploying a privacy-first open ecosystem that delivers healthcare information in a timely and personalized manner to meet the fast changing needs of the healthcare consumer. In the quarter, IQVIA acquired Lasso Marketing, which developed an operating system that's purpose built for healthcare marketers to coordinate and execute omnichannel digital campaigns from a single platform. In addition, DMD Marketing Solutions, which you will recall, we acquired about a year ago, was recently selected by a top 10 pharma client to bring to market 3 oncology and biological brands using digital insights to deliver personalized brand content to HCPs that are relevant to their practices and interest. Demand for our commercial technology solutions remained strong. This quarter, the top 20 pharma clients selected IQVIA's commercial technology ecosystem suite to transform its commercial operations into an AI-enabled commercial model. The customer will deploy IQVIA's orchestrated customer engagement suite, IQVIA's master data management and orchestrated analytics in more than 30 countries, driving a 20% efficiency gain in customer coverage and boosting the speed and precision of their older management process. In the real-world business, IQVIA continues to lead in innovative study design that combine multiple IQVIA capabilities. For example, in the quarter, we were awarded a multiyear portfolio of real-world studies in psychiatry from a midsized pharma company. We are combining faster data-driven recruitment time lines with a comprehensive home health infrastructure to reduce the burden on both the patients and the site. In another example, we were awarded a significant contract with a major med tech company to identify early markers for organ transplant rejection to a non-interventional study that combines our med tech, real-world and translational sciences capabilities. Moving to RDS. Our decentralized clinical trial, DCT program, has received independent compliance validation from EU General Data Protection Regulation, GDPR, from Trust Arc, which is the leader in GDPR validation. This is a big deal. This program is highly recognized in the industry as it requires 2 separate independent audits. It's a key achievement for IQVIA as it is the first time any DCT offering has received this European data privacy validation. In addition, we've now expanded our DCT capabilities by launching the first self-collection safety lab panel for U.S. clinical trial participants in collaboration with Tasso Inc., a leader in clinical grade blood collection solutions. Participants in clinical trials can now provide a blood specimen for lab testing in the comfort of their own home without the need to visit an investigator site or have a health care professional visit them, expanding our DCT offerings and capabilities. And of course, as you've seen, the overall R&DS business continues its strong momentum with services bookings in the quarter exceeding $2 billion for the first time ever. This translated into a quarterly book-to-bill ratio of 1.39 excluding pass-throughs. And including pass-throughs, the business delivered over $2.5 billion of total net new business in the quarter with a book-to-bill ratio of 1.27. Over the last 12 months, our contracted book-to-bill ratio was 1.35, excluding pass-throughs, and 1.29, including pass-throughs. I will now turn it over to Ron for more details on our financial performance. Well good morning, David. Thank you for the question and there are many elements of response built in your question itself. You clearly know the industry and what's happening very well. Look as a context as you all know in the field, patient visits have not fully recovered to pre-pandemic levels. So that's point number one. I think it was presented at an industry conference recently. I think it was on October 7 Society for Clinical Research Sites Summit, this issue of staff shortages that are affecting investor side operations was flagged as a development industry-wide. So that, if you will, is on the negative now. You're correct to point to DCT has obviously -- the less we require the patient to actually visit the site, the better it is as a counter to this issue. Now we don't see this issue as a sort of permanent or ongoing thing. It happens to be that what we have been dealing with, and we've been talking about from the beginning of the year, which is very high levels of attrition, people have a hard time going back to work. We have a harder time recruiting the skill sets that we require plus the impact on cost of labor that all of that has, all of these factors in combination are a significant -- or the single most important operational challenge we have seen. And as we've mentioned many times, we've been dealing with that and offsetting the impact of these issues with our productivity initiatives and cost-reduction programs. Now we're not the only ones to experience these staff shortages. The sites also have staff shortages as a result of the same factors. And when they have to prioritize dealing with the incoming flow of patients versus dealing with clinical trials. And so that's a development. You mentioned also the complexity of studies as new factors. And I think this is also correct. There is -- the mix, not just in our backlog, I think it's industry-wide that happens to be the evolution of the market, the mix of studies makes it -- makes the factors I just mentioned, even more acute. As you know, recruitment of patients is much more -- is correlated. The difficulty to recruit patient is correlated with the complexity of the study. Now this is an area where we can shine because we've got our data analytics and our technology, and we've proven many times that we are able to address complex studies and recruit patients better than we would have had otherwise. So which side is going to win, it's hard to tell. But look, so far, I mean, through the year, we've been able to address all of those. I mean you've seen our numbers every quarter we have been able to beat our own expectations, and that's because we've been able to address it. We have a very diversified, large-scale company, and we are able to adjust. We're not dependent on one single study. Had we been 1/10 of the size, we would be highly sensitive to a big study win or a big study loss. We're not. We just tweaked a little bit the fourth quarter numbers here just because we want to make sure we anticipate everything and be transparent and put this out to investors. Thank you for your question, Dave. Thank you, John, and a very good question. That is exactly the operational equation that we are dealing with. And again, there's no news here. We've been talking about this throughout the year. We've been saying this is a single most significant operational challenge we're dealing with is talent, talent, talent. And the cost of the talent, recruiting, training, retaining and compensating the talent that we need to execute our studies. The levels of attrition reached record highs. I mean, you're talking about almost 20% sometime in the first part of the year. We have seen those levels of attrition come down and stabilized. Now they're still very high. It's now more in the 16%, 17% type of range and is stabilized there. And we hope that they are going to continue to come down. Obviously, we put in place a very large number of measures to retain people. And those include, not only but they include the compensation -- upward compensation adjustments, which again, places more burden and more -- and create inflation that we have to deal with. This is, as I just mentioned before, the sales issue industry-wide and including at our partner sites where we execute the studies, which is creating the bottlenecks that we talked about for us to execute. So as far as our operations, we don't know how long this attrition issues and employee turnover and headwinds will last. We are dealing with them. I can tell you that many of the cost-cutting and productivity initiative programs that we were planning to launch in '23, we have decided to accelerate and we're starting many of them in this fourth quarter of 2022 in anticipation of potential continuation of some of these employee turnover and wage inflation issues. So we are going to address that as far as our operations. Now you asked the balancing question, which is how are we able to reflect that on pricing. As you know, on the CRO side of the house, it's a long-cycle business. So the contracted backlog that was contracted a year or 2 years, 3 years, 4 years ago, that's still in our backlog sometimes, that is at a certain cost assumptions, which were different than the ones we are facing. There are, in most contracts, cost escalation provisions and clauses that enable us to adjust the rates. But I don't think anyone anticipated 8%, 9% inflation. So we're not fully able to immediately -- there is a delay, if you will, there is a lag between when we are suffering the cost headwind and when we can reflect that into our pricing. Now it's a little less like that in the shorter cycle businesses on the commercial side. But there also we have long-term contracts. We have at least 1 year, 2-year contracts. We've got technology licenses at certain rates. We've got data contracts at certain rates. So it is more likely that we are able to reflect price increases in analytics, in consulting, in services, which are 3, 6 months, 1 year visibility-type contracts and those were able to -- but again, it's not the bulk of the business. So it will happen, and we've got plans to do so, but there is a lag. Thank you, John, for your question. Yes. Well, Sandy, and thank you for the question. Look, we are very pleased with the continued strong growth that we are seeing in TAS. You heard us, both Ron and myself, report organic constant currency revenue growth, excluding COVID from both years of 12%. That's really, really strong. And you know that the -- if we think about the business in three buckets and the high-growth bucket includes real world and commercial tech and they continue to be strong drivers of growth. We continue to find innovative ways to utilize real-world evidence for clients, as I described in my introductory remarks, and we care to deploy more of our technology solutions. You talked about digital marketing. So it's true that sales forces, sales reps as a demographic in general, are going down. And so any parts of any business that are reliant on physical interactions between sales reps and physicians, those businesses clearly have a downward long-term trends. So people who are dependent on CRM, for example, are going to experience headwinds. Now as I have mentioned many times before, we have been long ago at the forefront of the transition to digital marketing. Interactions with HCPs are now rapidly evolving towards digital interactions. And I mentioned in my introductory remarks, some examples, we made investments in this area. We bought DMD Marketing last year. We bought Lasso this past quarter. These are unique, this is kind of an operating system that enables pharma clients to buy and decide where to place promotional content. This is where the industry is going. We've made investments. We bought technology and companies that we feel are unique and will enable us to claim our fair share of that market. And we are here to support our clients in this transition. So you're absolutely correct. Overall, the traditional mode of going to market is going away. It's a slow trend downwards, but it is downward, but it is more than offset by growth in digital marketing, and that's what we've been investing in, and that's what's growing in our business. Thank you, Sandy. Yes. So I mean, that's the item that we've been working on. And as Ron mentioned, we decided that it was time to retire some of the debt that matures in '24. So we took out 5 10 in just a few weeks ago, a couple of weeks ago. And we're probably going to retire what is maturing in '24. We will retire that in '23. And so we will begin addressing the issue of interest expense. Of course, it's a 1-year issue right? From a comparison standpoint, we likely will have a step-up in interest expense in aggregate for us in '23 versus '22. But from then on, hopefully, rates are going to either stabilize or decrease. If you look at the forecast by the individual governance of the Fed, and you've got these charts with every dots representing each governor's anticipation of rates and they are really all over the map. For 2024, ranging from 2.5% to 5%. So hopefully, at some point, the rates will go down and then it becomes a tailwind, so to speak. But certainly, going to '23, it will be a headwind that we have to address, and we're planning to address and take other actions on other fronts to mitigate that impact. Yes. Thank you very much for your question. Look, given the strength of the industry backdrop, there's obviously competition for TAS. That's number one. That's in addition to the overall context of post-COVID resignations and the inflation that drives an additional component of wage inflation. Now we are actively recruiting and hiring, I mean, thousands of people, the numbers are staggering, the number of people we bring on board in order to meet the incremental demand. And of course, we've had this attrition issue that I mentioned earlier. We have approximately 83,000 employees. We recruit, as I said, thousands and thousands of employees a year. So we do have the capabilities we are focused on it. Now where? Which pockets? Obviously, it's CRAs, its operational people, it's project leadership. It's really front-line execution field skilled professionals. And that's where the issues are. Now because of that, we're seeing margin pressure from the labor cost increases. And -- but you've seen we've expanded our margins. So really, that's because of our productivity initiatives. We do intend to continue this trend. We are not just sitting here and watching the headwinds, we are countering them, and you know that we've done that throughout the year. Now we are -- we made a minus modest adjustment to reflect some labor cost increase that we're not able to offset entirely in the fourth quarter, again, very minor just because there is a lag. You recruit highly skilled and expensive people. It takes a little bit of time before they are actually deployed in the field and productive. And sometimes, you just don't have the time to catch up with the cost reduction programs to offset those increases in costs. Now with respect to the staff shortage at other sites, we don't manage those sites, and it's hard to do the same thing there. I do not, at this point in time, see that these trends are widespread or that they are going to continue in such a way that all of a sudden, the long-term conversion of our backlog is compromised. We do not see that because those staff shortages have been located in pockets. We are operating in a lot of sites and not all of them are experienced globally. And it's mostly some sites -- mostly the sites that have been affected are in the U.S. where we see most of the pressure. Frankly, some of the reasons we've had to make the little -- very modest residual adjustments we made to our fourth quarter numbers is a lot of it is due to the lab business not being able -- not receiving the flow of samples from the sites on the time line that they had been -- that they had expected them. And the reason for that is because there were less patient visits at the site. They were less patient visits at the sites because there was less staff to handle the patients. And so that's what created the bottleneck. And we know it's a specific site. So it's too early for me to say this is a widespread permanent change in the industry. Yes, the studies are more complex and that results into slower conversion by definition, but that was occurring even before COVID and it's not going to be a major step down and [indiscernible]. So, so far, we cannot say that this is going to continue. We think that we'll be able to deal with it in the early part of 2023. Yes. And again, that's absolutely -- you're absolutely correct, Patrick. We are exactly working on this. I mentioned earlier that we have plans. You will recall when we gave our 20 by '25 targets, which, by the way, are unchanged. Nothing here is, in the slightest, making us deviate from the goals we've set for 2025 for our company, at least with the exception perhaps of the leverage ratio we were targeting 2025 at a leverage ratio of 3. And as Ron mentioned, it's likely will be at 3 well before that. But other than that, our goals are the same. The road to those goals may not always necessarily be a straight line, but the growth haven't changed. Now in support of these goals, we had over the next 3 years, a series of programs and productivity initiatives internally, and we've decided in light of both the increased below-the-line headwinds for '23 and a continued labor inflation, which we are assuming as a given, we decided to accelerate the programs we were supposed to initiate in '23, and we are initiating them in the fourth quarter of '22. So the answer to your question is absolutely yes, and that's the plan. Absolutely nothing changed at all, okay? Overall, RFP flow is 10% up year-to-date, 15% in Q3. What we call the qualified pipeline, which means it's advanced, it's not early stage, it's not speculative, is up 19% year-over-year. Awards in Q3, the awards are -- should I mention the number? The awards in Q3 are 22% up, second highest quarter ever. Plus 10% sequential growth. I mean, I don't know what else to tell you. I'm looking at every number possible. On the demand side, we see no change. It's widespread, large pharma, EBP. We've been saying this for the -- from the beginning of the year. You guys are not believing us, but the numbers are showing, are -- and I guess everyone else is coming to the story as well."

Actual results could differ materially from those stated or implied by forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties associated with the company\u2019s business, which are discussed in the company\u2019s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings.  In addition, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures on this call which should be considered a supplement to and not a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the comparable GAAP measures is included in the press release and conference call presentation. I would now like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Ari Bousbib. \nAri Bousbib: Thank you Nick, and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us today to discuss our second quarter results. IQVIA delivered strong financial results this quarter despite the dynamics of the broader macro environment and the various global geopolitical issues. Let me address a few of the key ones. Some of you have continued to ask about the impact of biotech funding on the CRO industry. As we have said on several occasions, the recent decline in biotech funding has not had any significant impact on our business. Our exposure to pre-commercial EBPs remains at just over 10% of our backlog. We have not seen an impact on bookings or RFPs, nor any increase in cancellations or delays in clinical trial work from the slowdown in biotech funding. Actually, RFP dollars from the overall EBP client segment continued to grow double digits in the quarter. In China, the government-imposed COVID lockdowns had a modest impact on our second quarter results, mostly from disruptions to our clinical and laboratory operations. Our commercial business was virtually unaffected. Our experience in managing through prior lockdowns during the pandemic has been helpful in minimizing the operational impacts on site closures. Our guidance assumes that modest impacts on COVID-related lockdowns in China will continue through the end of the third quarter. In Ukraine, we continued to work with sites and sponsors to ensure the safety of our employees and patients while working to mitigate trial disruptions caused by the ongoing crisis. In Russia, we continue to conduct trials currently underway to ensure the safety of patients already enrolled in clinical trials, but we are moving recruitment on new trials to other countries. The financial impacts of the Russia-Ukraine crisis are tracking in line with the expectations we communicated back in April.  More generally, we are of course monitoring, as are you, the possibility of a recession. I would just note that over the past 20 years, IQVIA along with the broader CRO industry has shown resilience to economic downturns. During recessionary times over the past two decades, annual S&P 500 revenue contracted by as much as 10% while IQVIA\u2019s clinical business and the CRO industry as a whole never experienced a year of revenue decline. The resilience of the CRO industry likely reflects the long cycle nature of our business, as well as of course the mission critical importance of clinical research and more generally the defensive nature of healthcare. With that as background, let\u2019s review the second quarter. Revenue for the second quarter grew 3% on a reported basis and 7.1% at constant currency. The fully $6 million beat above the midpoint of our guidance range was primarily driven by the timing of pass-through revenues versus our expectations, as well as some operational upside. Compared to last year and excluding COVID-related work from both periods, our base businesses grew 16% at constant currency on an organic basis. Ron will provide additional details in his remarks, including COVID-adjusted numbers for each of our segments. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA increased 10.8%, reflecting our strong revenue growth and ongoing cost management discipline. Second quarter adjusted diluted EPS of $2.44 grew 14.6% driven entirely by our adjusted EBITDA growth.  Let me provide some more updates and color on the business in the quarter. The continued strong performance at IQVIA is driven by our highly differentiated capabilities. As you know, the key differentiator for us in the clinical and commercial spaces is IQVIA\u2019s connected intelligence. Let me give you a few examples of how IQVIA\u2019s applications here help our clients solve their most complex problems. IQVIA\u2019s AI-driven next best action platform helps our clients integrate multiple data sources, transforming raw data into personalized recommendations to sales, marketing and medical personnel which of course leads to deeper relationships with healthcare providers. In the quarter, a top 10 pharma client chose IQVIA\u2019s solution to completely transform their omnichannel commercial engagement model and to improve their go-to-market efficiency across multiple brands in eight countries by up to 30%. Another example in the quarter, we were selected by a top 20 pharma client to optimize the delivery of raw brand content directly to healthcare providers for one of their respiratory brands. Our solution here connects digital and field sales channels to deliver highly personalized content that results in high quality, seamless brand experience for healthcare providers. This will improve this client\u2019s digital engagement metrics by 3.5 times. Another area where demand has been growing is pharma co-vigilance. Our platform here combines a unique catalog of over 500,000 safety-specific terms and patterns with natural language processing to mine vast amounts of online data and to identify potential adverse events. In the quarter, another top 10 pharma client selected our solution to reduce the risk of non-compliance and to increase data accuracy, ultimately improving their efficiency by up to 75%. Beyond mass pharma, our commercial solutions are also resonating with EBP clients, especially when they decide to commercialize their assets on their own following approval. For example, in the quarter we contracted with a leading EBP client to implement and manage their entire end-to-end commercial information management and to support their patient engagement and access programs. This includes data provisioning, massive data management, and data modeling. Our ability to offer these services on a fully integrated platform will allow for a more streamlined implementation, generating savings of up to 20% versus multi-vendor solutions. As you know, IQVIA continues to be the global leader in real world evidence. In the quarter, a top 10 pharma awarded IQVIA a major project in medical affairs. The project leverages our AI and ML capabilities to provide near real-time disease insights across five different therapeutic areas. These insights will help identify misdiagnosis and [indiscernible] treatments which will in turn improve patient outcomes.  As you know, our ECOA, or Electronic Clinical Outcomes Assessment platform has won multiple awards for its breakthrough patient engagement innovations. The product includes a library of over 1,500 prebuilt clinical outcome assessments which enables sponsors to deploy assessments to patients up to 14 weeks sooner than competitors\u2019 offerings. This efficiency reduces risks to study start-up timelines and allows our clients to capture more feedback from patients, ultimately amplifying the patient\u2019s voice real time.  A top five sponsor recently engaged IQVIA to couple this ECOA platform with our patient randomization tool so that we eliminate redundant workflows, improve data accuracy and patient compliance, thereby reducing site on-boarding activities by an estimated 50%.  Finally, in the overall R&D as business, we continued our strong momentum, delivering over $2.6 billion of total net new business in the quarter, including pass-throughs. The services bookings also remained at the historic high we have seen recently of over $1.9 billion. This resulted in a second quarter contracted net book-to-bill ratio of 1.34 including pass-throughs, and 1.32 excluding pass-throughs. Over the last 12 months, our contracted net book-to-bill ratio was 1.32, both including and excluding pass-throughs. As you can see, there continues to be strong positive momentum across the business and an unprecedented level of engagement with our clients across our portfolio of commercial and clinical businesses despite the broader environment.  I will now turn it over to Ron for more details on our financial performance.\nRon Bruehlman: Thanks Ari, and good morning everyone. Let\u2019s start by reviewing revenue. Second quarter revenue of $3.541 billion grew 3% on a reported basis and 7.1% at constant currency. In the quarter, COVID-related revenues were approximately $250 million, which was down about $300 million versus the second quarter of 2021. In our base business, that is excluding all COVID-related work from both this year and last, organic growth at constant currency was 16%.  Technology and analytic solutions revenue for the second quarter was $1.408 billion, up 4.1% reported and 9.4% at constant currency. Excluding all COVID-related work, organic growth at constant currency in TAS was 10%. Research and development solutions second quarter revenue of $1.950 billion was up 3.1% reported and 6% at constant currency, and excluding all COVID-related work, organic growth at constant currency in R&DS was 22%.  Contract sales and medical solutions, or CSMS second quarter revenue of $183 million declined 5.7% reported, but grew 2.1% at constant currency. Excluding all COVID-related work, organic growth at constant currency in CSMS was 7%.  First half revenue of $7.109 billion grew 3.8% on a reported basis and 6.9% at constant currency. In our base business, that is excluding all COVID-related work, organic growth at constant currency for the first half was 14%. Technology and analytics solutions revenue for the first half was $2.847 billion, up 5.4% reported and 9.6% at constant currency. Excluding all COVID-related work, organic growth at constant currency in TAS was 10% for the first half. R&D solutions first half revenue of $3.884 billion was up 3.3% at actual FX rates and 5.3% at constant currency. Excluding all COVID-related work, organic growth at constant currency in R&DS was 19%. Finally, contract sales and medical solutions, or CSMS first half revenue of $378 million declined 2.3% reported and grew 3.9% constant currency. Excluding all COVID-related work, organic growth in constant currency at CSMS was 6%. Now let\u2019s move down the P&L. Adjusted EBITDA in the quarter was $800 million, representing growth of 10.8%, while first half adjusted EBITDA was $1.612 billion, up 10% year-over-year. Second quarter GAAP net income was $256 million and GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.34. For the first half, we had GAAP net income of $581 million or $3.02 of earnings per diluted share. Adjusted net income was $466 million for the second quarter and adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 14.6% to $2.44. For the first half, adjusted net income was $943 million or $4.91 per share.  As already highlighted, R&D solutions delivered yet another strong quarter of new business. This graph that we\u2019re showing here shows the growth of our backlog over the past few years at actual currency rates and it demonstrates the sustained strength of our clinical business through the COVID pandemic.  You\u2019ll recall that as our bookings reached record levels during the pandemic, many of you expressed concern about a looming so-called COVID cliff, and we told you then that our COVID-related bookings would be replaced by new programs that spanned a breadth of our therapeutic expertise, and in fact that\u2019s what happened. As of June 30, our contracted backlog stands at a record $25.6 billion, including pass-throughs. That\u2019s a 50% increase over about three years. The COVID contribution to our backlog, which peaked at 11% early in 2021, is now approximately 6%. Let\u2019s turn to the balance sheet. As of June 30, cash and cash equivalents totaled $1.428 billion and gross debt was $12.767 billion, resulting in net debt of $11.339 billion. Our net leverage ratio as of June 30 was 3.58 times trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA. Second quarter cash flow from operations was $329 million and capex was $161 million, resulting in free cash flow of $168 million for the quarter. This was somewhat lower than prior quarters, and it mainly reflected the timing of cash collections, which we expect to normalize in the second half. You saw in the quarter that were quite active in the market, repurchasing $590 million of our shares, and this puts our year-to-date share repurchase activity at just shy of $1 billion. This leaves us with slightly over $1.5 billion of share repurchase authorization remaining under the current program. Moving to guidance, our full year 2022 revenue expectation at constant currency remains unchanged. On a reported basis, the strengthening of the dollar since April has caused an incremental full-year revenue headwind from foreign currency translation of approximately $125 million, based on rates as of this Monday, July 18. We\u2019re updating our revenue guidance to reflect this. For the full year, we now expect revenue to be between $14.4 billion and $14.550 billion, which represents year-over-year growth of 7.4% to 8.5% at constant currency and 3.8% to 4.9% at actual FX rates. As a reminder, this equates to low to mid-teens organic growth at constant currency, excluding COVID-related work. Our projected revenue growth includes just over 150 basis points of contribution from M&A.  Since FX fluctuations have had a minimal impact on our profit, our adjusted EBITDA guidance remains unchanged. We are tightening the guidance range to be between $3.345 billion and $3.395 billion, which represents year-over-year growth of 10.7% to 12.3%. Our adjusted diluted EPS guidance also remains unchanged. We are tightening the range here to between $10 and $10.20, which translates to year-over-year growth of 10.7% to 13%.  Our full year 2022 guidance assumes that foreign currency rates as of July 18 continue for the balance of the year. Since issuing our initial guidance at our analyst and investor conference in November, FX fluctuations have caused full year revenue headwinds of over $400 million.  Moving to our third quarter guidance, we expect revenues to be between $3.515 billion and $3.565 billion, or growth of 8.4% to 9.8% on a constant currency basis, and 3.7% to 5.1% on a reported basis. Excluding COVID-related work, we expect organic revenue growth at constant currency to be in the low to mid teens in the third quarter. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $805 million and $820 million, up 10.6% to 12.6%, and adjusted diluted EPS is expected to be between $2.34 and $2.42, growing 7.8% to 11.5%.  To summarize, we delivered a very strong second quarter. Our base business delivered mid-teens organic growth at constant currency, excluding COVID-related work. Our R&DS business had another strong bookings quarter with over $2.6 billion of net new business. Contracted backlog at the end of the quarter hit a new record of $25.6 billion, up over 7% year-over-year. We repurchased nearly $600 million of our shares while maintaining our net leverage ratio of approximately 3.6 times trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA, and finally, we adjusted our revenue guidance to reflect changes in foreign exchange but held our earnings guidance unchanged. With that, let me turn it back over to our Operator for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from Sandy Draper from Guggenheim. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nSandy Draper: Thanks very much, and congratulations on a solid quarter in a tough environment. I guess I\u2019m actually going to let other people ask about R&D solutions - I\u2019m sure there will be a lot of questions there, but my question, Ari and Ron, is on the TAS side. We\u2019re not out of COVID but certainly getting further past it and trying to act in a more normal way. Have either buying patterns or what people are focused on changed at all, so was there a certain focus during COVID of these are short-term tech solutions we need because trials are being shut down, or whatever - you know, we can\u2019t get sales people into doctor\u2019s offices. As we\u2019re coming out, is the general trend persisting or are you seeing any shift and refocus on new areas on the tech side? Thanks.\nAri Bousbib: Yes, thank you Sandy, and good morning to you. I\u2019d start answering your question by simply saying there is absolutely none of those concerns. We haven\u2019t seen any of that. We\u2019re very pleased with the continued growth of our TAS business, really across the board, and you know that we like to think of our business in three buckets: the high growth ones, which is real world and technology, and that represents - Mike, I\u2019m going to say about 40%--\nMike Fedock: More like 45.\nAri Bousbib: --45% of the total, and that\u2019s experiencing continued growth, hasn\u2019t abated during COVID at all, and continues to sell through at the same pace. Then we have the labor-based consulting, primary market research, analytics business which grows mid to high single digits and has been very strong through COVID, and continues to be strong essentially at the same pace, and that\u2019s about--\nMike Fedock: Twenty-five percent or so.\nAri Bousbib: --25% approximately, so the last balance, the 30% is basically our historic IMS data business, and that\u2019s kind of flattish to up 1% or 2%, quarter-in, quarter-out, and also has been essentially flat in terms of its growth through the COVID crisis. As Ron mentioned, constant--organic constant currency revenue growth for TAS excluding COVID was 10% in the quarter and also 10% for the first half, so again really we\u2019re not seeing anything at all that\u2019s changed versus the pandemic peak, or before the pandemic peak. Continued strong momentum. Thank you Sandy.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Eric Coldwell from Baird. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nEric Coldwell: Thank you, good morning. Wanted to hit on capital structure. With the obvious comments about looking at the potential for a recession, rising interest rates, etc., a number of companies have changed their capital allocation and capital structure strategies. I\u2019m curious if you could talk about what you\u2019re doing on those fronts, maybe discuss any terms, maturities or issues with the various fixation instruments you have on your variable rate debt, because I do believe the majority of your debt is effectively fixed at this point, and then what is embedded in your interest rate assumptions for the year and how much has \u201922 guidance in total been impacted from your first guidance to current guidance in relation to the interest rate increases that we\u2019ve seen so far. I know that\u2019s a lot, but--\nAri Bousbib: No, I wouldn\u2019t expect less from you, Eric. You ask one question and you manage to pack 10 questions in one!\nEric Coldwell: [Indiscernible] comments, right?\nAri Bousbib: It\u2019s a topical question, obviously, and you can imagine we are looking at the global environment, the rates. You saw the ECB bump of 50 basis points this morning, and we do have some euro debt, as you know. Obviously there is a point at which those changes cross certain thresholds and it does have an impact on our capital structure, and we are modeling all of those and making different scenarios as to how we change or not our capital allocation strategy. For now, it remains what it was. I\u2019m going to ask Ron to give you more detail and address the specifics of your question. Ron?\nRon Bruehlman: Yes Eric, to your specific question, I think you had asked about our--in essence about whether our debt and how much of our debt is fixed rate versus variable rate, so how much is affected going forward. I know this is of interest to the group in any event. About 45% of our debt is fixed rate, just shy of 60% is fixed with swaps. We did have a euro floor that fixed even more of our debt up until recently, but we\u2019re about at the floor now with the recent ECB decision, so--\nAri Bousbib: Up to today, it was, like--\nRon Bruehlman: Seventy-five percent--\nAri Bousbib: Seventy-five percent fixed.\nRon Bruehlman: Yes, but going forward it will be more like just shy of 60% fixed. You had asked about what our guidance assumes, and we\u2019ve pretty much followed what the market consensus is there in the U.S. about assuming a couple of 75 basis point increases in the U.S. in July and September, and 25 basis point increases in the fourth quarter two times. For the euro, we have a series of increases, smaller increases assumed out through the balance of the year, totaling just slightly over 100 basis points baked into our numbers. That\u2019s pretty much in line with the market consensus right now. Now, you asked also about how much has interest expense--the increase in rates affected our interest expense assumptions since November, I guess, when we put our initial guidance out. I\u2019ll have to go back and look at that. It\u2019s obviously had an impact, not so much in the first half of the year but more in the second half of the year, obviously, as the rate increases or the pace of rate increases has been back-end loaded in the year. We\u2019ll have to come back with an answer to that, unless Nick has it handy.\nNick Childs: Yes, right now we\u2019re thinking it\u2019s somewhere between $50 million to $75 million that we\u2019re seeing on interest, but you\u2019ve seen that we\u2019ve been able to hold the EPS number, so we\u2019ve had some favorability in terms of our assumptions on share count and all of that below the line, that has kind of helped us manage that a little bit better.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Elizabeth Anderson from Evercore. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nElizabeth Anderson: Hi guys, thanks so much for the question. Maybe I\u2019ll take Eric\u2019s and have a combined combo. One, if you could talk about the assumptions regarding China specifically embedded in your 3Q guidance, and then looking at the guidance that you gave for 3Q, it implies a nice EBITDA step-up in the fourth quarter. You guys obviously did a nice job managing the SG&A line in particular this quarter, so I just wanted to understand there if there was something specific to call out that was driving that step-up in EBITDA there, or what\u2019s the explanation there. Thanks.\nAri Bousbib: Yes, thanks Elizabeth. These are two very distinct questions, so let me start with the second one, the fourth quarter. Look - fourth quarter, there is some level of seasonality in our business, historically it has always been the case both on the commercial side and on the clinical side, and the fourth quarter traditionally is always the strongest one.  You are specifically alluding to EBITDA, and I would point that if you go back and look in general, our margins in the fourth quarter are higher than, let\u2019s say, sequentially in the third quarter, for example, and in general it\u2019s about a point higher - you know, maybe a little less than that, maybe a little more than that, depending on the year. That is because on the commercial side, it\u2019s the end of the year, a lot of the budgets tend to be spent and a lot of purchases get done last minute, and obviously both our clients want to do that before they close the year and our sales force pushes, as always, to make the quarter and so on, so forth for more sales at the end of the quarter and at the end of the year, so there\u2019s that kind of momentum on the commercial side, whether it\u2019s data or analytics or just across the board on our commercial portfolio. That\u2019s always the case year in, year out, and this year it\u2019s a little bit stronger than might have indicated in prior years, but it\u2019s not inconsistent.  On the clinical side, it\u2019s all driven by the execution of the backlog and when and how it converts, so that\u2019s really--you know, we do a roll-up project by project of when we anticipate the work will be done and costs incurred and revenue recognized, and we do that bottom-up and that\u2019s where it comes out. Again, in general fourth quarter tends to be stronger in the clinical side as well historically, and that is probably because people want to try to execute the work before the end of the year, so that\u2019s not unusual. Agree that\u2019s sequentially a bit more than prior years, but again nothing inconsistent. Ron, you want to say something?\nRon Bruehlman: Yes, just to answer your question on China and the impact there, modest impact in Q2. We\u2019re assuming a continued modest impact in Q3, mainly around our lab business and clinical trials as not all the sites are open in areas where there\u2019s shutdowns or restrictions. The only caution I would say there is just that none of us knows exactly what\u2019s going to happen in China, where future lockdowns might happen and so forth, but right now we\u2019re not expected a big impact.\nAri Bousbib: Yes, just a remark on China, bear in mind it\u2019s less than 3% of our total revenue. We have a strong presence there relative to our competitors and we are doing very well. On the clinical side is where the impact is. Remember, on the commercial side we have exactly zero impact from the lockdowns - that was the case during the pandemic at the peak of it, and it continues to be the case today.  On the clinical side, obviously the issue is accessing sites, and when it\u2019s closed, it\u2019s closed. But we have learned during the pandemic how to work with that and to do remote visits, etc., and so far at least, the impact from China lockdowns, which have been extensive, as you know, in Shanghai and Tianjin and some other areas, we have been able to manage through that and whatever financial impact was essentially absorbed in our numbers. Thank you Elizabeth.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Derik de Bruin from Bank of America. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nDerik de Bruin: Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my question. I\u2019ve gotten a bunch of questions from investors along the lines of I think people appreciate that the RD&S business was very resilient during the past recessions, but you\u2019re absolutely right - having done the Quintiles IPO, I remember the growth rates back then. I think the question I\u2019ve gotten some on the TAS business, and just sort of, like, how that goes, particularly on the consulting side of the business, and any sort of potential impact from recession there. Thank you.\nAri Bousbib: Yes, thank you for the question. Look - the resilience that\u2019s obvious on the clinical side, it\u2019s born by the long-term history, as I mentioned in my introductory remarks. On the commercial side, you are correct - I mean, I guess you pointed to consulting because consulting is usually the most discretionary type of spend at our clients. So far, not one--I would say not one noise, not one--nothing. We are looking--I am asking every day, what is going on in the business in every aspect, and I can tell you there is no indication whatsoever that somehow people are curtailing their budgets on the commercial side.  Bear in mind, the last big recession we had along with the housing crisis in the end of 2008, \u201909, \u201910, the commercial business was affected really by different factors. There were very large pharma consolidations, and on the commercial side when you have a large pharma merger, you go from two clients to one client, so that automatically affects your revenues. Not so much on the clinical side - generally if you are in--if the two pharma companies that merge are in the same therapy, the authorities won\u2019t let you merge and generally when pharma merge, they have complementary therapies and the clinical trials continue. So yes, those laws, that pharma consolidation wave that took place at that time, a lot of it driven by tax considerations, affected our commercial business. We\u2019re not seeing any of that so far. Secondly, there was a unique phenomenon then, which was that there was an unusual large number of patent expiries, and those LOEs were sort of accelerating the 2008 to 2012 time frame. There was a so-called patent cliff, and that was coupled with an unusually low number of new product approvals. The pharma commercial business is obviously driven by the net of new approvals versus patent--or loss of exclusivity, and usually that\u2019s a net positive. At that time, there was unusual circumstances where we had a trough in new approvals and a peak in loss of exclusivity, and that was a reverse trend.  But today, we don\u2019t see that. We know the pipeline, we know the molecules in the pipe that are supposed to be approved and the expiries and so on, and we see none of that anytime soon, so we\u2019re not concerned and we feel that the commercial business is fairly well insulated as well.  Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from David Windley from Jefferies. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nDavid Windley: Hi, thanks. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question.  Ari, you\u2019ve touched on China and Ukraine very effectively. The R&DS business seems to be navigating through that really, really well. Some of the things that we\u2019ve heard are that in addition to those acute issues in certain parts of the world, that we have kind of general staff burnout like we have in the broader healthcare system, that sites are overwhelmed and site-level turnover and things like that are affecting the capacity of the site network that you might be using. I wonder if--you know, again, you guys seem to be navigating that really well, and so I wondered if you could talk to how you are supporting the sites to be able to continue to get your trials processed in an environment where the global capacity for sites is somewhat affected.\nAri Bousbib: Yes, so I assume you mean globally, not just Russia and Ukraine. Look - Russia, Ukraine, the first part of your question, we addressed that, as you said, quite effectively. That doesn\u2019t mean that it was easy or that it didn\u2019t consume an enormous amount of management attention and work. Thankfully we were able to reallocate resources and clinical work to other sites. Now, this itself does not add incrementally to the existing burden of the existing sites. Your second point is more--I think is truly valid. It is true we have a lot of work to execute, as mentioned many times. This is our single most important operational challenge, that is execution, and that requires people. People recruiting, retention and development is our single most important operational challenge in the current environment. I think I\u2019ve mentioned before, and I see the trend continuing, the high attrition levels we\u2019ve seen are somewhat plateauing and diminishing. That may have something to do with perhaps a more recessionary environment and people less likely to jump ship. It also may have to do with the fact that we really have a strong book of business and we are, hopefully, I want to believe, a more exciting work environment and more exciting company to be part of. We\u2019re doing our part to try to retain our people. The sites themselves, we are not seeing--I\u2019m sure if you asked specifically the individual, they\u2019d say yes, I\u2019m burnt out. Are we asking people to work more and to be more productive and so on? Yes, but again that\u2019s just the nature of the type of work that we do. We\u2019re not seeing any execution difficulties as a result of people being, quote-unquote, burnt out. We\u2019re not. When people are burned out, they either quite or they ask to be allocated to something else, and that\u2019s what we try to do.  We\u2019ve always tried to prioritize the wellbeing of our employees, and during the pandemic that has accelerated. I may not have mentioned this before, but even for myself on downwards, we\u2019ve had a dramatic change in tone and how we address issues with employees\u2019 work flexibility. We do live in a different environment where the considerations for employees, valued employees and skilled employees to remain at the company involve more than just work and compensation, and so we are doing our part to address that.  We will be 90,000-plus people by the end of the year, and we continue to hire. In this year, we have hired by the end of the year more than 25,000 people just to replace attrition and to support the growth. We are really a hiring machine. We\u2019ve dramatically, dramatically improved the level of sophistication of our human resource management functions around the world, and the type of analytics and artificial intelligence tools we use to track our employees\u2019 workload are really very unprecedented, so it is an issue and we are managing it. You wanted to add something, Mike?\nMike Fedock: Yes, I think Dave, just on the color on the sites, I think one thing we\u2019ve seen is sites engaging with our on-site support offering we have within R&DS, so they\u2019re reaching out to us to try to assist them. I\u2019m not going to comment to say if our sites are burnt out or not, but clearly they have a lot of work to do and we\u2019re providing a service to help them execute that work, which is great.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jack Meehan from Nephron Research. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nJack Meehan: Thank you, good morning. Ari, I was hoping you could share more perspective on the R&D environment, just given your RFP commentary. Looking back, we had two banner years of funding in 2020 and 2021. Things have obviously slowed down here in the public markets in 2022. As you look at the things you\u2019re bidding on now, do you have a sense for when they were funded? I guess I\u2019m just trying to get a sense for where you think we are in this funding cycle and it showing up for late stage work. \nAri Bousbib: Okay, well thank you and good morning. This is obviously a good question. Again, I mentioned before for the commercial side, I do the same on the clinical side, I am almost daily asking a number of people to monitor activity. Again, I wouldn\u2019t be saying this unless I had a certain level of confidence that so far, as of late last night, I can assure you there simply is no sign that the pipeline--you know, very early indicators is slowing down, the RFP volume is slowing down, and it is across the board in every segment. The second quarter was another quarter of record bookings. I can tell you, I think the awards--the volume was the second highest quarter ever, so we\u2019re just not seeing it. I know there are concerns, and it is true that the volume of funding has gone down, it\u2019s just not translating into a slowdown in either the strength and growth of our pipeline has never as large, record growth and volume, both dollars and numbers, or the RFP volume or the awards or the bookings. Now, you are asking a very, very pertinent question, which is the clients, whether EDP, midsize, large pharma who are requesting proposals or who are in the pipeline, when did they get their funding; and you are absolutely correct - it takes maybe three years, I\u2019m going to say, before the funding raised today is actually spent. A lot of what is going to be disbursed by these companies that have booked--with whom we\u2019ve booked business each quarter is cash that was raised in prior periods, so you want to try to say, well, funding is low now and therefore two years, three years from now, maybe bookings should go down. That\u2019s just not the experience historically. Again, our business is not dependent on secondary public offerings from pre-commercial EDPs. It\u2019s just not. Secondly, a lot of things are going to happen over the next few years where--you know, that\u2019s the benefit of scale. Remember we are all over the world, we have the largest volume of business of any CRO in the world. We\u2019re not exposed to one client, two clients, 10 clients, a segment, another segment, a geography, another geography. At any given point in time, we are working on well over 2,500 trials. We are a big ship, and like every big ship, it\u2019s very hard. You\u2019re not going to see from us 50% growth in a quarter, but on the other hand the converse is also never going to happen. We are a very big ship, and these disturbances in a long cycle business do not affect the direction of our business. Any other comments you want to make?\nRon Bruehlman: No, I think you covered it good. Next question?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum from Stifel. Please go ahead, your line is open. \nAdam: Hi, this is Adam on for Shlomo. What is the difference in FX headwind for 2022 the company is facing today versus what it was expecting on the first quarter earnings call?\nRon Bruehlman: It was $125 million, was the FX headwind on revenue on the full year versus what we guided in April.\nAri Bousbib: So guidance, you mean the second half? What is the question?\nRon Bruehlman: The actual FX headwind, so the FX headwind on our full year guidance--\nAri Bousbib: On revenue, yes.\nRon Bruehlman: --was $125 million.\nMike Fedock: Ninety basis points worse than last quarter.\nRon Bruehlman: Correct.\nAdam: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Tejas Savant from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nTejas Savant: Hey Ari, good morning. Just a couple of quick follow-ups here, and apologies for beating the R&D backlog to death here again. We\u2019ve heard some estimates of up to a third of these pre-commercial companies possibly needing to raise capital at some point in \u201923. Does that at the margin change your calculus at all in terms of who you choose to work with on a go-forward basis, or do you have perhaps higher risk adjustment triggers to your backlog as some of these companies get closer to needing a funding raise? Then if you could also comment separately on the M&A landscape and how you\u2019re sort of thinking about that. I know last quarter, you\u2019d said repos being the near term priority, but just curious as to your take on asset valuations.\nAri Bousbib: Well, okay Tejas, thank you very much and good morning. Look - again, your question on the pre-commercial EBPs needing more funding and having issues is a good theoretical question and correct one for the industry, we are just not exposed to those folks. We have very little of our backlog that\u2019s with pre-commercial EBPs. Those pre-commercial EBPs have been carefully vetted because that\u2019s our process, long pre-dating the current decline in biotech funding. We never take on a molecule that doesn\u2019t have very solid science behind it, that our scientific experts have vetted and believe in. That in and of itself is a guarantee that the science will be developed and that the clinical trials will go on independently of the funding, because worst case scenario, that science will be purchased by large pharma. You are seeing it today. You are seeing a number of large pharma companies buying out pre-commercial EBPs because those pre-commercial EBPs may be running into funding issues but the science is good, therefore the trial will continue no matter what. That\u2019s number one. Number two, we are not going to take into our backlog a company that doesn\u2019t have funding. It just doesn\u2019t happen for us. We do a thorough financial vetting of the project before we put it into our backlog, so we don\u2019t have that exposure. Our business model is different than perhaps some other smaller CROs that essentially team up with pre-commercial EBPs and go around to raise funding and they put that into their backlog. We don\u2019t do that, so this is the reason why we\u2019re not seeing anything different to, again, neither the pipeline nor the RFP volume, nor the awards nor the bookings. Again, I\u2019ve got a huge slew of numbers, I\u2019m looking at a very fine level of granularity here. Look at oncology - if we look at our qualified pipeline, which is really--you know, with a very, very fine comb, our oncology pipeline, there are lots of pre-commercial EBPs, and that\u2019s--I am speaking about the qualified pipeline, that\u2019s really, really high probability, it\u2019s up in the quarter 17% - one, seven - year-over-year. You look at internal medicine, where there\u2019s a lot of rare disease stuff, 14% up in qualified pipeline.  The pipeline in general for EBP, the pipeline - the pipeline! - is 18% up year-over-year in the quarter. I mean, I\u2019m looking at numbers that are literally record numbers, both in growth and in dollars and in volume, so I wouldn\u2019t be speaking confidently if I didn\u2019t have these numbers. Could I wake up tomorrow and the world is falling apart? I don\u2019t know, but that that\u2019s--you know? If I believed that, I wouldn\u2019t cross the street. I\u2019m looking at numbers. The rest is noise. Did you have another question? You had two questions.\nRon Bruehlman: Yes, what was the second question, Tejas?\nTejas Savant: It was on M&A and just prioritizing vis-\u00e0-vis repos. Thank you, Ari.\nAri Bousbib: Yes, M&A. Well, as you saw, we purchased almost a billion dollars in the first half of the year of shares. We did very little M&A, not because we didn\u2019t want to. At any given point in time, we\u2019ve always had lots - I mean, lots, hundreds of potential acquisitions, small, mid, large, and that\u2019s our job. We\u2019ve got corporate development activities. We rarely execute on those, whether it\u2019s for strategic reasons or for financial reasons sometimes. As you said, valuations have been a little bit out of whack. It always takes time for those valuation expectations to come down and adjust to public market valuations and the environment. I think we\u2019re seeing a little bit more of that, so perhaps we will have more opportunities to execute in the second half, I just don\u2019t know - acquisitions are binary, but we don\u2019t have--you know if the acquisition makes sense, it fits in our strategy and is nothing big here or out of whack with anything that we\u2019ve done in the past. You know what we do. We\u2019re very disciplined, and if it fits in our strategy on the commercial side or the clinical side, then we\u2019ll go ahead and do it if the valuation makes sense. Thank you for your question.\nOperator: Our last question will come from John Sourbeer from UBS. Please go ahead, your line is open. John Sourbeer from UBS, your line is open.\nJohn Sourbeer: Hi, can you hear me?\nAri Bousbib: Yes. Yes, we can hear you.\nJohn Sourbeer: Great. I know it\u2019s a little early to comment on the \u201923 guidance, but when you think about the headlines from biotech funding and then, on the other hand, the company has $1 billion in COVID RDS headwinds this year potentially easing comps for next year, do you think that the \u201923 RDS growth is going to be in line with that long term low double-digit guidance that was provided last year at the investor day?\nAri Bousbib: Okay, let me give you \u201923 guidance - just kidding! I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s a little bit early, and as we discussed over the course of the past hour, there are lots of macro dynamics and so on and so forth. We\u2019re not going to start venturing. There is basically nothing different today from what we told you at the end of last year in the underlying dynamics and fundamentals of our businesses, strategically or operationally. What\u2019s changed is the financial environment and the dynamics of risk because of Russia-Ukraine, because of the energy prices and so and so forth, but that doesn\u2019t affect, as we\u2019ve said over and over again, the underlying dynamics and fundamentals of our business. As I sit here today, those are the same as they were when we gave you long term guidance back in November. Thank you for your question. \nOperator: We are out of time for questions today. Mr. Childs, I turn the call back over to you.\nNick Childs: Okay, thank you everyone for joining us today. We look forward to talking to you after the call and on our next call at the end of the third quarter. If anyone has any other follow-up questions, we\u2019ll be happy to take them. Thank you all for joining.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thanks Ari, and good morning everyone. Let's start by reviewing revenue. Second quarter revenue of $3.541 billion grew 3% on a reported basis and 7.1% at constant currency. In the quarter, COVID-related revenues were approximately $250 million, which was down about $300 million versus the second quarter of 2021. In our base business, that is excluding all COVID-related work from both this year and last, organic growth at constant currency was 16%.  Technology and analytic solutions revenue for the second quarter was $1.408 billion, up 4.1% reported and 9.4% at constant currency. Excluding all COVID-related work, organic growth at constant currency in TAS was 10%. Research and development solutions second quarter revenue of $1.950 billion was up 3.1% reported and 6% at constant currency, and excluding all COVID-related work, organic growth at constant currency in R&DS was 22%.  Contract sales and medical solutions, or CSMS second quarter revenue of $183 million declined 5.7% reported, but grew 2.1% at constant currency. Excluding all COVID-related work, organic growth at constant currency in CSMS was 7%.  First half revenue of $7.109 billion grew 3.8% on a reported basis and 6.9% at constant currency. In our base business, that is excluding all COVID-related work, organic growth at constant currency for the first half was 14%. Technology and analytics solutions revenue for the first half was $2.847 billion, up 5.4% reported and 9.6% at constant currency. Excluding all COVID-related work, organic growth at constant currency in TAS was 10% for the first half. R&D solutions first half revenue of $3.884 billion was up 3.3% at actual FX rates and 5.3% at constant currency. Excluding all COVID-related work, organic growth at constant currency in R&DS was 19%. Finally, contract sales and medical solutions, or CSMS first half revenue of $378 million declined 2.3% reported and grew 3.9% constant currency. Excluding all COVID-related work, organic growth in constant currency at CSMS was 6%. Now let's move down the P&L. Adjusted EBITDA in the quarter was $800 million, representing growth of 10.8%, while first half adjusted EBITDA was $1.612 billion, up 10% year-over-year. Second quarter GAAP net income was $256 million and GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.34. For the first half, we had GAAP net income of $581 million or $3.02 of earnings per diluted share. Adjusted net income was $466 million for the second quarter and adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 14.6% to $2.44. For the first half, adjusted net income was $943 million or $4.91 per share.  As already highlighted, R&D solutions delivered yet another strong quarter of new business. This graph that we're showing here shows the growth of our backlog over the past few years at actual currency rates and it demonstrates the sustained strength of our clinical business through the COVID pandemic.  You'll recall that as our bookings reached record levels during the pandemic, many of you expressed concern about a looming so-called COVID cliff, and we told you then that our COVID-related bookings would be replaced by new programs that spanned a breadth of our therapeutic expertise, and in fact that's what happened. As of June 30, our contracted backlog stands at a record $25.6 billion, including pass-throughs. That's a 50% increase over about three years. The COVID contribution to our backlog, which peaked at 11% early in 2021, is now approximately 6%. Let's turn to the balance sheet. As of June 30, cash and cash equivalents totaled $1.428 billion and gross debt was $12.767 billion, resulting in net debt of $11.339 billion. Our net leverage ratio as of June 30 was 3.58 times trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA. Second quarter cash flow from operations was $329 million and capex was $161 million, resulting in free cash flow of $168 million for the quarter. This was somewhat lower than prior quarters, and it mainly reflected the timing of cash collections, which we expect to normalize in the second half. You saw in the quarter that were quite active in the market, repurchasing $590 million of our shares, and this puts our year-to-date share repurchase activity at just shy of $1 billion. This leaves us with slightly over $1.5 billion of share repurchase authorization remaining under the current program. Moving to guidance, our full year 2022 revenue expectation at constant currency remains unchanged. On a reported basis, the strengthening of the dollar since April has caused an incremental full-year revenue headwind from foreign currency translation of approximately $125 million, based on rates as of this Monday, July 18. We're updating our revenue guidance to reflect this. For the full year, we now expect revenue to be between $14.4 billion and $14.550 billion, which represents year-over-year growth of 7.4% to 8.5% at constant currency and 3.8% to 4.9% at actual FX rates. As a reminder, this equates to low to mid-teens organic growth at constant currency, excluding COVID-related work. Our projected revenue growth includes just over 150 basis points of contribution from M&A.  Since FX fluctuations have had a minimal impact on our profit, our adjusted EBITDA guidance remains unchanged. We are tightening the guidance range to be between $3.345 billion and $3.395 billion, which represents year-over-year growth of 10.7% to 12.3%. Our adjusted diluted EPS guidance also remains unchanged. We are tightening the range here to between $10 and $10.20, which translates to year-over-year growth of 10.7% to 13%.  Our full year 2022 guidance assumes that foreign currency rates as of July 18 continue for the balance of the year. Since issuing our initial guidance at our analyst and investor conference in November, FX fluctuations have caused full year revenue headwinds of over $400 million.  Moving to our third quarter guidance, we expect revenues to be between $3.515 billion and $3.565 billion, or growth of 8.4% to 9.8% on a constant currency basis, and 3.7% to 5.1% on a reported basis. Excluding COVID-related work, we expect organic revenue growth at constant currency to be in the low to mid teens in the third quarter. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $805 million and $820 million, up 10.6% to 12.6%, and adjusted diluted EPS is expected to be between $2.34 and $2.42, growing 7.8% to 11.5%.  To summarize, we delivered a very strong second quarter. Our base business delivered mid-teens organic growth at constant currency, excluding COVID-related work. Our R&DS business had another strong bookings quarter with over $2.6 billion of net new business. Contracted backlog at the end of the quarter hit a new record of $25.6 billion, up over 7% year-over-year. We repurchased nearly $600 million of our shares while maintaining our net leverage ratio of approximately 3.6 times trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA, and finally, we adjusted our revenue guidance to reflect changes in foreign exchange but held our earnings guidance unchanged. With that, let me turn it back over to our Operator for Q&A. Yes Eric, to your specific question, I think you had asked about our--in essence about whether our debt and how much of our debt is fixed rate versus variable rate, so how much is affected going forward. I know this is of interest to the group in any event. About 45% of our debt is fixed rate, just shy of 60% is fixed with swaps. We did have a euro floor that fixed even more of our debt up until recently, but we're about at the floor now with the recent ECB decision, so-- Seventy-five percent-- Yes, but going forward it will be more like just shy of 60% fixed. You had asked about what our guidance assumes, and we've pretty much followed what the market consensus is there in the U.S. about assuming a couple of 75 basis point increases in the U.S. in July and September, and 25 basis point increases in the fourth quarter two times. For the euro, we have a series of increases, smaller increases assumed out through the balance of the year, totaling just slightly over 100 basis points baked into our numbers. That's pretty much in line with the market consensus right now. Now, you asked also about how much has interest expense--the increase in rates affected our interest expense assumptions since November, I guess, when we put our initial guidance out. I'll have to go back and look at that. It's obviously had an impact, not so much in the first half of the year but more in the second half of the year, obviously, as the rate increases or the pace of rate increases has been back-end loaded in the year. We'll have to come back with an answer to that, unless Nick has it handy. Yes, just to answer your question on China and the impact there, modest impact in Q2. We're assuming a continued modest impact in Q3, mainly around our lab business and clinical trials as not all the sites are open in areas where there's shutdowns or restrictions. The only caution I would say there is just that none of us knows exactly what's going to happen in China, where future lockdowns might happen and so forth, but right now we're not expected a big impact. No, I think you covered it good. Next question? It was $125 million, was the FX headwind on revenue on the full year versus what we guided in April. The actual FX headwind, so the FX headwind on our full year guidance-- --was $125 million. Correct. Yes, what was the second question, Tejas?"

            "name": "Ari Bousbib",
            "content": "Thank you Nick, and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us today to discuss our second quarter results. IQVIA delivered strong financial results this quarter despite the dynamics of the broader macro environment and the various global geopolitical issues. Let me address a few of the key ones. Some of you have continued to ask about the impact of biotech funding on the CRO industry. As we have said on several occasions, the recent decline in biotech funding has not had any significant impact on our business. Our exposure to pre-commercial EBPs remains at just over 10% of our backlog. We have not seen an impact on bookings or RFPs, nor any increase in cancellations or delays in clinical trial work from the slowdown in biotech funding. Actually, RFP dollars from the overall EBP client segment continued to grow double digits in the quarter. In China, the government-imposed COVID lockdowns had a modest impact on our second quarter results, mostly from disruptions to our clinical and laboratory operations. Our commercial business was virtually unaffected. Our experience in managing through prior lockdowns during the pandemic has been helpful in minimizing the operational impacts on site closures. Our guidance assumes that modest impacts on COVID-related lockdowns in China will continue through the end of the third quarter. In Ukraine, we continued to work with sites and sponsors to ensure the safety of our employees and patients while working to mitigate trial disruptions caused by the ongoing crisis. In Russia, we continue to conduct trials currently underway to ensure the safety of patients already enrolled in clinical trials, but we are moving recruitment on new trials to other countries. The financial impacts of the Russia-Ukraine crisis are tracking in line with the expectations we communicated back in April.  More generally, we are of course monitoring, as are you, the possibility of a recession. I would just note that over the past 20 years, IQVIA along with the broader CRO industry has shown resilience to economic downturns. During recessionary times over the past two decades, annual S&P 500 revenue contracted by as much as 10% while IQVIA's clinical business and the CRO industry as a whole never experienced a year of revenue decline. The resilience of the CRO industry likely reflects the long cycle nature of our business, as well as of course the mission critical importance of clinical research and more generally the defensive nature of healthcare. With that as background, let's review the second quarter. Revenue for the second quarter grew 3% on a reported basis and 7.1% at constant currency. The fully $6 million beat above the midpoint of our guidance range was primarily driven by the timing of pass-through revenues versus our expectations, as well as some operational upside. Compared to last year and excluding COVID-related work from both periods, our base businesses grew 16% at constant currency on an organic basis. Ron will provide additional details in his remarks, including COVID-adjusted numbers for each of our segments. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA increased 10.8%, reflecting our strong revenue growth and ongoing cost management discipline. Second quarter adjusted diluted EPS of $2.44 grew 14.6% driven entirely by our adjusted EBITDA growth.  Let me provide some more updates and color on the business in the quarter. The continued strong performance at IQVIA is driven by our highly differentiated capabilities. As you know, the key differentiator for us in the clinical and commercial spaces is IQVIA's connected intelligence. Let me give you a few examples of how IQVIA's applications here help our clients solve their most complex problems. IQVIA's AI-driven next best action platform helps our clients integrate multiple data sources, transforming raw data into personalized recommendations to sales, marketing and medical personnel which of course leads to deeper relationships with healthcare providers. In the quarter, a top 10 pharma client chose IQVIA's solution to completely transform their omnichannel commercial engagement model and to improve their go-to-market efficiency across multiple brands in eight countries by up to 30%. Another example in the quarter, we were selected by a top 20 pharma client to optimize the delivery of raw brand content directly to healthcare providers for one of their respiratory brands. Our solution here connects digital and field sales channels to deliver highly personalized content that results in high quality, seamless brand experience for healthcare providers. This will improve this client's digital engagement metrics by 3.5 times. Another area where demand has been growing is pharma co-vigilance. Our platform here combines a unique catalog of over 500,000 safety-specific terms and patterns with natural language processing to mine vast amounts of online data and to identify potential adverse events. In the quarter, another top 10 pharma client selected our solution to reduce the risk of non-compliance and to increase data accuracy, ultimately improving their efficiency by up to 75%. Beyond mass pharma, our commercial solutions are also resonating with EBP clients, especially when they decide to commercialize their assets on their own following approval. For example, in the quarter we contracted with a leading EBP client to implement and manage their entire end-to-end commercial information management and to support their patient engagement and access programs. This includes data provisioning, massive data management, and data modeling. Our ability to offer these services on a fully integrated platform will allow for a more streamlined implementation, generating savings of up to 20% versus multi-vendor solutions. As you know, IQVIA continues to be the global leader in real world evidence. In the quarter, a top 10 pharma awarded IQVIA a major project in medical affairs. The project leverages our AI and ML capabilities to provide near real-time disease insights across five different therapeutic areas. These insights will help identify misdiagnosis and [indiscernible] treatments which will in turn improve patient outcomes.  As you know, our ECOA, or Electronic Clinical Outcomes Assessment platform has won multiple awards for its breakthrough patient engagement innovations. The product includes a library of over 1,500 prebuilt clinical outcome assessments which enables sponsors to deploy assessments to patients up to 14 weeks sooner than competitors' offerings. This efficiency reduces risks to study start-up timelines and allows our clients to capture more feedback from patients, ultimately amplifying the patient's voice real time.  A top five sponsor recently engaged IQVIA to couple this ECOA platform with our patient randomization tool so that we eliminate redundant workflows, improve data accuracy and patient compliance, thereby reducing site on-boarding activities by an estimated 50%.  Finally, in the overall R&D as business, we continued our strong momentum, delivering over $2.6 billion of total net new business in the quarter, including pass-throughs. The services bookings also remained at the historic high we have seen recently of over $1.9 billion. This resulted in a second quarter contracted net book-to-bill ratio of 1.34 including pass-throughs, and 1.32 excluding pass-throughs. Over the last 12 months, our contracted net book-to-bill ratio was 1.32, both including and excluding pass-throughs. As you can see, there continues to be strong positive momentum across the business and an unprecedented level of engagement with our clients across our portfolio of commercial and clinical businesses despite the broader environment.  I will now turn it over to Ron for more details on our financial performance. Yes, thank you Sandy, and good morning to you. I'd start answering your question by simply saying there is absolutely none of those concerns. We haven't seen any of that. We're very pleased with the continued growth of our TAS business, really across the board, and you know that we like to think of our business in three buckets: the high growth ones, which is real world and technology, and that represents - Mike, I'm going to say about 40%-- --45% of the total, and that's experiencing continued growth, hasn't abated during COVID at all, and continues to sell through at the same pace. Then we have the labor-based consulting, primary market research, analytics business which grows mid to high single digits and has been very strong through COVID, and continues to be strong essentially at the same pace, and that's about-- --25% approximately, so the last balance, the 30% is basically our historic IMS data business, and that's kind of flattish to up 1% or 2%, quarter-in, quarter-out, and also has been essentially flat in terms of its growth through the COVID crisis. As Ron mentioned, constant--organic constant currency revenue growth for TAS excluding COVID was 10% in the quarter and also 10% for the first half, so again really we're not seeing anything at all that's changed versus the pandemic peak, or before the pandemic peak. Continued strong momentum. Thank you Sandy. No, I wouldn't expect less from you, Eric. You ask one question and you manage to pack 10 questions in one! It's a topical question, obviously, and you can imagine we are looking at the global environment, the rates. You saw the ECB bump of 50 basis points this morning, and we do have some euro debt, as you know. Obviously there is a point at which those changes cross certain thresholds and it does have an impact on our capital structure, and we are modeling all of those and making different scenarios as to how we change or not our capital allocation strategy. For now, it remains what it was. I'm going to ask Ron to give you more detail and address the specifics of your question. Ron? Up to today, it was, like-- Seventy-five percent fixed. Yes, thanks Elizabeth. These are two very distinct questions, so let me start with the second one, the fourth quarter. Look - fourth quarter, there is some level of seasonality in our business, historically it has always been the case both on the commercial side and on the clinical side, and the fourth quarter traditionally is always the strongest one.  You are specifically alluding to EBITDA, and I would point that if you go back and look in general, our margins in the fourth quarter are higher than, let's say, sequentially in the third quarter, for example, and in general it's about a point higher - you know, maybe a little less than that, maybe a little more than that, depending on the year. That is because on the commercial side, it's the end of the year, a lot of the budgets tend to be spent and a lot of purchases get done last minute, and obviously both our clients want to do that before they close the year and our sales force pushes, as always, to make the quarter and so on, so forth for more sales at the end of the quarter and at the end of the year, so there's that kind of momentum on the commercial side, whether it's data or analytics or just across the board on our commercial portfolio. That's always the case year in, year out, and this year it's a little bit stronger than might have indicated in prior years, but it's not inconsistent.  On the clinical side, it's all driven by the execution of the backlog and when and how it converts, so that's really--you know, we do a roll-up project by project of when we anticipate the work will be done and costs incurred and revenue recognized, and we do that bottom-up and that's where it comes out. Again, in general fourth quarter tends to be stronger in the clinical side as well historically, and that is probably because people want to try to execute the work before the end of the year, so that's not unusual. Agree that's sequentially a bit more than prior years, but again nothing inconsistent. Ron, you want to say something? Yes, just a remark on China, bear in mind it's less than 3% of our total revenue. We have a strong presence there relative to our competitors and we are doing very well. On the clinical side is where the impact is. Remember, on the commercial side we have exactly zero impact from the lockdowns - that was the case during the pandemic at the peak of it, and it continues to be the case today.  On the clinical side, obviously the issue is accessing sites, and when it's closed, it's closed. But we have learned during the pandemic how to work with that and to do remote visits, etc., and so far at least, the impact from China lockdowns, which have been extensive, as you know, in Shanghai and Tianjin and some other areas, we have been able to manage through that and whatever financial impact was essentially absorbed in our numbers. Thank you Elizabeth. Yes, thank you for the question. Look - the resilience that's obvious on the clinical side, it's born by the long-term history, as I mentioned in my introductory remarks. On the commercial side, you are correct - I mean, I guess you pointed to consulting because consulting is usually the most discretionary type of spend at our clients. So far, not one--I would say not one noise, not one--nothing. We are looking--I am asking every day, what is going on in the business in every aspect, and I can tell you there is no indication whatsoever that somehow people are curtailing their budgets on the commercial side.  Bear in mind, the last big recession we had along with the housing crisis in the end of 2008, '09, '10, the commercial business was affected really by different factors. There were very large pharma consolidations, and on the commercial side when you have a large pharma merger, you go from two clients to one client, so that automatically affects your revenues. Not so much on the clinical side - generally if you are in--if the two pharma companies that merge are in the same therapy, the authorities won't let you merge and generally when pharma merge, they have complementary therapies and the clinical trials continue. So yes, those laws, that pharma consolidation wave that took place at that time, a lot of it driven by tax considerations, affected our commercial business. We're not seeing any of that so far. Secondly, there was a unique phenomenon then, which was that there was an unusual large number of patent expiries, and those LOEs were sort of accelerating the 2008 to 2012 time frame. There was a so-called patent cliff, and that was coupled with an unusually low number of new product approvals. The pharma commercial business is obviously driven by the net of new approvals versus patent--or loss of exclusivity, and usually that's a net positive. At that time, there was unusual circumstances where we had a trough in new approvals and a peak in loss of exclusivity, and that was a reverse trend.  But today, we don't see that. We know the pipeline, we know the molecules in the pipe that are supposed to be approved and the expiries and so on, and we see none of that anytime soon, so we're not concerned and we feel that the commercial business is fairly well insulated as well.  Thank you. Yes, so I assume you mean globally, not just Russia and Ukraine. Look - Russia, Ukraine, the first part of your question, we addressed that, as you said, quite effectively. That doesn't mean that it was easy or that it didn't consume an enormous amount of management attention and work. Thankfully we were able to reallocate resources and clinical work to other sites. Now, this itself does not add incrementally to the existing burden of the existing sites. Your second point is more--I think is truly valid. It is true we have a lot of work to execute, as mentioned many times. This is our single most important operational challenge, that is execution, and that requires people. People recruiting, retention and development is our single most important operational challenge in the current environment. I think I've mentioned before, and I see the trend continuing, the high attrition levels we've seen are somewhat plateauing and diminishing. That may have something to do with perhaps a more recessionary environment and people less likely to jump ship. It also may have to do with the fact that we really have a strong book of business and we are, hopefully, I want to believe, a more exciting work environment and more exciting company to be part of. We're doing our part to try to retain our people. The sites themselves, we are not seeing--I'm sure if you asked specifically the individual, they'd say yes, I'm burnt out. Are we asking people to work more and to be more productive and so on? Yes, but again that's just the nature of the type of work that we do. We're not seeing any execution difficulties as a result of people being, quote-unquote, burnt out. We're not. When people are burned out, they either quite or they ask to be allocated to something else, and that's what we try to do.  We've always tried to prioritize the wellbeing of our employees, and during the pandemic that has accelerated. I may not have mentioned this before, but even for myself on downwards, we've had a dramatic change in tone and how we address issues with employees' work flexibility. We do live in a different environment where the considerations for employees, valued employees and skilled employees to remain at the company involve more than just work and compensation, and so we are doing our part to address that.  We will be 90,000-plus people by the end of the year, and we continue to hire. In this year, we have hired by the end of the year more than 25,000 people just to replace attrition and to support the growth. We are really a hiring machine. We've dramatically, dramatically improved the level of sophistication of our human resource management functions around the world, and the type of analytics and artificial intelligence tools we use to track our employees' workload are really very unprecedented, so it is an issue and we are managing it. You wanted to add something, Mike? Okay, well thank you and good morning. This is obviously a good question. Again, I mentioned before for the commercial side, I do the same on the clinical side, I am almost daily asking a number of people to monitor activity. Again, I wouldn't be saying this unless I had a certain level of confidence that so far, as of late last night, I can assure you there simply is no sign that the pipeline--you know, very early indicators is slowing down, the RFP volume is slowing down, and it is across the board in every segment. The second quarter was another quarter of record bookings. I can tell you, I think the awards--the volume was the second highest quarter ever, so we're just not seeing it. I know there are concerns, and it is true that the volume of funding has gone down, it's just not translating into a slowdown in either the strength and growth of our pipeline has never as large, record growth and volume, both dollars and numbers, or the RFP volume or the awards or the bookings. Now, you are asking a very, very pertinent question, which is the clients, whether EDP, midsize, large pharma who are requesting proposals or who are in the pipeline, when did they get their funding; and you are absolutely correct - it takes maybe three years, I'm going to say, before the funding raised today is actually spent. A lot of what is going to be disbursed by these companies that have booked--with whom we've booked business each quarter is cash that was raised in prior periods, so you want to try to say, well, funding is low now and therefore two years, three years from now, maybe bookings should go down. That's just not the experience historically. Again, our business is not dependent on secondary public offerings from pre-commercial EDPs. It's just not. Secondly, a lot of things are going to happen over the next few years where--you know, that's the benefit of scale. Remember we are all over the world, we have the largest volume of business of any CRO in the world. We're not exposed to one client, two clients, 10 clients, a segment, another segment, a geography, another geography. At any given point in time, we are working on well over 2,500 trials. We are a big ship, and like every big ship, it's very hard. You're not going to see from us 50% growth in a quarter, but on the other hand the converse is also never going to happen. We are a very big ship, and these disturbances in a long cycle business do not affect the direction of our business. Any other comments you want to make? So guidance, you mean the second half? What is the question? On revenue, yes. Well, okay Tejas, thank you very much and good morning. Look - again, your question on the pre-commercial EBPs needing more funding and having issues is a good theoretical question and correct one for the industry, we are just not exposed to those folks. We have very little of our backlog that's with pre-commercial EBPs. Those pre-commercial EBPs have been carefully vetted because that's our process, long pre-dating the current decline in biotech funding. We never take on a molecule that doesn't have very solid science behind it, that our scientific experts have vetted and believe in. That in and of itself is a guarantee that the science will be developed and that the clinical trials will go on independently of the funding, because worst case scenario, that science will be purchased by large pharma. You are seeing it today. You are seeing a number of large pharma companies buying out pre-commercial EBPs because those pre-commercial EBPs may be running into funding issues but the science is good, therefore the trial will continue no matter what. That's number one. Number two, we are not going to take into our backlog a company that doesn't have funding. It just doesn't happen for us. We do a thorough financial vetting of the project before we put it into our backlog, so we don't have that exposure. Our business model is different than perhaps some other smaller CROs that essentially team up with pre-commercial EBPs and go around to raise funding and they put that into their backlog. We don't do that, so this is the reason why we're not seeing anything different to, again, neither the pipeline nor the RFP volume, nor the awards nor the bookings. Again, I've got a huge slew of numbers, I'm looking at a very fine level of granularity here. Look at oncology - if we look at our qualified pipeline, which is really--you know, with a very, very fine comb, our oncology pipeline, there are lots of pre-commercial EBPs, and that's--I am speaking about the qualified pipeline, that's really, really high probability, it's up in the quarter 17% - one, seven - year-over-year. You look at internal medicine, where there's a lot of rare disease stuff, 14% up in qualified pipeline.  The pipeline in general for EBP, the pipeline - the pipeline! - is 18% up year-over-year in the quarter. I mean, I'm looking at numbers that are literally record numbers, both in growth and in dollars and in volume, so I wouldn't be speaking confidently if I didn't have these numbers. Could I wake up tomorrow and the world is falling apart? I don't know, but that that's--you know? If I believed that, I wouldn't cross the street. I'm looking at numbers. The rest is noise. Did you have another question? You had two questions. Yes, M&A. Well, as you saw, we purchased almost a billion dollars in the first half of the year of shares. We did very little M&A, not because we didn't want to. At any given point in time, we've always had lots - I mean, lots, hundreds of potential acquisitions, small, mid, large, and that's our job. We've got corporate development activities. We rarely execute on those, whether it's for strategic reasons or for financial reasons sometimes. As you said, valuations have been a little bit out of whack. It always takes time for those valuation expectations to come down and adjust to public market valuations and the environment. I think we're seeing a little bit more of that, so perhaps we will have more opportunities to execute in the second half, I just don't know - acquisitions are binary, but we don't have--you know if the acquisition makes sense, it fits in our strategy and is nothing big here or out of whack with anything that we've done in the past. You know what we do. We're very disciplined, and if it fits in our strategy on the commercial side or the clinical side, then we'll go ahead and do it if the valuation makes sense. Thank you for your question. Yes. Yes, we can hear you. Okay, let me give you '23 guidance - just kidding! I don't know. It's a little bit early, and as we discussed over the course of the past hour, there are lots of macro dynamics and so on and so forth. We're not going to start venturing. There is basically nothing different today from what we told you at the end of last year in the underlying dynamics and fundamentals of our businesses, strategically or operationally. What's changed is the financial environment and the dynamics of risk because of Russia-Ukraine, because of the energy prices and so and so forth, but that doesn't affect, as we've said over and over again, the underlying dynamics and fundamentals of our business. As I sit here today, those are the same as they were when we gave you long term guidance back in November. Thank you for your question."

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Nick Childs, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Mr. Childs, please begin your conference.\nNick Childs: Thank you. Good morning everyone. Thank you for joining our first quarter 2022 earnings call. With me today are Ari Bousbib, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Ron Bruehlman, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Eric Sherbet, Executive Vice President and General Counsel; Mike Fedock, Senior Vice President, Financial Planning and Analysis; and Bryan Stengel, Associate Director, Investor Relations. Today, we will be referencing a presentation that will be visible during this call for those of you on our webcast. This presentation will also be available following this call in the Events and Presentations section of our IQVIA Investor Relations website at ir.iqvia.com. Before we begin, I would like to caution listeners that certain information discussed by management during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results will differ materially from those stated or implied by forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties associated with the company's business which are discussed in the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings. In addition, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures on this call, which should be considered a supplement to and not a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the comparable GAAP measures is included in the press release and conference call presentation. I would now like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Ari Bousbib.\nAri Bousbib: Thank you, Nick and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining today to discuss our first quarter results. IQVIA has very strong financial results in the quarter and that is despite the broader macro environment. On this note, regarding first the tragic situation in the Ukraine, our thoughts and concerns from the beginning has been around the safety and well being of our employees, the patients we support and all those affected by the ongoing events. We've been actively supporting our employees and their families on the ground with evacuation support, relocation services and financial assistance. For example, we accelerated bonus payments and actually we continue to pay our employees there, regardless of their ability to perform any work. In addition, IQVIA capabilities are being utilized to help support the resulting refugee crisis. For example, Ukrainian refugees are entering surrounding countries with medicines and prescriptions and medical professionals in those countries are seeking to identify and convert product information on these prescriptions into their local equivalent. To help, we've established a free online service for medical professionals to search a product name, active ingredients, and strength, and the tool generates a list of matching products in whichever the local country around the Ukraine is. Also, we've been working very closely with our customers, suppliers and clinical sites across the region to ensure continuity of our in-flight clinical trials and ensure of course that our clients are able to continue to support the effective delivery of medicines to vulnerable patients in the region who depend on these medicines. In Ukraine we are providing support to ensure that trial patients who have begun receiving treatment remain on their treatment protocols. We have established direct to patient shipments of investigational medical products and patient call centers in order to ensure patient care can continue. In Russia, we are guided by ethical concerns to ensure the safety of patients already enrolled in clinical trials. We are utilizing our global logistics and procurement infrastructure to facilitate the movement of investigational medical products, lab kits, and samples into and out of the country to minimize potential adverse impacts to patient care. For studies that are in startup or early phase, in both countries, we are redirecting patient recruitment to other countries based on consultations with our customers. Even though a little less than 1% of our overall revenue and approximately 3% of our global patient recruitment come from the Ukraine and Russia, the operational disruptions I just described, will have some financial impact which we have incorporated into our updated guidance. Now, another key focus area for investors in the quarter, as you will know, has been the emerging biopharma funding environment. We received a number of questions on this topic since our earnings release in February and we have addressed those in multiple forums. However, there have been some lingering questions on the same topic and I want to take this opportunity once again to reiterate our comments with a specific focus, a) on the funding environment and b) on our own company's exposure to this EBP segment. I'll start by stating that the concern about EBP funding environment is overstated. I want to support the assertion with four key points. Number one, the industry has observed a slowdown in public funding compared to the record levels in 2020 and 2021, but the private venture capital markets have continued to be strong and funding in the first quarter of 2022 was the third highest ever according to the National Venture Capital Association. I will also observe that these EBP firms are seeking large amounts of cash from the very strong funding cycles in 2020 and 2021. Number two, when there is a reduction in EBP funding or the IPO market contracts, mid and large pharma companies often step up their acquisition activities of EBP companies and frankly, that benefits us as we have long-standing relationships with these customers. In fact, you may have seen the recent acquisition of Checkmate Pharmaceuticals by Regeneron, which illustrates this very point. Number three, history tells us that when EBP funding slows, it does not have a significant effect on our business. For example, following the last EBP funding slowdown in 2015, 2016, our IQVIA biotech unit saw no interruption in net new business and revenue growth, nor any unusual increase in cancellations. And finally, number four, when we look at either our pipeline or RFP activity, we have simply not seen any slowdown, no unusual cancellation activity, no unusual delays in decision making. In fact, in the quarter our overall R&DS RFP dollars were up 13% year-over-year, and RFP dollars from EBP were up over 16%. The broader industry continues to show strength. We're seeing clinical trials start up 7% in the first quarter compared to last year, with a 14% increase in oncology trial starts, which is a therapeutic area, as you well know, that's predominantly sponsored by EBP. Now, let me focus on our own exposure to the same, specifically three commercial EBPs, which are those EBPs that have zero revenue, and are the most vulnerable and exposed to the funding environment. And here I want to make another four points. Number one, as of March 31, pre-commercial EBPs represented just over 10% of our total R&DS backlog. Number two, less than 7% of our overall RFP dollars in the quarter came from pre-commercial EBP. Number three, this exposure to pre-commercial EBP for IQVIA is not only minimal, but also I want to point out and underline that our vetting process for taking on a pre-commercial EBP is extremely rigorous and thorough. The process includes, for example, a review of the clients cash balances, payment history, viability and quality of their science, and of course progress with clinical developments. So, again, said differently, not every EBP who knocks at our door with a molecule that they think is interesting, makes it into our battle. Number four, I will simply remind you that this exposure primarily impacts our R&DS segment. Approximately 45% of IQVIA's total company revenue comes from our commercial businesses. And as you know, there is virtually zero pre-commercial exposure on the commercial side. With those kind of a background, let me now delve into the first quarter results. Revenue for the first quarter grew 4.7% on a reported basis and 6.8% at constant currency. The $23 million beat above the midpoint of our guidance range was driven by strong operational performance across all three segments. And that was of course partially offset by foreign exchange headwinds. Compared to prior year and excluding COVID related work for both years, our core businesses grew about 13% at constant currency on an organic basis. Ron will provide additional detail in his remarks, including COVID adjusted numbers for each of our three segments. First quarter adjusted EBITDA grew 9.1% reflecting our revenue growth, as well as ongoing productivity initiatives. First quarter adjusted diluted EPS of $2.47 grew 13.3%, that was 4% above the midpoint of our guide, which is with about $0.03 of the beat coming from operational improvements. I'll now provide an update on the business and let's start with the commercial and technology side. We've spoken before and you're familiar with IQVIA's connected intelligence framework, which leverages our advanced analytics technology and domain expertise across the entire clinical and commercial portfolio and has been critical in supporting the emerging needs of the pharma industry. I want to give a recent example of how these capabilities are being deployed. In the quarter we entered into a multiyear agreement with Argenx for the development and commercialization of new indications for their rare disease product currently approved for treatments of a rare autoimmune disorder affecting the muscles. Our collaboration with Argenx incorporates IQVIA's Connected Intelligence to support clinical development, real world evidence, regulatory and commercial support to accelerate the development of this product for potential treatment of other severe autoimmune diseases and to expand globally. This is an exciting product with a lot of upside potential. It's currently approved for three -- six indications, has the potential for up to 15 indications. Plus this drug has already been launched in the U.S. and has plans to launch in Europe and in Japan in the next year. Another example of a client selecting IQVIA's integrated capabilities to solve complex problems is [indiscernible], a European pharma client recently selected IQVIA's Vigilance Platform and Regulatory Information Management Technology. This is an area that's a real headache for our clients. And our technology solutions simplify and streamline our processes. [Indiscernible] will benefit from our technology's integrated AI ML capabilities, automation of labor-heavy activities, and easy implementation. To date, over 150 clients have adopted one or more solutions within our safety, regulatory and four different [ph] suites of technologies. In the real world evidence, I'm sure you've seen that we were selected to support DARWIN, or Data Analysis and Real World Interrogation Network. DARWIN is a strategic initiative of the EMA. This is a major win for IQVIA as it draws on our proprietary technologies, methods and deep scientific and operational expertise. It will help us deepen our relationship with healthcare providers and sites across Europe. Moving to Clinical Technology, IQVIA continues to lead the industry in decentralized clinical trials. Our end-to-end solution of integrated technology and services capabilities are being utilized on just over one third of our full service trials globally. Today, we've recruited over 300,000 patients across 80 countries, covering over 30 indications. Now, whether for traditional or decentralized trials, demand for our suite of digital clinical technology offerings continued to increase during the first quarter. To date, over 400 clients have adopted one or more modules within our Orchestrated Clinical Technology suite since launch. One of these key modules for example, is our clinical trial payments solution. This technology ensures accurate, timely and transparent investigator payment processing. It is a key driver of both site and sponsors satisfaction. Four of the top 10 and 25 of the top 30 pharma clients have now selected IQVIA's payment technology solution for their trials. This includes a major award in the quarter with a top 10 sponsor to migrate their entire payment ecosystem across several legacy platforms to our technology. The scale of this technology migration is the largest of its kind in the industry and it encompasses 120 clinical studies across all phases, with over 6000 sites globally. Beyond these client highlights, our overall R&DS businesses continued to see strong momentum in the quarter, delivering over $2.5 billion of net new business, including pass-throughs. This included a record quarter of over $1.9 billion of services bookings, resulting in the first quarter of contracted net book-to-bill ratio of 1.32, excluding pass-throughs and 1.31 including pass-throughs. Over the last 12 months our contracted net book-to-bill ratio was 1.33 excluding pass-throughs and 1.32 including pass-throughs. Our contracted backlog in R&DS grew 9.1% year-over-year to a record $25.3 billion as of March 31, 2022. As a result, our next 12 months revenue from backlog increased to over $7 billion growing 8% from a year ago. As you can see there is a lot of strong positive momentum across the business, regardless of the choppy macro environment. On a final note, IQVIA was named the top CRO in overall reputation by clinical trial sites around the world in the 2021 CenterWatch's Global Site Benchmark Survey. This is a big deal for us. This is a rigorous and independent survey, that is highly respected in the industry. Over 60,000 investigators, trial coordinators, research nurses, and other clinical professionals representing clinical trial sites from around the world were asked to rank and score 29 CROs across 35 performance related attributes. We are proud to have been selected and named the top CRO in overall reputation and specifically, we received high marks, especially high marks for our comprehensive decentralized trials, direct to patient recruitment, and therapeutic clinical regulatory and technology expertise. I will now turn it over to Ron for more details on our financial performance. Ron?\nRon Bruehlman: Thanks, Ari, and good morning, everyone. Let's start by reviewing revenue. First quarter revenue of $3,568 million grew 4.7% on a reported basis and 6.8% at constant currency. In the quarter COVID related revenues were approximately $375 million to down about 35% versus the first quarter of 2021. In our base business, that is excluding all COVID related work from both this year and last, organic growth at constant currency was about 13%. Technology and Analytic Solutions revenue for the first quarter was $1,439 million, which was up 6.8% reported and 9.8% at constant currency. Excluding all COVID related work, organic growth at constant currency in Tech and Analytic Solutions was just over 10%. R&D Solutions first quarter revenue of $1,934 million was up 3.5% at actual FX rates and 4.7% at constant currency. Again, excluding all COVID related work, organic growth at constant currency in R&DS was approximately 17% which was consistent with our expectations. Contract Sales and Medical Solutions or CSMS first quarter revenue of $195 million grew 1% reported and 5.7% at constant currency. Excluding all COVID related work, organic growth at constant currency in CSMS was mid single digits. And let's move down the P&L now. Adjusted EBITDA was $812 million for the first quarter, which represented growth of 9.1% on a reported basis. First quarter GAAP net income was $325 million, that was up 53.3% year-over-year and GAAP diluted earnings per share with $1.68 up 54.1% year-over-year. Adjusted net income was $477 million for the quarter, up 12.2% year-over-year and adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 13.3% to $2.47. Now as already reviewed R&D Solutions delivered yet another outstanding quarter of net new business. Our backlog at March 31 stood at a record $25.3 billion, an increase of 9.1% year-over-year. Next 12 months revenue from backlog increased 8% year-over-year to just over $7 billion and I would note that both the backlog and next 12 months revenue numbers I just quoted were affected by FX rates at quarter end and that is to say they were lower than they otherwise would have been due to the strengthening of the dollar during the quarter. Okay, moving now to the balance sheet, first quarter cash flow from operations was $508 million and CapEx was $177 million. That resulted in free cash flow of $331 million and as a reminder, our free cash flow in the first quarter of each year is affected by the timing of annual bonus payments. At March 31, cash and cash equivalents totaled $1,387 million and gross debt was $12,637 million which resulted in net debt of $11,250 million. Our net leverage ratio at March 31 was 3.64 times trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA. In the quarter we repurchased $403 million of our shares, which leaves us with slightly over $2.1 billion of share repurchase authorization remaining under the current program. Now let's move to guidance. For the full year 2022, our expectation remains unchanged, that organic revenue growth excluding COVID related work will be low to mid teens at constant currency. Since February FX fluctuations have caused an incremental full year revenue headwind of over $200 million as of yesterday's rates. In addition, we currently estimate the revenue disruption from the Russia-Ukraine crisis to be in the $40 million to $50 million range. Accordingly, we are updating our revenue guidance range to reflect these two factors. For the full year, we now expect revenue to be between $14,450 million and $14,750 million, which represents year-over-year growth of 6.9 to 9%, at constant currency and 4.2% to 6.3% reported, both compared to 2021. Now as a reminder, in the revenue guidance we've provided in our Q4 call in February, we absorbed a $70 million FX headwind versus the initial guidance we provided at Analysts and Investor Conference in November. Objective revenue growth includes just over 150 basis points of contribution from M&A activity. Now, despite the macro factors that affected our revenue guidance, we're reaffirming our full year 2022 adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS guidance ranges that we provided on our fourth quarter 2021 earnings call. This includes absorbing the earnings impact of lost revenue in Russia and Ukraine as well as the costs that remain there such as salaries and assistance provided to employees. Accordingly, we continue to expect adjusted EBITDA to be between $3,330 million and $3,405 million representing year-over-year growth at 10.2% to 12.7% and we continue to expect adjusted diluted EPS to be between $9.95 and $10.25 or year-over-year growth at 10.2% to 13.5%. Now, our full year 2022 guidance ranges assume that foreign currency rates as of yesterday, April 26, remain in effect for the balance of the year. Moving on to second quarter guidance, I'll remind you that the first half of last year represented our peak for COVID related revenues, and as a result of that, the second quarter should be the toughest year-over-year compare in terms of revenues. So for the second quarter revenue is expected to be between $3,470 million and $3,520 million representing growth of 4.6% to 6% on a constant currency basis and 0.9% to 2.4% on a reported basis. Excluding COVID related work we expect organic revenue growth at constant currency to be in the low to mid teens, consistent with what we had in Q1 actuals and our projected full year revenue growth. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $790 million and $805 million, up 9.4% to 11.5% and adjusted diluted EPS is expected to be between $2.35 and $2.42, growing 10.3% to 13.6%. So to summarize, we delivered very strong first quarter results on both the top and bottom line against what had been a very strong first quarter of 2021. Our base business maintained low teens organic growth at constant currency, excluding COVID related work with double digit growth on this basis in both TAS and R&DS. Our R&DS bookings for business recorded its largest ever quarter of service bookings, contracted backlog exceeded $25 billion for the first time rising over 9% year-over-year with over $7 billion expected to convert to revenue over the next 12 months. We maintained our net leverage ratio at 3.6 times 12-month adjusted EBITDA on a trailing basis and finally most importantly, despite the turmoil around us, we remain very confident in our outlook and accordingly have maintained a full year 2022 profit guidance. So with that, let me hand it back over to the operator for our Q&A session.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Eric Coldwell from Baird. Your line is open, please ask a question.\nEric Coldwell: Thanks very much. Good morning. Two quick ones, both on geography. First, with Russia-Ukraine, I'm sorry if I missed it, but could you tell us the impact in Q1 and then how the $40 million to $50 million of annual impact is phased through the year? I guess, I would assume the majority of that or a significant portion is in 2Q, but we'd love to get your sense on how you faced that $40 million to $50 million projected impact? And then secondarily, early in the pandemic IQVIA was the first and perhaps most vocal company to talk about the impact of China in Asia-Pac when COVID first broke out. Obviously, a lot of conversation these days on the rolling lockdowns in China, I'd love to get an update on what you're seeing from the impact in that market and how you're operating across that region, given the governmental actions ongoing today? Thanks very much.\nAri Bousbib: Thank you. Good morning, Eric and thanks for your questions. On the first one, Ukraine, well Ukraine actually is like we're not even 1% or above 1% of our revenue a little less. So call it $130 million, $140 million, let's say. And, obviously, it's a significant displacement and the world that cannot be done primarily in R&DS. I might point out some of that may come back, some of the trial obviously needs to continue and will be delayed. It just takes time and because of the disruption, or you want to answer specifically, the question on the how much per quarter? We said it's -- we sized it at $40 million to $50 million, right? So it's less than a proportion of impact in Q1, obviously, because the conflict didn't start until late February. So we had a few million dollars of impact in Q1, not a huge impact. You're right, Eric, that it's probably that $40 million to 50 million is probably front end loaded in the year, because we should recapture a little bit as we get late in the year and we start shifting work. But that always takes longer than you think it's going to take. So, you know, we're not assuming a huge recovery of work in 2022, but ultimately, as we find new patients and move the clinical trial activity outside of Russia and Ukraine, we should recover a lot of that you know in probably back end of the year or early next. Now with respect to China, just to situate the conversation, China is about 2.5% of our global revenues and that's about half and half on U.S. and commercial. Now to take the commercial side first, we saw virtually no impact, even at the worst of the COVID crisis when everything was shut down in China on our commercial business. Obviously, some of the business that requires some face to face interactions like PMR, consulting and so on, obviously went to zero, but the rest of the business, the technology, the analytics, services continued pretty much intact. So we have no concerns there. On the R&DS the obvious concern if they were lock downs is our ability to access sites. Now, right now it's a fluid situation. We are tracking closely what's happening on the ground. We've seen some disruption to site access and patient visits, again mostly in Shanghai, because that's where the lock down has been limited to so far. It's hard to imagine that these are going to be prolonged for a very long time or expanded toward China, but again, we -- no one can tell. So that's where we are. Again, we are relatively confident outside China that when these things happen there we've learned how to deal with it with our remote capabilities and our ex-site development of decentralized trials, et cetera, we have become more adept and we are prepared to address those situations. We believe the same will be true if God forbid in China the situation were to deteriorate. But frankly, at this point, we haven\u2019t seen much, again this is the minimus and we haven\u2019t taken any adjustments or anything like that forecast for China. Any other comments guys? Okay thank you, Eric.\nEric Coldwell: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Shlomo Rosenbaum from Stifel. Your line is open, please ask your question. \nShlomo Rosenbaum: Hi, thank you very much for taking my questions. A quick question, just is the years revenue and profitability pacing the way that you expected as you entered the year? I mean obviously a little bit of change with Russia and stuff like that, just the second quarter guidance is a little bit lower than what the Street expected. Obviously the street does not have the insight into the pacing that you guys have at that level of detail and it could be that we just didn\u2019t get the same kind of COVID headwind roll off year-over-year and I just want to kind of start with that question and then I have one followup.\nAri Bousbib: Well, Shlomo thank you for your question, good morning. Look, I think Ron mentioned in his introductory remarks that last year's first half included the highest, the peak revenues from COVID. The second quarter will be the toughest compared year-over-year with COVID in. Right? The biggest step down, year-over-year of COVID revenue will be in the second quarter. That's one factor. Secondly, on a reported basis, if you look at, again, assuming FX rates remain where they are for the balance of the year, the worst comparisons year-over-year in terms of FX impact, are in the second quarter, okay? But the underlying businesses when you take these out, COVID and FX, you guys help me out with the numbers, yes second quarter is consistent with the rest of\u2026\nRon Bruehlman: Yes, very consistent. And that's why we're giving you ex-COVID constant currency organic, because that cleans out a lot of the items that cause the volatility that you're seeing. And really across the quarters of 2022, when you look at it on that basis, very consistent growth rate.\nAri Bousbib: So again, I mean, in TAS I can tell you the, what's built in our forecast and reflected in our guidance is due to constant currency organic growth, excluding COVID related work will be high single digits, so very consistent again with the first quarter. R&DS due to constant currency organic growth, excluding COVID will be upper teens. And CSMS will be low single digits, excluding COVID related work at again constant currency organic growth. So you're right on a reported basis the number with the actual COVID work included it looks a little choppy sequentially. But the reality is the underlying business is pretty consistent and pretty strong.\nShlomo Rosenbaum: Okay, great.\nRon Bruehlman: Yes and the other thing I would say Shlomo is that, that's pretty much in line with our guidance that we gave. I mean the, the linearity and how it's progressing over the quarter is exactly what we were expecting.\nShlomo Rosenbaum: Okay, perfect. Then this is another one for you Ari, just you have a really good history of being aggressive on share repurchases when the stock dips, and the stock is pulled back a lot. I mean, you know, at the Analysts Day you communicated being, and just, you know, actually more recently of having a lower leverage target in for a longer period of time. But would you consider taking up the leverage to take advantage of the stock price, given the fact that it seems like our trends in the business really haven't changed despite the changes in the stock price?\nAri Bousbib: My first inclination will be to do that, but very frankly, we're not going to do that. We can buy, you know, thankfully, there is a third factory you are articulating, which is our cash flow generation. And as you've seen, it's been pretty strong. And that allows us more flexibility and affords us the ability to do both, that is to maintain a lower leverage ratio and aggressively pursue share repurchases. You saw we bought for over $400 million in the first quarter. You know, frankly, there are time windows where we cannot buy. We reported earnings I think in February 15, and [Technical Difficulty] we be in the markets as we leverage a lot any level of time. So again, the answer to your question is, yes we will do aggressive share repurchases, but no we will not increase the leverage ratio.\nShlomo Rosenbaum: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jack Meehan from Nephron Research. Your line is open, please ask your question.\nJack Meehan: Thank you, and good morning. You know, one of the big debates for this year in the industry has also been labor. How did your wage and turnover trends compare to versus prior periods? Can you just comment on how you're managing through that?\nAri Bousbib: Yes, well look, it's interesting. We've, we're obviously experiencing the same trend that we've talked about before, which is given the strength of the industry backdrop, there's obviously competition for talent. And we are really, really actively recruiting and hiring to meet the incremental demand. We also saw like the rest of the industry attrition pick up towards the end. I think it has stabilized I would say over the past few weeks. We track these very carefully and look at it on a weekly basis. And it seems to have kind of plateaued and maybe even start to come down a little bit. Look we have employees and we recruit thousands of employees a year. So we do the talent acquisition capabilities to be able to meet this increased demand. And we have -- we actually it is fascinating back to the Ukraine situation, we are actually looking now at repositioning individuals from these countries, Russia, and also Ukraine, in different geographies, and utilize them in other places. So we are really literally our global footprint allows us a little bit more initiative. We are seeing some margin pressure from labor cost increases, but as we have the flexibility, again, because our global footprint to do some arbitrage and moving things around the world, to optimize our cost structure, we of course, have our ongoing, that's part of our DNA, you know, we are continuing. That's what we do day in day out productivity initiatives and cost optimization actions. Look, we've also increased rate cards on existing RFPs and we are looking for ways to pass along some of those cost increases into pricing where we can. So the combination of all of that, obviously, this is easier to do, the pricing level is easier on short cycle businesses and on the longer cycle businesses where we've already priced in some price escalations, but they don't always reflect the wage inflation that we actually see in the market. But again, the combination of all of these levers allows us to manage that situation fairly effectively. And by the way, all these cost pressures that I -- that we're talking about are already factored in our guidance. I also want to point out, I mean, maybe that's not my special series on that, but we paid in aggregate the highest ever level, dollar level of bonuses for 2021 to our employee population, in aggregate we continue to pay, I would set a very respectable a high level bonuses to our employees, even during the worst of the pandemic. And I think we've seen in our employee surveys, which we do pretty frequently, higher and higher satisfaction levels and loyalty to our company. You know, my understanding is not every one of our peers has done that. And in fact, we know specifically other peer that has paid zero or very little bonuses last year. So that also has created some employee Exodus at some other peer companies, and we're benefiting from that as well. So it's a complex situation. Wages are going up. There is attrition, and so on, so forth. But there are a lot of moving parts here, including competitive ones. And we feel confident that we can address these issues without changing anything in our guidance. Thanks for your question.\nJack Meehan: Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of John Sourbeer from UBS. Your line is open, please ask your question.\nJohn Sourbeer: Hi, thanks for taking my questions. I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit on the real world evidence business growth in the quarter and is this still going to be a double digit growth this year you going to -- may be some of the COVID work going away throughout the year?\nAri Bousbib: Okay. Well look, real world evidence, we saw strong growth. You saw that in TAS in general, organic constant currency revenue growth, excluding COVID was just over 10% in aggregate. And the high growth segments, as you pointed out, are real world evidence and of course, as you all know, Commercial Tech which continued to be strong drivers of growth. And I gave several examples, specific client examples of how in the commercial world and technology space, and real world evidence we are utilizing our unique capabilities. So, real world evidence is doing disclose the numbers here or not?\nRon Bruehlman: I mean, [indiscernible] there continues to high teen, growth driver excluding any COVID impacts. So the numbers we've been giving for real world have excluded that from the beginning. So that business has been consistently in the high to upper teens growth rates and we see that continue.\nAri Bousbib: Yes, exactly John. We see that continuing. To your last question, with respect to that COVID step down in revenue, which we've been talking about for a while now, we've always said during the height of the pandemic, that and this is true for real world, is true for commercial and certainly is extremely true for the R&DS business. COVID work essentially crowded out the rest of the business, because our clients understandably refocused their dollars on COVID, whether it's vaccines, or therapeutics, or what have you. But on the commercial side, government works to track and monitor COVID patients, et cetera and they turned to us. As you know, we had a very strong share of that market appropriately. And the concerns that some of you had expressed at that time is, well when that goes away then what happens? Well, we told you that that time that when that would go away, the base business would come back, because we knew that there were a lot of projects that have been essentially put on hold and that there was a lot of pent up demand that needed to be addressed and that's exactly what is happening. Exactly what is happening. Now that's true with real world evidence, it's true on the commercial side and it is true certainly in R&DS. Thank you.\nJohn Sourbeer: Thanks, I appreciate the color there and then just maybe one followup. As you are approaching around that 3.5 times levered, any thoughts on M&A and what areas or potential type of businesses would you be looking at if there were do those?\nAri Bousbib: Well, look, we always said we've gave guidance, we have done, and that's been consistent. By the way you can look at our record is between 1 and 2 points of our revenue top line growth over the long-term has been supplementing our organic growth. We make acquisitions within our core businesses when they are strategic and add capabilities or allow us to enter adjacent markets where we think we can add value. We have walked away, we do walk away from I want to say 90 plus percent of the companies we look at in the market. We always felt that valuations were very frothy, and that we did not want to, despite the rate environment so long we did not want to pay for assets more than what they were worth. And unfortunately, for those who did you now find yourself in an environment where valuations have taken a beating and now you've got a lot of private equity owned businesses that are very attractive, we would like to buy. But the entry points for those current owners at the time we did the acquisition was very high. And so, I just don't know how that -- it's going to take time. And because of that I am suggesting that we are going to -- if we were always cautious we are going to continue to be cautious now. Having said that, we will step up to the plate when the acquisition is extremely attractive, extremely accretive to our operations and our financials and we've done that in the quarter actually, we bought significant lab business, which is very attractive. And I believe that's the bulk of our acquisition spending that and correct, yes. And we like very much the lab business, as we discussed before. These are very strong and necessary capabilities and our lab business has been doing spectacular. We obviously, we look at CROs when they come up, but again, the valuation premiums on those assets have been out of reach for us. On the commercial side, we've bought technology companies and we will continue to look at the digital space. We've got, as you know, a strong interest in growing, in continue to grow on the commercial side, the commercial side is becoming increasingly sophisticated, with the go to market strategies of our clients becoming a lot more akin to how larger, consumer oriented businesses look at the world with much better, you see what our OCE suite, how our OCE ecosystem does with a lot of embedded intelligence is no longer -- we're not talking about a simple CRM point solution, as is the case for most of the competition, our system is an ongoing, live, with sophisticated AI analytics that enable the users to make decisions on a timely basis with respect to targeting the right customer at the right time with the right message. And so anything that complements or advances our position in the U.S. digital and European digital commercial spaces where it's most advanced, we will look at and we will be aggressive enough to enter those spaces and complement our capabilities. So that's what you know, I just gave you my overall strategic panorama here in terms of acquisitions.\nJohn Sourbeer: Thanks for taking the questions.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Luke Sergott from Barclays. Your line is open, please ask your question.\nLuke Sergott: Good morning. Thanks for the question here. Just a couple of cleanups. On the COVID step down into 2Q, remind us, I might have missed this one, can you remind us what you guys did in 2Q last year, and by the segments, just so we have an idea how that paces out ?\nRon Bruehlman: We have a combination of projects in the TAS segment, you'll recall, we did a lot of government work, which is stepping down as we go through this year. In the R&DS segment, we are working on some mega COVID vaccine studies and safety monitoring work and also therapeutics. But you know, we were involved in hundreds of different COVID related projects. So are you asking what type of work were we doing or revenue numbers?\nLuke Sergott: No, just the revenue. I was just trying to get a sense, I meant the numbers.\nRon Bruehlman: The numbers like I told you was, we did about $375 million and now are you talking in Q2 or Q1 now?\nLuke Sergott: Q2 last, I'm just trying to get a sense of the step down what you have the whole billion rolling off right?\nRon Bruehlman: And you can infer from the numbers we gave you on the conference call what Q1 was last year, which was, over $550 million and in Q2 it was slightly larger than that last year.\nLuke Sergott: That's helpful. That's exactly what I was looking for. All right. So and there's something here a little more strategic as you think about it. So I mean, when you guys came on after the merger, you started going after the fat tails of biotech, right and going after all the bookings. And so now when you're getting up to record booking levels 1.9 plus, are you guys at capacity of what your business can handle? And I guess it's more of a sense of, I understand it's hard just to add additional bodies given the tight labor market. So give us a sense of the type of work you're now taking on how that's changed. And if we should expect you know, the overall bookings to continue to climb or if this is kind of peak at your capacity right now?\nAri Bousbib: Well first of all I -- capacity we always is people driven in this business, as you know. But I would say if anything, certainly seems to merger. Our ability to take on more work with the same amount of people has increased significantly, because of our decentralized clinical trials capabilities. The increase in technology content, in data analytics, in process improvements that we've done since the merger is very dramatic. So our ability to take on more work with the same amount of people is significantly enhanced. So I don't see, frankly our turning away work, because somehow we don't have the capacity, we just don't do that. Again, with the minor exception of what I described before in my introductory comments, for pre-commercial EBPs, that knock at our door for assistance, and that don't qualify based on our rigorous vetting process. With that minor exception, we are able, willing, eager to take on any and all work. So certainly, I hope we continue assuming the underlying dynamics of the market continue to grow, which is, I think, a very, very valid assumption and a completely conservative expectation. And assuming that we continue to gain market share, which is also I think a conservative expectation. You should expect our bookings to continue to grow over the long-term, no question about it.\nLuke Sergott: Okay, thanks.\nAri Bousbib: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Donnelly from Citi. Your line is open, please ask your question.\nPatrick Donnelly: Hey, guys, thanks for the questions. Ari, I just wanted to circle back on EBP really helpful commentary during the script. I mean, it sounds like even if you did see some softening your business is diversified enough where the impact would be pretty negligible. But to date, you haven't seen anything. And just to clean up, I guess why you wouldn't be seeing it versus some competitors, like one yesterday, who called it out? Then coming down to your vetting process, you're maybe not taking on higher risk trials that others are and you think it comes down to kind of that process internally?\nAri Bousbib: Look, I don't know, I'm not going to speak for other competitors. I obviously people in the industry know, or have knowledge of what their peers focus on in terms of market segments. Look, from the beginning of this merger, we said we were going to be a lot more thorough in terms of what gets into our backlog. If you recall, we switched from \"awarded business\" to \"contracted business\", we became a lot more vigorous in terms of the specific booking analytics. I mean, again, I want to, I certainly hope you will never ever hear from us, God forbid it that we are making an adjustment to our bookings, because we are the some kind of some meteorites came from the cosmos and hit our backlog. You haven't heard that from us, quite the opposite. And so, we tell you what the numbers are, and those numbers are thoroughly and vigorously scrubbed. I repeat, we're not going to take it. There are many, we deal with our many clients that call or companies that call or [indiscernible] firms or they are lot of -- these are lot of biotech staff all over the world with high hopes and they'd love to have us help them and support them and they sometimes even want to leverage the fact that they are supported by a few IQVIA in order to raise money. And of course, we just don't do that. That's not our business. You know, that could be -- you know, it is often the case that an EBP at a very early stage with one molecules and high hopes and a nice looking management team, go around raising money and they come in with, at least an assertion that there is a CRO already involved and that has vetted their -- the scientific basis, et cetera. And the more credible the CRO, the better chances they have of raising money. Now we don't do that. It is simple. Others do. So that there are significant differences between how we do business. Someone asked earlier about capacity. And I said this is not going to be a capacity issue for us. But look, it's not that we are desperate for business, we have business, so we're not going to take on anyone. So I think that may be one difference. And as we said market segment focus, you have, Mike do you have any other comment?\nMike Fedock: Just to build on those comments. You know, in addition to the vetting on both the financial and scientific basis, the nature of work that we typically take in is in the later stage clinical timeframe, whereby there's a lot more I think, you know, historical data versus whether you're down feeling an EBP is mainly in the preclinical or first in inhuman space. So I think that's a that's another benefit to the [indiscernible].\nAri Bousbib: Thank you, and very important. \nPatrick Donnelly: Yep, now that's really helpful. I appreciate it.\nAri Bousbib: And then your first comment, frankly, was the right one, which is it's a very small part of our overall business, our company.\nPatrick Donnelly: Right, yes, understood. And then just a quick one Ari on the pricing environment. You know, what you see in there? I know that's a concern and biotech falls off, maybe pricing soften and it sounds like you guys still have nice power there. And on the back of that, any delay in terms of getting reimbursed on some of the shifting trials in Russia, Ukraine, just wondering, as you put in a change order, is there near-term margin pressure that then alleviates as you go through the year and get reimbursed? Just trying to figure that piece out as well? Thank you.\nAri Bousbib: Yes, yes, of course. But again, it's a small, small piece of the overall, and we are absorbing that cost. So we haven't changed our profit outlook and we are not planning to do that for now. There's no reason to do that. We can absorb it. We have enough initiatives. We are large enough, diversified enough that we can handle the Russia, Ukraine situation and disruption on clinical trials normal, so longer that's what, that it is what it is now. Okay?\nNick Childs: Thank you, Patrick. Thank you all for joining us today. We look forward to speaking to you again on our next earnings call. Myself and the team will be available for the rest of the day for any follow up questions, so feel free to reach out. I look forward to talking to everyone again soon. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Ron Bruehlman",
            "content": "Thanks, Ari, and good morning, everyone. Let's start by reviewing revenue. First quarter revenue of $3,568 million grew 4.7% on a reported basis and 6.8% at constant currency. In the quarter COVID related revenues were approximately $375 million to down about 35% versus the first quarter of 2021. In our base business, that is excluding all COVID related work from both this year and last, organic growth at constant currency was about 13%. Technology and Analytic Solutions revenue for the first quarter was $1,439 million, which was up 6.8% reported and 9.8% at constant currency. Excluding all COVID related work, organic growth at constant currency in Tech and Analytic Solutions was just over 10%. R&D Solutions first quarter revenue of $1,934 million was up 3.5% at actual FX rates and 4.7% at constant currency. Again, excluding all COVID related work, organic growth at constant currency in R&DS was approximately 17% which was consistent with our expectations. Contract Sales and Medical Solutions or CSMS first quarter revenue of $195 million grew 1% reported and 5.7% at constant currency. Excluding all COVID related work, organic growth at constant currency in CSMS was mid single digits. And let's move down the P&L now. Adjusted EBITDA was $812 million for the first quarter, which represented growth of 9.1% on a reported basis. First quarter GAAP net income was $325 million, that was up 53.3% year-over-year and GAAP diluted earnings per share with $1.68 up 54.1% year-over-year. Adjusted net income was $477 million for the quarter, up 12.2% year-over-year and adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 13.3% to $2.47. Now as already reviewed R&D Solutions delivered yet another outstanding quarter of net new business. Our backlog at March 31 stood at a record $25.3 billion, an increase of 9.1% year-over-year. Next 12 months revenue from backlog increased 8% year-over-year to just over $7 billion and I would note that both the backlog and next 12 months revenue numbers I just quoted were affected by FX rates at quarter end and that is to say they were lower than they otherwise would have been due to the strengthening of the dollar during the quarter. Okay, moving now to the balance sheet, first quarter cash flow from operations was $508 million and CapEx was $177 million. That resulted in free cash flow of $331 million and as a reminder, our free cash flow in the first quarter of each year is affected by the timing of annual bonus payments. At March 31, cash and cash equivalents totaled $1,387 million and gross debt was $12,637 million which resulted in net debt of $11,250 million. Our net leverage ratio at March 31 was 3.64 times trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA. In the quarter we repurchased $403 million of our shares, which leaves us with slightly over $2.1 billion of share repurchase authorization remaining under the current program. Now let's move to guidance. For the full year 2022, our expectation remains unchanged, that organic revenue growth excluding COVID related work will be low to mid teens at constant currency. Since February FX fluctuations have caused an incremental full year revenue headwind of over $200 million as of yesterday's rates. In addition, we currently estimate the revenue disruption from the Russia-Ukraine crisis to be in the $40 million to $50 million range. Accordingly, we are updating our revenue guidance range to reflect these two factors. For the full year, we now expect revenue to be between $14,450 million and $14,750 million, which represents year-over-year growth of 6.9 to 9%, at constant currency and 4.2% to 6.3% reported, both compared to 2021. Now as a reminder, in the revenue guidance we've provided in our Q4 call in February, we absorbed a $70 million FX headwind versus the initial guidance we provided at Analysts and Investor Conference in November. Objective revenue growth includes just over 150 basis points of contribution from M&A activity. Now, despite the macro factors that affected our revenue guidance, we're reaffirming our full year 2022 adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS guidance ranges that we provided on our fourth quarter 2021 earnings call. This includes absorbing the earnings impact of lost revenue in Russia and Ukraine as well as the costs that remain there such as salaries and assistance provided to employees. Accordingly, we continue to expect adjusted EBITDA to be between $3,330 million and $3,405 million representing year-over-year growth at 10.2% to 12.7% and we continue to expect adjusted diluted EPS to be between $9.95 and $10.25 or year-over-year growth at 10.2% to 13.5%. Now, our full year 2022 guidance ranges assume that foreign currency rates as of yesterday, April 26, remain in effect for the balance of the year. Moving on to second quarter guidance, I'll remind you that the first half of last year represented our peak for COVID related revenues, and as a result of that, the second quarter should be the toughest year-over-year compare in terms of revenues. So for the second quarter revenue is expected to be between $3,470 million and $3,520 million representing growth of 4.6% to 6% on a constant currency basis and 0.9% to 2.4% on a reported basis. Excluding COVID related work we expect organic revenue growth at constant currency to be in the low to mid teens, consistent with what we had in Q1 actuals and our projected full year revenue growth. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $790 million and $805 million, up 9.4% to 11.5% and adjusted diluted EPS is expected to be between $2.35 and $2.42, growing 10.3% to 13.6%. So to summarize, we delivered very strong first quarter results on both the top and bottom line against what had been a very strong first quarter of 2021. Our base business maintained low teens organic growth at constant currency, excluding COVID related work with double digit growth on this basis in both TAS and R&DS. Our R&DS bookings for business recorded its largest ever quarter of service bookings, contracted backlog exceeded $25 billion for the first time rising over 9% year-over-year with over $7 billion expected to convert to revenue over the next 12 months. We maintained our net leverage ratio at 3.6 times 12-month adjusted EBITDA on a trailing basis and finally most importantly, despite the turmoil around us, we remain very confident in our outlook and accordingly have maintained a full year 2022 profit guidance. So with that, let me hand it back over to the operator for our Q&A session. Yes, very consistent. And that's why we're giving you ex-COVID constant currency organic, because that cleans out a lot of the items that cause the volatility that you're seeing. And really across the quarters of 2022, when you look at it on that basis, very consistent growth rate. Yes and the other thing I would say Shlomo is that, that's pretty much in line with our guidance that we gave. I mean the, the linearity and how it's progressing over the quarter is exactly what we were expecting. I mean, [indiscernible] there continues to high teen, growth driver excluding any COVID impacts. So the numbers we've been giving for real world have excluded that from the beginning. So that business has been consistently in the high to upper teens growth rates and we see that continue. We have a combination of projects in the TAS segment, you'll recall, we did a lot of government work, which is stepping down as we go through this year. In the R&DS segment, we are working on some mega COVID vaccine studies and safety monitoring work and also therapeutics. But you know, we were involved in hundreds of different COVID related projects. So are you asking what type of work were we doing or revenue numbers? The numbers like I told you was, we did about $375 million and now are you talking in Q2 or Q1 now? And you can infer from the numbers we gave you on the conference call what Q1 was last year, which was, over $550 million and in Q2 it was slightly larger than that last year."

            "content": "Thank you, Nick and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining today to discuss our first quarter results. IQVIA has very strong financial results in the quarter and that is despite the broader macro environment. On this note, regarding first the tragic situation in the Ukraine, our thoughts and concerns from the beginning has been around the safety and well being of our employees, the patients we support and all those affected by the ongoing events. We've been actively supporting our employees and their families on the ground with evacuation support, relocation services and financial assistance. For example, we accelerated bonus payments and actually we continue to pay our employees there, regardless of their ability to perform any work. In addition, IQVIA capabilities are being utilized to help support the resulting refugee crisis. For example, Ukrainian refugees are entering surrounding countries with medicines and prescriptions and medical professionals in those countries are seeking to identify and convert product information on these prescriptions into their local equivalent. To help, we've established a free online service for medical professionals to search a product name, active ingredients, and strength, and the tool generates a list of matching products in whichever the local country around the Ukraine is. Also, we've been working very closely with our customers, suppliers and clinical sites across the region to ensure continuity of our in-flight clinical trials and ensure of course that our clients are able to continue to support the effective delivery of medicines to vulnerable patients in the region who depend on these medicines. In Ukraine we are providing support to ensure that trial patients who have begun receiving treatment remain on their treatment protocols. We have established direct to patient shipments of investigational medical products and patient call centers in order to ensure patient care can continue. In Russia, we are guided by ethical concerns to ensure the safety of patients already enrolled in clinical trials. We are utilizing our global logistics and procurement infrastructure to facilitate the movement of investigational medical products, lab kits, and samples into and out of the country to minimize potential adverse impacts to patient care. For studies that are in startup or early phase, in both countries, we are redirecting patient recruitment to other countries based on consultations with our customers. Even though a little less than 1% of our overall revenue and approximately 3% of our global patient recruitment come from the Ukraine and Russia, the operational disruptions I just described, will have some financial impact which we have incorporated into our updated guidance. Now, another key focus area for investors in the quarter, as you will know, has been the emerging biopharma funding environment. We received a number of questions on this topic since our earnings release in February and we have addressed those in multiple forums. However, there have been some lingering questions on the same topic and I want to take this opportunity once again to reiterate our comments with a specific focus, a) on the funding environment and b) on our own company's exposure to this EBP segment. I'll start by stating that the concern about EBP funding environment is overstated. I want to support the assertion with four key points. Number one, the industry has observed a slowdown in public funding compared to the record levels in 2020 and 2021, but the private venture capital markets have continued to be strong and funding in the first quarter of 2022 was the third highest ever according to the National Venture Capital Association. I will also observe that these EBP firms are seeking large amounts of cash from the very strong funding cycles in 2020 and 2021. Number two, when there is a reduction in EBP funding or the IPO market contracts, mid and large pharma companies often step up their acquisition activities of EBP companies and frankly, that benefits us as we have long-standing relationships with these customers. In fact, you may have seen the recent acquisition of Checkmate Pharmaceuticals by Regeneron, which illustrates this very point. Number three, history tells us that when EBP funding slows, it does not have a significant effect on our business. For example, following the last EBP funding slowdown in 2015, 2016, our IQVIA biotech unit saw no interruption in net new business and revenue growth, nor any unusual increase in cancellations. And finally, number four, when we look at either our pipeline or RFP activity, we have simply not seen any slowdown, no unusual cancellation activity, no unusual delays in decision making. In fact, in the quarter our overall R&DS RFP dollars were up 13% year-over-year, and RFP dollars from EBP were up over 16%. The broader industry continues to show strength. We're seeing clinical trials start up 7% in the first quarter compared to last year, with a 14% increase in oncology trial starts, which is a therapeutic area, as you well know, that's predominantly sponsored by EBP. Now, let me focus on our own exposure to the same, specifically three commercial EBPs, which are those EBPs that have zero revenue, and are the most vulnerable and exposed to the funding environment. And here I want to make another four points. Number one, as of March 31, pre-commercial EBPs represented just over 10% of our total R&DS backlog. Number two, less than 7% of our overall RFP dollars in the quarter came from pre-commercial EBP. Number three, this exposure to pre-commercial EBP for IQVIA is not only minimal, but also I want to point out and underline that our vetting process for taking on a pre-commercial EBP is extremely rigorous and thorough. The process includes, for example, a review of the clients cash balances, payment history, viability and quality of their science, and of course progress with clinical developments. So, again, said differently, not every EBP who knocks at our door with a molecule that they think is interesting, makes it into our battle. Number four, I will simply remind you that this exposure primarily impacts our R&DS segment. Approximately 45% of IQVIA's total company revenue comes from our commercial businesses. And as you know, there is virtually zero pre-commercial exposure on the commercial side. With those kind of a background, let me now delve into the first quarter results. Revenue for the first quarter grew 4.7% on a reported basis and 6.8% at constant currency. The $23 million beat above the midpoint of our guidance range was driven by strong operational performance across all three segments. And that was of course partially offset by foreign exchange headwinds. Compared to prior year and excluding COVID related work for both years, our core businesses grew about 13% at constant currency on an organic basis. Ron will provide additional detail in his remarks, including COVID adjusted numbers for each of our three segments. First quarter adjusted EBITDA grew 9.1% reflecting our revenue growth, as well as ongoing productivity initiatives. First quarter adjusted diluted EPS of $2.47 grew 13.3%, that was 4% above the midpoint of our guide, which is with about $0.03 of the beat coming from operational improvements. I'll now provide an update on the business and let's start with the commercial and technology side. We've spoken before and you're familiar with IQVIA's connected intelligence framework, which leverages our advanced analytics technology and domain expertise across the entire clinical and commercial portfolio and has been critical in supporting the emerging needs of the pharma industry. I want to give a recent example of how these capabilities are being deployed. In the quarter we entered into a multiyear agreement with Argenx for the development and commercialization of new indications for their rare disease product currently approved for treatments of a rare autoimmune disorder affecting the muscles. Our collaboration with Argenx incorporates IQVIA's Connected Intelligence to support clinical development, real world evidence, regulatory and commercial support to accelerate the development of this product for potential treatment of other severe autoimmune diseases and to expand globally. This is an exciting product with a lot of upside potential. It's currently approved for three -- six indications, has the potential for up to 15 indications. Plus this drug has already been launched in the U.S. and has plans to launch in Europe and in Japan in the next year. Another example of a client selecting IQVIA's integrated capabilities to solve complex problems is [indiscernible], a European pharma client recently selected IQVIA's Vigilance Platform and Regulatory Information Management Technology. This is an area that's a real headache for our clients. And our technology solutions simplify and streamline our processes. [Indiscernible] will benefit from our technology's integrated AI ML capabilities, automation of labor-heavy activities, and easy implementation. To date, over 150 clients have adopted one or more solutions within our safety, regulatory and four different [ph] suites of technologies. In the real world evidence, I'm sure you've seen that we were selected to support DARWIN, or Data Analysis and Real World Interrogation Network. DARWIN is a strategic initiative of the EMA. This is a major win for IQVIA as it draws on our proprietary technologies, methods and deep scientific and operational expertise. It will help us deepen our relationship with healthcare providers and sites across Europe. Moving to Clinical Technology, IQVIA continues to lead the industry in decentralized clinical trials. Our end-to-end solution of integrated technology and services capabilities are being utilized on just over one third of our full service trials globally. Today, we've recruited over 300,000 patients across 80 countries, covering over 30 indications. Now, whether for traditional or decentralized trials, demand for our suite of digital clinical technology offerings continued to increase during the first quarter. To date, over 400 clients have adopted one or more modules within our Orchestrated Clinical Technology suite since launch. One of these key modules for example, is our clinical trial payments solution. This technology ensures accurate, timely and transparent investigator payment processing. It is a key driver of both site and sponsors satisfaction. Four of the top 10 and 25 of the top 30 pharma clients have now selected IQVIA's payment technology solution for their trials. This includes a major award in the quarter with a top 10 sponsor to migrate their entire payment ecosystem across several legacy platforms to our technology. The scale of this technology migration is the largest of its kind in the industry and it encompasses 120 clinical studies across all phases, with over 6000 sites globally. Beyond these client highlights, our overall R&DS businesses continued to see strong momentum in the quarter, delivering over $2.5 billion of net new business, including pass-throughs. This included a record quarter of over $1.9 billion of services bookings, resulting in the first quarter of contracted net book-to-bill ratio of 1.32, excluding pass-throughs and 1.31 including pass-throughs. Over the last 12 months our contracted net book-to-bill ratio was 1.33 excluding pass-throughs and 1.32 including pass-throughs. Our contracted backlog in R&DS grew 9.1% year-over-year to a record $25.3 billion as of March 31, 2022. As a result, our next 12 months revenue from backlog increased to over $7 billion growing 8% from a year ago. As you can see there is a lot of strong positive momentum across the business, regardless of the choppy macro environment. On a final note, IQVIA was named the top CRO in overall reputation by clinical trial sites around the world in the 2021 CenterWatch's Global Site Benchmark Survey. This is a big deal for us. This is a rigorous and independent survey, that is highly respected in the industry. Over 60,000 investigators, trial coordinators, research nurses, and other clinical professionals representing clinical trial sites from around the world were asked to rank and score 29 CROs across 35 performance related attributes. We are proud to have been selected and named the top CRO in overall reputation and specifically, we received high marks, especially high marks for our comprehensive decentralized trials, direct to patient recruitment, and therapeutic clinical regulatory and technology expertise. I will now turn it over to Ron for more details on our financial performance. Ron? Thank you. Good morning, Eric and thanks for your questions. On the first one, Ukraine, well Ukraine actually is like we're not even 1% or above 1% of our revenue a little less. So call it $130 million, $140 million, let's say. And, obviously, it's a significant displacement and the world that cannot be done primarily in R&DS. I might point out some of that may come back, some of the trial obviously needs to continue and will be delayed. It just takes time and because of the disruption, or you want to answer specifically, the question on the how much per quarter? We said it's -- we sized it at $40 million to $50 million, right? So it's less than a proportion of impact in Q1, obviously, because the conflict didn't start until late February. So we had a few million dollars of impact in Q1, not a huge impact. You're right, Eric, that it's probably that $40 million to 50 million is probably front end loaded in the year, because we should recapture a little bit as we get late in the year and we start shifting work. But that always takes longer than you think it's going to take. So, you know, we're not assuming a huge recovery of work in 2022, but ultimately, as we find new patients and move the clinical trial activity outside of Russia and Ukraine, we should recover a lot of that you know in probably back end of the year or early next. Now with respect to China, just to situate the conversation, China is about 2.5% of our global revenues and that's about half and half on U.S. and commercial. Now to take the commercial side first, we saw virtually no impact, even at the worst of the COVID crisis when everything was shut down in China on our commercial business. Obviously, some of the business that requires some face to face interactions like PMR, consulting and so on, obviously went to zero, but the rest of the business, the technology, the analytics, services continued pretty much intact. So we have no concerns there. On the R&DS the obvious concern if they were lock downs is our ability to access sites. Now, right now it's a fluid situation. We are tracking closely what's happening on the ground. We've seen some disruption to site access and patient visits, again mostly in Shanghai, because that's where the lock down has been limited to so far. It's hard to imagine that these are going to be prolonged for a very long time or expanded toward China, but again, we -- no one can tell. So that's where we are. Again, we are relatively confident outside China that when these things happen there we've learned how to deal with it with our remote capabilities and our ex-site development of decentralized trials, et cetera, we have become more adept and we are prepared to address those situations. We believe the same will be true if God forbid in China the situation were to deteriorate. But frankly, at this point, we haven't seen much, again this is the minimus and we haven't taken any adjustments or anything like that forecast for China. Any other comments guys? Okay thank you, Eric. Well, Shlomo thank you for your question, good morning. Look, I think Ron mentioned in his introductory remarks that last year's first half included the highest, the peak revenues from COVID. The second quarter will be the toughest compared year-over-year with COVID in. Right? The biggest step down, year-over-year of COVID revenue will be in the second quarter. That's one factor. Secondly, on a reported basis, if you look at, again, assuming FX rates remain where they are for the balance of the year, the worst comparisons year-over-year in terms of FX impact, are in the second quarter, okay? But the underlying businesses when you take these out, COVID and FX, you guys help me out with the numbers, yes second quarter is consistent with the rest of... So again, I mean, in TAS I can tell you the, what's built in our forecast and reflected in our guidance is due to constant currency organic growth, excluding COVID related work will be high single digits, so very consistent again with the first quarter. R&DS due to constant currency organic growth, excluding COVID will be upper teens. And CSMS will be low single digits, excluding COVID related work at again constant currency organic growth. So you're right on a reported basis the number with the actual COVID work included it looks a little choppy sequentially. But the reality is the underlying business is pretty consistent and pretty strong. My first inclination will be to do that, but very frankly, we're not going to do that. We can buy, you know, thankfully, there is a third factory you are articulating, which is our cash flow generation. And as you've seen, it's been pretty strong. And that allows us more flexibility and affords us the ability to do both, that is to maintain a lower leverage ratio and aggressively pursue share repurchases. You saw we bought for over $400 million in the first quarter. You know, frankly, there are time windows where we cannot buy. We reported earnings I think in February 15, and [Technical Difficulty] we be in the markets as we leverage a lot any level of time. So again, the answer to your question is, yes we will do aggressive share repurchases, but no we will not increase the leverage ratio. Yes, well look, it's interesting. We've, we're obviously experiencing the same trend that we've talked about before, which is given the strength of the industry backdrop, there's obviously competition for talent. And we are really, really actively recruiting and hiring to meet the incremental demand. We also saw like the rest of the industry attrition pick up towards the end. I think it has stabilized I would say over the past few weeks. We track these very carefully and look at it on a weekly basis. And it seems to have kind of plateaued and maybe even start to come down a little bit. Look we have employees and we recruit thousands of employees a year. So we do the talent acquisition capabilities to be able to meet this increased demand. And we have -- we actually it is fascinating back to the Ukraine situation, we are actually looking now at repositioning individuals from these countries, Russia, and also Ukraine, in different geographies, and utilize them in other places. So we are really literally our global footprint allows us a little bit more initiative. We are seeing some margin pressure from labor cost increases, but as we have the flexibility, again, because our global footprint to do some arbitrage and moving things around the world, to optimize our cost structure, we of course, have our ongoing, that's part of our DNA, you know, we are continuing. That's what we do day in day out productivity initiatives and cost optimization actions. Look, we've also increased rate cards on existing RFPs and we are looking for ways to pass along some of those cost increases into pricing where we can. So the combination of all of that, obviously, this is easier to do, the pricing level is easier on short cycle businesses and on the longer cycle businesses where we've already priced in some price escalations, but they don't always reflect the wage inflation that we actually see in the market. But again, the combination of all of these levers allows us to manage that situation fairly effectively. And by the way, all these cost pressures that I -- that we're talking about are already factored in our guidance. I also want to point out, I mean, maybe that's not my special series on that, but we paid in aggregate the highest ever level, dollar level of bonuses for 2021 to our employee population, in aggregate we continue to pay, I would set a very respectable a high level bonuses to our employees, even during the worst of the pandemic. And I think we've seen in our employee surveys, which we do pretty frequently, higher and higher satisfaction levels and loyalty to our company. You know, my understanding is not every one of our peers has done that. And in fact, we know specifically other peer that has paid zero or very little bonuses last year. So that also has created some employee Exodus at some other peer companies, and we're benefiting from that as well. So it's a complex situation. Wages are going up. There is attrition, and so on, so forth. But there are a lot of moving parts here, including competitive ones. And we feel confident that we can address these issues without changing anything in our guidance. Thanks for your question. Okay. Well look, real world evidence, we saw strong growth. You saw that in TAS in general, organic constant currency revenue growth, excluding COVID was just over 10% in aggregate. And the high growth segments, as you pointed out, are real world evidence and of course, as you all know, Commercial Tech which continued to be strong drivers of growth. And I gave several examples, specific client examples of how in the commercial world and technology space, and real world evidence we are utilizing our unique capabilities. So, real world evidence is doing disclose the numbers here or not? Yes, exactly John. We see that continuing. To your last question, with respect to that COVID step down in revenue, which we've been talking about for a while now, we've always said during the height of the pandemic, that and this is true for real world, is true for commercial and certainly is extremely true for the R&DS business. COVID work essentially crowded out the rest of the business, because our clients understandably refocused their dollars on COVID, whether it's vaccines, or therapeutics, or what have you. But on the commercial side, government works to track and monitor COVID patients, et cetera and they turned to us. As you know, we had a very strong share of that market appropriately. And the concerns that some of you had expressed at that time is, well when that goes away then what happens? Well, we told you that that time that when that would go away, the base business would come back, because we knew that there were a lot of projects that have been essentially put on hold and that there was a lot of pent up demand that needed to be addressed and that's exactly what is happening. Exactly what is happening. Now that's true with real world evidence, it's true on the commercial side and it is true certainly in R&DS. Thank you. Well, look, we always said we've gave guidance, we have done, and that's been consistent. By the way you can look at our record is between 1 and 2 points of our revenue top line growth over the long-term has been supplementing our organic growth. We make acquisitions within our core businesses when they are strategic and add capabilities or allow us to enter adjacent markets where we think we can add value. We have walked away, we do walk away from I want to say 90 plus percent of the companies we look at in the market. We always felt that valuations were very frothy, and that we did not want to, despite the rate environment so long we did not want to pay for assets more than what they were worth. And unfortunately, for those who did you now find yourself in an environment where valuations have taken a beating and now you've got a lot of private equity owned businesses that are very attractive, we would like to buy. But the entry points for those current owners at the time we did the acquisition was very high. And so, I just don't know how that -- it's going to take time. And because of that I am suggesting that we are going to -- if we were always cautious we are going to continue to be cautious now. Having said that, we will step up to the plate when the acquisition is extremely attractive, extremely accretive to our operations and our financials and we've done that in the quarter actually, we bought significant lab business, which is very attractive. And I believe that's the bulk of our acquisition spending that and correct, yes. And we like very much the lab business, as we discussed before. These are very strong and necessary capabilities and our lab business has been doing spectacular. We obviously, we look at CROs when they come up, but again, the valuation premiums on those assets have been out of reach for us. On the commercial side, we've bought technology companies and we will continue to look at the digital space. We've got, as you know, a strong interest in growing, in continue to grow on the commercial side, the commercial side is becoming increasingly sophisticated, with the go to market strategies of our clients becoming a lot more akin to how larger, consumer oriented businesses look at the world with much better, you see what our OCE suite, how our OCE ecosystem does with a lot of embedded intelligence is no longer -- we're not talking about a simple CRM point solution, as is the case for most of the competition, our system is an ongoing, live, with sophisticated AI analytics that enable the users to make decisions on a timely basis with respect to targeting the right customer at the right time with the right message. And so anything that complements or advances our position in the U.S. digital and European digital commercial spaces where it's most advanced, we will look at and we will be aggressive enough to enter those spaces and complement our capabilities. So that's what you know, I just gave you my overall strategic panorama here in terms of acquisitions. Well first of all I -- capacity we always is people driven in this business, as you know. But I would say if anything, certainly seems to merger. Our ability to take on more work with the same amount of people has increased significantly, because of our decentralized clinical trials capabilities. The increase in technology content, in data analytics, in process improvements that we've done since the merger is very dramatic. So our ability to take on more work with the same amount of people is significantly enhanced. So I don't see, frankly our turning away work, because somehow we don't have the capacity, we just don't do that. Again, with the minor exception of what I described before in my introductory comments, for pre-commercial EBPs, that knock at our door for assistance, and that don't qualify based on our rigorous vetting process. With that minor exception, we are able, willing, eager to take on any and all work. So certainly, I hope we continue assuming the underlying dynamics of the market continue to grow, which is, I think, a very, very valid assumption and a completely conservative expectation. And assuming that we continue to gain market share, which is also I think a conservative expectation. You should expect our bookings to continue to grow over the long-term, no question about it. Thank you. Look, I don't know, I'm not going to speak for other competitors. I obviously people in the industry know, or have knowledge of what their peers focus on in terms of market segments. Look, from the beginning of this merger, we said we were going to be a lot more thorough in terms of what gets into our backlog. If you recall, we switched from \"awarded business\" to \"contracted business\", we became a lot more vigorous in terms of the specific booking analytics. I mean, again, I want to, I certainly hope you will never ever hear from us, God forbid it that we are making an adjustment to our bookings, because we are the some kind of some meteorites came from the cosmos and hit our backlog. You haven't heard that from us, quite the opposite. And so, we tell you what the numbers are, and those numbers are thoroughly and vigorously scrubbed. I repeat, we're not going to take it. There are many, we deal with our many clients that call or companies that call or [indiscernible] firms or they are lot of -- these are lot of biotech staff all over the world with high hopes and they'd love to have us help them and support them and they sometimes even want to leverage the fact that they are supported by a few IQVIA in order to raise money. And of course, we just don't do that. That's not our business. You know, that could be -- you know, it is often the case that an EBP at a very early stage with one molecules and high hopes and a nice looking management team, go around raising money and they come in with, at least an assertion that there is a CRO already involved and that has vetted their -- the scientific basis, et cetera. And the more credible the CRO, the better chances they have of raising money. Now we don't do that. It is simple. Others do. So that there are significant differences between how we do business. Someone asked earlier about capacity. And I said this is not going to be a capacity issue for us. But look, it's not that we are desperate for business, we have business, so we're not going to take on anyone. So I think that may be one difference. And as we said market segment focus, you have, Mike do you have any other comment? Thank you, and very important. And then your first comment, frankly, was the right one, which is it's a very small part of our overall business, our company. Yes, yes, of course. But again, it's a small, small piece of the overall, and we are absorbing that cost. So we haven't changed our profit outlook and we are not planning to do that for now. There's no reason to do that. We can absorb it. We have enough initiatives. We are large enough, diversified enough that we can handle the Russia, Ukraine situation and disruption on clinical trials normal, so longer that's what, that it is what it is now. Okay?"

Actual results could differ materially from those stated or implied by forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties associated with the company's business, which are discussed in the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings. In addition, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures on this call, which should be considered a supplement to and not a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the comparable GAAP measures is included in the press release and conference call presentation. I would now like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO.\nAri Bousbib: Thank you, Nick, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today to discuss our 2023 results. You saw that we had a good quarter. Let me start the call by sharing the latest of what we are seeing in our end markets, along with our key accomplishments for 2023. On the clinical side, demand from our R&DS clients remained strong. Net new bookings for the quarter exceeded $2.8 billion, the second largest quarter in IQVIA history, representing a quarterly book-to-bill of 1.31. Our quarterly RFP flow was up 13% year-over-year, driven by EBP and large pharma. Our qualified pipeline grew double-digits versus prior year. Emerging biotech funding was strong. According to BioWorld, fourth quarter EBP funding was $21.6 billion, the highest quarter in the last two years continuing the sequential improvement we've seen throughout the year. For the full year, EBP funding for 2023 was $70.9 billion, up 17% versus the prior year, and that represents the largest year on record, if we exclude the outlier years of 2020 and 2021, when there was dramatic outstanding due to COVID. As we close 2023, we're proud of what we have achieved in R&DS. The business booked $10.7 billion of net new business, including record high service bookings of $8.4 billion. Our backlog stands at $29.7 billion, and that's up 9% year-over-year. The business added nearly 400 net new customers in the year. We made great progress with our clinical research strategies. We significantly expanded our R&D site network and management organization through strategic acquisitions that offer clinical research coordination study feasibility and patient recruitment capability. We further expanded the capabilities of the lab business through the launch of a new synthetic antibody discovery offering, which is differentiated from the traditional animal-derived antibodies that are used by our competitors. And we partnered with the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, CEPI, who enhance the world's ability to rapidly conduct clinical research for vaccines and other biological countermeasures against emerging infectious diseases in underdeveloped countries. Turning to TAS. The commercial side of our business continues, of course, to face the macro environment that we've described in the past as our clients remain cautious with their spending and their cost containment. Our results in the quarter were slightly better than what we had expected. Although, discretionary spending has not yet rebounded to the levels that we expect, they will, and it continues to be a headwind. Fundamentally, leading market indicators do point to an upcoming improvement. For instance, the FDA approved 55 new molecules in 2023 and that's almost 50% more than the prior year and it is the highest level since 2018. The spend on new drug launches by our pharma clients is expected to be over $190 billion over the next five years. That's up over 25% compared to the prior five-year period. Frankly, in our own engagement with customers in the recent past, we noted an improved customer sentiment during the quarter. In fact, the pipeline of opportunities remains strong even as decision time lines remain elongated and negotiations more difficult similar to what we indicated last quarter. Based on these dynamics, we continue to expect demand to pick up, but not before the second half of the year. And as a result, we may see the 2024 sequential short trend for TAS to be the inverse of what we experienced in 2023. We might see revenue growth in the first quarter that resembles the growth of the fourth quarter of 2023 and grow to gradually improve as we move to the back end of the year. Now despite more difficult macro environment, the TAS business had some significant achievements in 2023. We continued expanding our commercial technology and analytics offerings. We, in fact, added 33 new clients on our OCE technology platform. We successfully launched a new software platform, which tracks the performance of 1.6 million drugs covering 600 diseases across 93 countries. We successfully introduced a first-in-kind med tech consumption offering that supports the complex journey that medical devices take as they travel from manufacturer to health care providers. And we acquired a quality metric to extend our suite of patient health measurement tools using clinical outcome assessments and patient reported outcomes. Let me now turn to the results for the quarter. Revenue for the fourth quarter grew 3.5% on a reported basis and 2.6% at constant currency compared to last year and excluding COVID-related work from both periods, we grew the top line approximately 6% on a constant currency basis, including approximately 1.5 points of contribution from acquisitions. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA increased 5%, reflecting our ongoing cost management discipline. Fourth quarter adjusted diluted EPS of $2.84 faced the continuing headwind of the step-up in interest expense and the UK corporate tax rate increase. Excluding the impact of these items, our adjusted diluted EPS growth was 11%. Now, a few highlights of this business activity this quarter. Let's start with TAS. The midsized pharma client awarded IQVIA, a four-year outsourcing program to support their life cycle strategy of converting established brands to over-the-counter sales in more than 40 countries. Similarly, IQVIA won a four-year contract with a large pharma client to provide global market intelligence via a single globally accessible source of commercial data. In the quarter, we won a significant contract with a large pharma in the dermatology, rheumatology and oncology therapeutic areas. This program will allow our clients to access detailed prescribing patterns in local markets, and enhanced HCP targeting in 18 countries. The CDC selected IQVIA to provide comprehensive monitoring services following the end of the COVID public health emergency status. IQVIA will support the CDC in analyzing data in near real time. On the respiratory virus response, including for influenza and RSV, identifying at-risk groups and improving overall population health. In the quarter, our Patient Services business, which is showing faster growth within our past segment, secured a significant contract with a large pharma that includes adherence monitoring, co-pay support and at-home treatment administration. In our real-world business, the National Health Service of England awarded IQVIA, a large contract to deploy our privacy technology and to enable the NHS efforts to ensure the highest standards of patient data governance and privacy controls. Moving to RDS, a top 5 pharma client selected IQVIA as a key clinical FSP provider. Noteworthy here is that, a competitor of ours had been the 100% sole provider previously. This partnership will help the client improve clinical trial oversight and manage costs more effectively. In Q4, another top 5 clients awarded IQVIA a full-service Phase 2 study on ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig's disease. IQVIA was selected due to our vast expertise in ALS disease as well as our faster recruitment time lines. In the quarter, a biotech client selected IQVIA to conduct a complex trial for a promising cell and gene therapy targeting myositis, which is an autoimmune disease. We were selected due to our AI capabilities that allow us to identify sites and develop an innovative trial strategy. Also in the quarter, IQVIA expanded its partnership with a major pharma company by securing six new global oncology trials, consisting of a mix of early and late-stage trials. We were chosen due to our expertise in oncology and our ability to efficiently manage large complex trials. A leading biotech firm, selected IQVIA to conduct a program comprised of three initial stage studies in cancer research. The client is expanding from local to global development and needed a large-scale partner like IQVIA. In Q4, IQVIA was awarded a major contract from a top 10 global pharma to become its primary pharmacovigilance platform provider. This multiyear program includes replacing their legacy systems with IQVIA's drug safety monitoring technology which uses generative AI capability to automatically extract adverse event information from unstructured data sources. Finally, and before I turn it to Ron for a detailed financial review, I would like to take the opportunity to acknowledge and congratulate our employees around the world for the nice recognition the company just received. For the seventh consecutive year, IQVIA was named one of the world's most admired companies in Fortune's annual survey. And for the third year in a row, IQVIA was named the number one most admired company in our category. Lastly, before turning it over to Ron, I'd like to specifically mention the prestigious recognition received by Christina Mack one of IQVIA's senior leaders, who is the Chief Scientific Officer for our real-world business. Christina was named 2023 PharmaVoice 100 honorary, is a peer-recognized industry-wide honor. We are very proud at IQVIA of Christina's work and our passion for accelerating innovation in health care through the use of evidence-based decision-making. Let me now turn it to Ron for our financial review.\nRonald Bruehlman: Okay. Thanks, Ari, and good morning, everyone. Let's start by reviewing revenue. Fourth quarter revenue of$3.868 billion grew 3.5% on a reported basis and 2.6% constant currency. In the quarter, COVID-related revenues were approximately $65 million, which was down about $125 million versus the fourth quarter of 2022. Now excluding all COVID related work from both this year and last, constant currency growth was approximately 6%. And as Ari mentioned, acquisitions contributed about 150 basis points of this growth. Technology & Analytics Solutions revenue for the fourth quarter was $1.531 billion, up 2.1% reported and 1.3% constant currency. Excluding all COVID-related work, constant currency growth in TAS was 4%. R&D Solutions fourth quarter revenue of $2.151 billion was up 4.5% reported and 3.7% at constant currency and excluding all COVID related where constant currency growth and R&DS was 9% in the quarter. Finally, Contract Sales and Medical Solutions or CSMS fourth quarter revenue of $186 million grew 2.2% reported and 1.7% at constant currency. For the full year, revenue was $14.984 billion, growing at 4% on a reported basis and 4.1% at constant currency. COVID-related revenues totaled approximately $420 million for the year. Excluding all COVID-related work from both years, constant currency growth was 9%. Full year Technology & Analytics Solutions revenue was $5.862 billion, up 2% reported, 2.1% at constant currency and excluding all COVID-related work, growth at constant currency in TAS was 6%. In R&D Solutions full year revenue was $8.395 billion, growing 6%, both on a reported and a constant currency basis, and excluding all COVID-related work, growth at constant currency in R&DS was 13%. Finally, in CSMS revenue for the full year was $727 million, which was down 2.2% reported and 0.3% at constant currency. Okay. Moving down to P&L. Adjusted EBITDA was $966 million for the fourth quarter. That represented 5% growth, while full year adjusted EBITDA was $3.569 billion, which was up 6.7% year-over-year. Fourth quarter GAAP net income was $469 million and GAAP diluted earnings per share was $2.54. For the full year, GAAP net income was $1.358 billion, or $7.29 of earnings per diluted share. Adjusted net income was $523 million for the fourth quarter and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $2.84. For the full year, adjusted net income was $1.901 billion in adjusted diluted EPS was $10.20. Excluding the year-over-year impact of the step-up in interest rates and the increase in the UK corporate tax rate, adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 11% in the fourth quarter and 12% for the full year. Now it's already reviewed, R&D Solutions delivered another really strong quarter of bookings. Our backlog at December 31 stood at a record $29.7 billion. That's up 9.2% year-over-year and 31% over the last three years. Okay. Let's turn to the balance sheet. As of December 31, cash and cash equivalents totaled $1.376 billion and gross debt was $13.673 billion. And due to the math that results in net debt of $12.297 billion, our net leverage ratio at year-end was 3.45 times trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA. Fourth quarter cash flow from operations was $747 million and capital expenditures was $179 million, which resulted in free cash flow of $568 million for the quarter. Now in the quarter, we repurchased $229 million of our shares at an average price of $1.95 per share bringing our full year share repurchase activity to just slightly below $1 billion. This leaves us with just under $2.4 billion of share repurchase authorization remaining under the current program. Now as you know, coming out of the merger, we took advantage of the low interest rate environment and deployed a significant amount of capital for internal investments, acquisitions and share repurchases, which were quite accretive for our shareholders. Now, over that period, our net interest expense was relatively steady at around $400 million per year, but at the end of 2022 and through the middle of 2023, we experienced a rapid and unprecedented rise in interest rates, which drove annual interest expense, up by almost $0.25 billion causing our adjusted EPS to be just slightly over flat in 2023. Now, as you saw in November, we successfully refinanced approximately $2.75 billion of our near-term debt maturities. The strong demand for IQVIA debt that we experienced allowed us to tighten pricing and lock in an average fixed rate below 4.9% for those issuances after swaps. This refinancing extended approximately $2.75 billion of maturities to 2029 and 2031 and we reduced our interest rate risk exposure by locking in over 80% of our debt at fixed rates. With this refinancing, we now expect net interest expense to be approximately $650 million in 2024. Now, the forward curves point to a reduction in rates in the future. We've included the current market consensus in our 2024 guidance. Further reductions would lower our net interest expense more on our variable rate debt and potentially open opportunities to refinance additional debt in the future. Now let's go to our 2024 guidance, which I'll review in detail. For the full year, we expect total revenue to be between $15.400 billion and $15.650 billion, this includes approximately $300 million of a step-down in COVID-related work year-over-year and about 100 basis points of contribution from M&A activity and further FX headwind of approximately 50 basis points versus 2023. Our adjusted EBITDA guidance is $3.700 billion to $3.800 billion. Our adjusted diluted EPS guidance is $10.95 to $11.25. Now this guidance includes about $650 million of interest expense. Approximately $580 million of operational depreciation and amortization expense, an effective income tax rate, just under 20% and an average diluted share count of approximately 184 million shares. This guidance also assumes about $2 billion deployment split evenly between acquisitions and share repurchase. Finally, our guidance assumes that foreign currency rates as of February 12 continue for the balance of the year. Now at the segment level, we expect TAS revenue to be between $6 billion and $6.2 billion. Q1 2023 was the last quarter that we had significant COVID-related revenues in TAS. So the COVID step down in TAS will be minimal for the balance of the year. As already mentioned, the guidance now anticipates an improvement in our commercial business towards the back end of the year, which will still result in a year-over-year growth of low to mid-single-digits. R&DS revenue is expected to be between $8.7 billion and $8.8 billion. This guidance includes almost the entire $300 million step down in COVID-related revenue. And that represents approximately 350 basis points of headwind to the R&DS growth rate. The guidance also reflects the latest phasing of pass-through revenue which results in an additional headwind of approximately 100 basis points to R&DS year-over-year. Adjusting for the COVID step-down in the pass-through headwind, R&DS revenue growth in 2024 is expected to remain in the high single-digits. CSMS revenue is expected to be approximately $700 million, which is down slightly year-over-year. Now, let's review the first quarter guidance. For the first quarter, we expect revenue to be between $3.650 billion and $3.725 billion. The decline in COVID-related work is weighted towards the beginning of the year with the largest impact in Q1. Also, we expect mark conditions and TAS to recover only in the back half of the year, as we've said. Adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter is expected to be between $850 million and $870 million, and adjusted diluted EPS is expected to be between $2.45 and $2.55. Now keep in mind that Q1 is the toughest comparison for adjusted diluted EPS due to the interest rate increases we saw throughout 2023. As we mentioned, our guidance assumes that foreign currency rates as of February 12 continue for the balance of the year. So let's summarize. Q4 was another strong quarter. R&DS delivered the second largest booking quarter in IQVIA history at over $2.8 billion, along with another quarter of double-digit RFC growth. For the full year of 2023, revenue grew 9% at constant currency, excluding COVID-related work. Our EBITDA margin expanded by 60 basis points and adjusted diluted EPS was up 12% you exclude the year-over-year impact of interest rates and the increase in the UK tax rate. Free cash flow was strong in the quarter at $568 million, representing 109% of adjusted net income. IQVIA was named to Fortune's 2023 list of the World's most Admired Companies for the seventh consecutive year and earned the first place ranking within our industry group for the third consecutive year. And lastly, we issued full year 2024 guidance with underlying revenue growth of 5% to 7%, continued margin expansion and a resumption of EPS growth with adjusted diluted earnings per share expected to be up 7% to 10%. Now, before we open the call to Q&A, I'd like to make you aware of the leadership change within IQVIA's finance organization, Nick Childs, who has led our Investor Relations and treasury functions very ably for the past three years, is moving on to become CFO of our North American business. He will be succeeded by Kerry Joseph, who has served as CFO of that business unit for the past five years. Kerry, who is a member of the global finance leadership team has had many finance roles of increasing responsibility during his 20-plus years with the company. Kerry and Nick have already been working together to transition responsibilities and Kerry will join Nick on our follow-up calls this quarter, so you all have a chance to meet them. Now, with that, let me hand it back over to the operator to begin our Q&A session.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Anne Samuel from JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nAnne Samuel: Hi, guys. Congrats on the great present and thanks for taking the question. My first question was just on TAS. You spoke to expectations for a back half recovery in this business. It seems like based on your comments and some of those from others at our recent conference that others in the life sciences IT space are seeing some early optimism around that. And I was just wondering what do you expect to be the early indicators that the recovery is happening in that business? And what part of your TAS business will maybe start to see the first green shoots?\nAri Bousbib: Well, thank you, Anne. I mean, look, we -- early last year, we're expecting that things would turn around second half of last year. And as you know, it didn't happen. Now it's got to happen at some point. So, we then thought, well, by the second quarter of later -- at the end of last year's third quarter, I thought, okay, second quarter of 2024. We are now expecting this to happen second half. And in support of all of these, I mentioned some data points in my introductory remarks. Look, the FDA approved 50% more molecules than last year and is the highest level since 2018. That really generally bodes well for the commercial business as our clients prepare for launching those drugs into the marketplace. And those launches come for significant support from the type of services that we provide, whether it's data launch consulting, planning, market access, pricing support and so on and so forth. And in fact, our own market expectations of spend by pharma over the next few years, compares very favorably to the prior period. Now, in our own conversations with clients, we're noting more optimism on the outlook for 2024. But perhaps because we've been hurt before, we've tried to be appropriately cautious in planning. And really, when we build up the forecast for our TAS business based on the pipeline, I might note, I don't think we said that before or even if we report any of these numbers here, but we have a pipeline of opportunities with a very detailed methodology that's been proven over time. And I can tell you that our pipeline for the year for the 2024 year is higher than it has ever been on the TAS business. So that gives us comfort that the forecast is appropriately built and hopefully, we'll be -- we have upside favorability if things work out perfectly well. But we've built enough caution on the forecast here that we feel good about the TAS business for 2024 as we presented it. Now, a word of caution, the business saw a decline in growth through 2023 with every quarter being worse than the previous one. We expect 2024 to be sort of the mirror image of that. That is the first quarter to be more like last year's fourth quarter and the second quarter more like the third quarter, et cetera, with the ramp up through the year and hopefully building momentum as we progress through 2024.\nAnne Samuel: That's very helpful. Thank you. And then maybe on the R&DS side. I was hoping maybe you could just provide a little bit of color on just how to think about the cadence for 2024. I'm just given all the moving pieces. Thank you.\nAri Bousbib: You mean the cadence? Yes, anyone has any\nAnne Samuel: The cadence of revenue yes.\nAri Bousbib: Yes.\nNicholas Childs: Yes, I mean I think you I mean I guess I would tell you to look at the linearity that you've seen in prior years -- any sort of drop off or a significant pickup either no.\nAnne Samuel: Great. Very helpful. Thank you so much.\nNicholas Childs: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Shlomo Rosenbaum from Stifel. Your line is open.\nShlomo Rosenbaum: Hi. Thank you for taking my questions. Ari, can you talk a little bit about the significant contract signings in the quarter? A second largest in the company's history, were there certain really large deals that maybe boosted it? Were there certain therapeutic areas that might have boosted it? Maybe just give us a little bit of color about that.\nAri Bousbib: Okay. Well, thank you, Shlomo, for the question. There was no specific contract or particular award or anything like that. I would just say that, by segment, the EBP segment was particularly strong. I mentioned funding was very strong in the quarter. The highest on record. Again, if you exclude the COVID years. And so EBP was particularly strong. I'd say with -- again, we don't talk about book-to-bill per segment, but the EBP book-to-bill, if you will, was higher than our 1.31. So, comparatively, we had -- and I would say about 25%. Is that correct, guys? 25% of our bookings in the year were EBP. So that's a little bit of color that I can give you. But nothing -- no one time big award or anything that skewed the numbers pretty strong across the board.\nNicholas Childs: Therapeutic area we continue to excel in oncology and cell and gene therapy in a complex clinical trial, no change.\nAri Bousbib: Right. Correct.\nShlomo Rosenbaum: Great. Thank you. Is there -- can you just comment anything about competitively in the marketplace? Has there been any changes? I know it's a long cycle business. Anything you could talk about either on TAS or R&DS with any of the well-known competitors that are out there?\nAri Bousbib: Well, I don't generally like to comment on competitors. But yes, there have been a number of disruptions sort of company is being acquired or spun off in the CRO space. And that always introduces some level of disruption. I mean some of these companies have been in trouble. The fact that, they've been acquired by private equity or conversely spun off in the public markets. Does that mean that they'll be more competitive, less competitive? It's hard to tell. It's disruption often. Often, happens. If you take a longer view of this question, we believe that our merger seven years ago, significantly disrupted the industry and led to a large number of subsequent transactions which resulted from what we believe was reactions to the clear competitive advantage that we think we established that enabled us over the past few years to gradually gain market share. But other than that, I mean, I don't have any further comments.\nNicholas Childs: Thank you, Shlomo.\nShlomo Rosenbaum: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Tejas Savant from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nTejas Savant: Hey, guys. Good morning. So my first question here is on the R&D side of things. Ari, can you help us think through just a shift in mix in FSP versus hybrid versus full service work and the margin implications of that? And similarly, sort of any shift in the mix of work as you head into 2024 on therapeutic area basis? And what that means -- what that might for your backlog burn rates?\nRonald Bruehlman: Question was about the mix shift in margins between FSP and full service, correct?\nTejas Savant: That's right.\nRonald Bruehlman: Yes. Look, FSP tends to be somewhat lower margin than full service. Now, take into account, though, that full service comes with pass-through -- significant pass-through revenues that FSP doesn't. And so when you look at the average margins, including passers, they're not that different. But yes, in general, there has been -- there is some margin degradation as a result of the shift towards FSP. On the other hand, this shift is a very gradual shift that's going on. It's -- you're talking about points of single points of shift, not huge -- a huge flight to FSP, and it takes place over time, remember, the average trial for plus years to complete. So there really hasn't been any dramatic impact on our margins as a result of that. And, of course, we're working all the time to optimize and take costs out and do things to improve our margins independent of whatever contracts we happen to be signing. So I would say, not a big impact there. And you see in our EBITDA margins, they've actually continue to improve overall and that's with R&DS being over 50% of our revenue.\nAri Bousbib: And then your second question?\nTejas Savant: Yes. My second question, actually, I'm going to switch to the TAS comments, guys. I mean, are you encouraging to see expectations of a recovery in the back half of the year? And you talked about your detailed bottom-up pipeline build there. But I just want to put a finer point on it in terms of just the timing of the recovery, right? So, what gives you confidence comes through in 2H 2024 versus getting pushed to 2025? Is it something related to contracted work that you have clear line of sight to versus work that could be delayed? Or is it some large real-world evidence projects that you see coming through here in the back half?\nAri Bousbib: Yes. Thank you, Tejas. No, it's not anything -- any one contract or a specific level, as I mentioned, the overall sentiment bubbling up into a pipeline that I mentioned is the highest that we've had ever. Now, the pipeline doesn't always translate exactly as it is. It's probability adjusted and so on and so forth, but that's a good indication from a metric standpoint that we should be up for the year. And we've built some level of cushion here because we've been burned/delayed last year. And so that's what kind of gives us a little bit of confidence along with the conversations we're having with our clients. Again, I wouldn't -- this is not like -- we're not seeing a sharp uptick all of a sudden, okay? Our clients are -- especially large pharma, very, very focused on cost containment. They've all announced significant cost reduction programs. Some of them in anticipation of really unknown impact of the IRA, some in anticipation of some LOEs coming soon in the next few years or other variables, but the fact is there are these large pharma cost discussions that we're having with clients as well, and we are a significant vendor and therefore, those conversations have tended to be more difficult than they were in the past with respect to negotiations and pricing and so on. That is still there. The number of opportunities, the number of projects, the number of compensations, all of which translate into a pipeline, the request for proposals and so on that we're having are clearly up. And given the life cycle of the sales processes as we know them, we are anticipating that those would concretize into sales towards the back end of the year.\nRonald Bruehlman: And Tejas, just one point of emphasis here, too. In the TAS business particularly is hundreds and hundreds of projects. You're not going to have any individual project move the needle there. Thank you.\nTejas Savant: Thanks guys. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Luke Sergott from Barclays. Your line is open.\nLuke Sergott: Hi, guys. Can you talk about the -- we keep talking about the TAS recovery, but -- and the big pipeline that you guys have, but can you kind of double-click into what that looks like versus discretionary versus the sticky side? I think there's a lot of confusion about where the weakness has been in TAS and where the strength has been? And if there's actually any change or improvement on the side of like regulatory and medical writing, things like that to give more confidence in that back half recovery that you're talking about?\nAri Bousbib: Yes. Well, look, we ourselves are, as I mentioned before, I'm putting a fair amount of caution and conservatism, if you want to call it that way in our own forecast because of some of the factors you mentioned, that we've experienced last year. The business continues to grow. Look, the general environment so far is consistent with what we were experiencing at the end of last year. And you've seen our large cap companies that operate in the same business actually forecast even declining sales for their own businesses for 2024. Now, we're not there because as you correctly point out, some of these services that we sell are not exactly discretionary, so look, the data business, for example, continues to hold up well. It's never been a fast growth business, but it's holding up. We saw headwinds in the more discretionary part of the TAS segment, which is the analytics and consulting business. But I have to say that the business started to pick up a bit with sequential improvements in growth in Q4 compared to Q3. So even this more discretionary side, we saw an uptick, not -- again, not a steep curve, but we saw a positive movement even on the discretionary side. Now, the impact on the discretionary project part of the real-world business, that is a little bit of a longer cycle within TAS, is a little bit longer cycle. We started seeing that in Q3 and continued in Q4, and it did impact the performance of our real-world business in Q4. So, if I might summarize the data business holding up maybe a little bit even better, doing a little bit better. The totally discretionary piece of analytics and consulting, little movement and some uptick that we are perceiving. The real-world piece, you've got the stuff that they need to do. That hasn't changed. And then there is a step that's more discretionary because it's more -- it's a longer cycle, the deceleration impacted our numbers more in Q3 and further in Q4. So, the issues we saw in Analytics and Consulting in the early part of the year, we started seeing in real world in Q3 and Q4, and we expect that to continue in Q1. But if you -- I hope that gives you enough color here to get a sense for what we're seeing.\nLuke Sergott: It does, it does. Thank you. And then I guess a follow-up on the -- there's a lot of concern here. Some of your peers talked about biotech RFP slowing in 4Q. But just as you look at the actual step-up needed to maintain the book-to-bills and the bookings levels that you guys have had. Do you see that, that level of RFP volume across all your segments is enough to sustain it over the next six months? Or could we see some softening here maybe in the 1Q? And obviously, this is just more of a quarterly dynamic as the full year kind of paces out as what you're talking about. But just when you're thinking about the actual bookings getting -- you're closing that sales cycle, could some stuff get pushed out to more of the back half of the year. \nAri Bousbib: I mean, look, you've got a lot of hypothetical here. You're referring to a competitor commentary. I didn't hear any of that. And we're not seeing that again. This is interesting. People want to see badness and had their hat on something. I would point to you that going back a couple of years at least, people who are competitors \"whining about EVP funding.\" and all see our stock suffered as a result of this whining, we kept telling the world that we weren't seeing it. We ended up being correct. There was no dramatic drop-off in funding. It didn't happen. If anything, now, as I mentioned, it's even going further at record levels. So EVP is good. That actually was very, very strong in terms of bookings. We see that trend continuing. When things get funded in a quarter, typically the bookings come in over the course of the following year. So, I don't see that happening on the EBP segment. Large pharma, yes, there is a little bit of reprioritization of projects. You've heard that from us, from others, looking at different programs, but it's not like people are saying, all of a sudden, we're not doing research anymore. There's a little bit of -- at the moment, as we discussed earlier Ron mentioned a bit of a pendulum moving more towards FSP. But again, we play in that segment, too. We play in every segment. But other than these dynamics, I don't see anything that would lead me to believe that all of a sudden, we have to be worried, quite the opposite. As I said, our RFP flow was up 13% in Q4, and that's across the board, strong double-digits in EBP and in large pharma as well. For the -- that was in Q4. Full year same thing, very strong and EBP even stronger for the full year. Awards, which is sort of, if you will, a leading indicator of bookings because as you know, we and maybe a small number of others actually report bookings and book to risk based on contracted work. Some still report only awards, which is kind of before contracted and awards are also at a record high level. If you look at our pipeline, the total pipeline is up high single-digits, in very high single-digits, again, at a record level. Qualified pipeline, which is we look at -- we have our own methodology to screen all the opportunities and come down to those that we think are the ones we want to pursue and that are the most viable and the most likely to come to fruition. The qualified pipeline is up strong double-digits, again, across the board. So, I don't know what else to tell you. I don't -- you heard anything that I don't know, let me know.\nLuke Sergott: No, that's why I'm in my seat and you're in your seat. Appreciate. Thank you.\nAri Bousbib: All right. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Elizabeth Anderson from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nElizabeth Anderson: Hi guys. Thanks so much for the color on the complexity of the demand environment. I had a question about the 4Q bookings. Can you comment on sort of what percentage was FSP? I know you said it, obviously, with the revenue shift is very incremental over the course of the year. But I would just be curious, sort of, level set what you're seeing in the current environment there?\nAri Bousbib: The question is how much of our bookings was FSP. I think a little over 20%, is that correct?\nRonald Bruehlman: Yes, -- was the bookings in the quarter and that's for the full year for FSP.\nAri Bousbib: How much -- can you be more -- well, how much was EVP? 25%?\nRonald Bruehlman: Yes. Total EVP is about one-quarter of our bookings for the year. \nAri Bousbib: Right. And I think FSP is mostly large pharma, right?\nRonald Bruehlman: Yes.\nElizabeth Anderson: And then how would you comment on the rate card as we think about 2024 in terms of both full service work and FSP?\nRonald Bruehlman: Talk about pricing?\nAri Bousbib: Yes. No, no, rate card, the rates, labor and so on.\nRonald Bruehlman: Yes. I mean, look, this continues to be pressure from clients and negotiate and tough negotiations that's been the biggest surprise for me over the past several years, and that is that you got a better mode, you've got a better company, a better delivery system, better capabilities, then we should be able to actually charge more. But lo and behold, we've got competitors. And as I said before, clients are -- clients that we want to continue to have. We have with whom we sell a lot to we sell a lot of stuff. And we have strong relationships. And when the client tells you, listen, CEO calls you and says, I need you to lower the rate here on this because it's going to help me in my cost reduction program, it's hard to say, listen, I'm better than a competitor and the answer is no. So we don't say yes to everything, but this is part of managing our long-term relationships, and we -- I wouldn\u2019t hide the fact that we are having maybe more pressure than we had before, generally on pricing that's across the board. There's no secret there.\nElizabeth Anderson: Got it. That\u2019s super helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of David Windley from Jefferies. Your line is open.\nDavid Windley: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. A little bit of a follow-up to Elizabeth there. Ari, we spent in December, quite a bit of time talking about the decision cycle environment with, I think, principally large pharma. So I joined late, but I've heard you describe that your RFP flows look pretty good. Your awards look pretty good. Those things seem to be holding up, but you had described that whether it was IRA or pending loss of exclusivity of important products or whatever that clients were kind of mulling over their prioritizations and processes a lot longer than normal. And I suppose part of that is probably also a little bit of Elizabeth -- your answer to Elizabeth's question around pricing and trying to meet budget cut targets and things like that. How would you -- I'd love for you to elaborate on that environment? And do you feel like you're closer to the end of it? Or are we still in the middle of it? When do we think large pharma will be back the business, so to speak?\nAri Bousbib: Well, again, I want to make sure -- I mean, it's not like back to business, not like people are on hold and they are not doing anything again. I mean, look, our backlog continues to grow. The RFP flow is up double-digits.\nNicholas Childs: Second highest bookings quarter ever.\nAri Bousbib: Right. We had the second highest bookings quarter ever and the first -- the one that was the highest, which was last year, I think that was -- we had a very big proportion of pass-through from specific large award. That's why it was like over $3 billion, if I recall, in that quarter. So, this quarter, we had, what, $2.8 billion. I mean -- and that was like a regular quarter with nothing unusual, no big one-timer award or anything like that. So, it's a pretty -- the numbers are the numbers. Now, the conversations are more difficult, longer, more negotiations, but the volume -- the answer to your question is I think the volume and the number of opportunities, it keeps going up. And again, EBP funding very strong, all-time high. We saw particular strength on EBP, and we see that continuing this year. So not like we're on hold and thinking about when are we back to business. That's perhaps a question we were asking ourselves on the TAS segment, and that we are in the middle of, and we see some sign of green shoots as Elizabeth told us before, or Anne, I think, was the one used that expression, some green shoots on the commercial side to the back end of the year. But on the R&DS side, we are experiencing the pressure, the more difficult environment with respect to pricing and negotiation and so on. We are in those conversations. But no one is saying, I'm going to hold, and I'm not doing anything. Again, the numbers showed numbers of RFPs, the pipeline at an all-time high, the qualified pipeline up strong double-digits and are going across the board. It's not like there's one segment or another. So I would say quite the opposite. I think the number of opportunities, the environment is very fertile in terms of chasing opportunities and responding to request for proposals, we are very, very busy.\nDavid Windley: Okay. So if I could follow up then. To go the next step and ask perhaps what might be the factors that are influencing the disconnect between a high single-digit to double-digit RFP award pace with a below mid-single-digit revenue growth. So I understand part of that is TAS, I'm going to try to head off a little bit in the past. Part of that is TAS. I know that. So, we'll set that aside. And I know you also attribute some to COVID, but COVID is now small enough that it is like any other big project that you would see come to a conclusion in any given year and ramp transition those people to a new project and ramp that up. So, it would seem that you're to a point where the backlog growth should be translating to R&DS revenue growth, and there's a disconnect there. So to what would you attribute that? \nAri Bousbib: Yes. So again, if you take R&DS, it's not -- COVID, it's not like one project like any other. It's not the case. We really have a COVID is very specific. It took specific resources, it's specific projects. And in 2024, it's coming down by $300 million. That represents a direct headwind to growth of 350 basis points to R&DS growth, 350 basis points. In addition, and this is more of a mix issue I mentioned in my introductory remarks, a number of wins, and we continue to win in the oncology area. We're happy about that because that's the fastest-growing therapeutic area, hands down all around. It has been for a while and will continue to be. And we are winning in oncology. The issue with that therapeutic area is that the burn rate is much lower. It takes time. It's more difficult to recruit patients. It's more complex. And therefore, it transfers into revenue slower than anything else. And we have a disproportionate share in that market. Third reason in the mix, we do have -- we happen to be, and that's just a consequence. It's hard to explain, but some years, we've got tailwinds from pass-throughs and some years, we have headwind from pass-throughs. As you know, pass-throughs are -- I'm not going to say irrelevant, but they come with no profit. They come with -- it's just an artificial accounting add to our -- but the fact our buildup forecast for 2024, pass-throughs will be a headwind to R&DS growth, and that represents 100 basis points approximately of headwind to top line growth of R&DS, again, inclusive of pass-throughs. So, if you add 350 basis points of headwind from COVID from the step down in COVID and 100 basis points of headwind from the pass-through mix, that's 450 basis points. So, you're right. But if you add back this and you normalize our underlying business is growing high single-digits, very high single-digits on the R&DS side. So, I think that's the reconciliation. You're right, Dave, you're smart analysts and you point to the apparent disconnect between the strong growth of our bookings and the reported growth in 2024, which, again, we hope to be out of that in 2025. It certainly bodes well. 2025 should be a sweet year. I don't want to put actions for 2025 here. We're barely talking about 2024. But I think based on everything we're seeing, we should certainly be behind all of those issues. But thank you Dave, I think that was the last question. Thank you.\nDavid Windley: Thank you.\nOperator: This ends our question-and-answer session. Mr. Childs, I turn the call back over to you.\nNicholas Childs: Thank you very much, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. We look forward to speaking to you again on our first quarter earnings call in April. The team and I will be available the rest of the day to answer any follow-up questions you have. Thank you. Thank you very much.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Ronald Bruehlman",
            "content": "Okay. Thanks, Ari, and good morning, everyone. Let's start by reviewing revenue. Fourth quarter revenue of$3.868 billion grew 3.5% on a reported basis and 2.6% constant currency. In the quarter, COVID-related revenues were approximately $65 million, which was down about $125 million versus the fourth quarter of 2022. Now excluding all COVID related work from both this year and last, constant currency growth was approximately 6%. And as Ari mentioned, acquisitions contributed about 150 basis points of this growth. Technology & Analytics Solutions revenue for the fourth quarter was $1.531 billion, up 2.1% reported and 1.3% constant currency. Excluding all COVID-related work, constant currency growth in TAS was 4%. R&D Solutions fourth quarter revenue of $2.151 billion was up 4.5% reported and 3.7% at constant currency and excluding all COVID related where constant currency growth and R&DS was 9% in the quarter. Finally, Contract Sales and Medical Solutions or CSMS fourth quarter revenue of $186 million grew 2.2% reported and 1.7% at constant currency. For the full year, revenue was $14.984 billion, growing at 4% on a reported basis and 4.1% at constant currency. COVID-related revenues totaled approximately $420 million for the year. Excluding all COVID-related work from both years, constant currency growth was 9%. Full year Technology & Analytics Solutions revenue was $5.862 billion, up 2% reported, 2.1% at constant currency and excluding all COVID-related work, growth at constant currency in TAS was 6%. In R&D Solutions full year revenue was $8.395 billion, growing 6%, both on a reported and a constant currency basis, and excluding all COVID-related work, growth at constant currency in R&DS was 13%. Finally, in CSMS revenue for the full year was $727 million, which was down 2.2% reported and 0.3% at constant currency. Okay. Moving down to P&L. Adjusted EBITDA was $966 million for the fourth quarter. That represented 5% growth, while full year adjusted EBITDA was $3.569 billion, which was up 6.7% year-over-year. Fourth quarter GAAP net income was $469 million and GAAP diluted earnings per share was $2.54. For the full year, GAAP net income was $1.358 billion, or $7.29 of earnings per diluted share. Adjusted net income was $523 million for the fourth quarter and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $2.84. For the full year, adjusted net income was $1.901 billion in adjusted diluted EPS was $10.20. Excluding the year-over-year impact of the step-up in interest rates and the increase in the UK corporate tax rate, adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 11% in the fourth quarter and 12% for the full year. Now it's already reviewed, R&D Solutions delivered another really strong quarter of bookings. Our backlog at December 31 stood at a record $29.7 billion. That's up 9.2% year-over-year and 31% over the last three years. Okay. Let's turn to the balance sheet. As of December 31, cash and cash equivalents totaled $1.376 billion and gross debt was $13.673 billion. And due to the math that results in net debt of $12.297 billion, our net leverage ratio at year-end was 3.45 times trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA. Fourth quarter cash flow from operations was $747 million and capital expenditures was $179 million, which resulted in free cash flow of $568 million for the quarter. Now in the quarter, we repurchased $229 million of our shares at an average price of $1.95 per share bringing our full year share repurchase activity to just slightly below $1 billion. This leaves us with just under $2.4 billion of share repurchase authorization remaining under the current program. Now as you know, coming out of the merger, we took advantage of the low interest rate environment and deployed a significant amount of capital for internal investments, acquisitions and share repurchases, which were quite accretive for our shareholders. Now, over that period, our net interest expense was relatively steady at around $400 million per year, but at the end of 2022 and through the middle of 2023, we experienced a rapid and unprecedented rise in interest rates, which drove annual interest expense, up by almost $0.25 billion causing our adjusted EPS to be just slightly over flat in 2023. Now, as you saw in November, we successfully refinanced approximately $2.75 billion of our near-term debt maturities. The strong demand for IQVIA debt that we experienced allowed us to tighten pricing and lock in an average fixed rate below 4.9% for those issuances after swaps. This refinancing extended approximately $2.75 billion of maturities to 2029 and 2031 and we reduced our interest rate risk exposure by locking in over 80% of our debt at fixed rates. With this refinancing, we now expect net interest expense to be approximately $650 million in 2024. Now, the forward curves point to a reduction in rates in the future. We've included the current market consensus in our 2024 guidance. Further reductions would lower our net interest expense more on our variable rate debt and potentially open opportunities to refinance additional debt in the future. Now let's go to our 2024 guidance, which I'll review in detail. For the full year, we expect total revenue to be between $15.400 billion and $15.650 billion, this includes approximately $300 million of a step-down in COVID-related work year-over-year and about 100 basis points of contribution from M&A activity and further FX headwind of approximately 50 basis points versus 2023. Our adjusted EBITDA guidance is $3.700 billion to $3.800 billion. Our adjusted diluted EPS guidance is $10.95 to $11.25. Now this guidance includes about $650 million of interest expense. Approximately $580 million of operational depreciation and amortization expense, an effective income tax rate, just under 20% and an average diluted share count of approximately 184 million shares. This guidance also assumes about $2 billion deployment split evenly between acquisitions and share repurchase. Finally, our guidance assumes that foreign currency rates as of February 12 continue for the balance of the year. Now at the segment level, we expect TAS revenue to be between $6 billion and $6.2 billion. Q1 2023 was the last quarter that we had significant COVID-related revenues in TAS. So the COVID step down in TAS will be minimal for the balance of the year. As already mentioned, the guidance now anticipates an improvement in our commercial business towards the back end of the year, which will still result in a year-over-year growth of low to mid-single-digits. R&DS revenue is expected to be between $8.7 billion and $8.8 billion. This guidance includes almost the entire $300 million step down in COVID-related revenue. And that represents approximately 350 basis points of headwind to the R&DS growth rate. The guidance also reflects the latest phasing of pass-through revenue which results in an additional headwind of approximately 100 basis points to R&DS year-over-year. Adjusting for the COVID step-down in the pass-through headwind, R&DS revenue growth in 2024 is expected to remain in the high single-digits. CSMS revenue is expected to be approximately $700 million, which is down slightly year-over-year. Now, let's review the first quarter guidance. For the first quarter, we expect revenue to be between $3.650 billion and $3.725 billion. The decline in COVID-related work is weighted towards the beginning of the year with the largest impact in Q1. Also, we expect mark conditions and TAS to recover only in the back half of the year, as we've said. Adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter is expected to be between $850 million and $870 million, and adjusted diluted EPS is expected to be between $2.45 and $2.55. Now keep in mind that Q1 is the toughest comparison for adjusted diluted EPS due to the interest rate increases we saw throughout 2023. As we mentioned, our guidance assumes that foreign currency rates as of February 12 continue for the balance of the year. So let's summarize. Q4 was another strong quarter. R&DS delivered the second largest booking quarter in IQVIA history at over $2.8 billion, along with another quarter of double-digit RFC growth. For the full year of 2023, revenue grew 9% at constant currency, excluding COVID-related work. Our EBITDA margin expanded by 60 basis points and adjusted diluted EPS was up 12% you exclude the year-over-year impact of interest rates and the increase in the UK tax rate. Free cash flow was strong in the quarter at $568 million, representing 109% of adjusted net income. IQVIA was named to Fortune's 2023 list of the World's most Admired Companies for the seventh consecutive year and earned the first place ranking within our industry group for the third consecutive year. And lastly, we issued full year 2024 guidance with underlying revenue growth of 5% to 7%, continued margin expansion and a resumption of EPS growth with adjusted diluted earnings per share expected to be up 7% to 10%. Now, before we open the call to Q&A, I'd like to make you aware of the leadership change within IQVIA's finance organization, Nick Childs, who has led our Investor Relations and treasury functions very ably for the past three years, is moving on to become CFO of our North American business. He will be succeeded by Kerry Joseph, who has served as CFO of that business unit for the past five years. Kerry, who is a member of the global finance leadership team has had many finance roles of increasing responsibility during his 20-plus years with the company. Kerry and Nick have already been working together to transition responsibilities and Kerry will join Nick on our follow-up calls this quarter, so you all have a chance to meet them. Now, with that, let me hand it back over to the operator to begin our Q&A session. Question was about the mix shift in margins between FSP and full service, correct? Yes. Look, FSP tends to be somewhat lower margin than full service. Now, take into account, though, that full service comes with pass-through -- significant pass-through revenues that FSP doesn't. And so when you look at the average margins, including passers, they're not that different. But yes, in general, there has been -- there is some margin degradation as a result of the shift towards FSP. On the other hand, this shift is a very gradual shift that's going on. It's -- you're talking about points of single points of shift, not huge -- a huge flight to FSP, and it takes place over time, remember, the average trial for plus years to complete. So there really hasn't been any dramatic impact on our margins as a result of that. And, of course, we're working all the time to optimize and take costs out and do things to improve our margins independent of whatever contracts we happen to be signing. So I would say, not a big impact there. And you see in our EBITDA margins, they've actually continue to improve overall and that's with R&DS being over 50% of our revenue. And Tejas, just one point of emphasis here, too. In the TAS business particularly is hundreds and hundreds of projects. You're not going to have any individual project move the needle there. Thank you. Yes, -- was the bookings in the quarter and that's for the full year for FSP. Yes. Total EVP is about one-quarter of our bookings for the year. Yes. Talk about pricing? Yes. I mean, look, this continues to be pressure from clients and negotiate and tough negotiations that's been the biggest surprise for me over the past several years, and that is that you got a better mode, you've got a better company, a better delivery system, better capabilities, then we should be able to actually charge more. But lo and behold, we've got competitors. And as I said before, clients are -- clients that we want to continue to have. We have with whom we sell a lot to we sell a lot of stuff. And we have strong relationships. And when the client tells you, listen, CEO calls you and says, I need you to lower the rate here on this because it's going to help me in my cost reduction program, it's hard to say, listen, I'm better than a competitor and the answer is no. So we don't say yes to everything, but this is part of managing our long-term relationships, and we -- I wouldn't hide the fact that we are having maybe more pressure than we had before, generally on pricing that's across the board. There's no secret there."

            "name": "Ari Bousbib",
            "content": "Thank you, Nick, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today to discuss our 2023 results. You saw that we had a good quarter. Let me start the call by sharing the latest of what we are seeing in our end markets, along with our key accomplishments for 2023. On the clinical side, demand from our R&DS clients remained strong. Net new bookings for the quarter exceeded $2.8 billion, the second largest quarter in IQVIA history, representing a quarterly book-to-bill of 1.31. Our quarterly RFP flow was up 13% year-over-year, driven by EBP and large pharma. Our qualified pipeline grew double-digits versus prior year. Emerging biotech funding was strong. According to BioWorld, fourth quarter EBP funding was $21.6 billion, the highest quarter in the last two years continuing the sequential improvement we've seen throughout the year. For the full year, EBP funding for 2023 was $70.9 billion, up 17% versus the prior year, and that represents the largest year on record, if we exclude the outlier years of 2020 and 2021, when there was dramatic outstanding due to COVID. As we close 2023, we're proud of what we have achieved in R&DS. The business booked $10.7 billion of net new business, including record high service bookings of $8.4 billion. Our backlog stands at $29.7 billion, and that's up 9% year-over-year. The business added nearly 400 net new customers in the year. We made great progress with our clinical research strategies. We significantly expanded our R&D site network and management organization through strategic acquisitions that offer clinical research coordination study feasibility and patient recruitment capability. We further expanded the capabilities of the lab business through the launch of a new synthetic antibody discovery offering, which is differentiated from the traditional animal-derived antibodies that are used by our competitors. And we partnered with the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, CEPI, who enhance the world's ability to rapidly conduct clinical research for vaccines and other biological countermeasures against emerging infectious diseases in underdeveloped countries. Turning to TAS. The commercial side of our business continues, of course, to face the macro environment that we've described in the past as our clients remain cautious with their spending and their cost containment. Our results in the quarter were slightly better than what we had expected. Although, discretionary spending has not yet rebounded to the levels that we expect, they will, and it continues to be a headwind. Fundamentally, leading market indicators do point to an upcoming improvement. For instance, the FDA approved 55 new molecules in 2023 and that's almost 50% more than the prior year and it is the highest level since 2018. The spend on new drug launches by our pharma clients is expected to be over $190 billion over the next five years. That's up over 25% compared to the prior five-year period. Frankly, in our own engagement with customers in the recent past, we noted an improved customer sentiment during the quarter. In fact, the pipeline of opportunities remains strong even as decision time lines remain elongated and negotiations more difficult similar to what we indicated last quarter. Based on these dynamics, we continue to expect demand to pick up, but not before the second half of the year. And as a result, we may see the 2024 sequential short trend for TAS to be the inverse of what we experienced in 2023. We might see revenue growth in the first quarter that resembles the growth of the fourth quarter of 2023 and grow to gradually improve as we move to the back end of the year. Now despite more difficult macro environment, the TAS business had some significant achievements in 2023. We continued expanding our commercial technology and analytics offerings. We, in fact, added 33 new clients on our OCE technology platform. We successfully launched a new software platform, which tracks the performance of 1.6 million drugs covering 600 diseases across 93 countries. We successfully introduced a first-in-kind med tech consumption offering that supports the complex journey that medical devices take as they travel from manufacturer to health care providers. And we acquired a quality metric to extend our suite of patient health measurement tools using clinical outcome assessments and patient reported outcomes. Let me now turn to the results for the quarter. Revenue for the fourth quarter grew 3.5% on a reported basis and 2.6% at constant currency compared to last year and excluding COVID-related work from both periods, we grew the top line approximately 6% on a constant currency basis, including approximately 1.5 points of contribution from acquisitions. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA increased 5%, reflecting our ongoing cost management discipline. Fourth quarter adjusted diluted EPS of $2.84 faced the continuing headwind of the step-up in interest expense and the UK corporate tax rate increase. Excluding the impact of these items, our adjusted diluted EPS growth was 11%. Now, a few highlights of this business activity this quarter. Let's start with TAS. The midsized pharma client awarded IQVIA, a four-year outsourcing program to support their life cycle strategy of converting established brands to over-the-counter sales in more than 40 countries. Similarly, IQVIA won a four-year contract with a large pharma client to provide global market intelligence via a single globally accessible source of commercial data. In the quarter, we won a significant contract with a large pharma in the dermatology, rheumatology and oncology therapeutic areas. This program will allow our clients to access detailed prescribing patterns in local markets, and enhanced HCP targeting in 18 countries. The CDC selected IQVIA to provide comprehensive monitoring services following the end of the COVID public health emergency status. IQVIA will support the CDC in analyzing data in near real time. On the respiratory virus response, including for influenza and RSV, identifying at-risk groups and improving overall population health. In the quarter, our Patient Services business, which is showing faster growth within our past segment, secured a significant contract with a large pharma that includes adherence monitoring, co-pay support and at-home treatment administration. In our real-world business, the National Health Service of England awarded IQVIA, a large contract to deploy our privacy technology and to enable the NHS efforts to ensure the highest standards of patient data governance and privacy controls. Moving to RDS, a top 5 pharma client selected IQVIA as a key clinical FSP provider. Noteworthy here is that, a competitor of ours had been the 100% sole provider previously. This partnership will help the client improve clinical trial oversight and manage costs more effectively. In Q4, another top 5 clients awarded IQVIA a full-service Phase 2 study on ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig's disease. IQVIA was selected due to our vast expertise in ALS disease as well as our faster recruitment time lines. In the quarter, a biotech client selected IQVIA to conduct a complex trial for a promising cell and gene therapy targeting myositis, which is an autoimmune disease. We were selected due to our AI capabilities that allow us to identify sites and develop an innovative trial strategy. Also in the quarter, IQVIA expanded its partnership with a major pharma company by securing six new global oncology trials, consisting of a mix of early and late-stage trials. We were chosen due to our expertise in oncology and our ability to efficiently manage large complex trials. A leading biotech firm, selected IQVIA to conduct a program comprised of three initial stage studies in cancer research. The client is expanding from local to global development and needed a large-scale partner like IQVIA. In Q4, IQVIA was awarded a major contract from a top 10 global pharma to become its primary pharmacovigilance platform provider. This multiyear program includes replacing their legacy systems with IQVIA's drug safety monitoring technology which uses generative AI capability to automatically extract adverse event information from unstructured data sources. Finally, and before I turn it to Ron for a detailed financial review, I would like to take the opportunity to acknowledge and congratulate our employees around the world for the nice recognition the company just received. For the seventh consecutive year, IQVIA was named one of the world's most admired companies in Fortune's annual survey. And for the third year in a row, IQVIA was named the number one most admired company in our category. Lastly, before turning it over to Ron, I'd like to specifically mention the prestigious recognition received by Christina Mack one of IQVIA's senior leaders, who is the Chief Scientific Officer for our real-world business. Christina was named 2023 PharmaVoice 100 honorary, is a peer-recognized industry-wide honor. We are very proud at IQVIA of Christina's work and our passion for accelerating innovation in health care through the use of evidence-based decision-making. Let me now turn it to Ron for our financial review. Well, thank you, Anne. I mean, look, we -- early last year, we're expecting that things would turn around second half of last year. And as you know, it didn't happen. Now it's got to happen at some point. So, we then thought, well, by the second quarter of later -- at the end of last year's third quarter, I thought, okay, second quarter of 2024. We are now expecting this to happen second half. And in support of all of these, I mentioned some data points in my introductory remarks. Look, the FDA approved 50% more molecules than last year and is the highest level since 2018. That really generally bodes well for the commercial business as our clients prepare for launching those drugs into the marketplace. And those launches come for significant support from the type of services that we provide, whether it's data launch consulting, planning, market access, pricing support and so on and so forth. And in fact, our own market expectations of spend by pharma over the next few years, compares very favorably to the prior period. Now, in our own conversations with clients, we're noting more optimism on the outlook for 2024. But perhaps because we've been hurt before, we've tried to be appropriately cautious in planning. And really, when we build up the forecast for our TAS business based on the pipeline, I might note, I don't think we said that before or even if we report any of these numbers here, but we have a pipeline of opportunities with a very detailed methodology that's been proven over time. And I can tell you that our pipeline for the year for the 2024 year is higher than it has ever been on the TAS business. So that gives us comfort that the forecast is appropriately built and hopefully, we'll be -- we have upside favorability if things work out perfectly well. But we've built enough caution on the forecast here that we feel good about the TAS business for 2024 as we presented it. Now, a word of caution, the business saw a decline in growth through 2023 with every quarter being worse than the previous one. We expect 2024 to be sort of the mirror image of that. That is the first quarter to be more like last year's fourth quarter and the second quarter more like the third quarter, et cetera, with the ramp up through the year and hopefully building momentum as we progress through 2024. You mean the cadence? Yes, anyone has any Yes. Okay. Well, thank you, Shlomo, for the question. There was no specific contract or particular award or anything like that. I would just say that, by segment, the EBP segment was particularly strong. I mentioned funding was very strong in the quarter. The highest on record. Again, if you exclude the COVID years. And so EBP was particularly strong. I'd say with -- again, we don't talk about book-to-bill per segment, but the EBP book-to-bill, if you will, was higher than our 1.31. So, comparatively, we had -- and I would say about 25%. Is that correct, guys? 25% of our bookings in the year were EBP. So that's a little bit of color that I can give you. But nothing -- no one time big award or anything that skewed the numbers pretty strong across the board. Right. Correct. Well, I don't generally like to comment on competitors. But yes, there have been a number of disruptions sort of company is being acquired or spun off in the CRO space. And that always introduces some level of disruption. I mean some of these companies have been in trouble. The fact that, they've been acquired by private equity or conversely spun off in the public markets. Does that mean that they'll be more competitive, less competitive? It's hard to tell. It's disruption often. Often, happens. If you take a longer view of this question, we believe that our merger seven years ago, significantly disrupted the industry and led to a large number of subsequent transactions which resulted from what we believe was reactions to the clear competitive advantage that we think we established that enabled us over the past few years to gradually gain market share. But other than that, I mean, I don't have any further comments. And then your second question? Yes. Thank you, Tejas. No, it's not anything -- any one contract or a specific level, as I mentioned, the overall sentiment bubbling up into a pipeline that I mentioned is the highest that we've had ever. Now, the pipeline doesn't always translate exactly as it is. It's probability adjusted and so on and so forth, but that's a good indication from a metric standpoint that we should be up for the year. And we've built some level of cushion here because we've been burned/delayed last year. And so that's what kind of gives us a little bit of confidence along with the conversations we're having with our clients. Again, I wouldn't -- this is not like -- we're not seeing a sharp uptick all of a sudden, okay? Our clients are -- especially large pharma, very, very focused on cost containment. They've all announced significant cost reduction programs. Some of them in anticipation of really unknown impact of the IRA, some in anticipation of some LOEs coming soon in the next few years or other variables, but the fact is there are these large pharma cost discussions that we're having with clients as well, and we are a significant vendor and therefore, those conversations have tended to be more difficult than they were in the past with respect to negotiations and pricing and so on. That is still there. The number of opportunities, the number of projects, the number of compensations, all of which translate into a pipeline, the request for proposals and so on that we're having are clearly up. And given the life cycle of the sales processes as we know them, we are anticipating that those would concretize into sales towards the back end of the year. Yes. Well, look, we ourselves are, as I mentioned before, I'm putting a fair amount of caution and conservatism, if you want to call it that way in our own forecast because of some of the factors you mentioned, that we've experienced last year. The business continues to grow. Look, the general environment so far is consistent with what we were experiencing at the end of last year. And you've seen our large cap companies that operate in the same business actually forecast even declining sales for their own businesses for 2024. Now, we're not there because as you correctly point out, some of these services that we sell are not exactly discretionary, so look, the data business, for example, continues to hold up well. It's never been a fast growth business, but it's holding up. We saw headwinds in the more discretionary part of the TAS segment, which is the analytics and consulting business. But I have to say that the business started to pick up a bit with sequential improvements in growth in Q4 compared to Q3. So even this more discretionary side, we saw an uptick, not -- again, not a steep curve, but we saw a positive movement even on the discretionary side. Now, the impact on the discretionary project part of the real-world business, that is a little bit of a longer cycle within TAS, is a little bit longer cycle. We started seeing that in Q3 and continued in Q4, and it did impact the performance of our real-world business in Q4. So, if I might summarize the data business holding up maybe a little bit even better, doing a little bit better. The totally discretionary piece of analytics and consulting, little movement and some uptick that we are perceiving. The real-world piece, you've got the stuff that they need to do. That hasn't changed. And then there is a step that's more discretionary because it's more -- it's a longer cycle, the deceleration impacted our numbers more in Q3 and further in Q4. So, the issues we saw in Analytics and Consulting in the early part of the year, we started seeing in real world in Q3 and Q4, and we expect that to continue in Q1. But if you -- I hope that gives you enough color here to get a sense for what we're seeing. I mean, look, you've got a lot of hypothetical here. You're referring to a competitor commentary. I didn't hear any of that. And we're not seeing that again. This is interesting. People want to see badness and had their hat on something. I would point to you that going back a couple of years at least, people who are competitors \"whining about EVP funding.\" and all see our stock suffered as a result of this whining, we kept telling the world that we weren't seeing it. We ended up being correct. There was no dramatic drop-off in funding. It didn't happen. If anything, now, as I mentioned, it's even going further at record levels. So EVP is good. That actually was very, very strong in terms of bookings. We see that trend continuing. When things get funded in a quarter, typically the bookings come in over the course of the following year. So, I don't see that happening on the EBP segment. Large pharma, yes, there is a little bit of reprioritization of projects. You've heard that from us, from others, looking at different programs, but it's not like people are saying, all of a sudden, we're not doing research anymore. There's a little bit of -- at the moment, as we discussed earlier Ron mentioned a bit of a pendulum moving more towards FSP. But again, we play in that segment, too. We play in every segment. But other than these dynamics, I don't see anything that would lead me to believe that all of a sudden, we have to be worried, quite the opposite. As I said, our RFP flow was up 13% in Q4, and that's across the board, strong double-digits in EBP and in large pharma as well. For the -- that was in Q4. Full year same thing, very strong and EBP even stronger for the full year. Awards, which is sort of, if you will, a leading indicator of bookings because as you know, we and maybe a small number of others actually report bookings and book to risk based on contracted work. Some still report only awards, which is kind of before contracted and awards are also at a record high level. If you look at our pipeline, the total pipeline is up high single-digits, in very high single-digits, again, at a record level. Qualified pipeline, which is we look at -- we have our own methodology to screen all the opportunities and come down to those that we think are the ones we want to pursue and that are the most viable and the most likely to come to fruition. The qualified pipeline is up strong double-digits, again, across the board. So, I don't know what else to tell you. I don't -- you heard anything that I don't know, let me know. All right. Thank you. The question is how much of our bookings was FSP. I think a little over 20%, is that correct? How much -- can you be more -- well, how much was EVP? 25%? Right. And I think FSP is mostly large pharma, right? Yes. No, no, rate card, the rates, labor and so on. Well, again, I want to make sure -- I mean, it's not like back to business, not like people are on hold and they are not doing anything again. I mean, look, our backlog continues to grow. The RFP flow is up double-digits. Right. We had the second highest bookings quarter ever and the first -- the one that was the highest, which was last year, I think that was -- we had a very big proportion of pass-through from specific large award. That's why it was like over $3 billion, if I recall, in that quarter. So, this quarter, we had, what, $2.8 billion. I mean -- and that was like a regular quarter with nothing unusual, no big one-timer award or anything like that. So, it's a pretty -- the numbers are the numbers. Now, the conversations are more difficult, longer, more negotiations, but the volume -- the answer to your question is I think the volume and the number of opportunities, it keeps going up. And again, EBP funding very strong, all-time high. We saw particular strength on EBP, and we see that continuing this year. So not like we're on hold and thinking about when are we back to business. That's perhaps a question we were asking ourselves on the TAS segment, and that we are in the middle of, and we see some sign of green shoots as Elizabeth told us before, or Anne, I think, was the one used that expression, some green shoots on the commercial side to the back end of the year. But on the R&DS side, we are experiencing the pressure, the more difficult environment with respect to pricing and negotiation and so on. We are in those conversations. But no one is saying, I'm going to hold, and I'm not doing anything. Again, the numbers showed numbers of RFPs, the pipeline at an all-time high, the qualified pipeline up strong double-digits and are going across the board. It's not like there's one segment or another. So I would say quite the opposite. I think the number of opportunities, the environment is very fertile in terms of chasing opportunities and responding to request for proposals, we are very, very busy. Yes. So again, if you take R&DS, it's not -- COVID, it's not like one project like any other. It's not the case. We really have a COVID is very specific. It took specific resources, it's specific projects. And in 2024, it's coming down by $300 million. That represents a direct headwind to growth of 350 basis points to R&DS growth, 350 basis points. In addition, and this is more of a mix issue I mentioned in my introductory remarks, a number of wins, and we continue to win in the oncology area. We're happy about that because that's the fastest-growing therapeutic area, hands down all around. It has been for a while and will continue to be. And we are winning in oncology. The issue with that therapeutic area is that the burn rate is much lower. It takes time. It's more difficult to recruit patients. It's more complex. And therefore, it transfers into revenue slower than anything else. And we have a disproportionate share in that market. Third reason in the mix, we do have -- we happen to be, and that's just a consequence. It's hard to explain, but some years, we've got tailwinds from pass-throughs and some years, we have headwind from pass-throughs. As you know, pass-throughs are -- I'm not going to say irrelevant, but they come with no profit. They come with -- it's just an artificial accounting add to our -- but the fact our buildup forecast for 2024, pass-throughs will be a headwind to R&DS growth, and that represents 100 basis points approximately of headwind to top line growth of R&DS, again, inclusive of pass-throughs. So, if you add 350 basis points of headwind from COVID from the step down in COVID and 100 basis points of headwind from the pass-through mix, that's 450 basis points. So, you're right. But if you add back this and you normalize our underlying business is growing high single-digits, very high single-digits on the R&DS side. So, I think that's the reconciliation. You're right, Dave, you're smart analysts and you point to the apparent disconnect between the strong growth of our bookings and the reported growth in 2024, which, again, we hope to be out of that in 2025. It certainly bodes well. 2025 should be a sweet year. I don't want to put actions for 2025 here. We're barely talking about 2024. But I think based on everything we're seeing, we should certainly be behind all of those issues. But thank you Dave, I think that was the last question. Thank you."

[Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the call over to Nick Childs, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasury. Mr. Childs, please begin your conference.\nNicholas Childs: Thank you, Regina, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our third quarter 2023 earnings call. With me today are Ari Bousbib, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Ron Bruehlman, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Eric Sherbet, Executive Vice President and General Counsel; Mike Fedock, Senior Vice President, Financial Planning and Analysis; and Gustavo Perrone, Senior Director, Investor Relations.  Today, we'll be referencing a presentation that will be visible during this call for those of you on our webcast. This presentation will also be available following this call in the Events and Presentations section of our IQVIA Investor Relations website at ir.iqvia.com. Before we begin, I would like to caution listeners that certain information discussed by management during this conference call will include forward-looking statements.  The actual results could differ materially from those stated or implied by forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties associated with the company's business, which are discussed in the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings.  In addition, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures on this call, which should be considered a supplement to and as a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the comparable GAAP measures is included in the press release and conference call presentation.  I would now like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO.\nAri Bousbib: Thank you, Nick, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today to discuss our third quarter results. So in line with our expectations, R&DS is performing very well. The TAS business continued to grow, but revenue fell short of what we had expected. About half of our total revenue shortfall came from foreign exchange headwinds versus our previous guidance, and the other half from persistent weakness in demand in the TAS segment. Despite the TAS revenue shortfall, our productivity actions allowed us to deliver on our profit guidance. We continue to receive questions about the health of the industry and customer demand. And I'd like to give you the latest of what we are seeing in the market.  Let's start on the clinical development side. Demand in the R&DS segment remains strong. Net new bookings exceeded $2.6 billion, representing a quarterly book-to-bill of 1.24x overall, including pass-throughs. And given that this quarter, there is a significant difference between services bookings and bookings with pass-through, I note that our services bookings were the highest ever at $2.3 billion, resulting in a 1.4x services book-to-bill.  Our backlog reached $28.8 billion, growing 11.7% versus prior year, another historic high. Our quarterly RFP flow was up 10% year-over-year with growth across all customer segments. Our strong performance is supported by continued healthy market dynamics. Emerging biotech funding was strong in the quarter. According to BioWorld, third quarter EVP funding was $18.7 billion, the largest quarter this year. Year-to-date, EVP funding through Q3 was up 8% versus prior year.  If you look at the first half, large pharma R&D spend, it was above 20% of net revenues, highlighting continued strong R&D activity within large pharma as well. Based on these indicators, the clinical trial industry remains healthy. Our strong market position, market wins, scale and differentiated offerings give us confidence that our R&DS business will continue to deliver above-market growth.  Turning now to TAS. On the commercial side of our business, we are obviously facing a tougher macro environment. Our clients remain cautious with their spending and have extended their decision-making time lines beyond what we would have normally expected. I'm sure you also saw that several large pharma have announced significant cost reduction programs. And obviously, we are a significant vendor to large pharma.  Now we had anticipated to see improvements as we progress through the year, specifically in the quarter, we usually see activity pick up in September after the slower July, August summer months. It didn't happen. While we still have growth for the segment as a whole, we experienced further declines in our Analytics and Consulting business somewhat slower-than-expected growth in the discretionary parts of our real-world business as well as some impact from the China situation.  While the acceleration we are anticipating is taking longer than expected, based on our pipeline, we remain confident that there will be a rebound in demand sometime in 2024. We know this because the pipeline of opportunities remain strong even as decision time lines are elongated, and negotiations with our customers have become more difficult. We also know this because historically, going back 25 years, every time there was a pullback in spend on the commercial side. The industry adapts and comes back within a year or two.  With this as context, let's now review the third quarter results. Revenue for the third quarter grew 4.9% on a reported basis, 4.1% at constant currency. Compared to last year, and excluding COVID related work from both periods, we grew the top line approximately 8.5% on a constant currency basis, and that includes approximately 1.5 points of contribution from acquisitions. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA increased 9.1%, driven by revenue growth and ongoing cost management discipline.  Third quarter adjusted diluted EPS of $2.49 faced the ongoing headwind of the step-up in interest expense and the U.K. corporate tax rate. If you exclude the impact of these nonoperational items, our adjusted diluted EPS growth underlying was 13%. Let me share a few highlights of business activity in the quarter.  And let me start with TAS. This quarter, IQVIA was awarded several noteworthy analytics contracts to support our clients' go-to-market strategies. For example, an EBP clients selected IQVIA to provide analytics around key prescriber and payer trends for their women's health products. In another significant win this quarter, IQVIA secured a large U.S. data analytics contract with a top 10 pharma client that has been buying from a competitor for over a decade. We also received an award from an EBP client to support the launch of their first branded product into the diabetes market.  This will be an end-to-end launch solution, including field reps, inside sales reps, OCE, information management infrastructure, data analytics, commercial compliance and co-pay card operations. Also in the quarter, I'm sure you saw that we received an award from Sanofi to deploy our OCE platform within the Middle East and Africa markets. Sanofi has been using IQVIA in many markets around the world to support the HCP engagement.  On the tech side, we've been getting some questions about our partnership with Salesforce. And I just want to confirm that IQVIA has been a key life sciences partner to Salesforce for many years now with offerings that span from clinical to commercial. And we plan to continue this strong partnership with Salesforce, combining our life sciences domain expertise and intelligence with sales force technologies and platforms.  Moving now to Real-World. We were awarded multiple rare disease studies from both large pharma and biotech clients, highlighting our expertise and differentiated offerings within this growing therapeutic area including innovative study design, patient recruitment and AI-enabled technology to provide unique solutions. A couple of examples. The top 20 large pharma awarded IQVIA a 10-year study to improve patient treatment for a rare genetic liver disease. The Japanese EVP client awarded IQVIA 2 large post-marketing surveillance studies on rare diseases in the circulatory nervous and muscular systems.  Moving now to R&DS. We entered into a strategic collaboration with the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, CEPI, aimed at enhancing the world's ability to rapidly conduct clinical research for vaccines and other biological countermeasures against emerging infectious diseases. This collaboration is a key enabler of CEPI's mission goal, which is sponsored by the G7 and G20 countries to develop safe, effective and globally accessible vaccines against emerging disease outbreaks within 100 days.  We've also entered into an innovative strategic collaboration with Argenx, a global immunology biotech company leveraging our connected intelligence capabilities we bring together end-to-end asset development services, ranging from regulatory to market authorization to integrated technology-enabled pharmacovigilance safety tracking. This will allow Argenx to accelerate the market launch of new rare disease therapies to autoimmune patients.  In the quarter, a top 10 pharma client renewed the FSP partnership with IQVIA as they look to design and launch their new clinical monitoring model. IQVIA will codevelop the solution leveraging our expertise, innovative tech-enabled approach and exceptional delivery performance. IQVIA has remained the sole global medical information center provider by one of our large pharma clients. IQVIA differentiates in the market as the only provider to have successfully utilized an AI, natural language processing solution for medical information.  As has been the case in the last few years, R&DS continues to win big in oncology with multiple awards in the quarter, a few examples. IQVIA won a late-stage program with a biotech company developing immuno-oncology therapies, we were selected after successful delivery of an earlier stage trial as well as our unparalleled data analytics to help identify patients and populations with unmet needs. We were awarded a Phase III oncology trial from a large cutting-edge biotech company. IQVIA was selected for our expertise in endometrial carcinoma cancer as well as our ability to accelerate trial start-up. This is an important trial, given the unmet medical need and limited treatment options for patients with this condition.  Also, IQVIA was awarded 2 large global oncology trials from a midsized pharma client. IQVIA was selected due to our strategic design and operational expertise in oncology including our ability to manage multiple large complex trials and our experience in managing the unique safety profile of these molecules.  With that, I will turn it over to Ron for more details on our financial performance.\nRonald Bruehlman: Thanks, Ari, and good morning, everyone. Let's start by reviewing revenue. Third quarter revenue of $3,736 million grew 4.9% on a reported basis and 4.1% at constant currency. Now in the quarter, COVID-related revenues were about $95 million, down about $125 million versus the third quarter of 2022. Excluding all COVID related work from both this year and last, constant currency growth was approximately 8.5%. As Ari mentioned, acquisitions contributed about 150 basis points of this growth.  Technology & Analytics Solutions revenue was $1,431 million, that's up 2.2% on a reported basis and 0.9% at constant currency. And excluding all COVID-related work, constant currency growth in TAS was 5%. R&D Solutions revenue of $2,122 million was up 7.2% reported and 6.4% at constant currency. Excluding all COVID-related work, constant currency growth in R&DS was 11%.  Lastly, Contract Sales & Medical Solutions or CSMS revenue of $183 million was flat on a reported basis and up 4.9% at constant currency. Year-to-date revenue of $11,116 million grew 4.2% on a reported basis and 4.8% at constant currency. Excluding all COVID-related work, constant currency growth was 11% year-to-date. Technology & Analytics Solutions revenue year-to-date was $4,331 million, up 2% reported and 2.4% at constant currency and excluding all COVID-related work, growth at constant currency and TAS year-to-date was 7%.  R&D Solutions year-to-date revenue of $6,244 million was up 6.5% at actual FX rates and 6.8% at constant currency. Excluding all COVID-related work, growth at constant currency and R&DS was 14% year-to-date. And finally, Contract Sales and Medical Solutions year-to-date revenue of $541 million declined 3.6% reported and increased 1.2% at constant currency.  Let's move down the P&L. Adjusted EBITDA in the quarter was $888 million, representing growth of 9.1%, while year-to-date adjusted EBITDA was $2,603 million, up 7.3% year-over-year. Third quarter GAAP net income was $303 million, and GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.63. Year-to-date, GAAP net income was $889 million or $4.76 of earnings per diluted share. Adjusted net income was $462 million for the third quarter, and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $2.49. Year-to-date, adjusted net income was $1,378 million, or $7.37 per diluted share. Excluding the year-over-year impact of the step-up in interest rates and the increase in the U.K. corporate tax rate, adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 13% in the third quarter and 12% year-to-date. Now it's already reviewed, R&D Solutions delivered another strong quarter of bookings. Backlog at September 30 stood at $28.8 billion, up almost 12% year-over-year and 33% higher in the last 3 years.  Yes, let's review the balance sheet. As of September 30, cash and cash equivalents totaled $1,224 million and gross debt was $13,631 million and that resulted in net debt of $12,407 million. Our net leverage ratio ended the quarter at 3.52x trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA. Third quarter cash flow from operations was $583 million and capital expenditures were $146 million, resulting in free cash flow of $437 million. You saw in the quarter that we repurchased $144 million of our shares, which puts our year-to-date share repurchase activity just slightly below $800 million. This leaves us with just under $2.6 billion of share repurchase authorization remaining under the current program.  Yes. Let's turn to guidance. We're updating our guidance to reflect both the slower growth in the TAS segment and the headwind from foreign exchange rates compared to our previous guide, we currently expect revenue to be between $14,885 million and $14,920 million, which represents year-over-year growth of 3.3% to 3.5%. Excluding approximately $600 million of COVID-related revenue step down versus 2022, this guidance represents growth at constant currency of approximately 9%, including about 140 basis points of contribution from acquisitions.  To reflect these changes in revenue, we're also updating our guidance for full year adjusted EBITDA to $3,560 million to $3,570 million, and this represents year-over-year growth of 6.4% to 6.7%. It also implies 70 basis points of margin expansion for the year. Lastly, we're updating our guidance for adjusted diluted EPS to $10.16 to $10.23, which is flat to up 0.7% versus the prior year. This includes the year-over-year impact of the step-up in interest rates and the increase in U.K. corporate tax rate. If you were to exclude these items, adjusted diluted earnings per share is now expected to grow 11% to 12%.  But based on this full year outlook, our implied fourth quarter guidance is as follows. For revenue, we expect between $3,769 million and $3,804 million or growth of 0.8% to 1.7% on a reported basis and 0.7% to 1.6% on a constant currency basis. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $957 million and $967 million, up 4% to 5.1%. Net yield margin expansion of about 80 basis points in the quarter. Adjusted diluted EPS is expected to be between $2.79 and $2.86, growing 0.4% to 2.9% year-over-year. Excluding the step-up in interest expense and the increased U.K. tax rate, we're expecting fourth quarter adjusted diluted EPS to grow 10% to 13%.  Now all of our guidance assumes that foreign currency rates as of October 30 continue for the balance of the year. Now as is our custom, we plan to provide you with a detailed 2024 full year guidance on our Q4 earnings call in February. However, while it's early, and we're still in the midst of our planning process, we thought it would be helpful to share a preliminary view that would help you frame how we see 2024. We see reported revenue growth in the mid-single digits in 2024. This includes a further step down of approximately $300 million in covered revenue, which is about 200 basis points of headwind to revenue growth. As well as another 100 basis points of headwind from foreign exchange rates, assuming current foreign currency exchange rates remain in effect of 2024. We see adjusted EBITDA margins expanding 50 basis points, and this will drive high single-digit adjusted diluted EPS growth.  Now, I trust this preliminary look at 2024 is helpful to you. Again, we will, as is our custom, give you more detailed guidance and specificity for 2024 when we release our full year earnings early next year. So to summarize, despite client caution and spending levels below our expectations, the TAS business continued its growth in the quarter. While the near-term growth outlook for TAS is below our previous expectations, we're confident in the longer-term fundamentals of the business as our pipelines indicate there will be a rebound in demand sometime in 2024. In the quarter, we delivered another strong performance in R&DS with 11% revenue growth at constant currency, excluding COVID-related work, quarterly net new bookings were strong at over $2.6 billion, representing a book-to-bill of 1.24x, and we reached a historic high of $2.3 billion in services bookings representing a services book-to-bill of 1.4x out.  Our industry-leading backlog reached a new record of $28.8 billion, up approximately 12% year-over-year. And finally, leading indicators on the clinical side remains strong as evidenced by our quarterly RFP growth of 10% versus the prior year, with growth across all customer segments.  With that, let me hand it back over to the operator to open up the conference for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Elizabeth Anderson with Evercore ISI.\nElizabeth Anderson: One thing that I was just trying to work through for my own sort of benefit is sort of the commentary, I think, Ari, you alluded to in terms of some of the pullback in R&D spend on the pharma side. And the sort of continued strength of R&DS in terms of bookings and what you're seeing in terms of RFPs. Could you help us sort of think about how you think about those 2 factors sort of that commentary where you sort of think pharma's growth is going to be sort of the remainder of this year and next year? And that -- and maybe remind us of how that's played out in prior cycles?\nAri Bousbib: Yes. You're asking -- Elizabeth, thanks for your question. You're asking about contrasting the pullback in spend on the commercial side versus continued strength in R&DS.\nElizabeth Anderson: Sorry, R&DS, more specifically, sorry?\nAri Bousbib: Yes. But there is no pull back on spend in R&DS. I don't think I said that. I said the opposite. Funding in R&DS has been very strong. I'm sorry if I misspoke -- was misunderstood, but there is no pullback in R&DS quite the opposite. I mentioned in my introductory comments that the -- if you look at the EBP sector, which has been under pressure and people have been concerned about, we see EBP funding in the quarter actually higher than it was last year.  And I think year-to-date, I mentioned that funding was up 8% year-over-year. So I also mentioned that we are experiencing a strong continued RFP flow growth. It's actually up 10% in the quarter year-over-year. So I think it's quite the opposite. Our world continue at a record high level, again, higher than last year. To give you some more color, our qualified pipeline is up 16% year-over-year and continues to be very, very strong. Our total pipeline as well, very strong, record high historically. I mentioned our book-to-bill in the quarter is 1.24x and basis, including pass-throughs, and when you exclude pass-throughs and you just focus on services, our book-to-bill is 1.4x. Our services bookings were $2.3 billion in the quarter. That's a historic high for us. So again, nothing that we see and we've been handling this point over and over again in the environment or in an all internal metric leads us to believe there is anything changed on the R&DS spend.  There are different dynamics. It is true that we have -- we see our clients, large pharma, especially explore new models with more FSP or hybrid type of services awarded. I mentioned we won some large FSPs, which explains, of course, the lower amount of pass-throughs in the quarter in our bookings. But other than that, the spend is strong and our prospects for the business continue to be very strong on the R&DS side.\nElizabeth Anderson: Ari, that's super helpful. And so when we take the sort of pharma R&D commentary that you said about some of the pullbacks that -- and some of the spending cuts in there, you would say that you guys are seeing -- you're still seeing strong demand within that specific pharma segment, maybe yes, further and they're cutting costs by pushing more into FSP and maybe there's some anecdotal large pharma companies that are cutting with the sort of broader strength across that. That's the correct way to interpret what you're saying on the large pharma?\nAri Bousbib: Yes. I mean -- large pharma, you saw, I think 2/3 of the top 10 large pharma and we know that, that's basically the case. The vast majority of large pharma companies have announced either publicly or internally a significant cost-cutting program, that's due to the macro environment, which is very challenging. Concerns raised by the IRA and the general issues that we see geopolitical problems all over the world, continuing wars in Europe, the Middle East. And of course, we have the situation in China which has all but frozen the market for multinational corporations in China.  So all of those are headwinds plus the companies that were very active during the COVID years are seeing dramatic pullbacks in revenue and all of that is putting pressure on margins. And as a result, large pharma has been -- and I would say, unusually so, very aggressive in launching cost reduction programs. Now I said before that, that is not reflected. So far, we haven't seen that in the R&D side of the house. Again, I want to reiterate very strong strength. I mean a good momentum in the business and all the metrics show that there is no slowdown there.  Again, not surprising. It's a long-cycle business. However, we're bearing the brunt of those cost reduction initiatives on the TAS segment where we see that projects that should take a certain amount of time are taking a lot more time to get decided or awarded. And we see our clients negotiating on terms a lot harder than they ever were. And all of that has caused us to come short on the TAS segment in our revenues. But again, we're confident that this is will rebound. We know this because the pipelines continue to be very strong on the TAS segment.  And we -- if you look back at every time there was a pullback of source from large pharma in history, whether you go back to the 2008, '10 period or anytime some big legislation was enacted. There was always a little bit of a pullback. And then it came back, the company -- the industry is very innovative and comes back growing and our business goes along with it. So we're confident that we'll come back sometime in '24. Thank you, Elizabeth.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Charles Rhyee with TD Cowen.\nCharles Rhyee: Just wanted to follow up on the TAS segment here. You talked about sort of longer time lines. But when you're in discussions with clients, do they continue to express an intention to kind of continue with the projects? Or are they sort of just on hold? And how much of this is -- you mentioned the IRA. How much would you attribute to sort of the pharma companies kind of reviewing pipelines and projects overall? And do you have a sense of how long that kind of process could take? You mentioned sort of reacceleration sometime in '24, but is -- do you think that's early next year? Or could that stretch into later next year?\nAri Bousbib: Yes. Well, thank you, Charles. I mean, look, I want to distinguish again between the clinical development side of the house and the commercial shorter cycle part of the house where there are more pockets of spend that are more discretionary from a time line standpoint. So again, on the clinical side of the house, yes, there are reviews of pipelines and so on and which molecules are worthwhile developing, there's more analysis.  But this is at the early, early stage of the process. As you know, we are primarily almost entirely a Phase III clinical trial company. And so we are not seeing that, and we will not be seeing that for another several years, if it were to affect the pipeline. I remind you that the number of molecules coming down the pipe is at a record high. The number of FDA approval is at a record high. And all of that bodes well for our clinical business and all the metrics that we see from funding to RFPs, to awards, to backlog and bookings are very, very strong.  Once again, we had a record historically -- historic high in services bookings in the quarter of $2.3 billion, representing a book-to-bill ratio of 1.4x, excluding pass-through. So that's what the clinical side of the house. We have not seen the impact of any revisions or rethinking of pipelines so far. On the commercial side, that's the area where we are seeing an impact of our clients being more cautious, more conservative, stepping back from some of the projects they were planning to do. But for the most part, what we do, except again for the discretionary part, must be done, there is discretion with respect to timing. And of course, clients are being more aggressive in terms of seeking price reductions and better terms and so on.  The pipelines that we have indicate that demand is still there. To your question, when people say to us, they will no longer do a project, it's no longer in our pipeline. But if it remains in our pipeline, then it means the clients still intends to do it. It's just that the time line for decision-making has been pushed to the right. What explains it, it's, again, general concerns about the economy, general concerns about the macro geopolitical issues, the pressures resulting from sharp revenue declines, post-COVID and what that entails from a margin point of view.  As I mentioned in my introductory remarks, we are a very large vendor to pharma and to large pharma in particular. And when large pharma seeks to improve their margins, they seek to reduce costs. And obviously, they come to us for further reductions and that elongates time lines, and of course, erodes pricing as well on our side. All of that has resulted in us coming short on our revenues in TAS, along with, as we mentioned in the introductory remarks, the significant FX headwinds versus what we had guided to before. So that's the environment. Thank you for that question.\nCharles Rhyee: Sorry, and the portfolio review?\nAri Bousbib: Portfolio on the R&D side?\nCharles Rhyee: No, no. On the commercialization side, I misspoke. I meant, how much has the IRA impact is sort of as a -- has that had an effect on when pharmas have portfolio reviews and where they put their discretionary spend, but it sounds like you're saying it's more just the general macro environment that's had an impact on?\nAri Bousbib: Yes. We measure the IRA hasn't had any concrete -- significant concrete impact yet on the market. This is all based on hypothetical developments and down the line. So that just adds another cloud of uncertainty and in anticipation of that uncertainty that causes management teams to appropriately seek cost containment. That's all.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Dan Leonard with UBS.\nDaniel Leonard: I just wanted to circle back to your 2024 framing commentary, that mid-single-digit growth figure. Can you speak to your expectations between the TAS segment in the R&DS segment? And then in R&DS in 2024, do you expect any meaningful difference in growth rates between the direct fee revenue and total revenue?\nAri Bousbib: So again, this is a very -- we thought it would be helpful just because there's uncertainty. And you will recall that even in the -- at the peak of COVID, we decided to give you guidance early. And we're doing this because we hope that, that's helpful to you. Now it's an initial outlook based on where we are in our planning process. We have not completed that planning process. So I would caution you that this is, again, preliminary, and we will come back as is our custom when we release full year earnings early in '24 with detailed and precise guidance by segments, et cetera.  Just on your question, we are guiding to mid-single digit overall revenue growth. That includes $300 million of step-down from COVID and I think that's essentially are in R&DS. So if you added that back to our total revenues, that would be another couple of hundred basis points on top of that. And of course, we have -- we expect 100 basis points of foreign exchange headwinds assuming FX rate remains where they are today.  So when we say mid-single digits, that's really on a reported basis once you adjust for the COVID step-down and FX, it's more high single digits, which I'm sure you agree for and about $15 billion revenue company is quite an achievement in the current environment. With respect to segment growth, I think it's too early to give it to you. We obviously have an idea, but what should we -- I mean, I just gave it to you when we tell you that the COVID impact is 100% in R&DS, you could just assume that we are expecting -- is actually for now, assume about the same across the segments, that is mid-single digits, I would say, okay, before the COVID adjustment.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Your next question will come from the line of David Windley with Jefferies.\nDavid Windley: Ari, I wanted to focus on margin. You commented in your prepared remarks about productivity initiatives that you took in the third quarter, you're talking about the bookings mix being heavy to service, and so that could be beneficial in R&DS to EBITDA growth. Just wondered if you could talk expansively about any further productivity initiatives that you might be able to take? And kind of what are the drivers to get you to that 50 basis points of EBITDA margin expansion for next year?\nAri Bousbib: Thank you, David. Look, I mean, the productivity initiatives I mentioned, not just in the third quarter, you will recall, we started this towards the end of last year. That's what has led us to be able to address the revenue shortfall and not completely bear the brunt of that reduction falling through EBITDA. We've been able to offset a lot of that headwind with those cost reduction programs. It takes time.  As you know, if we -- the actions that we took in Q3 are not going to be benefit in Q4, Q1, Q2 of next year. So we're possibly taking actions to restructure our overhead structure, to review our spans of control globally, to continue our offshoring programs to review our infrastructure footprint that includes real estate. It includes IT. It includes really all of that infrastructure that we need to run our business and all of those cost factors along with mix of the -- the proper mix of in-sourcing, outsourcing.  And as I mentioned, continued offshoring of certain activities and taking advantage of labor arbitrage among our different centers, whether it's in the Philippines, in India, in Bangladesh, in South America, et cetera, all of those things are being done on an ongoing basis, and we see the benefit in our margins this year. And the actions we took, for example, in the third quarter, the carryover benefit will materialize in Q4. So the -- and in following quarters during 2024. The reason we feel confident about a 50 basis point margin expansion in 2024 is because we see that it's the carryover of the actions we took this year that will benefit on a full year basis 2024. And of course, we don't intend to stop those actions selectively.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Justin Bowers with Deutsche Bank.\nJustin Bowers: So I just wanted to take a step back and with respect to some of the cost-cutting programs that we've seen large pharma announced, what is IQVIA's opportunity to sort of participate in some of that and help drive some of those savings, whether it's in sort of R&DS or TAS? And then secondarily, on -- for the outlook for 2024, what's the M&A assumption embedded in that growth rate?\nAri Bousbib: Thank you, Justin, for your question. Yes, we are actively engaged with our customers to help them with their cost reduction programs. Look, we have to, we are a large vendor to large pharma across the board, clinical and TAS. And they come to us and ask us to help them. So we have an opportunity to do that. Obviously, it affects our revenue growth, that's primarily the case in TAS because that's where the pricing changes and the renegotiated terms impact us almost immediately, less so in R&DS, but mostly in TAS.  Now the opportunities, if you will, for us, is that in those conversations, we try to offer more services, that has always been the case. That's a traditional way of engaging with our clients when they seek our cost reductions. We try to capture a bigger share of their spend in exchange for being able to deliver those services at a lower price point. And so the benefit for us is longer term, we get a bigger piece as they give us more volume. We've seen that happen, frankly, on the commercial side and on the R&DS side, over the past 5, 6 years and certainly since the merger. And we certainly hope that, that will materialize, but it will take a couple of years to materialize because when clients need to switch vendors, it takes time to let the contract and convey them to us. Your next question was on the...\nJustin Bowers: Acquisition impact.\nAri Bousbib: It's about -- yes, about 100 basis points, yes. Again, that's the assumption for 2024 at this stage. Yes. That's what's baked in -- when we come back we'll give you formal guidance. This is really not guidance. It's really a preliminary look on where we are. Thank you, Justin.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel.\nShlomo Rosenbaum: I just want to drill down a little bit more into TAS. You talked about the discretionary areas. Maybe you can just get a little bit more into -- is it consulting, BPO, software data sales? Maybe just a little bit more of detail as to how growth is trending within each one of kind of the subsegments. I know you don't break it out exactly revenue-wise, but it is helpful to kind of think about what's going on beneath the surface there?\nAri Bousbib: Yes. Thank you, Shlomo, for the question and -- but you need to clarify. Look, the TAS segment has continued to grow in the quarter. I mean, you know and you can look at the large cap companies that serve the life sciences industry with products and services, supporting post-drug introduction in the market and you can see that they almost uniformly are showing declining growth this year, and sharp declines in the quarter for those who have reported.  Now we continue to have growth. And the reason for that is because some of this stuff is longer term and is somewhat mission-critical. I'm speaking about data, the stuff that's technology licenses, subscription, recurring revenue, all of that continues as is, and that's what is enabling us to continue to deliver growth. However, the parts of our business that are more discretionary. And when I say discretionary, I don't mean to say that our clients may decide simply not to go ahead. It happens, but that's a small proportion of what we sell. It means that it can be done later. It means that it can be done in a different way, perhaps in a \"slim-down version\", less -- better than we thought.  And so the consulting and analytics part of our business, which as you know is a bad quarter of our revenues. It is showing sharp declines, sharper than we would have expected. Some of the projects have simply fallen off, but the pipelines are still there. That's what gives us confidence for a rebound in '24. We know that these projects have to be done. The clients are just taking a lot more time to make a decision. They are negotiating us a lot longer and a lot more aggressively. And this is what has happened.  This is -- I mentioned in my introductory remarks, a few examples of significant wins in TAS, and these are almost uniformly these types of projects. Helping clients launch a -- launch products in new markets, helping them with their go-to-market strategies. These are things that have to be done. And the project that we won in the quarter, frankly, some of those we should have won in the first quarter. They were in the pipeline since last year. So the decision time lines have expanded and the terms have been tougher. That's what has happened. I hope that color helps you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Luke Sergott with Barclays.\nLuke Sergott: So you talked about the large FSP win. I know you're seeing a lot more shift to that type of hybrid model. And you've talked in the past about this being really in cyclical in nature. But this has also come at a lower margin. So help us think about like the duration, the size of the FSP wins that you had. And if we should expect some mix headwinds to your future over the next 3 months to a year on this business from -- regarding R&DS side.\nAri Bousbib: Thank you, Luke. Yes, you're absolutely correct that an FSP award comes at a lower booked margin than a full-service program. And you're also correct that this has -- is a cyclical development in the industry. I recall very well that at the time we did the merger 7 years ago, and coming into at the time, the legacy Quintiles organization, it was explained to me that the industry was now in the midst of a switch from full service to FSP. And as a result of which, Quintiles at the time had pulled back from servicing these clients because they didn't want to do FSP work given its lower margin profile.  I thought at the time there was a strategic error and we since then, of course, have decided to serve our clients with the full portfolio of services, including FSP and including full service and including hybrid and everything else. We serve clients. We don't push offerings. So if at this point in time, our clients are interested in more FSP or more hybrid models, that's what we will sell to them. It is then incumbent upon us to work on our cost structure to try to recover margins when we execute the work at a higher level than when we booked it out, and try to continue to develop cost containment and cost reductions so that we can offset the margin mix impact.  Look, we are a very large company we are executing thousands of trials at any given point in time. We manage a portfolio of businesses. Once again, we are about a $15 billion revenue company growing mid-single digits before your account for the step down in COVID revenue and the FX headwind. And we are at adjusted EBITDA margins of 24%, and we are expanding those margins. And we intend to continue that model well into the future despite cyclical headwinds that may occur, whether it is a tougher spending environment on the TAS side, whether it is a switch to FSP from some of our large pharma clients.  You saw in the quarter, again, $2.3 billion of services fee revenue, excluding pass-through bookings resulting in a book-to-bill of 1.4x, again, a historic high in our bookings. That included some FSP wins, again, not anything that would move the needle dramatically. But on a large number like this, you can see that we have less pass-throughs, that will materialize in our margin mix in the next couple of years, not next quarter, obviously, and we fully intend to offset that with our cost reductions and continue to increase our margins. Thank you for your question.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Jailendra Singh with Truist Securities.\nJailendra Singh: I want to ask about the capital deployment strategy over the next 12 months. Has there been any change there in terms of your priority to pay down debt versus buyback shares or even M&A allocation? And one quick clarification, what is the magnitude of the swaps rolling off next year?\nAri Bousbib: The first question and the second question, I'll give to the technicians here. The first question on capital allocation. Look, it's fascinating, we are getting from our investors 2 different messages. One is please, please reduce your leverage. And one is, please, please do not change your leverage. And I have to tell you, we historically have been living with a level of leverage that's admittedly higher than others. We are at around 3.5 net leverage right now. I want to just -- for the anecdote, tells you that we've had in the past, much higher levels of leverage and a much more difficult market conditions and much lower levels of cash flow conversion.  And we've lived with that nicely because we have a highly predictable, high-visibility business model. Our strategy has been, a, to invest in the business in capital expenditures, to innovate new products and services; b, by companies that add, that are accretive and enable us to grow faster; and, c, return money to our shareholders through share repurchases. And that has been a very effective strategy, especially when rates were extremely low.  I remind you that just 2 years ago, treasuries were at 0, 0. And I'm very glad that we had that amount of leverage. Today, treasury is at, what, 5.5? I mean we've never seen in history, such a sharp dramatic rise in interest rates in such a short period of time. Obviously, we are paying the brunt of our leverage, the price of that leverage because of that, and it's costing us 10 points, 10 points of growth in earnings per share.  However, I would argue that mid-single-digit treasury rates is high versus 0, but it's not the end of the world. I will also tell you that we though the brunt of that sharp increase in interest rates this year in '23. And assuming like everyone else assumes that the curve, if it needs to be believe indicates a stabilization and even a potential decline, then that should be a headwind -- I'm sorry, a tailwind to our EPS going forward, and we don't anticipate a sharp increase in rates or interest expense going forward.  And so therefore, we should be able to resume strong EPS growth going forward. That's for the leverage. Having said that, we are working as we speak on, obviously, refinancing and readdressing some of the shorter-term maturities, which we have in '24, in '25, and we'll do that soon, hopefully. And that will continue to alleviate that headwind that we faced this year in interest expense and continue to stabilize our balance sheet. But from there, at least, we intend to continue to use our cash to invest in the business and do acquisitions and share repurchase, especially at the levels where we are. Thank you for your question. Any comment on the swap?\nRonald Bruehlman: Yes, we have about $800 million of swaps rolling off in the second quarter of 2024. Adding to that -- add anything to that, which is at about an average rate of about, call it, somewhere between 2.5% and 3%. So it will be a headwind next year, but not to the extent that you saw on the swap that rolled off this year.\nAri Bousbib: Yes. Thank you very much.\nNicholas Childs: Well, thank you, everyone, for joining us today. We look forward to talking to everyone on our next call. And myself and the team will be available for any follow-up calls and any other follow-up questions you have across the day and over the next few days. So feel free to reach out. Thanks, everyone, for joining.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Ronald Bruehlman",
            "content": "Thanks, Ari, and good morning, everyone. Let's start by reviewing revenue. Third quarter revenue of $3,736 million grew 4.9% on a reported basis and 4.1% at constant currency. Now in the quarter, COVID-related revenues were about $95 million, down about $125 million versus the third quarter of 2022. Excluding all COVID related work from both this year and last, constant currency growth was approximately 8.5%. As Ari mentioned, acquisitions contributed about 150 basis points of this growth.  Technology & Analytics Solutions revenue was $1,431 million, that's up 2.2% on a reported basis and 0.9% at constant currency. And excluding all COVID-related work, constant currency growth in TAS was 5%. R&D Solutions revenue of $2,122 million was up 7.2% reported and 6.4% at constant currency. Excluding all COVID-related work, constant currency growth in R&DS was 11%.  Lastly, Contract Sales & Medical Solutions or CSMS revenue of $183 million was flat on a reported basis and up 4.9% at constant currency. Year-to-date revenue of $11,116 million grew 4.2% on a reported basis and 4.8% at constant currency. Excluding all COVID-related work, constant currency growth was 11% year-to-date. Technology & Analytics Solutions revenue year-to-date was $4,331 million, up 2% reported and 2.4% at constant currency and excluding all COVID-related work, growth at constant currency and TAS year-to-date was 7%.  R&D Solutions year-to-date revenue of $6,244 million was up 6.5% at actual FX rates and 6.8% at constant currency. Excluding all COVID-related work, growth at constant currency and R&DS was 14% year-to-date. And finally, Contract Sales and Medical Solutions year-to-date revenue of $541 million declined 3.6% reported and increased 1.2% at constant currency.  Let's move down the P&L. Adjusted EBITDA in the quarter was $888 million, representing growth of 9.1%, while year-to-date adjusted EBITDA was $2,603 million, up 7.3% year-over-year. Third quarter GAAP net income was $303 million, and GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.63. Year-to-date, GAAP net income was $889 million or $4.76 of earnings per diluted share. Adjusted net income was $462 million for the third quarter, and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $2.49. Year-to-date, adjusted net income was $1,378 million, or $7.37 per diluted share. Excluding the year-over-year impact of the step-up in interest rates and the increase in the U.K. corporate tax rate, adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 13% in the third quarter and 12% year-to-date. Now it's already reviewed, R&D Solutions delivered another strong quarter of bookings. Backlog at September 30 stood at $28.8 billion, up almost 12% year-over-year and 33% higher in the last 3 years.  Yes, let's review the balance sheet. As of September 30, cash and cash equivalents totaled $1,224 million and gross debt was $13,631 million and that resulted in net debt of $12,407 million. Our net leverage ratio ended the quarter at 3.52x trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA. Third quarter cash flow from operations was $583 million and capital expenditures were $146 million, resulting in free cash flow of $437 million. You saw in the quarter that we repurchased $144 million of our shares, which puts our year-to-date share repurchase activity just slightly below $800 million. This leaves us with just under $2.6 billion of share repurchase authorization remaining under the current program.  Yes. Let's turn to guidance. We're updating our guidance to reflect both the slower growth in the TAS segment and the headwind from foreign exchange rates compared to our previous guide, we currently expect revenue to be between $14,885 million and $14,920 million, which represents year-over-year growth of 3.3% to 3.5%. Excluding approximately $600 million of COVID-related revenue step down versus 2022, this guidance represents growth at constant currency of approximately 9%, including about 140 basis points of contribution from acquisitions.  To reflect these changes in revenue, we're also updating our guidance for full year adjusted EBITDA to $3,560 million to $3,570 million, and this represents year-over-year growth of 6.4% to 6.7%. It also implies 70 basis points of margin expansion for the year. Lastly, we're updating our guidance for adjusted diluted EPS to $10.16 to $10.23, which is flat to up 0.7% versus the prior year. This includes the year-over-year impact of the step-up in interest rates and the increase in U.K. corporate tax rate. If you were to exclude these items, adjusted diluted earnings per share is now expected to grow 11% to 12%.  But based on this full year outlook, our implied fourth quarter guidance is as follows. For revenue, we expect between $3,769 million and $3,804 million or growth of 0.8% to 1.7% on a reported basis and 0.7% to 1.6% on a constant currency basis. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $957 million and $967 million, up 4% to 5.1%. Net yield margin expansion of about 80 basis points in the quarter. Adjusted diluted EPS is expected to be between $2.79 and $2.86, growing 0.4% to 2.9% year-over-year. Excluding the step-up in interest expense and the increased U.K. tax rate, we're expecting fourth quarter adjusted diluted EPS to grow 10% to 13%.  Now all of our guidance assumes that foreign currency rates as of October 30 continue for the balance of the year. Now as is our custom, we plan to provide you with a detailed 2024 full year guidance on our Q4 earnings call in February. However, while it's early, and we're still in the midst of our planning process, we thought it would be helpful to share a preliminary view that would help you frame how we see 2024. We see reported revenue growth in the mid-single digits in 2024. This includes a further step down of approximately $300 million in covered revenue, which is about 200 basis points of headwind to revenue growth. As well as another 100 basis points of headwind from foreign exchange rates, assuming current foreign currency exchange rates remain in effect of 2024. We see adjusted EBITDA margins expanding 50 basis points, and this will drive high single-digit adjusted diluted EPS growth.  Now, I trust this preliminary look at 2024 is helpful to you. Again, we will, as is our custom, give you more detailed guidance and specificity for 2024 when we release our full year earnings early next year. So to summarize, despite client caution and spending levels below our expectations, the TAS business continued its growth in the quarter. While the near-term growth outlook for TAS is below our previous expectations, we're confident in the longer-term fundamentals of the business as our pipelines indicate there will be a rebound in demand sometime in 2024. In the quarter, we delivered another strong performance in R&DS with 11% revenue growth at constant currency, excluding COVID-related work, quarterly net new bookings were strong at over $2.6 billion, representing a book-to-bill of 1.24x, and we reached a historic high of $2.3 billion in services bookings representing a services book-to-bill of 1.4x out.  Our industry-leading backlog reached a new record of $28.8 billion, up approximately 12% year-over-year. And finally, leading indicators on the clinical side remains strong as evidenced by our quarterly RFP growth of 10% versus the prior year, with growth across all customer segments.  With that, let me hand it back over to the operator to open up the conference for Q&A. Yes, we have about $800 million of swaps rolling off in the second quarter of 2024. Adding to that -- add anything to that, which is at about an average rate of about, call it, somewhere between 2.5% and 3%. So it will be a headwind next year, but not to the extent that you saw on the swap that rolled off this year."

            "content": "Thank you, Nick, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today to discuss our third quarter results. So in line with our expectations, R&DS is performing very well. The TAS business continued to grow, but revenue fell short of what we had expected. About half of our total revenue shortfall came from foreign exchange headwinds versus our previous guidance, and the other half from persistent weakness in demand in the TAS segment. Despite the TAS revenue shortfall, our productivity actions allowed us to deliver on our profit guidance. We continue to receive questions about the health of the industry and customer demand. And I'd like to give you the latest of what we are seeing in the market.  Let's start on the clinical development side. Demand in the R&DS segment remains strong. Net new bookings exceeded $2.6 billion, representing a quarterly book-to-bill of 1.24x overall, including pass-throughs. And given that this quarter, there is a significant difference between services bookings and bookings with pass-through, I note that our services bookings were the highest ever at $2.3 billion, resulting in a 1.4x services book-to-bill.  Our backlog reached $28.8 billion, growing 11.7% versus prior year, another historic high. Our quarterly RFP flow was up 10% year-over-year with growth across all customer segments. Our strong performance is supported by continued healthy market dynamics. Emerging biotech funding was strong in the quarter. According to BioWorld, third quarter EVP funding was $18.7 billion, the largest quarter this year. Year-to-date, EVP funding through Q3 was up 8% versus prior year.  If you look at the first half, large pharma R&D spend, it was above 20% of net revenues, highlighting continued strong R&D activity within large pharma as well. Based on these indicators, the clinical trial industry remains healthy. Our strong market position, market wins, scale and differentiated offerings give us confidence that our R&DS business will continue to deliver above-market growth.  Turning now to TAS. On the commercial side of our business, we are obviously facing a tougher macro environment. Our clients remain cautious with their spending and have extended their decision-making time lines beyond what we would have normally expected. I'm sure you also saw that several large pharma have announced significant cost reduction programs. And obviously, we are a significant vendor to large pharma.  Now we had anticipated to see improvements as we progress through the year, specifically in the quarter, we usually see activity pick up in September after the slower July, August summer months. It didn't happen. While we still have growth for the segment as a whole, we experienced further declines in our Analytics and Consulting business somewhat slower-than-expected growth in the discretionary parts of our real-world business as well as some impact from the China situation.  While the acceleration we are anticipating is taking longer than expected, based on our pipeline, we remain confident that there will be a rebound in demand sometime in 2024. We know this because the pipeline of opportunities remain strong even as decision time lines are elongated, and negotiations with our customers have become more difficult. We also know this because historically, going back 25 years, every time there was a pullback in spend on the commercial side. The industry adapts and comes back within a year or two.  With this as context, let's now review the third quarter results. Revenue for the third quarter grew 4.9% on a reported basis, 4.1% at constant currency. Compared to last year, and excluding COVID related work from both periods, we grew the top line approximately 8.5% on a constant currency basis, and that includes approximately 1.5 points of contribution from acquisitions. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA increased 9.1%, driven by revenue growth and ongoing cost management discipline.  Third quarter adjusted diluted EPS of $2.49 faced the ongoing headwind of the step-up in interest expense and the U.K. corporate tax rate. If you exclude the impact of these nonoperational items, our adjusted diluted EPS growth underlying was 13%. Let me share a few highlights of business activity in the quarter.  And let me start with TAS. This quarter, IQVIA was awarded several noteworthy analytics contracts to support our clients' go-to-market strategies. For example, an EBP clients selected IQVIA to provide analytics around key prescriber and payer trends for their women's health products. In another significant win this quarter, IQVIA secured a large U.S. data analytics contract with a top 10 pharma client that has been buying from a competitor for over a decade. We also received an award from an EBP client to support the launch of their first branded product into the diabetes market.  This will be an end-to-end launch solution, including field reps, inside sales reps, OCE, information management infrastructure, data analytics, commercial compliance and co-pay card operations. Also in the quarter, I'm sure you saw that we received an award from Sanofi to deploy our OCE platform within the Middle East and Africa markets. Sanofi has been using IQVIA in many markets around the world to support the HCP engagement.  On the tech side, we've been getting some questions about our partnership with Salesforce. And I just want to confirm that IQVIA has been a key life sciences partner to Salesforce for many years now with offerings that span from clinical to commercial. And we plan to continue this strong partnership with Salesforce, combining our life sciences domain expertise and intelligence with sales force technologies and platforms.  Moving now to Real-World. We were awarded multiple rare disease studies from both large pharma and biotech clients, highlighting our expertise and differentiated offerings within this growing therapeutic area including innovative study design, patient recruitment and AI-enabled technology to provide unique solutions. A couple of examples. The top 20 large pharma awarded IQVIA a 10-year study to improve patient treatment for a rare genetic liver disease. The Japanese EVP client awarded IQVIA 2 large post-marketing surveillance studies on rare diseases in the circulatory nervous and muscular systems.  Moving now to R&DS. We entered into a strategic collaboration with the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, CEPI, aimed at enhancing the world's ability to rapidly conduct clinical research for vaccines and other biological countermeasures against emerging infectious diseases. This collaboration is a key enabler of CEPI's mission goal, which is sponsored by the G7 and G20 countries to develop safe, effective and globally accessible vaccines against emerging disease outbreaks within 100 days.  We've also entered into an innovative strategic collaboration with Argenx, a global immunology biotech company leveraging our connected intelligence capabilities we bring together end-to-end asset development services, ranging from regulatory to market authorization to integrated technology-enabled pharmacovigilance safety tracking. This will allow Argenx to accelerate the market launch of new rare disease therapies to autoimmune patients.  In the quarter, a top 10 pharma client renewed the FSP partnership with IQVIA as they look to design and launch their new clinical monitoring model. IQVIA will codevelop the solution leveraging our expertise, innovative tech-enabled approach and exceptional delivery performance. IQVIA has remained the sole global medical information center provider by one of our large pharma clients. IQVIA differentiates in the market as the only provider to have successfully utilized an AI, natural language processing solution for medical information.  As has been the case in the last few years, R&DS continues to win big in oncology with multiple awards in the quarter, a few examples. IQVIA won a late-stage program with a biotech company developing immuno-oncology therapies, we were selected after successful delivery of an earlier stage trial as well as our unparalleled data analytics to help identify patients and populations with unmet needs. We were awarded a Phase III oncology trial from a large cutting-edge biotech company. IQVIA was selected for our expertise in endometrial carcinoma cancer as well as our ability to accelerate trial start-up. This is an important trial, given the unmet medical need and limited treatment options for patients with this condition.  Also, IQVIA was awarded 2 large global oncology trials from a midsized pharma client. IQVIA was selected due to our strategic design and operational expertise in oncology including our ability to manage multiple large complex trials and our experience in managing the unique safety profile of these molecules.  With that, I will turn it over to Ron for more details on our financial performance. Yes. You're asking -- Elizabeth, thanks for your question. You're asking about contrasting the pullback in spend on the commercial side versus continued strength in R&DS. Yes. But there is no pull back on spend in R&DS. I don't think I said that. I said the opposite. Funding in R&DS has been very strong. I'm sorry if I misspoke -- was misunderstood, but there is no pullback in R&DS quite the opposite. I mentioned in my introductory comments that the -- if you look at the EBP sector, which has been under pressure and people have been concerned about, we see EBP funding in the quarter actually higher than it was last year.  And I think year-to-date, I mentioned that funding was up 8% year-over-year. So I also mentioned that we are experiencing a strong continued RFP flow growth. It's actually up 10% in the quarter year-over-year. So I think it's quite the opposite. Our world continue at a record high level, again, higher than last year. To give you some more color, our qualified pipeline is up 16% year-over-year and continues to be very, very strong. Our total pipeline as well, very strong, record high historically. I mentioned our book-to-bill in the quarter is 1.24x and basis, including pass-throughs, and when you exclude pass-throughs and you just focus on services, our book-to-bill is 1.4x. Our services bookings were $2.3 billion in the quarter. That's a historic high for us. So again, nothing that we see and we've been handling this point over and over again in the environment or in an all internal metric leads us to believe there is anything changed on the R&DS spend.  There are different dynamics. It is true that we have -- we see our clients, large pharma, especially explore new models with more FSP or hybrid type of services awarded. I mentioned we won some large FSPs, which explains, of course, the lower amount of pass-throughs in the quarter in our bookings. But other than that, the spend is strong and our prospects for the business continue to be very strong on the R&DS side. Yes. I mean -- large pharma, you saw, I think 2/3 of the top 10 large pharma and we know that, that's basically the case. The vast majority of large pharma companies have announced either publicly or internally a significant cost-cutting program, that's due to the macro environment, which is very challenging. Concerns raised by the IRA and the general issues that we see geopolitical problems all over the world, continuing wars in Europe, the Middle East. And of course, we have the situation in China which has all but frozen the market for multinational corporations in China.  So all of those are headwinds plus the companies that were very active during the COVID years are seeing dramatic pullbacks in revenue and all of that is putting pressure on margins. And as a result, large pharma has been -- and I would say, unusually so, very aggressive in launching cost reduction programs. Now I said before that, that is not reflected. So far, we haven't seen that in the R&D side of the house. Again, I want to reiterate very strong strength. I mean a good momentum in the business and all the metrics show that there is no slowdown there.  Again, not surprising. It's a long-cycle business. However, we're bearing the brunt of those cost reduction initiatives on the TAS segment where we see that projects that should take a certain amount of time are taking a lot more time to get decided or awarded. And we see our clients negotiating on terms a lot harder than they ever were. And all of that has caused us to come short on the TAS segment in our revenues. But again, we're confident that this is will rebound. We know this because the pipelines continue to be very strong on the TAS segment.  And we -- if you look back at every time there was a pullback of source from large pharma in history, whether you go back to the 2008, '10 period or anytime some big legislation was enacted. There was always a little bit of a pullback. And then it came back, the company -- the industry is very innovative and comes back growing and our business goes along with it. So we're confident that we'll come back sometime in '24. Thank you, Elizabeth. Yes. Well, thank you, Charles. I mean, look, I want to distinguish again between the clinical development side of the house and the commercial shorter cycle part of the house where there are more pockets of spend that are more discretionary from a time line standpoint. So again, on the clinical side of the house, yes, there are reviews of pipelines and so on and which molecules are worthwhile developing, there's more analysis.  But this is at the early, early stage of the process. As you know, we are primarily almost entirely a Phase III clinical trial company. And so we are not seeing that, and we will not be seeing that for another several years, if it were to affect the pipeline. I remind you that the number of molecules coming down the pipe is at a record high. The number of FDA approval is at a record high. And all of that bodes well for our clinical business and all the metrics that we see from funding to RFPs, to awards, to backlog and bookings are very, very strong.  Once again, we had a record historically -- historic high in services bookings in the quarter of $2.3 billion, representing a book-to-bill ratio of 1.4x, excluding pass-through. So that's what the clinical side of the house. We have not seen the impact of any revisions or rethinking of pipelines so far. On the commercial side, that's the area where we are seeing an impact of our clients being more cautious, more conservative, stepping back from some of the projects they were planning to do. But for the most part, what we do, except again for the discretionary part, must be done, there is discretion with respect to timing. And of course, clients are being more aggressive in terms of seeking price reductions and better terms and so on.  The pipelines that we have indicate that demand is still there. To your question, when people say to us, they will no longer do a project, it's no longer in our pipeline. But if it remains in our pipeline, then it means the clients still intends to do it. It's just that the time line for decision-making has been pushed to the right. What explains it, it's, again, general concerns about the economy, general concerns about the macro geopolitical issues, the pressures resulting from sharp revenue declines, post-COVID and what that entails from a margin point of view.  As I mentioned in my introductory remarks, we are a very large vendor to pharma and to large pharma in particular. And when large pharma seeks to improve their margins, they seek to reduce costs. And obviously, they come to us for further reductions and that elongates time lines, and of course, erodes pricing as well on our side. All of that has resulted in us coming short on our revenues in TAS, along with, as we mentioned in the introductory remarks, the significant FX headwinds versus what we had guided to before. So that's the environment. Thank you for that question. Portfolio on the R&D side? Yes. We measure the IRA hasn't had any concrete -- significant concrete impact yet on the market. This is all based on hypothetical developments and down the line. So that just adds another cloud of uncertainty and in anticipation of that uncertainty that causes management teams to appropriately seek cost containment. That's all. So again, this is a very -- we thought it would be helpful just because there's uncertainty. And you will recall that even in the -- at the peak of COVID, we decided to give you guidance early. And we're doing this because we hope that, that's helpful to you. Now it's an initial outlook based on where we are in our planning process. We have not completed that planning process. So I would caution you that this is, again, preliminary, and we will come back as is our custom when we release full year earnings early in '24 with detailed and precise guidance by segments, et cetera.  Just on your question, we are guiding to mid-single digit overall revenue growth. That includes $300 million of step-down from COVID and I think that's essentially are in R&DS. So if you added that back to our total revenues, that would be another couple of hundred basis points on top of that. And of course, we have -- we expect 100 basis points of foreign exchange headwinds assuming FX rate remains where they are today.  So when we say mid-single digits, that's really on a reported basis once you adjust for the COVID step-down and FX, it's more high single digits, which I'm sure you agree for and about $15 billion revenue company is quite an achievement in the current environment. With respect to segment growth, I think it's too early to give it to you. We obviously have an idea, but what should we -- I mean, I just gave it to you when we tell you that the COVID impact is 100% in R&DS, you could just assume that we are expecting -- is actually for now, assume about the same across the segments, that is mid-single digits, I would say, okay, before the COVID adjustment. Thank you, David. Look, I mean, the productivity initiatives I mentioned, not just in the third quarter, you will recall, we started this towards the end of last year. That's what has led us to be able to address the revenue shortfall and not completely bear the brunt of that reduction falling through EBITDA. We've been able to offset a lot of that headwind with those cost reduction programs. It takes time.  As you know, if we -- the actions that we took in Q3 are not going to be benefit in Q4, Q1, Q2 of next year. So we're possibly taking actions to restructure our overhead structure, to review our spans of control globally, to continue our offshoring programs to review our infrastructure footprint that includes real estate. It includes IT. It includes really all of that infrastructure that we need to run our business and all of those cost factors along with mix of the -- the proper mix of in-sourcing, outsourcing.  And as I mentioned, continued offshoring of certain activities and taking advantage of labor arbitrage among our different centers, whether it's in the Philippines, in India, in Bangladesh, in South America, et cetera, all of those things are being done on an ongoing basis, and we see the benefit in our margins this year. And the actions we took, for example, in the third quarter, the carryover benefit will materialize in Q4. So the -- and in following quarters during 2024. The reason we feel confident about a 50 basis point margin expansion in 2024 is because we see that it's the carryover of the actions we took this year that will benefit on a full year basis 2024. And of course, we don't intend to stop those actions selectively. Thank you, Justin, for your question. Yes, we are actively engaged with our customers to help them with their cost reduction programs. Look, we have to, we are a large vendor to large pharma across the board, clinical and TAS. And they come to us and ask us to help them. So we have an opportunity to do that. Obviously, it affects our revenue growth, that's primarily the case in TAS because that's where the pricing changes and the renegotiated terms impact us almost immediately, less so in R&DS, but mostly in TAS.  Now the opportunities, if you will, for us, is that in those conversations, we try to offer more services, that has always been the case. That's a traditional way of engaging with our clients when they seek our cost reductions. We try to capture a bigger share of their spend in exchange for being able to deliver those services at a lower price point. And so the benefit for us is longer term, we get a bigger piece as they give us more volume. We've seen that happen, frankly, on the commercial side and on the R&DS side, over the past 5, 6 years and certainly since the merger. And we certainly hope that, that will materialize, but it will take a couple of years to materialize because when clients need to switch vendors, it takes time to let the contract and convey them to us. Your next question was on the... It's about -- yes, about 100 basis points, yes. Again, that's the assumption for 2024 at this stage. Yes. That's what's baked in -- when we come back we'll give you formal guidance. This is really not guidance. It's really a preliminary look on where we are. Thank you, Justin. Yes. Thank you, Shlomo, for the question and -- but you need to clarify. Look, the TAS segment has continued to grow in the quarter. I mean, you know and you can look at the large cap companies that serve the life sciences industry with products and services, supporting post-drug introduction in the market and you can see that they almost uniformly are showing declining growth this year, and sharp declines in the quarter for those who have reported.  Now we continue to have growth. And the reason for that is because some of this stuff is longer term and is somewhat mission-critical. I'm speaking about data, the stuff that's technology licenses, subscription, recurring revenue, all of that continues as is, and that's what is enabling us to continue to deliver growth. However, the parts of our business that are more discretionary. And when I say discretionary, I don't mean to say that our clients may decide simply not to go ahead. It happens, but that's a small proportion of what we sell. It means that it can be done later. It means that it can be done in a different way, perhaps in a \"slim-down version\", less -- better than we thought.  And so the consulting and analytics part of our business, which as you know is a bad quarter of our revenues. It is showing sharp declines, sharper than we would have expected. Some of the projects have simply fallen off, but the pipelines are still there. That's what gives us confidence for a rebound in '24. We know that these projects have to be done. The clients are just taking a lot more time to make a decision. They are negotiating us a lot longer and a lot more aggressively. And this is what has happened.  This is -- I mentioned in my introductory remarks, a few examples of significant wins in TAS, and these are almost uniformly these types of projects. Helping clients launch a -- launch products in new markets, helping them with their go-to-market strategies. These are things that have to be done. And the project that we won in the quarter, frankly, some of those we should have won in the first quarter. They were in the pipeline since last year. So the decision time lines have expanded and the terms have been tougher. That's what has happened. I hope that color helps you. Thank you, Luke. Yes, you're absolutely correct that an FSP award comes at a lower booked margin than a full-service program. And you're also correct that this has -- is a cyclical development in the industry. I recall very well that at the time we did the merger 7 years ago, and coming into at the time, the legacy Quintiles organization, it was explained to me that the industry was now in the midst of a switch from full service to FSP. And as a result of which, Quintiles at the time had pulled back from servicing these clients because they didn't want to do FSP work given its lower margin profile.  I thought at the time there was a strategic error and we since then, of course, have decided to serve our clients with the full portfolio of services, including FSP and including full service and including hybrid and everything else. We serve clients. We don't push offerings. So if at this point in time, our clients are interested in more FSP or more hybrid models, that's what we will sell to them. It is then incumbent upon us to work on our cost structure to try to recover margins when we execute the work at a higher level than when we booked it out, and try to continue to develop cost containment and cost reductions so that we can offset the margin mix impact.  Look, we are a very large company we are executing thousands of trials at any given point in time. We manage a portfolio of businesses. Once again, we are about a $15 billion revenue company growing mid-single digits before your account for the step down in COVID revenue and the FX headwind. And we are at adjusted EBITDA margins of 24%, and we are expanding those margins. And we intend to continue that model well into the future despite cyclical headwinds that may occur, whether it is a tougher spending environment on the TAS side, whether it is a switch to FSP from some of our large pharma clients.  You saw in the quarter, again, $2.3 billion of services fee revenue, excluding pass-through bookings resulting in a book-to-bill of 1.4x, again, a historic high in our bookings. That included some FSP wins, again, not anything that would move the needle dramatically. But on a large number like this, you can see that we have less pass-throughs, that will materialize in our margin mix in the next couple of years, not next quarter, obviously, and we fully intend to offset that with our cost reductions and continue to increase our margins. Thank you for your question. The first question and the second question, I'll give to the technicians here. The first question on capital allocation. Look, it's fascinating, we are getting from our investors 2 different messages. One is please, please reduce your leverage. And one is, please, please do not change your leverage. And I have to tell you, we historically have been living with a level of leverage that's admittedly higher than others. We are at around 3.5 net leverage right now. I want to just -- for the anecdote, tells you that we've had in the past, much higher levels of leverage and a much more difficult market conditions and much lower levels of cash flow conversion.  And we've lived with that nicely because we have a highly predictable, high-visibility business model. Our strategy has been, a, to invest in the business in capital expenditures, to innovate new products and services; b, by companies that add, that are accretive and enable us to grow faster; and, c, return money to our shareholders through share repurchases. And that has been a very effective strategy, especially when rates were extremely low.  I remind you that just 2 years ago, treasuries were at 0, 0. And I'm very glad that we had that amount of leverage. Today, treasury is at, what, 5.5? I mean we've never seen in history, such a sharp dramatic rise in interest rates in such a short period of time. Obviously, we are paying the brunt of our leverage, the price of that leverage because of that, and it's costing us 10 points, 10 points of growth in earnings per share.  However, I would argue that mid-single-digit treasury rates is high versus 0, but it's not the end of the world. I will also tell you that we though the brunt of that sharp increase in interest rates this year in '23. And assuming like everyone else assumes that the curve, if it needs to be believe indicates a stabilization and even a potential decline, then that should be a headwind -- I'm sorry, a tailwind to our EPS going forward, and we don't anticipate a sharp increase in rates or interest expense going forward.  And so therefore, we should be able to resume strong EPS growth going forward. That's for the leverage. Having said that, we are working as we speak on, obviously, refinancing and readdressing some of the shorter-term maturities, which we have in '24, in '25, and we'll do that soon, hopefully. And that will continue to alleviate that headwind that we faced this year in interest expense and continue to stabilize our balance sheet. But from there, at least, we intend to continue to use our cash to invest in the business and do acquisitions and share repurchase, especially at the levels where we are. Thank you for your question. Any comment on the swap? Yes. Thank you very much."

I would now like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO.\nAri Bousbib: Thank you, Nick, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today to discuss our second quarter results. IQVIA delivered another quarter of strong operational results with 9% organic revenue growth, excluding the impact of foreign exchange and COVID-related work. The demand environment for the industry continues to be healthy, which supports our confidence in the long-term outlook for our businesses. Emerging biotech funding continued its healthy trend. According to BioWorld, second quarter EBP funding was $17.1 billion, up 33% versus prior year and up 10% sequentially versus Q1. Clinical trial starts were up over 10% sequentially compared to Q1 2023. FDA approvals continued their strong momentum, which is a positive indicator for our commercial businesses going forward. There were 26 approvals in the first half of the year, and that's up 30% versus the average of the prior five years. M&A activity in the biopharma sector remains strong with over $90 billion spent in the first half. 2023 is on pace to be one of the largest years in the last decade in both value of transactions and number of deals, and that is with a high interest rate environment. Our Q2 demand metrics showed continued healthy growth. Net new bookings were just under $2.7 billion, which was our second largest quarter ever and represented a quarterly book-to-bill of 1.28. By the way, before I move on, I know that some of you inquired last quarter about our services book-to-bill, and I think some of you are concerned about what that may have implied about our performance. So just to remove any concern, our services book-to-bill this quarter was, Nick, 1.34?\nNick Childs: Correct.\nAri Bousbib: 1.34. And our trailing 12-month book-to-bill is 1.34 overall. And again, for those who asked, it's the same on a services basis. Once again, going forward, if there is any meaningful deviation between our total book-to-bill ratio and the services book-to-bill, then we will let you know. Otherwise, you can assume they are roughly the same. Now as a result of these bookings, our backlog reached $28.4 billion, growing 11% versus prior year on both reported and constant currency basis. Another metric we track is our quarterly RFP flow. And this past quarter, it was the largest ever. It was up 8% year-over-year and 6% sequentially. For the longer-term fundamentals of the industry are certainly very positive. Now in the short term, our clients have continued to be cautious with their spending due to the uncertain macroeconomic conditions and that's reflected primarily, I would say, only in some subsegments of our commercial business segments, that is TAS and CSMS. In the second quarter, these businesses were stable with the TAS segment growing in the second quarter at a rate consistent with the first quarter as we had anticipated in our guidance. Of course, last time we spoke, we expected client spending in these commercial businesses to show signs of acceleration by now. But unfortunately, they have continued to delay decisions. Our pipeline is still there. However, decisions keep being moved to the right. And as a result, we now expect these commercial businesses to perform for the balance of the year similarly to what we saw in the first half. For the TAS segment, that represents approximately 6% growth organically, excluding the impact of FX and the COVID step-down. And that 6% growth organically for the year is actually very strong in the current environment. With that, let's review the second quarter results. Revenue for the second quarter grew 5.3% on a reported basis and 5.5% at constant currency compared to last year. And again, excluding COVID-related work from both periods, we grew the top line 9% at constant currency on an organic basis. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA increased 8%, driven by the revenue growth and ongoing cost management discipline. Second quarter adjusted diluted EPS of $2.43, as expected, faced the headwind of the step-up in interest expense and the UK corporate tax rate change. Excluding the impact of these non-operational items, our adjusted diluted EPS growth would have been 14%. A few highlights of business activity. IQVIA has been awarded a significant contract with a top 10 pharma to implement our full commercial data and analytics solution suite. This suite of offerings will benefit our clients by utilizing insights powered by AI, such as personalized engagements with HCPs; leveraging our multichannel capabilities, including digital; precise geographical sales targeting; and better cost efficiency by reducing the number of resources that are manually generating insights. This initiative positions IQVIA as a strategic partner with this large top 10 pharma client for AI-powered data and analytics solutions. Another top 10 pharma extended and broadened an analytics project to track the sales performance of their top-selling immunotherapy oncology drug in Europe. The project allows commercial teams to continuously track brand performance, factoring AI-generated insights and improve, as a result, execution across seven cancer indications in over 25 countries. In another win, IQVIA was awarded a significant contract from another top 10 pharma client to deploy our OCE Optimizer application globally. This is an AI-powered multichannel sales management application that optimizes HCP engagement in real-time. IQVIA was selected over two other competitor solutions because of the seamless integration that OCE offers with the client's current ecosystem, the superior AI capability and our successful history with these clients in previous global system implementations. Also, in the quarter, IQVIA was selected by multiple clients to deliver regulatory-mandated plus post-approval safety studies in Europe. In each case, IQVIA was selected over preferred providers due to our deep expertise in sourcing data from the local health systems in Europe and our ability to bring multiple databases together in a harmonized manner for research. We were awarded a five-year pregnancy exposure study from an EBP customer to collect and analyze health information from women who take prescription medicines or vaccines during pregnancy and compare results with women who have not taken them. We won this award because of our rich experience in post-approval safety studies in pregnancy and deep experience in epidemiology. In the quarter, IQVIA has been recognized by the Artificial Intelligence Breakthrough Awards with the prestigious Best AI-Based Solution for Healthcare award. IQVIA was recognized for its AI software, including natural language processing and proprietary large language models technology, which analyzes complex and unstructured patient data to provide unique insights into patient care and disease states. This technology is helping clinicians identify and screen at-risk patients, enabling targeted intervention to patients in need. IQVIA continues to differentiate in the application of AI analytics with two of the top 10 pharma companies designating their use of IQVIA AI as their innovation of the year. In addition, both Databricks and Snowflake separately named IQVIA their 2023 Health and Life Sciences Partner of the Year. These awards recognize AI and tech partners for their exceptional accomplishments and joint collaboration. There's a lot going on at IQVIA with generative AI, and we will likely be discussing this at the appropriate time at a future investor meeting. Let me now move to R&DS segment, which had another strong quarter, including several key wins. Our expertise in oncology continues to be a differentiator for us. In the quarter, a midsized pharma company awarded IQVIA two large Phase III trials for gastric and prostate cancer, which are expected to last about six years. The client selected IQVIA due to our therapeutic expertise and infrastructure to run global complex oncology studies as well as our global data assets. Also this quarter, a large FSP client renewed their partnership with IQVIA as a preferred provider this time without soliciting competing bids. This client was a historical lockout account for the historical Quintiles legacy company. We won here due to our FSP expertise, scale and delivery capabilities. In our lab business, the top 10 pharma awarded us a large study in the quarter for a novel drug that improves the quality of life of patients suffering from a serious autoimmune disease that impacts one out of 50 people worldwide. This study is our clients' top R&D program, and it has positioned IQVIA as the largest laboratory service provider for this client. Lastly, I'm proud to share that Sheetal Telang, Vice President of Therapeutic Strategy at IQVIA, has been honored with the 2023 Rising Star Award by the Healthcare Business Women's Association. Sheetal earned the award for strong and innovative leadership of critical industry initiatives, including by increasing diversity and inclusion levels among patients enrolled in clinical trials. I will now turn it over to Ron for more details on our financial performance.\nRon Bruehlman: Thanks, Ari, and good morning, everyone. Let's start by reviewing revenue. Second quarter revenue of $3.728 billion grew 5.3% on a reported basis and 5.5% at constant currency. In the quarter, COVID-rebated revenues were approximately $120 million, which is down about $140 million versus the second quarter of 2022. Excluding all COVID-rebated work from both this year and last, organic growth at constant currency was 9%. Technology & Analytics Solutions revenue was $1.456 billion. That was up 3.4% on both a reported and constant currency basis. Excluding all COVID-related work, organic growth at constant currency in TAS was 6%. R&D Solutions revenue of $2.096 billion was up 7.5% reported and 7.6% at constant currency. Excluding all COVID-related work, organic growth at constant currency in R&DS was 12%. Lastly, Contract Sales and Medical Solutions, or CSMS, revenue of $176 million declined 3.8% reported and was flat at constant currency. Total company first half revenue was $7.380 billion, which was up 3.8% on a reported basis and 5.1% at constant currency. Excluding all COVID-related work, organic growth at constant currency for the first half was 10%. Technology & Analytics Solutions revenue for the first half was $2.900 billion. That's up 1.9% reported and 3.2% at constant currency. And excluding all COVID-related work, organic growth at constant currency and TAS was 6% for the first half. R&D Solutions first half revenue of $4.122 billion was up 6.1% at actual FX rates and 7.1% at constant currency. Excluding all COVID-related work, organic growth at constant currency in R&DS was 14% in the first half. Contract Sales and Medical Solutions, or CSMS, first half revenue of $358 million declined 5.3% reported and 0.5% in constant currency. Let's move down the P&L now. Adjusted EBITDA was $864 million for the second quarter, which represented growth of 8% while first half adjusted EBITDA was $1.715 billion, which was up 6.4% year-over-year. Second quarter GAAP net income was $297 million, and GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.59. For the first half, we had GAAP net income of $586 million or $3.12 of earnings per diluted share. Adjusted net income was $454 million for the second quarter, and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $2.43. For the first half, adjusted net income was $916 million or $4.88 per share. Now, excluding the year-over-year impact of the step-up in interest rates and the increase in the UK corporate tax rate, adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 14% in the second quarter and 11% for the first half. As already reviewed, R&D Solutions delivered another quarter of excellent bookings. Backlog at June 30 stood at a record $28.4 billion, which is up 11% year-over-year and up approximately 40% in the last three years. Reviewing the balance sheet. As of June 30, cash and cash equivalents totaled $1.382 billion, and gross debt was $13.777 billion, which resulted in net debt of $12.395 billion. Our net leverage ratio ended the quarter at 3.59 times trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA. Second quarter cash flow from operations was $402 million and capital expenditures were $160 million, resulting in free cash flow of $242 million. As we previously announced, in May, we issued $1.250 billion of senior secured and unsecured notes. The proceeds from these notes were used to pay down our revolving credit facility. We also took advantage during the quarter of our stock price multiples falling to 2017 levels and deployed $490 million to repurchase 2.5 million shares at an average price of $194 per share. In the first half, share repurchases totaled $619 million. Now we ended the quarter with $736 million of share repurchase authorization remaining under the program. But our Board of Directors just authorized a $2 billion increase to our share repurchase plan, which brings the authorization to $2.736 billion as of today. Let's turn to the guidance. We're updating our guidance to address the impact of the continued client cautiousness we've been experiencing in the commercial business. We now anticipate this cautiousness persisting for the balance of the year. And reflecting the reduced expectations for both TAS and CSMS, we currently expect revenue to be between $15.050 billion and $15.175 billion, which represents year-over-year growth of 4.4% to 5.3%. Total company organic growth at constant currency, excluding COVID-related work, is now expected to be between 8% and 9% for the year. This revenue guidance continues to assume about 100 basis points of contribution from acquisitions and a step down in COVID-related revenue of approximately $600 million versus 2022. By segment, we now expect TAS to grow approximately 6%, consistent with what we saw in the first half. Our expectations for the R&DS segment are unchanged and consistent with our previous guidance. And finally, we now expect CSMS revenue to decline approximately 3%. And all of these growth rates are organic at constant currency, excluding COVID-related work. Now, to reflect these changes in revenue, we're also updating our guidance for full year adjusted EBITDA to $3.600 billion to $3.635 billion, which represents year-over-year growth of 7.6% to 8.6%. And lastly, we're updating our guidance for adjusted diluted EPS to $10.20 to $10.45, representing year-over-year growth of 0.4% to 2.9%. This adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance includes the year-over-year impact of the step-up in interest rates and the increase in the UK corporate tax rate. And together, these non-operational items reduced the year-over-year growth rate by approximately 12 percentage points. So excluding these items, adjusted diluted earnings per share is expected to grow 12% to 15%. Now let's move to our third quarter guidance. In Q3, we expect revenue to be between $3.760 billion and $3.810 billion or growth of 3.9% to 5.3% on a constant currency basis and 5.6% to 7% on a reported basis. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $880 million and $895 million, up 8.1% to 10%. And adjusted diluted EPS is expected to be between $2.39 and $2.49, declining 3.6% to growing 0.4% year-over-year. Excluding the step-up in interest expense and the increase in the UK tax rate, this translates into third quarter adjusted diluted EPS growth of between 11% and 15%. Now, I should note that all of this guidance assumes that foreign currency rates as of July 31 continue for the balance of the year. So, let me summarize. We delivered another strong quarter of financial performance, including organic revenue growth of 9%, excluding the impact of foreign exchange and COVID-related work. Our quarterly net new bookings were the second highest ever at just under $2.7 billion, and our industry-leading backlog reached a new record of $28.4 billion, up 11% year-over-year. Underlying demand in the industry and our business remains healthy with our RFP flow reaching a new record high in the quarter, up 6% sequentially versus Q1 2023. We took advantage of the stock price multiples falling to 2017 levels during the quarter and bought back almost $0.5 billion worth of shares at an average of $194 per share. On top of this, our Board of Directors authorized a $2 billion increase to our share repurchase authorization. And finally, while client cautiousness and their discretionary spending is slightly reduced, our short-term outlook on the commercial side of the business, that is TAS and CSMS, the fundamentals of both the clinical and commercial markets continue to be healthy and support our confidence in the longer-term outlook for our company. And with that, let me hand it back over to the operator to open the phones for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll go first this morning to David Windley at Jefferies.\nDavid Windley: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Ari, you talked about a pretty substantial increase in trial start activity, which is encouraging, certainly. And the bookings, as you highlighted, are also pretty strong. I'm wondering if -- kind of on two points, if that is reflective of maybe pharma companies -- pharma and biotech companies kind of getting about business after some period of evaluation of pipelines; and then two, if there's any improvement in the operational environment, thinking about site staffing, labor turnover, things like that, that would help throughput on the operational side? Thanks.\nAri Bousbib: Yes. Thank you, Dave. Look, the environment from what we have been able to see over the past 1.5 years, two years has not changed. I know there have been rumblings about EBP funding on one hand and concerns about the impact of the IRA on the other hand. And it's true large pharma is evaluating the longer-term impact of the IRA and in that context, taking another look at their portfolio of studies, both in-flight and to come. And some of them reprioritized some of the studies. But fundamentally, our business has been sound, strong, growing sequentially every quarter. Our bookings have been beating record after record. So we really did not experience any tremor at all in the market on the R&DS side. And this quarter was just a continuation of what we had experienced. With respect to your second question about staffing and site start-up, attrition rates are back to pre-pandemic levels, which is about 10% to 12%. So, from our -- on our end, things are good. We continue to actively recruit and hire because we're growing organically at a very high rate. And therefore, we need the people to execute the work. So that recruiting is targeted at meeting the incremental demand. Obviously, there's always competition for talent. And right now, we have about 87,000 employees, and we continue to recruit thousands of people a year. So that's on our end. With respect to the site staffing issues, they saw -- frankly, we continue to see some staffing issues at some sites, but it's really, to a lesser degree than in prior, let's say, probably half a year or three quarters, and it's already dramatically reduced. So really, we are essentially getting back. I'm not going to say to 100% staffing levels at the site because there's still, again, are sporadic issues here and there, but it's not -- you're correct, it's not the severe issues we experienced perhaps six months or nine months ago. So it's much improved. Thank you, David.\nDavid Windley: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll go next now to Ann Hynes at Mizuho.\nAnn Hynes: Hi. Good morning. I just want to dig into TAS a little bit more. Within TAS, I know there are several sub-segments. Can you just give us growth rates or declines within the sub-segments like consulting technology and real-world evidence? And also, I think most of the pressure is coming from the consultant segment. Can you tell us just what the margin drop-through is that? So if consultant is maybe like 25% of revenue, I think it is, what's the debt margin -- negative margin drop-through? That'd be great. Thank you.\nAri Bousbib: Okay. I don't think we disclosed by sub-segment, the margins, but it's very good margin, I think, put it this way. The consulting is good margin, and the analytics is also very strong margin. A lot of our analytics work is delivered out of offshore centers in Bangalore, in Manila. And we generate good margins. It's a lot of standardized work. We have workflows that we use in processes that over the years, we've refined. And that work -- when we say consulting, don't think McKenzie-type consulting. Consulting is really, again, a pricing market access study, a launch study, a sales force optimization study. So, these are operationally geared consulting services that our clients utilize to support often the launch of new drugs or the reprioritization of geographic markets or specific restructuring of their sales organization in certain geographies or in certain therapies, those types of projects. And it's not like they are not going to do them. Those must -- are must-do projects. But the environment, the climate, the higher interest rates has kind of put people on sort of on a hold pattern, if you will. The pipeline is there. No one is spending is. I am just not doing the project. And therefore, we would say, well, the prospects are lower. Now, we have -- the projects are still there, but the decision-making seems to be pushed to the right. We were hoping, frankly, up to two, three months ago that things would recover by now in terms of the decision-making and accelerate. And that's why we, frankly, we were hoping that we would get back to the 8%-or-so growth, higher single-digit growth for the TAS segment for the year. We were expecting a strong acceleration, but we haven't seen it materialize in the second quarter. And so as of now, based on what we've seen, I think it's prudent to say that this -- the type of growth rates we've seen for the segment as a whole, which is 6% organically at constant currency and not including the COVID impacts, it should be -- should continue the rest of the year. Thank you.\nAnn Hynes: Great. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll go next now to Eric Coldwell at Baird. Baird, excuse me.\nEric Coldwell: Thank you very much. I had the same question as Anne, and I just wanted to follow up on that. The way we think about TAS is for us broadly defined sub-segments, data, analytics, consulting, real-world evidence and technology. I'm curious, did any of this cautiousness or sluggishness, did it expand beyond the analytics and consulting side? What are the growth trends in data, real-world evidence, tech any nuances or changes there? And then I have one quick follow-up, if I might. Thank you.\nAri Bousbib: All right. Sure. Of course, Eric. Thank you. So let's start with data, right the core of the business. That has not changed. I would say 90-plus percent of our business for the year on the data side is just locked in by the month of December for the following year. So there's no change there. That's recurring revenue, and not much has happened there. The level of discretion in terms of data by here for the clients is much less than the analytics and consulting segment that we were just discussing. For the faster-growing businesses, real world and commercial tech, now let's take the technology suites. It's not like the revenue is a reflection of the sales in the year. It's -- the revenue generated in technology is longer cycle, corresponds to technology awards from prior periods, from prior years. So nothing has changed there on the revenue side. There is cautiousness, similar to consulting and analytics, on the technology side in terms of new buys and new transitions. There's a number of dislocation in technology going on right now, by the way, both on the clinical side and on the commercial side, the main CRM competitor decided to change their platform. So as a result, clients are kind reviewing their technology decisions on the technology side. We've got new innovations. We've got the main competitors there, Medidata and others and Oracle, are launching a new suite. So, there is dislocation. So, because of that, clients are kind of taking their time to review decisions, but that's not impacting our revenue in year. On the real-world side, again, some of these are longer-term studies. There is a little bit, but again, I don't think that we've seen it affect our revenue year that much. A little bit of cautiousness and perhaps a little bit of delay on the late-phase real-world studies that we've seen. Again, I'm just giving you a really high-level commentary here on -- just to really scratch the business. But fundamentally, it is a 25% piece of the TAS segment, that's consulting and analytics, that's essentially down year-over-year by, I think, about 5%, if I recall. And so everything else is pretty much stable as expected.\nEric Coldwell: Thank you.\nAri Bousbib: What's your follow-up?\nEric Coldwell: Yeah, Mike. Thank you for the follow-up. I know you don't tend to get into details on M& A in the quarter with -- typically, these are smaller companies, sometimes higher revenue multiples. But I did notice $426 million, I believe, spent on acquisitions this quarter. I was hoping to get some sense of directionally what that might have been.\nAri Bousbib: Yeah. And I think it was done towards the end of the quarter. I mean, I can tell you, so it's a company called Cognitive for which we paid almost $300 million, so clinical site network. As you know, as part of our strategy overall, we are -- we've been acquiring certain assets that have strong patient enrollment capability in specific therapies. So Cognitive is, in particular is strong in internal medicine, in CNS, in vaccines as well and has some large pharma customers. So, we -- the company is headquartered in Arizona. It's -- obviously, it's a significant multiple of revenue. But -- and we acquired that towards the end of the quarter. And we have a bunch of all smaller stuff over here, but that's the -- what else do we have here? We have a $36 million investment in a small--\nRon Bruehlman: We had one other site network we've acquired.\nAri Bousbib: Right, right, right. It management organization, yes. That was in psychiatry and smoking cessation. So again, highly specialized site benefit organization we've done a couple this past quarter.\nEric Coldwell: So you are starting to follow the path of what PPD and ICON have done in prior years with moving into the opening up the marketplace for actually being a hybrid SMO, but probably still at a very small scale, I would assume.\nAri Bousbib: Yes, yes -- no. So we had already -- we do have -- we had a network that we had started ourselves. But we -- you're correct. I don't think we -- I mean we bought maybe one other one last year, if I remember -- you're correct. Again, these are -- it's not like we are buying dozens of this, but there happens to be that coincidentally, we bought two in the quarter. And that's basically the bulk of the spend that you see there.\nEric Coldwell: Perfect. Thank you so much. Thank you.\nOperator: We'll go next now to Tejas Savant at Morgan Stanley.\nTejas Savant: Hi, guys. Good morning and thanks for the time this morning. Ron, maybe one for you and a quick follow-up on the M&A side for Ari as well, if I may. So Ron, first for you, I mean, margins in the midpoint look to be expanding nicely here into the fourth quarter as implied by your third quarter guide. Can you just walk us through sort of what drives your confidence in that sort of margin expansion into year-end? And then on the M&A side, Ari, we noticed that the Propel Media acquisition from earlier in the year is being blocked by the FTC at the moment. We had some new merger review guidelines, draft guidelines admittedly, put out a couple of weeks ago as well. Does it concern you that you need to sort of rejig your M&A strategy here in light of like some of these recent developments?\nRon Bruehlman: I'll take the margin question first, Tejas. Look, there were a couple of things here. Number one, we've had market expansion all year. So it's really good indicator that it's credible to say we're going to have it in the back half of the year. We have a number of productivity initiatives underway to reduce cost. And those tend to be, of course, more back-end loaded. You get more benefit as you go through the year. So that's certainly going to support margins in the back half of the year. I think you have -- another thing that's happening is some of the labor cost pressure that we've been feeling over time on a year-over-year basis. You're starting to kind of lap that and get more pricing benefit in as well. So it's a combination of factors. Now all those factors overcome a little bit of drag from mix. For instance, the info business, which is -- tends to be a profitable business, never grows as fast as the rest of the business. So we're very confident in the margin outlook for the back half of the year, and those are the reasons.\nAri Bousbib: Yes. And the question on the acquisition that we're trying to do that we -- really is, I think, about a year. You know that we have a strategy to continue to grow in the digital space. Our strategy remains intact. We've seen those merger guidelines. Look, I'm not going to comment on the pending litigation with the FTC because planning litigation. We continue to believe strongly that there is absolutely zero logic to blocking this transaction. But we are aware that there are a few novel theories that are being promoted by this administration of the FTC. And listen, administrations come and go. And we are not going to change our M&A strategy. We believe that we are still a very small player in a hugely massive digital promotional market. I mean you've got the Googles of this world, giants that also participate in this market. And we have a right to participate in this market. We are serving the life sciences industry and their needs. And our customers welcome that development and our ability to offer those services. We believe that this acquisition actually increases the degree of intensity of competition in this market and actually allows all other participants to counter the essential strong behemoths that dominate the digital space today. So we just simply do not understand the FTC's arguments, and I'll leave it at that.\nTejas Savant: Thanks, guys. Appreciate the color.\nAri Bousbib: You\u2019re welcome.\nOperator: We'll go next now to Luke Sergott at Barclays.\nLuke Sergott: Good morning, guys. Thanks again for the questions. So you were talking about a little bit about decision-making getting elongated and I know that, that was on parts of the TAS business. But can you talk -- can you give us a sense of how much longer that has gotten? It typically takes for you guys, like, let's say, two months or three months to close a certain deal and now that that's six months. Just give us some type of framework on how long that has gotten. And then as you guys think about things recovering, I assume that there's also some delayed decision-making on the big -- the R&DS side. So when things start to turn around, is it safe to assume that the RDS side comes back before the TAS side when -- on this decision-making process?\nAri Bousbib: Thanks for the question, Luke. I'm not sure what you mean by R&DS coming back. I mean it's very strong. The R&DS segment is not experiencing any delays in decision-making that we can see, frankly. Again, we had another record quarter of bookings. Nothing's changed there. And our RFP flow, again, is at a record level. I could spend time giving you stats on the -- on our leading indicator metrics on the R&DS side, a qualified pipeline and the pipeline overall and so on are at a record high, and recontinue our sales activities as before, again, nothing -- no sign of delaying decision making on R&DS side. I want to be very clear on that. On the TAS segment and CSMS and again, it's largely affecting the consulting and analytics segment. And I would say almost exclusively, the issue is I can't quantify in month. I mean the stuff that's in our pipe that we've had since the end of last year. And here we are, August 1, and the clients on that specific opportunity still hasn't decided to -- everything is negotiated, and they know they have to do the study, but they could do the study next year. So. whatever clients -- on that side of the business, clients are basically saying to themselves, well, do I need to do this now? Or can I keep the can another few months? So. this stuff has been our pipeline six months, and we haven't taken it out because the client still is telling us that they want to do it. They just haven't signed yet. So, yes, I mean it's a bit in the time frame that you're talking about. It would have taken a month or two, and it's taking six months or more.\nLuke Sergott: Okay. And I guess I -- sorry for implying that you guys were seeing the RDS weakness or delays there in decision-making. It's just going more of an overall pharma comment. And on that decision-making on the TAS, is that more due to them, like your customers, focusing more on where they're going to place their bets and deploy that capital for the clinical trials and then kind of the TAS stuff is like a secondary knock-on or secondary benefit that you guys offer?\nAri Bousbib: It's really all over. Every client has -- it's hard to -- it weighs on everyone. Is there going to be a recession? Is there going to be a recession? Maybe we should delay the launch in Portugal. Maybe we should not look at our sales force now. If we do this next year, maybe that project that we were planning to do -- to evaluate whether we should adjust pricing in consideration of the IRA implications and so on, on this drug, in that market, in that therapy, we push it back. So it's not like I can give you a blanket answer. It's just the environment, the atmospherics are such that -- look, I'm sure someone is going to ask me a question, and I'm assuming it's going to be Shlomo, but our cash flow wasn't too special this past quarter and is the same thing. Why are large pharma companies that are sitting on massive piles of cash not paying their bills on time? Our collections are not where they should be. And it's just -- it's a high interest environment. So people tend to just find all kinds of reasons why there was a comma missing in an invoice, and therefore, we can't pay you and send me by the invoice in two weeks. It's just the environment. I don't have another answer.\nLuke Sergott: Got you. That's helpful. Thank you.\nAri Bousbib: Thank you, Luke.\nOperator: And we'll go next now to Shlomo Rosenbaum at Stifel.\nAri Bousbib: Here we go.\nShlomo Rosenbaum: Hey, Ari. I still get a question, even though you asked that one, right?\nAri Bousbib: Yes, yes.\nShlomo Rosenbaum: All right. Thank you. Actually, just -- I wanted to touch on one, just a metric and then maybe follow-up with another one just more oil broad. Just if you could talk to -- just tell us what the growth rate on real-world evidence was in the quarter. And then, Ari, maybe just if you could talk a little bit about, in terms of AI, you gave us a little bit of a teaser. But can you talk a little bit about just where you might have unique advantages, either because of the investments you've made in AI over the last bunch of years or just because of the uniqueness of the information that you've aggregated? Is there anything that's out there in market that's really unique right now? Or is this really stuff that's going to be on the comp? Thank you.\nAri Bousbib: Thank you. So quickly on the real-world evidence, it's been double-digits for one and it's still strong double-digits. So nothing changed there. With respect to AI, we're obviously very excited by the opportunity. This is not new for us, right? I mean we've been working on this for a long time. We've invested since 2015, 2016, and we own the number of market-leading and proprietary AI software engines. We've dedicated AI/ML resources for a long time. And we are extremely well positioned. We apply AI in drug development, discovery, clinical development, safety, market access, medical affairs and, of course, in commercialization to inform promotional and sales and targeting activities. We are using AI in NLP processes, in translations of medical documentations and protocols. That's for the offering part of the business, if you will. On the internal side, we've applied AI to many of our own internal processes. For example, lead to cash, we -- really across a set of processes to create efficiencies operationally. So it is a great opportunity for us and has been for the past few years. Now, how do you use AI to gain competitive advantages? It helps optimize site identification based on the patient populations that we derive from our -- that we mine in our databases, helps optimize patient recruitment techniques based on data and analytical footprint. It helps optimize development -- drug development protocols. We can -- we have support -- it has built predictive enrollment models based on all the protocol criteria thresholds. You're familiar with the next best application in our OCE suite, which leverages the know-how and the historical data to create predictive models of engagement with customers. We've also been developing a novel biomarker database with IQVIA's own natural language processing tools. We've used it in Alzheimer's studies to have an early identification and recruitment of patients with most likely to develop Alzheimer's. A lot of activities, frankly, to expand patient pathways. So if you look into -- I'm sure it's somewhere in our websites or literature, we have over 150 patent pending methodologies and algorithms, more than 30 predictive data disease models, more than 300 life science-specific analytical libraries, I mean I could go on and on. We've got a lot of stuff here on proprietary material in AI. Now this whole buzz around generative AI, as people are finding out, it's not so easy to apply and actually derive precise and relevant insights. And I'm looking forward to presenting why even using -- and by the way, we are working with -- everyone has announced significant generative AI applications and models because it's really -- as always, it's -- if you don't have access to the business rules and to the relevant content, you're going to come up with what they call hallucinations. And we've tried it and we are working with partners -- with technology partners, and it's very clear that we have the sauce internally here that would enable those large language model tools to be a lot more effective and accurate and precise than what they are today in the world of life sciences, where they basically only have access to what's available on the Internet or on public sources. That's why I can say now, but again, it's a very exciting development. Obviously, we are very busy leveraging internally. And there was a question earlier on margins and margin expansion, and it's one of the several initiatives that is helping us generate margin expansion.\nShlomo Rosenbaum: Thank you.\nOperator: We go next now to Jailendra Singh at Truist.\nJailendra Singh: Thank you, and thanks for taking my questions. I actually want to ask about data and information offerings business for you guys. One of your competitors recently talked about coming up with competitive solutions in that space for pharma companies. I understand this is a more stable and high-margin, very sticky business for you guys. But just remind us about your positioning there and what makes the barriers to entry high in that business.\nAri Bousbib: You are asking about the data business?\nJailendra Singh: Yes, yes.\nAri Bousbib: Okay.\nNick Childs: Comments that Dave has made in terms of data.\nAri Bousbib: Okay, okay. Yes. I mean, look, I don't know what to say here. It's just not the same planet, the only way I can put it. The scale, the global presence in over 100 countries, the level of granularity, the infrastructure -- the IT infrastructure to process, cleanse, cure, connect all that data on a global basis, the business rooms. I mean look at health care, data is chaos. It's -- you can have as much data as you want. If you don't understand it and connect it and cleanse it and know what you're dealing with, it's not really relevant. We have data on about 1.4 billion...\nNick Childs: 1.2 billion.\nAri Bousbib: 1.2 billion patients. And that -- I don't think there's anyone that has anything resembling what we have. I mean I just don't know what it's like.\nRon Bruehlman: We've been at it since the early 1950s, Jailendra. That should tell you something. I mean you don't -- there's nothing that would stop somebody technically from recreating what we have in data if they have 70 years and all the expertise we have.\nJailendra Singh: Got it. Thanks a lot.\nRon Bruehlman: Thank you.\nNick Childs: Okay. Well, thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We look forward to speaking to all of you again on our third quarter earnings call. The team and I will be available the rest of the day to take any other follow-up questions you may have. Thanks for joining.\nOperator: Thank you again, ladies and gentlemen. We'll conclude the IQVIA Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. But thank you all so much for joining us, and wish you all a great day. Good bye.",

            "name": "Ron Bruehlman",
            "content": "Thanks, Ari, and good morning, everyone. Let's start by reviewing revenue. Second quarter revenue of $3.728 billion grew 5.3% on a reported basis and 5.5% at constant currency. In the quarter, COVID-rebated revenues were approximately $120 million, which is down about $140 million versus the second quarter of 2022. Excluding all COVID-rebated work from both this year and last, organic growth at constant currency was 9%. Technology & Analytics Solutions revenue was $1.456 billion. That was up 3.4% on both a reported and constant currency basis. Excluding all COVID-related work, organic growth at constant currency in TAS was 6%. R&D Solutions revenue of $2.096 billion was up 7.5% reported and 7.6% at constant currency. Excluding all COVID-related work, organic growth at constant currency in R&DS was 12%. Lastly, Contract Sales and Medical Solutions, or CSMS, revenue of $176 million declined 3.8% reported and was flat at constant currency. Total company first half revenue was $7.380 billion, which was up 3.8% on a reported basis and 5.1% at constant currency. Excluding all COVID-related work, organic growth at constant currency for the first half was 10%. Technology & Analytics Solutions revenue for the first half was $2.900 billion. That's up 1.9% reported and 3.2% at constant currency. And excluding all COVID-related work, organic growth at constant currency and TAS was 6% for the first half. R&D Solutions first half revenue of $4.122 billion was up 6.1% at actual FX rates and 7.1% at constant currency. Excluding all COVID-related work, organic growth at constant currency in R&DS was 14% in the first half. Contract Sales and Medical Solutions, or CSMS, first half revenue of $358 million declined 5.3% reported and 0.5% in constant currency. Let's move down the P&L now. Adjusted EBITDA was $864 million for the second quarter, which represented growth of 8% while first half adjusted EBITDA was $1.715 billion, which was up 6.4% year-over-year. Second quarter GAAP net income was $297 million, and GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.59. For the first half, we had GAAP net income of $586 million or $3.12 of earnings per diluted share. Adjusted net income was $454 million for the second quarter, and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $2.43. For the first half, adjusted net income was $916 million or $4.88 per share. Now, excluding the year-over-year impact of the step-up in interest rates and the increase in the UK corporate tax rate, adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 14% in the second quarter and 11% for the first half. As already reviewed, R&D Solutions delivered another quarter of excellent bookings. Backlog at June 30 stood at a record $28.4 billion, which is up 11% year-over-year and up approximately 40% in the last three years. Reviewing the balance sheet. As of June 30, cash and cash equivalents totaled $1.382 billion, and gross debt was $13.777 billion, which resulted in net debt of $12.395 billion. Our net leverage ratio ended the quarter at 3.59 times trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA. Second quarter cash flow from operations was $402 million and capital expenditures were $160 million, resulting in free cash flow of $242 million. As we previously announced, in May, we issued $1.250 billion of senior secured and unsecured notes. The proceeds from these notes were used to pay down our revolving credit facility. We also took advantage during the quarter of our stock price multiples falling to 2017 levels and deployed $490 million to repurchase 2.5 million shares at an average price of $194 per share. In the first half, share repurchases totaled $619 million. Now we ended the quarter with $736 million of share repurchase authorization remaining under the program. But our Board of Directors just authorized a $2 billion increase to our share repurchase plan, which brings the authorization to $2.736 billion as of today. Let's turn to the guidance. We're updating our guidance to address the impact of the continued client cautiousness we've been experiencing in the commercial business. We now anticipate this cautiousness persisting for the balance of the year. And reflecting the reduced expectations for both TAS and CSMS, we currently expect revenue to be between $15.050 billion and $15.175 billion, which represents year-over-year growth of 4.4% to 5.3%. Total company organic growth at constant currency, excluding COVID-related work, is now expected to be between 8% and 9% for the year. This revenue guidance continues to assume about 100 basis points of contribution from acquisitions and a step down in COVID-related revenue of approximately $600 million versus 2022. By segment, we now expect TAS to grow approximately 6%, consistent with what we saw in the first half. Our expectations for the R&DS segment are unchanged and consistent with our previous guidance. And finally, we now expect CSMS revenue to decline approximately 3%. And all of these growth rates are organic at constant currency, excluding COVID-related work. Now, to reflect these changes in revenue, we're also updating our guidance for full year adjusted EBITDA to $3.600 billion to $3.635 billion, which represents year-over-year growth of 7.6% to 8.6%. And lastly, we're updating our guidance for adjusted diluted EPS to $10.20 to $10.45, representing year-over-year growth of 0.4% to 2.9%. This adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance includes the year-over-year impact of the step-up in interest rates and the increase in the UK corporate tax rate. And together, these non-operational items reduced the year-over-year growth rate by approximately 12 percentage points. So excluding these items, adjusted diluted earnings per share is expected to grow 12% to 15%. Now let's move to our third quarter guidance. In Q3, we expect revenue to be between $3.760 billion and $3.810 billion or growth of 3.9% to 5.3% on a constant currency basis and 5.6% to 7% on a reported basis. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $880 million and $895 million, up 8.1% to 10%. And adjusted diluted EPS is expected to be between $2.39 and $2.49, declining 3.6% to growing 0.4% year-over-year. Excluding the step-up in interest expense and the increase in the UK tax rate, this translates into third quarter adjusted diluted EPS growth of between 11% and 15%. Now, I should note that all of this guidance assumes that foreign currency rates as of July 31 continue for the balance of the year. So, let me summarize. We delivered another strong quarter of financial performance, including organic revenue growth of 9%, excluding the impact of foreign exchange and COVID-related work. Our quarterly net new bookings were the second highest ever at just under $2.7 billion, and our industry-leading backlog reached a new record of $28.4 billion, up 11% year-over-year. Underlying demand in the industry and our business remains healthy with our RFP flow reaching a new record high in the quarter, up 6% sequentially versus Q1 2023. We took advantage of the stock price multiples falling to 2017 levels during the quarter and bought back almost $0.5 billion worth of shares at an average of $194 per share. On top of this, our Board of Directors authorized a $2 billion increase to our share repurchase authorization. And finally, while client cautiousness and their discretionary spending is slightly reduced, our short-term outlook on the commercial side of the business, that is TAS and CSMS, the fundamentals of both the clinical and commercial markets continue to be healthy and support our confidence in the longer-term outlook for our company. And with that, let me hand it back over to the operator to open the phones for Q&A. We had one other site network we've acquired. I'll take the margin question first, Tejas. Look, there were a couple of things here. Number one, we've had market expansion all year. So it's really good indicator that it's credible to say we're going to have it in the back half of the year. We have a number of productivity initiatives underway to reduce cost. And those tend to be, of course, more back-end loaded. You get more benefit as you go through the year. So that's certainly going to support margins in the back half of the year. I think you have -- another thing that's happening is some of the labor cost pressure that we've been feeling over time on a year-over-year basis. You're starting to kind of lap that and get more pricing benefit in as well. So it's a combination of factors. Now all those factors overcome a little bit of drag from mix. For instance, the info business, which is -- tends to be a profitable business, never grows as fast as the rest of the business. So we're very confident in the margin outlook for the back half of the year, and those are the reasons. We've been at it since the early 1950s, Jailendra. That should tell you something. I mean you don't -- there's nothing that would stop somebody technically from recreating what we have in data if they have 70 years and all the expertise we have. Thank you."

            "name": "Ari Bousbib",
            "content": "Thank you, Nick, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today to discuss our second quarter results. IQVIA delivered another quarter of strong operational results with 9% organic revenue growth, excluding the impact of foreign exchange and COVID-related work. The demand environment for the industry continues to be healthy, which supports our confidence in the long-term outlook for our businesses. Emerging biotech funding continued its healthy trend. According to BioWorld, second quarter EBP funding was $17.1 billion, up 33% versus prior year and up 10% sequentially versus Q1. Clinical trial starts were up over 10% sequentially compared to Q1 2023. FDA approvals continued their strong momentum, which is a positive indicator for our commercial businesses going forward. There were 26 approvals in the first half of the year, and that's up 30% versus the average of the prior five years. M&A activity in the biopharma sector remains strong with over $90 billion spent in the first half. 2023 is on pace to be one of the largest years in the last decade in both value of transactions and number of deals, and that is with a high interest rate environment. Our Q2 demand metrics showed continued healthy growth. Net new bookings were just under $2.7 billion, which was our second largest quarter ever and represented a quarterly book-to-bill of 1.28. By the way, before I move on, I know that some of you inquired last quarter about our services book-to-bill, and I think some of you are concerned about what that may have implied about our performance. So just to remove any concern, our services book-to-bill this quarter was, Nick, 1.34? 1.34. And our trailing 12-month book-to-bill is 1.34 overall. And again, for those who asked, it's the same on a services basis. Once again, going forward, if there is any meaningful deviation between our total book-to-bill ratio and the services book-to-bill, then we will let you know. Otherwise, you can assume they are roughly the same. Now as a result of these bookings, our backlog reached $28.4 billion, growing 11% versus prior year on both reported and constant currency basis. Another metric we track is our quarterly RFP flow. And this past quarter, it was the largest ever. It was up 8% year-over-year and 6% sequentially. For the longer-term fundamentals of the industry are certainly very positive. Now in the short term, our clients have continued to be cautious with their spending due to the uncertain macroeconomic conditions and that's reflected primarily, I would say, only in some subsegments of our commercial business segments, that is TAS and CSMS. In the second quarter, these businesses were stable with the TAS segment growing in the second quarter at a rate consistent with the first quarter as we had anticipated in our guidance. Of course, last time we spoke, we expected client spending in these commercial businesses to show signs of acceleration by now. But unfortunately, they have continued to delay decisions. Our pipeline is still there. However, decisions keep being moved to the right. And as a result, we now expect these commercial businesses to perform for the balance of the year similarly to what we saw in the first half. For the TAS segment, that represents approximately 6% growth organically, excluding the impact of FX and the COVID step-down. And that 6% growth organically for the year is actually very strong in the current environment. With that, let's review the second quarter results. Revenue for the second quarter grew 5.3% on a reported basis and 5.5% at constant currency compared to last year. And again, excluding COVID-related work from both periods, we grew the top line 9% at constant currency on an organic basis. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA increased 8%, driven by the revenue growth and ongoing cost management discipline. Second quarter adjusted diluted EPS of $2.43, as expected, faced the headwind of the step-up in interest expense and the UK corporate tax rate change. Excluding the impact of these non-operational items, our adjusted diluted EPS growth would have been 14%. A few highlights of business activity. IQVIA has been awarded a significant contract with a top 10 pharma to implement our full commercial data and analytics solution suite. This suite of offerings will benefit our clients by utilizing insights powered by AI, such as personalized engagements with HCPs; leveraging our multichannel capabilities, including digital; precise geographical sales targeting; and better cost efficiency by reducing the number of resources that are manually generating insights. This initiative positions IQVIA as a strategic partner with this large top 10 pharma client for AI-powered data and analytics solutions. Another top 10 pharma extended and broadened an analytics project to track the sales performance of their top-selling immunotherapy oncology drug in Europe. The project allows commercial teams to continuously track brand performance, factoring AI-generated insights and improve, as a result, execution across seven cancer indications in over 25 countries. In another win, IQVIA was awarded a significant contract from another top 10 pharma client to deploy our OCE Optimizer application globally. This is an AI-powered multichannel sales management application that optimizes HCP engagement in real-time. IQVIA was selected over two other competitor solutions because of the seamless integration that OCE offers with the client's current ecosystem, the superior AI capability and our successful history with these clients in previous global system implementations. Also, in the quarter, IQVIA was selected by multiple clients to deliver regulatory-mandated plus post-approval safety studies in Europe. In each case, IQVIA was selected over preferred providers due to our deep expertise in sourcing data from the local health systems in Europe and our ability to bring multiple databases together in a harmonized manner for research. We were awarded a five-year pregnancy exposure study from an EBP customer to collect and analyze health information from women who take prescription medicines or vaccines during pregnancy and compare results with women who have not taken them. We won this award because of our rich experience in post-approval safety studies in pregnancy and deep experience in epidemiology. In the quarter, IQVIA has been recognized by the Artificial Intelligence Breakthrough Awards with the prestigious Best AI-Based Solution for Healthcare award. IQVIA was recognized for its AI software, including natural language processing and proprietary large language models technology, which analyzes complex and unstructured patient data to provide unique insights into patient care and disease states. This technology is helping clinicians identify and screen at-risk patients, enabling targeted intervention to patients in need. IQVIA continues to differentiate in the application of AI analytics with two of the top 10 pharma companies designating their use of IQVIA AI as their innovation of the year. In addition, both Databricks and Snowflake separately named IQVIA their 2023 Health and Life Sciences Partner of the Year. These awards recognize AI and tech partners for their exceptional accomplishments and joint collaboration. There's a lot going on at IQVIA with generative AI, and we will likely be discussing this at the appropriate time at a future investor meeting. Let me now move to R&DS segment, which had another strong quarter, including several key wins. Our expertise in oncology continues to be a differentiator for us. In the quarter, a midsized pharma company awarded IQVIA two large Phase III trials for gastric and prostate cancer, which are expected to last about six years. The client selected IQVIA due to our therapeutic expertise and infrastructure to run global complex oncology studies as well as our global data assets. Also this quarter, a large FSP client renewed their partnership with IQVIA as a preferred provider this time without soliciting competing bids. This client was a historical lockout account for the historical Quintiles legacy company. We won here due to our FSP expertise, scale and delivery capabilities. In our lab business, the top 10 pharma awarded us a large study in the quarter for a novel drug that improves the quality of life of patients suffering from a serious autoimmune disease that impacts one out of 50 people worldwide. This study is our clients' top R&D program, and it has positioned IQVIA as the largest laboratory service provider for this client. Lastly, I'm proud to share that Sheetal Telang, Vice President of Therapeutic Strategy at IQVIA, has been honored with the 2023 Rising Star Award by the Healthcare Business Women's Association. Sheetal earned the award for strong and innovative leadership of critical industry initiatives, including by increasing diversity and inclusion levels among patients enrolled in clinical trials. I will now turn it over to Ron for more details on our financial performance. Yes. Thank you, Dave. Look, the environment from what we have been able to see over the past 1.5 years, two years has not changed. I know there have been rumblings about EBP funding on one hand and concerns about the impact of the IRA on the other hand. And it's true large pharma is evaluating the longer-term impact of the IRA and in that context, taking another look at their portfolio of studies, both in-flight and to come. And some of them reprioritized some of the studies. But fundamentally, our business has been sound, strong, growing sequentially every quarter. Our bookings have been beating record after record. So we really did not experience any tremor at all in the market on the R&DS side. And this quarter was just a continuation of what we had experienced. With respect to your second question about staffing and site start-up, attrition rates are back to pre-pandemic levels, which is about 10% to 12%. So, from our -- on our end, things are good. We continue to actively recruit and hire because we're growing organically at a very high rate. And therefore, we need the people to execute the work. So that recruiting is targeted at meeting the incremental demand. Obviously, there's always competition for talent. And right now, we have about 87,000 employees, and we continue to recruit thousands of people a year. So that's on our end. With respect to the site staffing issues, they saw -- frankly, we continue to see some staffing issues at some sites, but it's really, to a lesser degree than in prior, let's say, probably half a year or three quarters, and it's already dramatically reduced. So really, we are essentially getting back. I'm not going to say to 100% staffing levels at the site because there's still, again, are sporadic issues here and there, but it's not -- you're correct, it's not the severe issues we experienced perhaps six months or nine months ago. So it's much improved. Thank you, David. Okay. I don't think we disclosed by sub-segment, the margins, but it's very good margin, I think, put it this way. The consulting is good margin, and the analytics is also very strong margin. A lot of our analytics work is delivered out of offshore centers in Bangalore, in Manila. And we generate good margins. It's a lot of standardized work. We have workflows that we use in processes that over the years, we've refined. And that work -- when we say consulting, don't think McKenzie-type consulting. Consulting is really, again, a pricing market access study, a launch study, a sales force optimization study. So, these are operationally geared consulting services that our clients utilize to support often the launch of new drugs or the reprioritization of geographic markets or specific restructuring of their sales organization in certain geographies or in certain therapies, those types of projects. And it's not like they are not going to do them. Those must -- are must-do projects. But the environment, the climate, the higher interest rates has kind of put people on sort of on a hold pattern, if you will. The pipeline is there. No one is spending is. I am just not doing the project. And therefore, we would say, well, the prospects are lower. Now, we have -- the projects are still there, but the decision-making seems to be pushed to the right. We were hoping, frankly, up to two, three months ago that things would recover by now in terms of the decision-making and accelerate. And that's why we, frankly, we were hoping that we would get back to the 8%-or-so growth, higher single-digit growth for the TAS segment for the year. We were expecting a strong acceleration, but we haven't seen it materialize in the second quarter. And so as of now, based on what we've seen, I think it's prudent to say that this -- the type of growth rates we've seen for the segment as a whole, which is 6% organically at constant currency and not including the COVID impacts, it should be -- should continue the rest of the year. Thank you. All right. Sure. Of course, Eric. Thank you. So let's start with data, right the core of the business. That has not changed. I would say 90-plus percent of our business for the year on the data side is just locked in by the month of December for the following year. So there's no change there. That's recurring revenue, and not much has happened there. The level of discretion in terms of data by here for the clients is much less than the analytics and consulting segment that we were just discussing. For the faster-growing businesses, real world and commercial tech, now let's take the technology suites. It's not like the revenue is a reflection of the sales in the year. It's -- the revenue generated in technology is longer cycle, corresponds to technology awards from prior periods, from prior years. So nothing has changed there on the revenue side. There is cautiousness, similar to consulting and analytics, on the technology side in terms of new buys and new transitions. There's a number of dislocation in technology going on right now, by the way, both on the clinical side and on the commercial side, the main CRM competitor decided to change their platform. So as a result, clients are kind reviewing their technology decisions on the technology side. We've got new innovations. We've got the main competitors there, Medidata and others and Oracle, are launching a new suite. So, there is dislocation. So, because of that, clients are kind of taking their time to review decisions, but that's not impacting our revenue in year. On the real-world side, again, some of these are longer-term studies. There is a little bit, but again, I don't think that we've seen it affect our revenue year that much. A little bit of cautiousness and perhaps a little bit of delay on the late-phase real-world studies that we've seen. Again, I'm just giving you a really high-level commentary here on -- just to really scratch the business. But fundamentally, it is a 25% piece of the TAS segment, that's consulting and analytics, that's essentially down year-over-year by, I think, about 5%, if I recall. And so everything else is pretty much stable as expected. What's your follow-up? Yeah. And I think it was done towards the end of the quarter. I mean, I can tell you, so it's a company called Cognitive for which we paid almost $300 million, so clinical site network. As you know, as part of our strategy overall, we are -- we've been acquiring certain assets that have strong patient enrollment capability in specific therapies. So Cognitive is, in particular is strong in internal medicine, in CNS, in vaccines as well and has some large pharma customers. So, we -- the company is headquartered in Arizona. It's -- obviously, it's a significant multiple of revenue. But -- and we acquired that towards the end of the quarter. And we have a bunch of all smaller stuff over here, but that's the -- what else do we have here? We have a $36 million investment in a small-- Right, right, right. It management organization, yes. That was in psychiatry and smoking cessation. So again, highly specialized site benefit organization we've done a couple this past quarter. Yes, yes -- no. So we had already -- we do have -- we had a network that we had started ourselves. But we -- you're correct. I don't think we -- I mean we bought maybe one other one last year, if I remember -- you're correct. Again, these are -- it's not like we are buying dozens of this, but there happens to be that coincidentally, we bought two in the quarter. And that's basically the bulk of the spend that you see there. Yes. And the question on the acquisition that we're trying to do that we -- really is, I think, about a year. You know that we have a strategy to continue to grow in the digital space. Our strategy remains intact. We've seen those merger guidelines. Look, I'm not going to comment on the pending litigation with the FTC because planning litigation. We continue to believe strongly that there is absolutely zero logic to blocking this transaction. But we are aware that there are a few novel theories that are being promoted by this administration of the FTC. And listen, administrations come and go. And we are not going to change our M&A strategy. We believe that we are still a very small player in a hugely massive digital promotional market. I mean you've got the Googles of this world, giants that also participate in this market. And we have a right to participate in this market. We are serving the life sciences industry and their needs. And our customers welcome that development and our ability to offer those services. We believe that this acquisition actually increases the degree of intensity of competition in this market and actually allows all other participants to counter the essential strong behemoths that dominate the digital space today. So we just simply do not understand the FTC's arguments, and I'll leave it at that. You're welcome. Thanks for the question, Luke. I'm not sure what you mean by R&DS coming back. I mean it's very strong. The R&DS segment is not experiencing any delays in decision-making that we can see, frankly. Again, we had another record quarter of bookings. Nothing's changed there. And our RFP flow, again, is at a record level. I could spend time giving you stats on the -- on our leading indicator metrics on the R&DS side, a qualified pipeline and the pipeline overall and so on are at a record high, and recontinue our sales activities as before, again, nothing -- no sign of delaying decision making on R&DS side. I want to be very clear on that. On the TAS segment and CSMS and again, it's largely affecting the consulting and analytics segment. And I would say almost exclusively, the issue is I can't quantify in month. I mean the stuff that's in our pipe that we've had since the end of last year. And here we are, August 1, and the clients on that specific opportunity still hasn't decided to -- everything is negotiated, and they know they have to do the study, but they could do the study next year. So. whatever clients -- on that side of the business, clients are basically saying to themselves, well, do I need to do this now? Or can I keep the can another few months? So. this stuff has been our pipeline six months, and we haven't taken it out because the client still is telling us that they want to do it. They just haven't signed yet. So, yes, I mean it's a bit in the time frame that you're talking about. It would have taken a month or two, and it's taking six months or more. It's really all over. Every client has -- it's hard to -- it weighs on everyone. Is there going to be a recession? Is there going to be a recession? Maybe we should delay the launch in Portugal. Maybe we should not look at our sales force now. If we do this next year, maybe that project that we were planning to do -- to evaluate whether we should adjust pricing in consideration of the IRA implications and so on, on this drug, in that market, in that therapy, we push it back. So it's not like I can give you a blanket answer. It's just the environment, the atmospherics are such that -- look, I'm sure someone is going to ask me a question, and I'm assuming it's going to be Shlomo, but our cash flow wasn't too special this past quarter and is the same thing. Why are large pharma companies that are sitting on massive piles of cash not paying their bills on time? Our collections are not where they should be. And it's just -- it's a high interest environment. So people tend to just find all kinds of reasons why there was a comma missing in an invoice, and therefore, we can't pay you and send me by the invoice in two weeks. It's just the environment. I don't have another answer. Thank you, Luke. Here we go. Yes, yes. Thank you. So quickly on the real-world evidence, it's been double-digits for one and it's still strong double-digits. So nothing changed there. With respect to AI, we're obviously very excited by the opportunity. This is not new for us, right? I mean we've been working on this for a long time. We've invested since 2015, 2016, and we own the number of market-leading and proprietary AI software engines. We've dedicated AI/ML resources for a long time. And we are extremely well positioned. We apply AI in drug development, discovery, clinical development, safety, market access, medical affairs and, of course, in commercialization to inform promotional and sales and targeting activities. We are using AI in NLP processes, in translations of medical documentations and protocols. That's for the offering part of the business, if you will. On the internal side, we've applied AI to many of our own internal processes. For example, lead to cash, we -- really across a set of processes to create efficiencies operationally. So it is a great opportunity for us and has been for the past few years. Now, how do you use AI to gain competitive advantages? It helps optimize site identification based on the patient populations that we derive from our -- that we mine in our databases, helps optimize patient recruitment techniques based on data and analytical footprint. It helps optimize development -- drug development protocols. We can -- we have support -- it has built predictive enrollment models based on all the protocol criteria thresholds. You're familiar with the next best application in our OCE suite, which leverages the know-how and the historical data to create predictive models of engagement with customers. We've also been developing a novel biomarker database with IQVIA's own natural language processing tools. We've used it in Alzheimer's studies to have an early identification and recruitment of patients with most likely to develop Alzheimer's. A lot of activities, frankly, to expand patient pathways. So if you look into -- I'm sure it's somewhere in our websites or literature, we have over 150 patent pending methodologies and algorithms, more than 30 predictive data disease models, more than 300 life science-specific analytical libraries, I mean I could go on and on. We've got a lot of stuff here on proprietary material in AI. Now this whole buzz around generative AI, as people are finding out, it's not so easy to apply and actually derive precise and relevant insights. And I'm looking forward to presenting why even using -- and by the way, we are working with -- everyone has announced significant generative AI applications and models because it's really -- as always, it's -- if you don't have access to the business rules and to the relevant content, you're going to come up with what they call hallucinations. And we've tried it and we are working with partners -- with technology partners, and it's very clear that we have the sauce internally here that would enable those large language model tools to be a lot more effective and accurate and precise than what they are today in the world of life sciences, where they basically only have access to what's available on the Internet or on public sources. That's why I can say now, but again, it's a very exciting development. Obviously, we are very busy leveraging internally. And there was a question earlier on margins and margin expansion, and it's one of the several initiatives that is helping us generate margin expansion. You are asking about the data business? Okay. Okay, okay. Yes. I mean, look, I don't know what to say here. It's just not the same planet, the only way I can put it. The scale, the global presence in over 100 countries, the level of granularity, the infrastructure -- the IT infrastructure to process, cleanse, cure, connect all that data on a global basis, the business rooms. I mean look at health care, data is chaos. It's -- you can have as much data as you want. If you don't understand it and connect it and cleanse it and know what you're dealing with, it's not really relevant. We have data on about 1.4 billion... 1.2 billion patients. And that -- I don't think there's anyone that has anything resembling what we have. I mean I just don't know what it's like."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Nick Childs, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasury. Mr. Childs, please begin your conference.\nNick Childs: Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our first quarter 2023 earnings call. With me today are Ari Bousbib, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Ron Bruehlman, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Eric Sherbet, Executive Vice President and General Counsel; Mike Fedock, Senior Vice President, Financial Planning and Analysis; and Gustavo Param, Senior Director, Investor Relations. Today, we will be referencing a presentation that will be visible during this call for those of you on our webcast. This presentation will also be available following this call in the Events and Presentations section of our IQVIA Investor Relations website at ir.iqvia.com. Before we begin, I would like to caution listeners that certain information discussed by management during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those stated or implied by forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties associated with the company's business which are discussed in the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings. In addition, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures on this call, which should be considered a supplement to and not a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the comparable GAAP measures is included in the press release and conference call presentation. I would now like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO.\nAri Bousbib: Thank you very much, Nick, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today to discuss our first quarter results. This was another quarter where we delivered again on all our financial targets. Our revenue grew 11% organic, excluding the impact of foreign exchange and COVID-related work. The diversification of our short and long-cycle businesses allowed us to perform well in the quarter despite the broader macroeconomic dynamics. The demand environment for our industry continues to be healthy. Global clinical trial activity remains resilient and the prospects for our commercial business remain favorable. A few encouraging signs I'd like to share with you this morning, the 15 largest pharmaceutical companies together spent a record setting $138 billion on research and development in 2022. According to BioWorld, the Q1 EBT [ph] funding was $15.6 billion. That was up double digit versus prior year and up sequentially versus Q4. March was a particularly strong month for EBT funding despite concerns about the impact from the banking crisis. FDA approvals are off to a strong start in 2023. There were 13 approvals in the first quarter. That's up from an average of 9 over the prior 5 years. And that's a positive indicator for our commercial business. There was a significant M&A activity in Q1, which primarily is large pharma acquiring smaller companies and the industry expects 2023 M&A spend to be one of the largest years in the last decade. This highlights the ongoing demand for molecules by large pharma. Internally, our Q1 demand metrics show continued healthy growth. I'll share a couple with you this morning. Net new bookings were $2.6 billion. That represented a quarterly book-to-bill of 1.28. As a result, our backlog reached a new record and grew 10.1% versus prior year on a reported basis and 11.3%, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Our RFP flow set a new quarterly record. It was up sequentially 15%, versus Q4 2022. Operationally, attrition levels have continued to decline, and they are now, in fact, back to pre-pandemic levels or slightly below that. Site selection was up double digits year-over-year. This increased productivity helped mitigate the unfavorable impact of the staff's proteges [ph] that investigator site that we spoke about in prior calls. R&DS organic revenue growth at constant currency, excluding COVID-related work, was 17% in the quarter. That was well above the upper end of our expectations. Within TAS, we continue to see some client cautiousness related to discretionary spending. TAS growth for the quarter was 6% organic at constant currency, excluding COVID-related work, and that was within our expectations, but towards the lower end. In summary, industry demand remains healthy despite some cautiousness in discretionary spending, mostly in the short-cycle businesses. The diversification of our businesses allows us to balance the current slower short-cycle growth with the resilience of our long-cycle businesses, demonstrating that IQVIA is a company that can operate effectively under different macro environments. And with that, as context, let me review the first quarter results. Revenue for the first quarter grew 2.4% on a reported basis, 4.7% at constant currency and compared to last year and excluding COVID-related work from both periods, we grew the top line as a company, 11% at constant currency on an organic basis. First quarter adjusted EBITDA increased 4.8%, driven by revenue growth and ongoing cost management discipline. First quarter adjusted diluted EPS of $2.45 declined slightly as expected driven by the onetime step-up in interest rates. Excluding interest expense and the U.K. tax rate headwinds that we discussed in the prior call, our adjusted diluted EPS growth exceeded 9%. I'd like to share a few highlights of business activity in the quarter. Within TAS, a top 10 pharma awarded IQVIA, our first omnichannel marketing deal in the Asia Pacific region. IQVIA's omnichannel marketing program provides client teams with AI ML powered insights and recommendations to deliver effective personalized digital engagements with ACP [ph] In the quarter, IQVIA won an award for our in-home patient services offering. This biotech client is launching a new MS treatment and selected IQVIA based on our ability to deliver testing and monitoring to the patient's home. These differentiated capabilities ease the burden for patients with limited mobility. Moving to the real-world part of our TAS business. IQVIA was awarded a major post authorization safety study to assess the impact and outcomes of prescribing a certain asthma drug to pregnant women with severe asthma. We won this large contract with a top 10 pharma client due to the breadth of our capabilities, including our relevant experience in the safety trials, our strong data and analytics capabilities and increased delivery efficiency with faster patient enrollment. Also in the quarter, we were awarded a large global intervention study with a top 10 pharma to identify high-risk cardiovascular patients by measuring the prevalence of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein. This protein is produced by the liver in response to inflammation in the body. Elevated levels of this protein in the blood are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, including heart attack and stroke. IQVIA was selected based on our ability to connect lab and clinical capabilities with therapeutic and real-world expertise in a cost-efficient manner. This study will have a significant impact on the future management of cardiovascular patients. Moving to R&DS. Continued strong momentum with our $2.6 billion of net new bookings in the quarter, translating into a book-to-bill of 1.28 in quarter, which brings our LTM book-to-bill to 1.35 in. A few highlights in the quarter. Oncology continues to be our largest therapeutic area. And in the quarter, a high-profile cutting-edge biotech company entered into a strategic partnership with IQVIA. This is a big deal. In fact, we were already awarded our first trial, which is for a novel bispecific antibody with potential development opportunities across several tumor types. Bispecific antibodies are designed to bind 2 different target molecules simultaneously. This project will leverage our end-to-end clinical trial solution, including protocol design, specialized medical and regulatory expertise, biomarker development and our integrated clinical operations, analytics and technology. We really are the only company with the ability to bring together these capabilities which, in turn, helped the client optimize trial design and reduce time to market. Importantly, going forward, this partnership creates multiple opportunities within this client's large oncology portfolio. We continue to have strong success with our clinical FSP [ph] trials business with several recent notable wins, including a significant preferred provider award with a major pharma. This was a competitive win against two incumbents and it further diversifies our portfolio of FSP clients and increases our share in that segment. We continue to deploy innovations in our clinical technology suite. Most recently, we introduced a new cloud-based platform within our research site network that will streamline document workflows and allow real-time collaboration among study teams. We already deployed this new technology to approximately 15% of IQVIA network sites across 28 countries, and we expect to deploy it to 40% of our sites in the next 12 months. The goal of deploying this technology at the site is to increase site productivity, which frees up more time for site support, compliance reviews and continuous monitoring of patient safety and study quality all of which are very important, especially in an environment where we experienced staff shortages at the site. Finally, a couple of nice accolades for our global IQVIA team. First, I am proud to share that our lab business received the prestigious Singaporean President Certificate of commendation, which is awarded to organizations that had a significant impact in the fight against COVID-19. In fact, five of our employees in Singapore received a Public Service Medal Award for their outstanding contributions to manage the impact of the pandemic. This is a nice recognition of the unique role we play in supporting public health. Second, our Scotland-based lab business recently achieved a global green lab certification for its commitment to practicing sustainable science. This certification is recognized by the United Nation's \"Race to Zero\" global campaign as the international gold standard for lab sustainability best practices towards a zero carbon future. I will now turn it over to Ron for more details on our financial performance.\nRon Bruehlman: Thanks, Ari, and good morning, everyone. Let's start by reviewing revenue. First quarter revenue of $3.652 billion grew 2.4% on a reported basis and 4.7% at constant currencies. In the quarter, COVID-related revenues were approximately $150 million, which was down about $230 million versus the first quarter of 2022. In our base business, that is excluding all COVID-related work from both this year and last, organic growth at constant currency was 11%. Technology & Analytics Solutions revenue was $1.444 billion, up 0.3% reported and 2.9% at constant currency. Excluding all COVID-related work, organic growth at constant currency in TAS was 6%. R&D Solutions revenue of $2.026 billion [ph] was up 4.8% reported and 6.5% at constant currency and excluding all COVID-related work, organic growth at constant currency in R&DS was 17%. Finally, Contract Sales and Medical Solutions or CSMS revenue of $182 million declined 6.7% reported and 1% at constant currency. And excluding all COVID-related work, the organic growth decline at constant currency was also 1% in CSMS. Let's move down to P&L. Adjusted EBITDA was $851 million for the first quarter, that's growth of 4.8%. GAAP net income was $289 million, and GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.53. Adjusted net income was $462 million in adjusted earnings per share diluted was $2.45. So as already highlighted, R&D Solutions continues its strong momentum. This graph shows the growth of our backlog over the past 3 years, which demonstrates the sustained growth of our clinical business. Our backlog at March 31 stood at a record $27.9 billion which was up over 40% over the last 3 years and growing 10% year-over-year. Reviewing the balance sheet. At March 31, cash and cash equivalents totaled $1.494 billion. Gross debt was $13.176 billion, and that resulted in net debt of $11.682 billion. Our net leverage ratio ended the quarter at 3.4 times trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA. First quarter cash flow from operations was strong at $417 million, and CapEx was $164 million, resulting in free cash flow of $253 million. In the quarter, we repurchased $129 million of shares, and that leaves us with slightly over $1.2 billion remaining under the current program. Let's go now to the guidance. Guidance for the full year 2023 remains unchanged. We continue to expect revenue excluding COVID-related work to grow organically at constant currency between 9% and 11%. And this revenue guidance continues to assume about 100 basis points of contribution from acquisitions and approximately $600 million of COVID-related revenue step down versus 2022. We're also reaffirming our guidance on adjusted EBITDA of $3.625 billion to $3.695 billion, and that represents year-over-year growth of 8.3% to 10.4%. Lastly, we're reaffirming our guidance on adjusted diluted EPS of $10.26 to $10.56. And this adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance includes a year-over-year impact of the step-up in interest rates and the increase in the U.K. corporate tax rate. And together, these nonoperational items impact the year-over-year growth rate by approximately 10 percentage points. Excluding these items, adjusted diluted earnings per share is expected to grow 11% to 14%. Let's move to our second quarter guidance. In Q2, we expect revenue to be between $3.675 billion and $3.750 billion. That's growth of 3.7% to 5.8% on a constant currency basis and 3.8% to 5.9% on a reported basis. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $850 million and $875 million, which would be up 6.3% to 9.4%, and adjusted diluted EPS is expected to be between $2.30 and $2.44, declining 5.7% to flat on a year-over-year basis. And keep in mind that the second quarter is the toughest compare for interest expense because we had a very favorable $1 billion swap roll off on March 31. It was also a year ago that rates started rising. So excluding the step-up of an interest expense and the increased U.K. tax rate, we expect adjusted diluted EPS to grow between 8% and 13% in the second quarter. Now all of our guidance assumes that foreign currency rates as of April 25 continue for the balance of the year. So to summarize, Q1 was another solid quarter of financial performance. We delivered revenue growth of 11% organic, excluding the impact of foreign exchange and COVID-related work. Underlying demand in the industry and in our business remains healthy with our RFPs accelerating in Q1 up 15% sequentially versus Q4 2022. And quarterly net new bookings were $2.6 billion, and our industry-leading backlog reached a new record of $27.9 billion, representing growth of over 10% year-over-year. We've been navigating well through the choppy macro environment and delivering on our numbers. Despite some of the cautiousness we've observed in the short-cycle discretionary spend, thanks to the resilience and the rest of the portfolio, which is mostly the long cycle and thus less affected by macro turbulent. Therefore, we are reaffirming our full year guidance of 9% to 11% organic revenue growth at constant currency, excluding COVID-related work and 11% to 14% adjusted EPS growth, excluding nonoperational items. And with that, let me hand it back over to the operator for Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Shlomo Rosenbaum at Stifel. Your line is open.\nShlomo Rosenbaum: Hi. Thank you very much for taking my questions. Ari, can you talk a little bit about the nature of the backlog burn? You had very strong bookings, you got strong book-to-bill, but the amount of revenue expected to - or backlog to convert to revenue, it seems kind of consistent for this quarter to last quarter? Or is there any - is there a change of mix over there? Is that a rounding item? Or is there something else that might be going on over there?\nAri Bousbib: Yes. Thank you, Shlomo. No. Look, we had very strong bookings. It was one of our highest bookings quarter and I wouldn't read anything. It's not the first time, by the way, that Q1 next 12 months revenue from bookings is essentially flat to Q4. Next 12 months bookings, I can't detect any seasonality to that, but it's not the first time it happened. So I wouldn't read anything into it at all. It's just a question of mix, months of pass-throughs that are taken into the quarter or delayed. And we're reverting to more regular mix of projects with, as you know, an increasing share in oncology, which typically burn a little slower. That might have a little bit at the margins of an impact. But I wouldn't read anything into it.\nShlomo Rosenbaum: Okay. Thank you.\nAri Bousbib: Thanks, Shlomo.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Anne Samuel of JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nAnne Samuel: Hi. Thank you for taking the question. I was hoping maybe you could speak to some of the dynamics within the TAS business. In the fourth quarter, the analytics and consulting business was impacted, but some of that maybe seems like it was unique to December purchasing patterns. So how much of this is carryover from what you saw in the fourth quarter? And then what's driving your confidence that it's going to come back in the remainder of the year so that you could hit your guidance?\nAri Bousbib: Yes. Thank you, Anne. It's a good question. Look, TAS growth in the first quarter was within the range we expected. You are correct that the guidance we gave on an organic constant currency ex COVID basis for the year, I think our guidance is 7% to 9%. And therefore, 6% clearly is right under that. But we did tell you that we did fully expect Q1 to be just under that. So our expectations were more in the 6% to 7%, 6% to 8% for the first quarter and we expected a slower start as you suggest, due to the cautiousness we saw in December in customers' discretionary spending and so we assume this was going to spill over, as you suggest, into the Q1, and that's why we assume a slower start in the year for this business. The reason why it's a little lower than our long-term growth expectation is due to the analytics and consulting business piece of TAS. That is about, I want to say, just under 25% of the total business in TAS. And as we said many times before, it's the shortest cycle and contains the most discretionary spend activity of the entire TAS portfolio. So what we are seeing is not cancellations of projects, not decisions to not conduct the projects. For the most part, these are projects that need to be done, pricing and market access studies, as an example, have to be done at some point. But the discretionary aspect applies to timing for the most part, okay? No one has a project that they don't need to do. These are products that need to be done, but they don't need to be done right this second. And we are seeing customers delaying decisions and pushing things to the right. That is what gives us confidence that in the latter part of the year, those projects will have to be done. So that's why we maintain our 7% to 9% organic constant currency excluding guidance for the year. Now we expect that cautiousness to continue into the second quarter. And we're assuming growth so far in line with the first quarter. Again, we're not seeing any customers walking away from projects or canceling anything. It's just consistent with what we saw at the end of Q4, delaying a project. We do expect the situation to improve in the second half because the pipelines are stronger and the customers eventually need to actually spend on those projects.\nAnne Samuel: That's extremely helpful color. Thank you so much.\nAri Bousbib: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of David Windley at Jefferies. Your line is open.\nDavid Windley: Thanks for taking my question. Good morning. Ari, I wondered if you could talk in the R&DS business. As you highlight, strong bookings, I guess, seasonally different from the fourth quarter. The thing that we're seeing, I guess, in our data review is that a lot of studies, similar to what you're describing in TAS in consulting that a lot of studies are kind of sitting in a limbo point and not moving forward into first patient in and kind of more productive revenue stages of the trial. And I wondered if you have some insights into that. And if any of your tools can help them move those forward? Or is it kind of a funding and financial issue that is keeping them from moving forward? I'd be curious your views there.\nAri Bousbib: Okay. Well Dave, thanks for the question. I want to use the opportunity to state as clearly and definitively as I can. We simply are not, I repeat, we are not seeing any of what you suggest. And no one is - first of all, on the funding question, I don't know how many times I'm going to repeat it. I've been doing this for five quarters in a row. We are not seeing any funding issue. In my introductory remarks, I share some of the statistics. Actually everything is up on the funding front. So we are not seeing any delays, any unusual cancellations, any postponing of decision-making within our portfolio. It could be that others are saying that we just are not seeing it. Once again, the overall RFP flow is at a record high. It's up 15% sequentially versus Q4 of '22 both the mid and the EBP segments are up strong double digits. I said before, it's up 15%. The qualified pipeline, which is, again, an even earlier indicator, is up almost up 8%. It's actually over 8% year-over-year, and it's almost $15 billion with, again, a record qualified pipeline. The total pipeline is over $25 billion. Also mid [ph] more than 5% growth year-over-year, $2.6 billion of net bookings in the quarter, it's more than the entire backlog of some of our smaller competitors out there. Our book-to-bill 1.28 is extremely strong in the current environment. And I think from what I've seen, the highest of any of our peers. Our backlog is up more than 10% year-over-year. That's on a reported basis. Excluding FX, it's up 11.3%. So again, what I'm trying to share some metrics with you here, if we look at by segment, again, it's across the board, large mid EBP. I've got a lot of numbers here, but everything is - honestly, everything is green here. Nick, do you have any other color to add to this?\nNick Childs: Yes. I guess, Dave, I think the only thing I would say there is we saw your question sort of earlier this week and talked to the team, and we're not seeing any sort of slowdown in terms of clients not wanting to start trials. I mean as soon as they're signing and pushing and getting ready, they are pushing trials forward. So we're not seeing any delays, clients trying to slow down starts. We are seeing same trials move forward and not - and not seeing the dynamics that you're asking about.\nRon Bruehlman: Yes. And Dave, if there's any slowness anywhere, it's just in some of the execution because of the labor issues at some of the sites. That would be the one place where we could burn faster and the industry could burn faster if there weren't the labor issues at the site.\nAri Bousbib: Right. And as I mentioned in my introductory remarks, we have been able to offset some of that unfavorable impact of stock shortages that Ron just brought up and we talked about before because site selection has been accelerating. I mentioned it was up double digits year-over-year and that increased productivity helped us in the quarter, and we expect we'll continue to do so the rest of the year. We also - I mentioned also in my introductory remarks, are introducing rapidly more technology at the site in order to free up personnel time and increase our productivity.\nDavid Windley: Yes. Very, very fulsome answer. If I could just add to that. I mean, there's been a lot of companies this week that have attributed weakness to - I mean, there are a lot of other companies seeing dramatic slowdowns. Maybe you could talk about how your positioning or your stage of the pipeline is different that also protects you from what they are seeing, Thermo, Danaher, et cetera.\nAri Bousbib: Yes. I mean the answer is in your question. We have a very strong momentum. We operate the vast majority of what we do is in the sweet spot of the clinical trial process, it's Phase III stuff. We're not affected by the primate issue, zero. And even in the primate issue continues for the next 3 years, you wouldn't see it at all in our numbers. We've already looked at that. And we continue to gain share. I know I gave examples on the FSP segment, it's true across the board in oncology, we just are winning in the marketplace. We displaced incumbents in a number of occasions with large clients. I think I don't see any - really no issues whatsoever on the R&DS front, not say for the execution and operational issues we have encountered. I mentioned that the attrition levels are coming down. I mean, I said before that the peak of the attrition a year ago, so we had more than 20% attrition, which is horrendous and we're now back to - I said pre-pandemic levels, actually well below that, which is barely over 10%, which is amazing and very good. And that enables us to do a lot more work, a lot faster. Thank you, David.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Eric Coldwell at Baird. Your line is open.\nEric Coldwell: Thanks, good morning. I want to hit on reimbursables on a couple of fronts. First off, on revenue was such a big COVID comp this quarter, I would have expected less reimbursable revenue, it looks like it actually grew quite a bit faster than service revenue. So what is the dynamic there? We're seeing mixed bag all over the industry in terms of the pass-through volatility with that big COVID headwind, I would have expected less you did more. Is there something underlying or outside of COVID exposure that's driving the reimbursables higher? Or is it just company-specific contract timing?\nAri Bousbib: Okay. Well, look, on a full year basis, we're expecting actually obviously less reimbursable expenses because of the disappearance of the COVID work, which was, as you suggest, very high pass-through expenses for those COVID vaccine trials. I wouldn't read much in the quarter because this volatility and depends on the mix of what you executed. So I don't -- I'm not -- to be honest, the book-to-bill is more or less similar to we -- I think you -- I read you know , I religiously do that before the call, your first flash note and you asked why we only reported our 606, our book-to-bill at 1.28. And by the way, I asked the same question to the team when they gave me the first draft and I agree with the rationale. As you've seen in recent quarters, essentially the numbers have tended to converge, which is essentially what we expected to happen. We will give you the breakdown or the ex reimbursable expenses book-to-bill, when we think there is -- when there is a big discrepancy and it is a significant and helps give you understanding of what happened in the quarter in terms of bookings. But if it's very close as it was last quarter as it is this quarter, which is not going to do that. The change to 606 standard that happened more than 5 years ago and none of our competitors actually disclosed that level of granularity or report any extra reimbursable expenses book-to-bill. But again, I wouldn't read and you might more here in the quarter, Nick or Ron, any commentary or color on Eric's question.\nRon Bruehlman: Yes. Look, we did have a little bit higher revenue from pass-throughs in the quarter. But as Ari said, I wouldn't read too much into the quarter-to-quarter and over a longer time period, you're analysis is correct with COVID work rolling off, there should be a decline in pass-through revenues. And yes, it's exactly on the book-to-bill. We just -- we're what 5 years in 6, 7 years in now since the change in the accounting and we'll only talk to on the book-to-bill, the services versus pass-through book-to-bill on the 605 versus 606 when there's a significant difference to talk about, and there wasn't this quarter.\nAri Bousbib: Yes. And Eric, the - just on the past because again, we -- I mentioned we did execute faster this past quarter on our NDS backlog. It's true we built - we accelerated. That's a - this is why we recognize more revenue. And as a result, there were more pass-through during the first quarter. I don't know that it's going - I don't think you'll see the same in the next few quarters based on the modeling I saw.\nEric Coldwell: Can I have one follow-up?\nAri Bousbib: Normally, no, but it's you. Go ahead. Thank you.\nEric Coldwell: I just wanted to hit on cash flow and expectations for the year, and we're juggling through overlapping reports here. So I'm sorry if I missed this. Did you mention what the DSO was in the quarter?\nRon Bruehlman: No, we didn't give an explicit DSO number. In fact, we don't typically give a number. You guys can back calculate. We were happy with the cash flow in the quarter. One thing I would want to remind everyone is in the first quarter, it's typically a weak quarter for cash flow because most of our incentive comp -- annual incentive comp is paid in the first quarter. Yes, there's some tax impacts too. Incentive comp is probably the biggest. It was strong. We were happy with our cash flow and not quite as strong as last year, but last year was an unusually strong first quarter for cash flow.\nAri Bousbib: Yes. So if we improved it's flattish, right?\nRon Bruehlman: DSOs on a quarter-to-quarter basis is fairly flattish. On a year-over-year basis, it's up a little bit and a lot of that has to do with the burning through the COVID-related advances that we got. So it was fully expected.\nEric Coldwell: Thanks very much. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Max Smock at William Blair. Your line is now open.\nMax Smock: I just wanted to clarify your comment in response to one of Dave's questions earlier about the NHP situation. And I just wanted to clarify, you said that you would not see any impact from the NHP shortage even if it continues for the next 3 years. Just wondering, at some point, wouldn't that limit the number of drugs getting into later-stage trials here? Just would be great to hear more about the work you've done internally to kind of evaluate your potential exposure over the next...\nAri Bousbib: Again, in theory, yes, but we don't expect that to happen. I mean there will be eventually other models, and they will become available. I mean, I don't -- we're not worried about this at all.\nRon Bruehlman: Yes. The 3 years just related to the length of time it takes to get from the discovery work in the Phase II and Phase III trials. There's a long delay between that. So yes, of course, theoretically, if there is a protracted issue, it affects everybody in the industry. We don't expect that to happen.\nMax Smock: Okay, great. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Sandy Draper at Guggenheim Securities. Your line is now open.\nSandy Draper: Thanks very much. I think it sounds like I need to get on Eric's distribution list. I can get his quick flash notes. I can't process fast enough to do that. So my question, Ari, or maybe Ron, is on the backlog burn. I'm trying to reconcile what you were talking about interest [ph] question. On my calculation, it looks like the backlog burn stepped down a little bit from the fourth quarter from 8% to 7.4%. My assumption was there's a little bit less sequentially in terms of reimbursables. So I just wanted to verify that. But then thinking about how you're expecting the backlog burn to play out as you have less COVID work, et cetera, which is faster burning, do you think is it reasonable to think stable off of this 7.4% Or would it sort of trend down over the course of the year? Thanks.\nRon Bruehlman: Look, I wouldn't put a lot of emphasis on quarter-to-quarter backlog burn as you calculate it there. It's not something that we pay a lot of attention to internally. I can tell you, you'll get variations like in the fourth quarter, we had very strong pass-through bookings, which pushes up the backlog some, but then those tend to burn later in the trial. And you'll see impacts like that affect any one quarter, like particularly the next quarter's burn rate. So overall, as Ari made the point, we tend to work on more complicated trials in oncology trials, in particular, tend to be longer, slower burn trial. So we may have slower burn on average than some of the others in the industry based upon our particular mix of projects, but that's more a macro long-term consideration than it is a quarter-to-quarter sort of variation driver.\nSandy Draper: Okay, great. That's helpful. Thanks, Ron.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Charles Rhyee from TD Cowen. Your line is now open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi. This is Lucas on for Charles. I want to dig into the TAS segment. You guys talked about consulting and analytics seeing some softness in 1Q. You guys also called out some wins in real-world evidence. Can you talk more about the performance of the other offerings within TAS and how they performed in 1Q, more specifically real-world evidence and technology platforms?\nRon Bruehlman: Look, our real world and technology, we tend to talk about them together because they're the faster growers and continued to be very solid growers in the quarter. As Ari pointed out, it was the analytics and consulting business that really slowed down in the quarter because a lot of that is shorter cycle business and can be delayed. We've always talked about information being a slower grower. So you know about that. And so you kind of piece it together, the difference versus prior quarters really relates to the analytics and consulting business, some of that shorter cycle business being delayed. It's really as simple as that. That's why we saw a little bit of a slowdown in the underlying core growth rate in the TAS business.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Derik De Bruin of Bank of America. Your line is now open.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is Will Chaff on for Derik. I know in the prepared remarks, you flagged that there has been a pickup of biotech M&A, which obviously is helping the funding environment. But I'm wondering what you're seeing in terms of the larger of the acquirer than reducing the R&D spend at the target. Is there any impact to you from that? Yes, if you could just explore those dynamics, that would be great.\nAri Bousbib: Yes. Thank you. Just to clarify, the M&A spend has nothing to do with funding. It's not included in the funding numbers. So these are two different and independent points. The heightened M&A activity is a plus, obviously, and is a tailwind for us. As you know, we've got large clients that are buying molecules for which work needs to be done. So this is generally a favorable trend for us. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Dan Leonard at Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.\nDan Leonard: Thank you. I was just hoping you could revisit that comment you made that RFPs grew 15% sequentially and I assume that's a volume number. And is there any difference between RFP volume trends and value trends? Thank you.\nAri Bousbib: Thank you. No, your assumption is incorrect. The growth numbers we mentioned are in dollars.\nNick Childs: Yes. So all the growth numbers that we've given, Dan, on the call are all dollar-based. It's not a volume.\nRon Bruehlman: And that's how we tend to track it because that's what's important.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Elizabeth Anderson at Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.\nElizabeth Anderson: Hi, guys. Thanks for the question. I know you said you just talked about it in terms of total dollar volume. I was just wondering if you could comment on the contribution in terms of pricing and R&DS to the dollars this year? And then secondly, just in terms of the pacing of TAS revenue over the back half of the year. Are you still thinking we should see that continue to accelerate be sort of in that like sort of mid- to high single-digit type range? Thank you.\nAri Bousbib: Yes. The comment on TAS is just correct. That's our expectation currently based on the pipeline. What was the first question? I'm sorry.\nNick Childs: Yes, I didn't hear your first question there, I'm sorry.\nElizabeth Anderson: Sure. It was just in terms of the contribution of sort of increases in pricing that could have contributed to the first quarter revenue results on a year-over-year basis?\nAri Bousbib: Nothing was negligible.\nNick Childs: Yes. I mean I wouldn't say if anything large, Elizabeth. I mean, again, you got to remember, trials are kind of vary from 3 to 5 years, it takes a while for all the pricing to pick up. We don't get that all and get it all upfront. So the pricing leads in over the course of the trials. Okay. And we will take one more question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Your final question comes from the line of Justin Bowers at Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nJustin Bowers: Thank you. Just sort of a two-parter. One with RWE, are you seeing any change in the velocity of demand there for that business, hearing in the marketplace that IRA might be a bit of a tailwind for that? And then can you also sort of educate us a little bit on the lead time between when market access and pricing studies are done and with respect to FDA approvals? Thank you.\nAri Bousbib: Yes. Thank you, Justin. On the first question, Nick, you have any...\nNick Childs: You said the growth on real world - nothing different.\nRon Bruehlman: Remains strong.\nAri Bousbib: Remains very strong, same. Nothing - really nothing changed on the real-world side. On the -- it really, really varies. There are clients who like to start even before FDA approval, sometimes well before when the early results are strong, data is good in the trial, they get - they want to get prepared. And we do those studies early, sometimes it's around the time of the approval. Sometimes it's a little later. Again, it depends, by the way, it depends on the market. Some clients may decide to introduce a drug in Europe or in some markets in Europe before others, et cetera, and it has to do with when the approvals in specific geographies occur. So it really varies. There's no [indiscernible] lead time. And that's why, again, quarter-on-quarter is discretionary. It's going to have to be done, but you can delay when you do it.\nJustin Bowers: Yes. I appreciate it. And just on RWE, just some of the things we're picking up in the field is that sponsors are leaning into those more or are thinking about leaning into those more as it relates to the IR legislation? And if I may, just on R&DS, just a quick follow-up there. Are you guys on the market share gains that you're making there? Is there any specific area? Or is it - are you seeing it across the board in both full service [indiscernible].\nAri Bousbib: Okay. Justin, thank you for your four questions. And I'm just going to answer briefly the last one, and then I suggest that the team will be available here the rest of the day and the next few days to answer any further questions. But the - on your question about market share, there's no way around it. I've said it before, and we again did this quarter. We have a high book-to-bill ratio around on the largest base revenue, you can assume that there is a gain share that's ongoing. The specific segments, I mentioned in my introductory remarks, in oncology, we know we are growing a lot faster and we are gaining share, that's by therapeutic area. And then in terms of the segments, again, it's across the board, but it was particularly significant this past quarter in FSP as well. So that's the color I can give you on share. Thank you.\nOperator: At this time, there are no further questions. Mr. Childs, I'll turn the call back over to you.\nNick Childs: Thank you, everyone, for joining us today, and we look forward to speaking to you again on our second quarter earnings call. Myself and the team will be available the rest of the day to take any other follow-up questions you might have. Thanks, everyone.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Ron Bruehlman",
            "content": "Thanks, Ari, and good morning, everyone. Let's start by reviewing revenue. First quarter revenue of $3.652 billion grew 2.4% on a reported basis and 4.7% at constant currencies. In the quarter, COVID-related revenues were approximately $150 million, which was down about $230 million versus the first quarter of 2022. In our base business, that is excluding all COVID-related work from both this year and last, organic growth at constant currency was 11%. Technology & Analytics Solutions revenue was $1.444 billion, up 0.3% reported and 2.9% at constant currency. Excluding all COVID-related work, organic growth at constant currency in TAS was 6%. R&D Solutions revenue of $2.026 billion [ph] was up 4.8% reported and 6.5% at constant currency and excluding all COVID-related work, organic growth at constant currency in R&DS was 17%. Finally, Contract Sales and Medical Solutions or CSMS revenue of $182 million declined 6.7% reported and 1% at constant currency. And excluding all COVID-related work, the organic growth decline at constant currency was also 1% in CSMS. Let's move down to P&L. Adjusted EBITDA was $851 million for the first quarter, that's growth of 4.8%. GAAP net income was $289 million, and GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.53. Adjusted net income was $462 million in adjusted earnings per share diluted was $2.45. So as already highlighted, R&D Solutions continues its strong momentum. This graph shows the growth of our backlog over the past 3 years, which demonstrates the sustained growth of our clinical business. Our backlog at March 31 stood at a record $27.9 billion which was up over 40% over the last 3 years and growing 10% year-over-year. Reviewing the balance sheet. At March 31, cash and cash equivalents totaled $1.494 billion. Gross debt was $13.176 billion, and that resulted in net debt of $11.682 billion. Our net leverage ratio ended the quarter at 3.4 times trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA. First quarter cash flow from operations was strong at $417 million, and CapEx was $164 million, resulting in free cash flow of $253 million. In the quarter, we repurchased $129 million of shares, and that leaves us with slightly over $1.2 billion remaining under the current program. Let's go now to the guidance. Guidance for the full year 2023 remains unchanged. We continue to expect revenue excluding COVID-related work to grow organically at constant currency between 9% and 11%. And this revenue guidance continues to assume about 100 basis points of contribution from acquisitions and approximately $600 million of COVID-related revenue step down versus 2022. We're also reaffirming our guidance on adjusted EBITDA of $3.625 billion to $3.695 billion, and that represents year-over-year growth of 8.3% to 10.4%. Lastly, we're reaffirming our guidance on adjusted diluted EPS of $10.26 to $10.56. And this adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance includes a year-over-year impact of the step-up in interest rates and the increase in the U.K. corporate tax rate. And together, these nonoperational items impact the year-over-year growth rate by approximately 10 percentage points. Excluding these items, adjusted diluted earnings per share is expected to grow 11% to 14%. Let's move to our second quarter guidance. In Q2, we expect revenue to be between $3.675 billion and $3.750 billion. That's growth of 3.7% to 5.8% on a constant currency basis and 3.8% to 5.9% on a reported basis. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $850 million and $875 million, which would be up 6.3% to 9.4%, and adjusted diluted EPS is expected to be between $2.30 and $2.44, declining 5.7% to flat on a year-over-year basis. And keep in mind that the second quarter is the toughest compare for interest expense because we had a very favorable $1 billion swap roll off on March 31. It was also a year ago that rates started rising. So excluding the step-up of an interest expense and the increased U.K. tax rate, we expect adjusted diluted EPS to grow between 8% and 13% in the second quarter. Now all of our guidance assumes that foreign currency rates as of April 25 continue for the balance of the year. So to summarize, Q1 was another solid quarter of financial performance. We delivered revenue growth of 11% organic, excluding the impact of foreign exchange and COVID-related work. Underlying demand in the industry and in our business remains healthy with our RFPs accelerating in Q1 up 15% sequentially versus Q4 2022. And quarterly net new bookings were $2.6 billion, and our industry-leading backlog reached a new record of $27.9 billion, representing growth of over 10% year-over-year. We've been navigating well through the choppy macro environment and delivering on our numbers. Despite some of the cautiousness we've observed in the short-cycle discretionary spend, thanks to the resilience and the rest of the portfolio, which is mostly the long cycle and thus less affected by macro turbulent. Therefore, we are reaffirming our full year guidance of 9% to 11% organic revenue growth at constant currency, excluding COVID-related work and 11% to 14% adjusted EPS growth, excluding nonoperational items. And with that, let me hand it back over to the operator for Q&A. Yes. And Dave, if there's any slowness anywhere, it's just in some of the execution because of the labor issues at some of the sites. That would be the one place where we could burn faster and the industry could burn faster if there weren't the labor issues at the site. Yes. Look, we did have a little bit higher revenue from pass-throughs in the quarter. But as Ari said, I wouldn't read too much into the quarter-to-quarter and over a longer time period, you're analysis is correct with COVID work rolling off, there should be a decline in pass-through revenues. And yes, it's exactly on the book-to-bill. We just -- we're what 5 years in 6, 7 years in now since the change in the accounting and we'll only talk to on the book-to-bill, the services versus pass-through book-to-bill on the 605 versus 606 when there's a significant difference to talk about, and there wasn't this quarter. No, we didn't give an explicit DSO number. In fact, we don't typically give a number. You guys can back calculate. We were happy with the cash flow in the quarter. One thing I would want to remind everyone is in the first quarter, it's typically a weak quarter for cash flow because most of our incentive comp -- annual incentive comp is paid in the first quarter. Yes, there's some tax impacts too. Incentive comp is probably the biggest. It was strong. We were happy with our cash flow and not quite as strong as last year, but last year was an unusually strong first quarter for cash flow. DSOs on a quarter-to-quarter basis is fairly flattish. On a year-over-year basis, it's up a little bit and a lot of that has to do with the burning through the COVID-related advances that we got. So it was fully expected. Yes. The 3 years just related to the length of time it takes to get from the discovery work in the Phase II and Phase III trials. There's a long delay between that. So yes, of course, theoretically, if there is a protracted issue, it affects everybody in the industry. We don't expect that to happen. Look, I wouldn't put a lot of emphasis on quarter-to-quarter backlog burn as you calculate it there. It's not something that we pay a lot of attention to internally. I can tell you, you'll get variations like in the fourth quarter, we had very strong pass-through bookings, which pushes up the backlog some, but then those tend to burn later in the trial. And you'll see impacts like that affect any one quarter, like particularly the next quarter's burn rate. So overall, as Ari made the point, we tend to work on more complicated trials in oncology trials, in particular, tend to be longer, slower burn trial. So we may have slower burn on average than some of the others in the industry based upon our particular mix of projects, but that's more a macro long-term consideration than it is a quarter-to-quarter sort of variation driver.

And so you kind of piece it together, the difference versus prior quarters really relates to the analytics and consulting business, some of that shorter cycle business being delayed. It's really as simple as that. That's why we saw a little bit of a slowdown in the underlying core growth rate in the TAS business. And that's how we tend to track it because that's what's important. Remains strong."

            "name": "Ari Bousbib",
            "content": "Thank you very much, Nick, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today to discuss our first quarter results. This was another quarter where we delivered again on all our financial targets. Our revenue grew 11% organic, excluding the impact of foreign exchange and COVID-related work. The diversification of our short and long-cycle businesses allowed us to perform well in the quarter despite the broader macroeconomic dynamics. The demand environment for our industry continues to be healthy. Global clinical trial activity remains resilient and the prospects for our commercial business remain favorable. A few encouraging signs I'd like to share with you this morning, the 15 largest pharmaceutical companies together spent a record setting $138 billion on research and development in 2022. According to BioWorld, the Q1 EBT [ph] funding was $15.6 billion. That was up double digit versus prior year and up sequentially versus Q4. March was a particularly strong month for EBT funding despite concerns about the impact from the banking crisis. FDA approvals are off to a strong start in 2023. There were 13 approvals in the first quarter. That's up from an average of 9 over the prior 5 years. And that's a positive indicator for our commercial business. There was a significant M&A activity in Q1, which primarily is large pharma acquiring smaller companies and the industry expects 2023 M&A spend to be one of the largest years in the last decade. This highlights the ongoing demand for molecules by large pharma. Internally, our Q1 demand metrics show continued healthy growth. I'll share a couple with you this morning. Net new bookings were $2.6 billion. That represented a quarterly book-to-bill of 1.28. As a result, our backlog reached a new record and grew 10.1% versus prior year on a reported basis and 11.3%, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Our RFP flow set a new quarterly record. It was up sequentially 15%, versus Q4 2022. Operationally, attrition levels have continued to decline, and they are now, in fact, back to pre-pandemic levels or slightly below that. Site selection was up double digits year-over-year. This increased productivity helped mitigate the unfavorable impact of the staff's proteges [ph] that investigator site that we spoke about in prior calls. R&DS organic revenue growth at constant currency, excluding COVID-related work, was 17% in the quarter. That was well above the upper end of our expectations. Within TAS, we continue to see some client cautiousness related to discretionary spending. TAS growth for the quarter was 6% organic at constant currency, excluding COVID-related work, and that was within our expectations, but towards the lower end. In summary, industry demand remains healthy despite some cautiousness in discretionary spending, mostly in the short-cycle businesses. The diversification of our businesses allows us to balance the current slower short-cycle growth with the resilience of our long-cycle businesses, demonstrating that IQVIA is a company that can operate effectively under different macro environments. And with that, as context, let me review the first quarter results. Revenue for the first quarter grew 2.4% on a reported basis, 4.7% at constant currency and compared to last year and excluding COVID-related work from both periods, we grew the top line as a company, 11% at constant currency on an organic basis. First quarter adjusted EBITDA increased 4.8%, driven by revenue growth and ongoing cost management discipline. First quarter adjusted diluted EPS of $2.45 declined slightly as expected driven by the onetime step-up in interest rates. Excluding interest expense and the U.K. tax rate headwinds that we discussed in the prior call, our adjusted diluted EPS growth exceeded 9%. I'd like to share a few highlights of business activity in the quarter. Within TAS, a top 10 pharma awarded IQVIA, our first omnichannel marketing deal in the Asia Pacific region. IQVIA's omnichannel marketing program provides client teams with AI ML powered insights and recommendations to deliver effective personalized digital engagements with ACP [ph] In the quarter, IQVIA won an award for our in-home patient services offering. This biotech client is launching a new MS treatment and selected IQVIA based on our ability to deliver testing and monitoring to the patient's home. These differentiated capabilities ease the burden for patients with limited mobility. Moving to the real-world part of our TAS business. IQVIA was awarded a major post authorization safety study to assess the impact and outcomes of prescribing a certain asthma drug to pregnant women with severe asthma. We won this large contract with a top 10 pharma client due to the breadth of our capabilities, including our relevant experience in the safety trials, our strong data and analytics capabilities and increased delivery efficiency with faster patient enrollment. Also in the quarter, we were awarded a large global intervention study with a top 10 pharma to identify high-risk cardiovascular patients by measuring the prevalence of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein. This protein is produced by the liver in response to inflammation in the body. Elevated levels of this protein in the blood are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, including heart attack and stroke. IQVIA was selected based on our ability to connect lab and clinical capabilities with therapeutic and real-world expertise in a cost-efficient manner. This study will have a significant impact on the future management of cardiovascular patients. Moving to R&DS. Continued strong momentum with our $2.6 billion of net new bookings in the quarter, translating into a book-to-bill of 1.28 in quarter, which brings our LTM book-to-bill to 1.35 in. A few highlights in the quarter. Oncology continues to be our largest therapeutic area. And in the quarter, a high-profile cutting-edge biotech company entered into a strategic partnership with IQVIA. This is a big deal. In fact, we were already awarded our first trial, which is for a novel bispecific antibody with potential development opportunities across several tumor types. Bispecific antibodies are designed to bind 2 different target molecules simultaneously. This project will leverage our end-to-end clinical trial solution, including protocol design, specialized medical and regulatory expertise, biomarker development and our integrated clinical operations, analytics and technology. We really are the only company with the ability to bring together these capabilities which, in turn, helped the client optimize trial design and reduce time to market. Importantly, going forward, this partnership creates multiple opportunities within this client's large oncology portfolio. We continue to have strong success with our clinical FSP [ph] trials business with several recent notable wins, including a significant preferred provider award with a major pharma. This was a competitive win against two incumbents and it further diversifies our portfolio of FSP clients and increases our share in that segment. We continue to deploy innovations in our clinical technology suite. Most recently, we introduced a new cloud-based platform within our research site network that will streamline document workflows and allow real-time collaboration among study teams. We already deployed this new technology to approximately 15% of IQVIA network sites across 28 countries, and we expect to deploy it to 40% of our sites in the next 12 months. The goal of deploying this technology at the site is to increase site productivity, which frees up more time for site support, compliance reviews and continuous monitoring of patient safety and study quality all of which are very important, especially in an environment where we experienced staff shortages at the site. Finally, a couple of nice accolades for our global IQVIA team. First, I am proud to share that our lab business received the prestigious Singaporean President Certificate of commendation, which is awarded to organizations that had a significant impact in the fight against COVID-19. In fact, five of our employees in Singapore received a Public Service Medal Award for their outstanding contributions to manage the impact of the pandemic. This is a nice recognition of the unique role we play in supporting public health. Second, our Scotland-based lab business recently achieved a global green lab certification for its commitment to practicing sustainable science. This certification is recognized by the United Nation's \"Race to Zero\" global campaign as the international gold standard for lab sustainability best practices towards a zero carbon future. I will now turn it over to Ron for more details on our financial performance. Yes. Thank you, Shlomo. No. Look, we had very strong bookings. It was one of our highest bookings quarter and I wouldn't read anything. It's not the first time, by the way, that Q1 next 12 months revenue from bookings is essentially flat to Q4. Next 12 months bookings, I can't detect any seasonality to that, but it's not the first time it happened. So I wouldn't read anything into it at all. It's just a question of mix, months of pass-throughs that are taken into the quarter or delayed. And we're reverting to more regular mix of projects with, as you know, an increasing share in oncology, which typically burn a little slower. That might have a little bit at the margins of an impact. But I wouldn't read anything into it. Thanks, Shlomo. Yes. Thank you, Anne. It's a good question. Look, TAS growth in the first quarter was within the range we expected. You are correct that the guidance we gave on an organic constant currency ex COVID basis for the year, I think our guidance is 7% to 9%. And therefore, 6% clearly is right under that. But we did tell you that we did fully expect Q1 to be just under that. So our expectations were more in the 6% to 7%, 6% to 8% for the first quarter and we expected a slower start as you suggest, due to the cautiousness we saw in December in customers' discretionary spending and so we assume this was going to spill over, as you suggest, into the Q1, and that's why we assume a slower start in the year for this business. The reason why it's a little lower than our long-term growth expectation is due to the analytics and consulting business piece of TAS. That is about, I want to say, just under 25% of the total business in TAS. And as we said many times before, it's the shortest cycle and contains the most discretionary spend activity of the entire TAS portfolio. So what we are seeing is not cancellations of projects, not decisions to not conduct the projects. For the most part, these are projects that need to be done, pricing and market access studies, as an example, have to be done at some point. But the discretionary aspect applies to timing for the most part, okay? No one has a project that they don't need to do. These are products that need to be done, but they don't need to be done right this second. And we are seeing customers delaying decisions and pushing things to the right. That is what gives us confidence that in the latter part of the year, those projects will have to be done. So that's why we maintain our 7% to 9% organic constant currency excluding guidance for the year. Now we expect that cautiousness to continue into the second quarter. And we're assuming growth so far in line with the first quarter. Again, we're not seeing any customers walking away from projects or canceling anything. It's just consistent with what we saw at the end of Q4, delaying a project. We do expect the situation to improve in the second half because the pipelines are stronger and the customers eventually need to actually spend on those projects. Thank you. Okay. Well Dave, thanks for the question. I want to use the opportunity to state as clearly and definitively as I can. We simply are not, I repeat, we are not seeing any of what you suggest. And no one is - first of all, on the funding question, I don't know how many times I'm going to repeat it. I've been doing this for five quarters in a row. We are not seeing any funding issue. In my introductory remarks, I share some of the statistics. Actually everything is up on the funding front. So we are not seeing any delays, any unusual cancellations, any postponing of decision-making within our portfolio. It could be that others are saying that we just are not seeing it. Once again, the overall RFP flow is at a record high. It's up 15% sequentially versus Q4 of '22 both the mid and the EBP segments are up strong double digits. I said before, it's up 15%. The qualified pipeline, which is, again, an even earlier indicator, is up almost up 8%. It's actually over 8% year-over-year, and it's almost $15 billion with, again, a record qualified pipeline. The total pipeline is over $25 billion. Also mid [ph] more than 5% growth year-over-year, $2.6 billion of net bookings in the quarter, it's more than the entire backlog of some of our smaller competitors out there. Our book-to-bill 1.28 is extremely strong in the current environment. And I think from what I've seen, the highest of any of our peers. Our backlog is up more than 10% year-over-year. That's on a reported basis. Excluding FX, it's up 11.3%. So again, what I'm trying to share some metrics with you here, if we look at by segment, again, it's across the board, large mid EBP. I've got a lot of numbers here, but everything is - honestly, everything is green here. Nick, do you have any other color to add to this? Right. And as I mentioned in my introductory remarks, we have been able to offset some of that unfavorable impact of stock shortages that Ron just brought up and we talked about before because site selection has been accelerating. I mentioned it was up double digits year-over-year and that increased productivity helped us in the quarter, and we expect we'll continue to do so the rest of the year. We also - I mentioned also in my introductory remarks, are introducing rapidly more technology at the site in order to free up personnel time and increase our productivity. Yes. I mean the answer is in your question. We have a very strong momentum. We operate the vast majority of what we do is in the sweet spot of the clinical trial process, it's Phase III stuff. We're not affected by the primate issue, zero. And even in the primate issue continues for the next 3 years, you wouldn't see it at all in our numbers. We've already looked at that. And we continue to gain share. I know I gave examples on the FSP segment, it's true across the board in oncology, we just are winning in the marketplace. We displaced incumbents in a number of occasions with large clients. I think I don't see any - really no issues whatsoever on the R&DS front, not say for the execution and operational issues we have encountered. I mentioned that the attrition levels are coming down. I mean, I said before that the peak of the attrition a year ago, so we had more than 20% attrition, which is horrendous and we're now back to - I said pre-pandemic levels, actually well below that, which is barely over 10%, which is amazing and very good. And that enables us to do a lot more work, a lot faster. Thank you, David. Okay. Well, look, on a full year basis, we're expecting actually obviously less reimbursable expenses because of the disappearance of the COVID work, which was, as you suggest, very high pass-through expenses for those COVID vaccine trials. I wouldn't read much in the quarter because this volatility and depends on the mix of what you executed. So I don't -- I'm not -- to be honest, the book-to-bill is more or less similar to we -- I think you -- I read you know , I religiously do that before the call, your first flash note and you asked why we only reported our 606, our book-to-bill at 1.28. And by the way, I asked the same question to the team when they gave me the first draft and I agree with the rationale. As you've seen in recent quarters, essentially the numbers have tended to converge, which is essentially what we expected to happen. We will give you the breakdown or the ex reimbursable expenses book-to-bill, when we think there is -- when there is a big discrepancy and it is a significant and helps give you understanding of what happened in the quarter in terms of bookings. But if it's very close as it was last quarter as it is this quarter, which is not going to do that. The change to 606 standard that happened more than 5 years ago and none of our competitors actually disclosed that level of granularity or report any extra reimbursable expenses book-to-bill. But again, I wouldn't read and you might more here in the quarter, Nick or Ron, any commentary or color on Eric's question. Yes. And Eric, the - just on the past because again, we -- I mentioned we did execute faster this past quarter on our NDS backlog. It's true we built - we accelerated. That's a - this is why we recognize more revenue. And as a result, there were more pass-through during the first quarter. I don't know that it's going - I don't think you'll see the same in the next few quarters based on the modeling I saw. Normally, no, but it's you. Go ahead. Thank you. Yes. So if we improved it's flattish, right? Again, in theory, yes, but we don't expect that to happen. I mean there will be eventually other models, and they will become available. I mean, I don't -- we're not worried about this at all. Yes. Thank you. Just to clarify, the M&A spend has nothing to do with funding. It's not included in the funding numbers. So these are two different and independent points. The heightened M&A activity is a plus, obviously, and is a tailwind for us. As you know, we've got large clients that are buying molecules for which work needs to be done. So this is generally a favorable trend for us. Thank you. Thank you. No, your assumption is incorrect. The growth numbers we mentioned are in dollars. Yes. The comment on TAS is just correct. That's our expectation currently based on the pipeline. What was the first question? I'm sorry. Nothing was negligible. Yes. Thank you, Justin. On the first question, Nick, you have any... Remains very strong, same. Nothing - really nothing changed on the real-world side. On the -- it really, really varies. There are clients who like to start even before FDA approval, sometimes well before when the early results are strong, data is good in the trial, they get - they want to get prepared. And we do those studies early, sometimes it's around the time of the approval. Sometimes it's a little later. Again, it depends, by the way, it depends on the market. Some clients may decide to introduce a drug in Europe or in some markets in Europe before others, et cetera, and it has to do with when the approvals in specific geographies occur. So it really varies. There's no [indiscernible] lead time. And that's why, again, quarter-on-quarter is discretionary. It's going to have to be done, but you can delay when you do it. Okay. Justin, thank you for your four questions. And I'm just going to answer briefly the last one, and then I suggest that the team will be available here the rest of the day and the next few days to answer any further questions. But the - on your question about market share, there's no way around it. I've said it before, and we again did this quarter. We have a high book-to-bill ratio around on the largest base revenue, you can assume that there is a gain share that's ongoing. The specific segments, I mentioned in my introductory remarks, in oncology, we know we are growing a lot faster and we are gaining share, that's by therapeutic area. And then in terms of the segments, again, it's across the board, but it was particularly significant this past quarter in FSP as well. So that's the color I can give you on share. Thank you."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Kerri Joseph, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasury. Mr. Joseph, please begin your conference.\nKerri Joseph: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our third quarter 2024 earnings call. With me today are Ari Bousbib, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Ron Bruehlman, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Eric Sherbet, Executive Vice President and General Counsel; Mike Fedock Senior Vice President, Financial Planning and Analysis; and Gustavo Peroni, Senior Director, Investor Relations. Today, we will be referencing a presentation that will be visible during this call for those of you on our webcast. This presentation will also be available following this call on the Events and Presentations section of our IQVIA Investor Relations website at ir.iqvia.com. Before we begin, I'd like to caution listeners that certain information discussed by management during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those stated or implied by forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties associated with the company's business, which are discussed in the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings. In addition, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures on this call, which should be considered a supplement to and not a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the comparable GAAP measures is included in the press release and conference call presentation. I would now like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Ari Bousbib.\nAri Bousbib: Thank you, Kerri, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today to discuss our third quarter results. IQVIA delivered another quarter of strong operational results. Revenue came in above the high end of our guidance range, representing about 6.5% growth, excluding the impact of foreign exchange and COVID-related work. And we also delivered 14% growth in adjusted diluted EPS. As we expected, the environment for our short-cycle businesses continues to improve as our clients are launching new drugs and executing on critical commercial programs. In fact, as revenue growth accelerated in Q3 to over 8% year-over-year, with growth in all subsegments. This reaffirms the second half growth trajectory that we had anticipated for TAS since the beginning of the year. And we now expect TAS growth for the year at the high end of our mid-single-digit range. On the clinical side, the near-term market environment continues to be choppy as we've been discussing in prior earnings calls. None of this is new, but as you know, we've been facing aggressive competitive pricing and tougher negotiations. Additionally, the trend that started over 1.5 years ago with large pharma re-prioritizing their program portfolios as a result of the IRA has been continuing, and this has been leading to a higher-than-normal level of cancellations, and we expect this to be the case again in the fourth quarter. On the EBP side, funding levels this year have improved. But as you know, it does take time for this funding to translate into actual RFP flows and even more time to translate into awards. Our bookings in the quarter included a substantial cancellation due to drug futility that impacted our quarterly net new business by approximately $350 million for that 1 trial. The reported net book-to-bill was 1.06x, but excluding the specific cancellation, the book-to-bill would be 1.22x. Lastly, in late September, 2 clients notified us of their need to delay 2 mega studies that were already in start-up phase due to client-related logistics issues. This affects our short-term guidance, and Ron will share more about that later. While we navigate through these short-term challenges, it's important to remember that our CRO business is a long-cycle business. The demand metrics give us confidence in the strength and resilience of our business. I'd like to share some details of what we are seeing. Firstly, as you may know, many large pharma companies have been running processes this year to reevaluate and consolidate their strategic partnerships. To date, we have successfully renewed every single large pharma strategic partnership. In fact, we've added new relationships, displaced incumbents and expanded the scope in over half a dozen of our strategic partnerships with large pharma clients. There are 2 aspects to this successful performance by the RBS team. One is that our existing large pharma customers have reaffirmed their trust in IQVIA. And two, it opens up opportunities for us to gain greater share of wallet in future programs because these clients have consolidated their strategic partnerships. In the EBP world, biotech funding reached about $16 billion in the quarter according to BioWorld, and that means that year-to-date, biotech funding was over $80 billion, which represents more than 50% growth in funding year-over-year. Now again, as I remarked earlier, it does take time, and it could take 1 year to 1.5 years before that funding translates in actual awards. Three, our backlog reached a new record of $31.1 billion at the end of the quarter, and that represents growth of 8% compared to the prior year. Four, our trailing 12-month book-to-bill remains healthy at 1.22x. Fifth observation, our next 12 months revenue from backlog is up 5.5% year-over-year. Our quarterly RFP flow continued the same trend we saw in the first half, increasing mid-single digits year-over-year. And finally, our qualified pipeline in the quarter is up across all customer segments, and it grew low double-digits overall compared to the prior year. And that is good. Now just to be balanced, I should point out that in stronger market environments, that qualified pipeline has sometimes been up in high double-digits. Now let's turn to the results for the quarter. Revenue for the quarter grew 4.3% on a reported basis and 4.2% at constant currency. Compared to last year, and excluding COVID-related work from both periods, we grew the top line about 6.5% at constant currency of which just under 5% is organic growth. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA increased 5.7% and driven by revenue growth and ongoing cost management discipline, and that resulted in 30 bps of margin expansion. Third quarter adjusted diluted EPS of $2 and $0.84 increased 14.1% year-over-year. I'd like to share a few highlights as is our practice of business activity. Let me start with RMBS, where we continue to differentiate with our therapeutic expertise, clinical technology and public health offerings. IQVIA won a top 10 pharma partnership as a new preferred provider for Central Lab as well as secured extension for several existing FSP engagements in clinical monitoring, data management and clinical technology. We were awarded a strategic partnership to provide VCT solutions for metabolic and cardiovascular program at top 15 pharma clients. We're the only company that can offer the VCT services and technology without having to partner with third parties. Within oncology, which is, as you know, a key therapeutic area for our industry, we were selected by several leading sponsors in the quarter, including a U.S. biotech client to manage a large global Phase III study for renal cell carcinoma for patients who have progressed after first-line immunotherapy combinations. A large pharma customer to conduct an early phase trial in prostate cancer, leveraging our expertise in dose escalation and both expansion study designs, a biotech client to run a global Phase III study for a biosimilar targeting multiple myeloma. This project aims to bring the first biosimilar for multiple myeloma to market, a biotech client leader in cell and gene therapies to conduct a groundbreaking Phase III trial for reoccurring cancer in the lymphatic system. Across these awards, we differentiate with our ability to run global studies with dedicated teams as well as our AI-enabled site selection solutions. Within clinical technology, in fact, we continue to expand our recently launched one home for sites offering. A biotech client selected IQVIA to increase clinical trial capacity by streamlining access to multiple vendor sites via our single sign-on platform. In the quarter, a large biotech client selected IQVIA to expedite the setup of a trial to deliver vaccines for Mpox in Sub-Saharan Africa addressing a critical outbreak in the region and significant unmet medical needs. Finally, IQVIA in partnership with the coalition for epidemic preparedness and innovations [SETI], the Rwandan government and the several institutes responded to an outbreak of the Marburg virus, a hemorrhagic fever with greater than 50% futility in Rwanda at the end of September. Our organizations collaborated to mobilize and dose the first patient with an investigational vaccination within 9 days of the outbreak. Moving to TAS. As you saw from our results, the business is recovering even better than we had forecasted. One area we continue to make great strides in is in building differentiating AI capabilities across our offerings. You will have seen we recently launched the IQVIA AI assistant, which is a new generative AI tool designed to provide life science customers with quick and powerful insights through a user-friendly conversational interface. This allows users to ask complex business questions and receive comprehensive and reliable answers in real time. IQVIA AI assistant is built on IQVIA's trademark health care-grade AI which enables extensive privacy safeguards and provides expert validation of accurate, reliable output as is demanded by the health care industry. IQVIA was awarded a multiyear contract by a large pharma client to deliver our next best action offering for sales reps across 9 countries. This AI-enabled solution optimizes sales rep engagement activities and enhances their interactions with HCPs. IQVIA secured a multiyear contract with a North American biotech clients to improve workflow efficiency through an integrated fully connected intelligent solution that includes OCE, orchestrated analytics, and one key offerings. The top 10 clients shows IQVIA to improve HCP engagement for a new schizophrenia treatment. And in this case, we displaced the incumbent by offering a solution that will enable daily alerts based on new real-time inputs versus the incumbent weekly frequency. The top 5 pharma clients awarded IQVIA, a multiyear contract to provide co-pay support for oncology and women's health franchises. This deal enhances patient access to medications and drive better health outcomes. A couple of examples in the real world segment, the top 5 pharma clients selected IQVIA to support the launch of the new GLP-1 assets targeting weight loss based on European payer reimbursement models. The top 5 pharma client engages IQVIA to provide an evidence-based approach for a client's medical affairs team to optimize funding decisions and prelaunch activities in the North American market. A top 20 large pharma clients awarded IQVIA contract to support engagement with HCPs and KOLs based on detailed share of voice analysis of scientific and clinical experts in 9 countries across all core therapeutic areas for the client. Finally, and before I turn it over to Ron for more details on our financial performance, I'd like to invite you to our IQVIA Investor Day, which has been scheduled for December 10th on the campus of our headquarters in Durham, North Carolina. Our Investor Relations team will be available to provide additional logistical details. Event information is already available on our investor portal. Ron?\nRon Bruehlman: Thanks, Ari, and good morning, everyone. Let's start by reviewing revenue. Third quarter revenue of $3.896 billion grew 4.3% on a reported basis and 4.2% at constant currency. In the quarter, COVID-related revenues were approximately $20 million, down from about $100 million in the third quarter of 2023. Now excluding all COVID-related work from both this year and last, constant currency growth was about 6.5%, of which just under 5% was organic. The majority of the acquisition contribution was in the TAS segment as is typical. Technology & Analytics Solutions revenue was $1.554 billion, up 8.6% reported and 8.2% at constant currency. R&D Solutions revenue of $2.162 billion was up 1.9% recorded and an even 2% at constant currency. Excluding all COVID-related work, growth at constant currency in R&DS was about 6%. Lastly, Contract Sales and Medical Solutions or CSMS revenue of $180 million declined 1.6% reported and 1.1% at constant currency. Year-to-date revenue was $11.447 billion, up 3% on a reported basis and 3.5% at constant currency. Excluding all COVID-related work, growth at constant currency was 6% year-to-date. Technology & Analytics Solutions revenue was $4.502 billion year-to-date, up 3.9% reported and 4.3% constant currency, excluding all COVID-related work, growth at constant currency and TAS was 5% Now as a reminder, our Q1 2023 was last quarter were TAS revenue had a meaningful contribution from COVID-related work. R&D Solutions year-to-date revenue of $6.404 billion with up 2.6% at actual FX rate and 3% at constant currency. Excluding all COVID-related work, growth at constant currency in R&DS was 7%. Lastly, Contract Sales and Medical Solutions year-to-date revenue of $541 million was flat on a reported basis and up 3% at constant currencies. Let's move down to P&L. Adjusted EBITDA was $939 million for the third quarter, which was growth of 5.7%, while year-to-date adjusted EBITDA was $2.688 billion, up 3.3% year-over-year. Third quarter GAAP net income was $285 million and GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.55. Year-to-date, GAAP net income was $936 million, which represented $5.08 of diluted earnings per share. Adjusted net income was $523 million for the third quarter. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $2.84, up 13.2% and 14.1%, respectively, versus prior year. Year-to-date, adjusted net income was $1.478 billion or $8.02 per share. Our backlog at September 30th was $31.1 billion. That's up 8% year-over-year and 6.7% at constant currency. Next 12 months revenue from backlog was $7.8 billion, going 5.5% year-over-year. Reviewing the balance sheet now. As of September 30th, cash and cash equivalents totaled $1.572 billion and gross debt was $13.512 billion and that resulted in a net debt of $11.940 billion. Our net leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 3.27x trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA. Third quarter cash flow from operations was $721 million, and capital expenditures were $150 million, resulting in a very strong free cash flow of $571 million. You saw in the quarter that we repurchased $200 million of our shares. That leaves us with just under $2.2 billion of share repurchase authorization remaining under the current program. Okay. Let's turn to guidance now. Now while our views on industry fundamentals remain positive, we are updating our full year guidance due to the delay in the 2 separate fast-burning mega trials, which clients communicated to us at the end of the quarter. These delays resulted from client-related logistical issues. Our team is working closely with these customers to ensure timely resumption of the trials in 2025. For the year, we now expect revenue to be between $15.350 billion and $15.400 billion, adjusted EBITDA to be between $3.675 billion and $3.7 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share to be between $11.10 and $11.20. There is no material change from our prior guidance to our assumptions around COVID related step-down in foreign exchange. The revenue growth contribution from acquisitions is expected to be about 1.5 points for the year. Now the second -- excuse me, at the segment level, we currently expect TAS to grow approximately 6% for the full year and R&D approximately 5%. Both growth rates are at constant currency, excluding the impact of the COVID revenue step down. For the fourth quarter, we expect revenue to be between $3.903 billion and $3.953 billion. This includes TAS revenue of growth of approximately 8% in R&DS revenue growth of about 1%, both at constant currency and in the case of R&DS, excluding COVID-related impact. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $987 million and $1.12 billion. And adjusted diluted EPS for the quarter is expected to be between $3.08 to $3.18. And this guidance assumes that foreign currency rates as of October 30th continue for the balance of the year. So to summarize, we delivered another quarter of strong operational results. Revenue came in above the high end of our guidance at about 6.5% year-over-year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange and COVID-related work, adjusted EBITDA margin expanded to 24.1%. Adjusted diluted EPS grew by 14% and as interest expense is no longer a headwind. Free cash flow was again strong, going 31% year-over-year, representing 109% cash conversion of adjusted net income. R&DS bookings were affected by the cancellation of one large program due to drug futility. We updated our Q4 guidance to reflect the delayed start of 2 fast-burning mega trials that are now expected to resume again in 2025. And while we are experiencing some near-term bumpiness in R&DS forward-looking indicators continue to signal a healthy demand environment, confirming the strength and resilience of this business into 2025 and beyond. And with that, let me hand it back over to the operator to open the Q&A session.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Ann with Mizuho.\nAnn Hynes: Any thoughts on preliminary 2025? I know the industry is going through a tough time now. But do you think you could still grow in that kind of high single-digit range given the backdrop?\nAri Bousbib: Well, thank you, Ann. We don't usually give guidance for the following year at the time of the third quarter earnings release, but we do plan to at least give some indication of the '25, we look like at our investor meeting on this December 10th. And as always, to give you more precise guidance for the year, concurrent with the full year earnings release. Now having said that, look, I'm going to depart from what everybody else in the room is telling to do, and I'm going to tell you that what -- and I'll do that because the environment is so shaky and obviously, you're wondering what's going to happen in '25. So look, if you look at '24, we grew -- we will have grown the company about mid-single digits, okay? After all the short-term challenges that we signaled are absorbed. And my expectation is that it will be similar in '25. That's really a high-level expectation. We haven't finished our planning process, as you can imagine. But if you look at the segments TAS, as predicted, rebounded in the second half, and that is a short-cycle business. So I think things are coming back as expected, and we anticipate this will continue. So if TAS grows this year at constant currency, again, around 6% or so, then I think I'm expecting that the same will be true at least in '25. And then for RDS, which will continue to deal with these short-term cancellations in Q4 and probably the early part of '25, we are projecting a 5-ish percent growth, 5% plus growth for RDS for this year. I'm going to assume at this early stage, a little bit similar. That's what's guiding my observation that I think company-wide would be around those levels as well in '25. Again, that's just as a placeholder, I invite you to join us on December 10th, where our planning will be more advanced, and we'll share more about that. And certainly, our full year detailed guidance when we reach full year earnings.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Shlomo with Stifle.\nShlomo Rosenbaum: Ari, I know it's one question, but I just want to get a lot more detail, if you can, on the trial delays because I can't talked about 2 trial issues also, they were talking about financial re-prioritization and stuff like that with some of their clients. You're talking about some kind of logistical issues. Can you give us a little bit more detail? Are these logistics physical logistics? What else could be involved in that? Does it have anything to do with the financials and what kind of confidence do you have that the projects will really ramp into the second half of '25? And if you kind of flush that out as much as possible would appreciate it.\nAri Bousbib : Yes. So look, I mean, what other competitors are experiencing is absolutely coincidental that 2 trials are out, and we have 2 trials. I understand why you're asking the question. Just again to step back and look at what's happening. We've got a general environment where, as I stated in my introductory remarks, large pharma has been reprioritizing their programs is nothing new here, and that has led that a direct consequence of the IRA. That has led to an elevated a number of cancellations. That affects the industry. That's the market environment. And frankly, even in that environment, we normally should be expected given our scale and performance and momentum, we should be expected to continue to deliver. And that's what we did for the first 3 quarters of the year. Separately and unfortunately, at the same time, we have had to deal with a very large cancellation that has nothing to do with reprioritization has to do with futility. And that obviously is affecting our short-term impact. Now in a normal environment, we would have been able to absorb that and move on. But because it's such a tough environment, and we're dealing with a general heightened level of cancellations, we've not been able to absorb that. Again, separately and unfortunately, concurrently, to clients, this is totally independent of anyone else of any reprioritization of any financial considerations of anything else, have had for their own reasons, we know what the reasons are. I cannot share them with you. We are subject to very strict NDAs for reasons. It has absolutely nothing to do with the drug, with us, with financials, we just can't tell you what the reasons are. I regret that. But those trials will resume, they happen to be fast burning, and they have tend to be very large. We are confident that they will resume in '25. Now I know it's a lot to absorb. And when you look at the whole picture, that's a lot of different things. I regret it as much as you, but that's the reality we're facing with. The choppy environment will navigate that on a normal circumstances, but we've had to deal with 2 discrete events unrelated really to the environment.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Anne with JPMorgan.\nAnne Samuel: I was hoping perhaps you could help us understand just maybe the timing of some of these dynamics of the cancellations, how much notice do you get in advance? And when we think about the delays for kind of pushing to the back half of next year, did they impact any other projects for 2025, or does that become incremental to 2025?\nAri Bousbib: Okay. On cancellations, typically, Look, it depends, okay? All these -- there's 2 types of cancellations. And I'm going to roughly say that in this past year, what we are seeing is that about half is due to the reprioritization and about half is the normal drug futility based on results. How does it happen with the reprioritization, it's a process that our clients are going through? And they've been going through this for 1.5 years, and I believe we are peaking at this point. It has an end. This process has an end. I see this ending at the end of this year. That's my prediction. It's 1 month's prediction. But I think that we're going to still see elevated cancellations in the fourth quarter. We don't -- we -- now IQVIA does not give quarterly numbers for cancelation [Indiscernible], I've said before, normally, it's about $0.5 billion, and it can vary plus or minus $200 million either side. It's by definition, it's not a constant number. It cannot be the same number every quarter, okay? So there are quarters where it's 300. The -- as quarter whether it's 250, they are post 600, 700, the average is around 500. And I think that we are seeing -- I wouldn't be -- I'm not surprised to so see quarters where we have doubled that number because of these reprioritizations, okay? So that's what we're dealing with. The traditional cancellations other than reprioritization, the traditional cancellations that are due to data it usually takes time because you've got a piece of data that's not favorable. As you know, there are independent panels investigated panels that review that data, the discussions with the FDA. It's a long process. And even in order to reach the decision to cancel, it takes time. When that happens, it also takes time to unwind the trial. If the trial is ongoing as opposed to the trials that are canceled because of reprioritization, which are things that are simply taken out of backlog, programs are canceled because they are in the middle in flight because of results, it takes time to unwind. It could take 2 or 3 quarters because we have to deal with patients that are -- that have been dosed, that are on the treatment, et cetera. So there are serious reasons. And often, it leads to additional bookings of extra work in order to facilitate that disengagement. So that's -- again, it's a complex unwinding process. But I hope that helps answer your question. Ron?\nRon Bruehlman: A, you would also, I think, asked about delays and whether the delays at incremental work in 2025, don't forget, these are multiyear trials. So if '24 work gets pushed into '25, sure, we pick it up there, but '25 work gets pushed into '26. So I wouldn't think of these as being incremental to 2025.\nAri Bousbib: Right. That's correct. However, the sequential growth will be affected, right? So just because of the compares and --\nRon Bruehlman : Exactly. And we'll give you more information on the sequential growth that we expect as we go forward during our normal guidance process.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Luke Barclays.\nLuke Sergott: A couple of cleanups here to start. On the M&A, you guys did $228 million, I think, in the quarter. Any update there on like the financial profile and is all this in TAS and kind of how we think about that business growing so we can -- from more perspective in the next year?\nAri Bousbib: Yes. Thank you. Well, yes, you're correct. As has been typically the case, the majority of our acquisition contribution is in TAS. But I would point out that in the quarter, TAS had a very strong step-up in organic growth. In fact, more than 3x sequentially. The company-wide organic growth was just under 5%, excluding acquisitions. So acquisition contributed to just over 1.5 points to our about 6.5 points of growth at constant currency, excluding COVID. Now if you do the math, you'll see that the organic growth in TAS was also mid-single-digits, which, again, is over 3x what it was in the prior quarter. So strong in TAS across the board organically. Since you asked about acquisitions, I just want to step back and reiterate what I've said many times before, and that is that acquisitions are an important part of our growth algorithm, always has been the case, and hopefully, will continue to be the case. In fact, we always aimed at least 2 points of incremental growth from acquisitions. But if you look at our numbers, you'll see that historically, we've never been able to do 2 points plus of growth. It's been more between 1 and 1.5 points. And this year, hopefully, 1.5% of contribution from acquisitions. Now bear in mind, we do a very large number of tiny, tiny deals, okay? You have the list here in front of you, Ron?\nRon Bruehlman : Just to give an example -- a couple of examples this year in the -- in a TAS area, we did an acquisition of a commercial engagement company, H3O, that has $1 million of annual revenue, we did a real-world platform B2i, that had slightly over $1 million of revenue. So when you look at the total number of acquisitions we do, it looks like a really big number, but there are any number of very small acquisition.\nAri Bousbib: That's typical. If you look at our list of actual acquisitions with all these little fancy names and they are important, okay, these are little deals that we -- we do this because we believe we are pretty good at buying good companies with potential growth. And typically, after we integrate them within a year or 2 of ownership, they do very well. So again, the vast majority of this deal has very little revenue. Now sometimes, we have to pay up a lot. I mean there are -- there's a handful of acquisitions we've done in the past -- in the recent past that we've paid 10x revenue for. I've seeing over the DMD, for example, like a couple of years, which facilitate our entry into the digital space. We paid almost 10x revenue for that company. So if you will, the acquisition number, the dollar paid for the acquisitions and the revenue contributions are not connected. For example, year-to-date, what's the [indiscernible] acquisitions year-to-date as of Q3 --\nRon Bruehlman : $649 million.\nAri Bousbib: Okay. We spent $649 million year-to-date on acquisitions at the -- as of the end of the third quarter. Almost half of that was 1 acquisition, a company called Micra, which is a small specialized CRO in med devices. It's actually an RDS acquisition, and we bought that in the third quarter, sometime in August, if I remember, and that was almost half of the spend. And we paid almost 5x revenue for that. So obviously, it's a big number in terms of the spend, but the revenue contribution this year of that acquisition is de minimis, okay? Because again, we paid almost 5x. We bought that in -- it has maybe one month of revenue in the quarter, and that's what it was. So again, very important acquisition as part of our strategy. Thanks for asking the question. By the way, I would remind you the best deal we ever did was the acquisition of the 40% minority we didn't yet own from our joint venture with Quest in our central lab. That was the largest deal that we did. And we paid $760 million for that. It came with exactly zero revenue because we already consolidated revenue, right? But it was a great deal nonetheless. So again, I hope that helps give context to our acquisition strategy.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Justin with Deutsche Bank.\nJustin Bowers: Looking forward to seeing the lab at the innovation center in December. Ari, just sticking with the M&A. I think at the -- in capital deployment at the beginning of the year, you guys talked about $2 billion deployment. I think when you put together the M&A and the buyback, you're still tracking below $1 billion. So assume nothing gets done in the fourth quarter, would it be fair to assume like sort of like $3 billion of dry powder for 2025? And then just related to the comments around pricing pressure. I think earlier, you've said it's been mostly concentrated to FSP. Are you seeing that spill over all into FSO?\nAri Bousbib: Okay. Well, thank you, Justin. This a great question. On the capital deployment, as you know, we signaled between $2 billion and $3 billion as a long-term goal annually spread between acquisitions and share repurchase. And as you correctly pointed out, so far this year, we saw the numbers so far, we spent $649 million on acquisitions and just $200 million on share repurchase. And frankly, that's because we were looking at bigger acquisitions that we were unable to do either for pricing or other reasons. Acquisitions, as you know, are binary, you do them, or you don't do them. Now based on what I know today, I don't think that we're going to spend a lot more on acquisitions before the end of the year. Maybe, again, I'm speculating between another $50 million to $100 million at the most. And therefore, you correct to point out, that leaves us with a lot of dry powder. My intention before the earnings release was to massively buy shares in the fourth quarter. And today, my intention is even to more massively buy share at the end of the quarter. My general counsel specifically said, on his head here, but I am telling you that we are very excited, and we are going to buy a lot of shares. We have $2.2 billion plus share buyback authorization. And the share price is screaming buy, and that's where we're going to spend our capital. Then you had a question on pricing. Pricing is tough across the board, has been commercial and RDS, obviously, it's not that it's more on FSP than on FSO, it's just that FSP was stronger this year. FSP is perhaps, correct me if I'm wrong, over here, it's about 15% of revenue roughly.\nRon Bruehlman : Yes, correct.\nAri Bousbib: And -- but it's been increasing in terms of our bookings and inching towards 20%, right? So eventually, it will be about 20%. But again, we might win again other FSOs. So I think it will be always between 15% and 20%. And FSP has, as you know, lower margins. So that depresses our -- it's a headwind to our margins because of mix. Every time we do more FSP, pricing is tough across the board, okay? One, because, as I mentioned before, this year, clients, most large pharma companies, put us through a sort of a rebid process, invited every CRO under the song, and as I mentioned in my introductory remarks, we did very well there. Essentially in every single one of these bid processes we were reselected for our existing strategic partnerships, and we expanded with half a dozen strategic partners and expanded the scope of what we are going to be preferred suppliers for, including especially for Central Lab. So we think that the future is very bright on R&DS. And again, pricing, very tough. That's 1 reason. The other reason is that we have, as you know, the industry has kind of sort of split between 3 large CROs and then another set of second-tier who have had, let's say, more trouble in the recent past and who are desperate to win business. And when you're desperate, the place you go to is price. And so all of that, even though they never selected, they end up creating somewhat of a more pricing pressure. And clients, of course, are going to be delighted to use them for that purpose. So these are the reasons. It doesn't look like it's improving. It's going to continue to be tough. But again, we are confident that we will continue to win and do well in the long term.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of David with Jefferies.\nDavid Windley: I wanted to start with just a clarification. I think based on the book-to-bill that you're reporting this morning, you added about $140 million of new wins bookings above revenue. Your backlog is growing about $500 million. Is the difference there just FX? So that's clarification. And then are you thinking about taking the timing issues, the cancellations, et cetera, the pricing pressure that you just commented on, how should we think about your ability to manage cost structure and continue to kind of hold margin or deliver margin as you have in the past in this environment?\nAri Bousbib: Dave, first of all, the first observation in your math, I think, is correct. I don't have the numbers in front of me, but based on what I heard, I think you're absolutely on the mark with the math on the bookings and the backlog. Your question on the cost management is an excellent one, and you probably are inferring from what we said correctly that we have to deal with significant cost headwinds for the following reasons. These delays, as you can imagine, we have already started up those 2 mega trials, okay? They were in start-up phase. And therefore, we stood up the resources and the infrastructure, the teams and everything that's required to perform and deliver on those trials. Now they are interrupted. So it's almost like -- but they are going to resume in '25. I think one of them in second quarter and then the rest basically second half and ramp up in the second half. Now we are not going to let these resources go and do what we just did to ramp up the resources. So that already is a cost that we have to bear. Now obviously, we're going to redeploy some of that against some of the other opportunities, FSP and so on. But nevertheless, there is no question that we are going to be living here over the next 2, 3 quarters, with an extra bucket of costs associated with this. And these are huge trials, okay? And that is going to affect our margins. Now again, we haven't finished our planning process. We have a lot of other levers. We are working constantly on costs. And we -- I mean, you saw, obviously, we hadn't yet been affected by this issue so far, but you saw that so far this year, we've done pretty well. And we've actually in the fourth quarter, achieved record margins, I think, 24.1% is the highest operating margins, that we have achieved since the company was created in '16, correct. So we've done well, 30 bps of expansion this quarter. But again, in the next 2, 3 quarters, we will have to see. And we'll share more details on December 10th and certainly on [Indiscernible] with the full year earnings release. But David, you're exactly on the mark.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Elizabeth with Evercore ISI.\nElizabeth Anderson: Maybe 1 high-level question and 1 number's question. Can you tell me where we are in this sort of strategic partnership? Obviously, that's been an area of strength for you guys. But sort of, are we just through this brand? Are we sort of still beginning? Is that not the right way to think about it? And then on the number's side, can you -- what do you think the interest expense is going to be for 2024 in your updated guidance?\nAri Bousbib: Thank you, Elizabeth. Yes, I mean, the strategic partnerships we did very well this year. Listen, we've been working with these clients for a long time. As you know, we expanded the number of logos that we have preferred partnerships with. And so this year -- and I think it's part of the overall reaction to the IRA and the overall focus on cost management, you know that most large pharma companies announced massive cost reduction programs, and so they opened up, they reopened all of their vendor relationships. I believe that we are largely through all of that. And I think that we are ready to move forward. Most of the large ones essentially have been completed. So that's for your first question. And second question --\nRon Bruehlman : Interest expense, talking about this year, Elizabeth round number, $625 million or so, give or take, around that number, which is not terribly different than what we were telling you before.\nElizabeth Anderson: Got it. And do you want to comment on '25 right now or not on that.\nRon Bruehlman : '25 interest, I mean obviously, it depends to an extent on what the Fed and the ECB do with interest rates, but flattish for next year -- we're anticipating, but we'll update as we go along.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael with Leerink Partners.\nMichael Cherny: I know we don't have formal '25 guidance, so it might be trading a little lightly here. But relative to R&DS and the 5% rough give or take, expectation at this point in time. What are the conditions have to look like relative from a macro basis, cancellation rates, et cetera, to make sure that number is still feasible. Is that predicated on those 2 mega trials re-ramping with the second half? And what are the most important puts and takes you're focused on that could change versus what the current trend is of general market choppiness?\nAri Bousbib: Yes. I mean, look, I wish I had a crystal ball, but I can only tell you what we see now. I believe that by the end of the year, this program reprioritizations will come to an end. We know that because we are in close conversations with our clients. And look, that's the business our clients are in, is to do research and innovate. They have been at this for 1.5 years, started, I think, in the -- just in the kind of middle of last year. I think this is -- we basically know what's been reprioritized and canceled. We know what will be canceled by the end of the year basically. Now there could be other trials that have drug futility issues that can always happen, but that's kind of in a normal range of things, and we anticipate that. In that mid-single-digit type of high-level expectations that we have as of now for '25 for R&DS, that's based on what we know today that has been canceled, the large -- you know that we had this $350 million program canceled in the quarter that we took in. We also had, in the first quarter, launched a $250 million program cancellation. And we know that these 2 programs mega trends have been delayed. And then we factored in everything else. Again, most of the trials are much smaller than that, and we work on hundreds and over 2,000 of them. So it's going to be the normal course of things. These big ones move the needle. If you look at R&DS growth this year, we had 7% in the first quarter. What did we have? First quarter was ex-COVID constant currency --\nRon Bruehlman : 8%.\nAri Bousbib: Right, 8% first quarter. Then we had 6% and 6% in -- on, again, a constant currency ex-COVID basis. And then we're going to have 1% in the fourth quarter. So similar to what I said last year about TAS, it might be like a mirror image in '25, okay, with things going the other way. Just because of the cancellations, the short-term impact of that and the delay is the short-term impact of that. So that's our best I can describe what we expect for '25 at this point based on what we know.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. Mr. Joseph. I turn the call back over to you.\nKerri Joseph: Thank you, operator. Thank you all for taking the time to join us today, and we look forward to speaking with you again in our fourth quarter 2024 earnings call. The team will be available the rest of the day to take any follow-up questions you might have. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Ron Bruehlman",
            "content": "Thanks, Ari, and good morning, everyone. Let's start by reviewing revenue. Third quarter revenue of $3.896 billion grew 4.3% on a reported basis and 4.2% at constant currency. In the quarter, COVID-related revenues were approximately $20 million, down from about $100 million in the third quarter of 2023. Now excluding all COVID-related work from both this year and last, constant currency growth was about 6.5%, of which just under 5% was organic. The majority of the acquisition contribution was in the TAS segment as is typical. Technology & Analytics Solutions revenue was $1.554 billion, up 8.6% reported and 8.2% at constant currency. R&D Solutions revenue of $2.162 billion was up 1.9% recorded and an even 2% at constant currency. Excluding all COVID-related work, growth at constant currency in R&DS was about 6%. Lastly, Contract Sales and Medical Solutions or CSMS revenue of $180 million declined 1.6% reported and 1.1% at constant currency. Year-to-date revenue was $11.447 billion, up 3% on a reported basis and 3.5% at constant currency. Excluding all COVID-related work, growth at constant currency was 6% year-to-date. Technology & Analytics Solutions revenue was $4.502 billion year-to-date, up 3.9% reported and 4.3% constant currency, excluding all COVID-related work, growth at constant currency and TAS was 5% Now as a reminder, our Q1 2023 was last quarter were TAS revenue had a meaningful contribution from COVID-related work. R&D Solutions year-to-date revenue of $6.404 billion with up 2.6% at actual FX rate and 3% at constant currency. Excluding all COVID-related work, growth at constant currency in R&DS was 7%. Lastly, Contract Sales and Medical Solutions year-to-date revenue of $541 million was flat on a reported basis and up 3% at constant currencies. Let's move down to P&L. Adjusted EBITDA was $939 million for the third quarter, which was growth of 5.7%, while year-to-date adjusted EBITDA was $2.688 billion, up 3.3% year-over-year. Third quarter GAAP net income was $285 million and GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.55. Year-to-date, GAAP net income was $936 million, which represented $5.08 of diluted earnings per share. Adjusted net income was $523 million for the third quarter. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $2.84, up 13.2% and 14.1%, respectively, versus prior year. Year-to-date, adjusted net income was $1.478 billion or $8.02 per share. Our backlog at September 30th was $31.1 billion. That's up 8% year-over-year and 6.7% at constant currency. Next 12 months revenue from backlog was $7.8 billion, going 5.5% year-over-year. Reviewing the balance sheet now. As of September 30th, cash and cash equivalents totaled $1.572 billion and gross debt was $13.512 billion and that resulted in a net debt of $11.940 billion. Our net leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 3.27x trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA. Third quarter cash flow from operations was $721 million, and capital expenditures were $150 million, resulting in a very strong free cash flow of $571 million. You saw in the quarter that we repurchased $200 million of our shares. That leaves us with just under $2.2 billion of share repurchase authorization remaining under the current program. Okay. Let's turn to guidance now. Now while our views on industry fundamentals remain positive, we are updating our full year guidance due to the delay in the 2 separate fast-burning mega trials, which clients communicated to us at the end of the quarter. These delays resulted from client-related logistical issues. Our team is working closely with these customers to ensure timely resumption of the trials in 2025. For the year, we now expect revenue to be between $15.350 billion and $15.400 billion, adjusted EBITDA to be between $3.675 billion and $3.7 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share to be between $11.10 and $11.20. There is no material change from our prior guidance to our assumptions around COVID related step-down in foreign exchange. The revenue growth contribution from acquisitions is expected to be about 1.5 points for the year. Now the second -- excuse me, at the segment level, we currently expect TAS to grow approximately 6% for the full year and R&D approximately 5%. Both growth rates are at constant currency, excluding the impact of the COVID revenue step down. For the fourth quarter, we expect revenue to be between $3.903 billion and $3.953 billion. This includes TAS revenue of growth of approximately 8% in R&DS revenue growth of about 1%, both at constant currency and in the case of R&DS, excluding COVID-related impact. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $987 million and $1.12 billion. And adjusted diluted EPS for the quarter is expected to be between $3.08 to $3.18. And this guidance assumes that foreign currency rates as of October 30th continue for the balance of the year. So to summarize, we delivered another quarter of strong operational results. Revenue came in above the high end of our guidance at about 6.5% year-over-year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange and COVID-related work, adjusted EBITDA margin expanded to 24.1%. Adjusted diluted EPS grew by 14% and as interest expense is no longer a headwind. Free cash flow was again strong, going 31% year-over-year, representing 109% cash conversion of adjusted net income. R&DS bookings were affected by the cancellation of one large program due to drug futility. We updated our Q4 guidance to reflect the delayed start of 2 fast-burning mega trials that are now expected to resume again in 2025. And while we are experiencing some near-term bumpiness in R&DS forward-looking indicators continue to signal a healthy demand environment, confirming the strength and resilience of this business into 2025 and beyond. And with that, let me hand it back over to the operator to open the Q&A session. A, you would also, I think, asked about delays and whether the delays at incremental work in 2025, don't forget, these are multiyear trials. So if '24 work gets pushed into '25, sure, we pick it up there, but '25 work gets pushed into '26. So I wouldn't think of these as being incremental to 2025. Exactly. And we'll give you more information on the sequential growth that we expect as we go forward during our normal guidance process. Just to give an example -- a couple of examples this year in the -- in a TAS area, we did an acquisition of a commercial engagement company, H3O, that has $1 million of annual revenue, we did a real-world platform B2i, that had slightly over $1 million of revenue. So when you look at the total number of acquisitions we do, it looks like a really big number, but there are any number of very small acquisition. $649 million. Yes, correct. Interest expense, talking about this year, Elizabeth round number, $625 million or so, give or take, around that number, which is not terribly different than what we were telling you before. '25 interest, I mean obviously, it depends to an extent on what the Fed and the ECB do with interest rates, but flattish for next year -- we're anticipating, but we'll update as we go along. 8%."

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Kerri Joseph, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasury. Mr. Joseph, please begin your conference.\nKerri Joseph: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our second quarter 2024 earnings call. With me today are Ari Bousbib, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Ron Bruehlman, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Mike Fedock, Senior Vice President, Financial Planning and Analysis; and Gustavo Perrone, Senior Director, Investor Relations. Today, we will be referencing a presentation that will be visible during this call for those of you on our webcast. This presentation will also be available following this call in the Events & Presentations section of our IQVIA Investor Relations website at ir.iqvia.com. Before we begin, I would like to caution listeners that certain information discussed by management during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those stated or implied by forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties associated with the company's business, which are discussed in the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings. In addition, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures on this call, which should be considered a supplement to and not a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the comparable GAAP measures is included in the press release and conference call presentation. I would now like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Ari Bousbib.\nAri Bousbib: Thank you, Kerri, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today to discuss our second quarter results. IQVIA delivered another quarter of strong operational results with 5% revenue growth, excluding the impact of foreign exchange and COVID related work, and 8.6% growth in adjusted diluted earnings per share. The fundamentals of the industry remain healthy, which supports our confidence in the outlook for our business. On the commercial side, things are starting to gradually improve, and while customers continue to exercise budgetary cautiousness, we see faster decisions and more focus on carrying out mission critical projects such as those associated with launching new drugs. As you recall, new FDA approvals for 2023 were 55, which was the second largest year since 2017. And in fact, year-to-date approvals are at 21, which is in line with the average for the last five years. In the quarter, TAS came in a little better than our expectations, consistent with the improving leading indicators that we cited earlier this year. Both Consulting and Analytics and real world revenue improved sequentially in the second quarter. We said TAS revenue growth for 2024 was going to be the mirror image of 2023. And in fact, TAS revenue growth was about 3% in the first quarter and it was 4% in the second quarter, excluding COVID and foreign exchange. At constant currency and based on looking -- on forward-looking indicators, we remain confident in our full year forecast for TAS. This implies 6% to 7% growth for the balance of the year, resulting in full year mid-single digit growth, again consistent with the target we established for TAS at the beginning of the year. On the clinical side, while we continue to see the trend we have observed over the past year with large pharma reprioritizing their portfolios of programs and reallocating money to the most attractive ones in response largely to the IRA, demand from our large pharma clients in R&DS remains solid. We are also encouraged by the continued acceleration of EBP funding. In fact, BioWorld reports emerging biotech funding for the second quarter was $22.9 billion, which is up 32% versus the prior year. For the first half, biotech funding is about $70 billion, essentially equal to the entire year of 2023. Obviously, it does take time for funding to translate into RFP flows, but certainly, it bodes well for mid-long term prospects in our EBP segment. In the quarter, R&DS recorded good net new bookings of approximately $2.7 billion, representing a book-to-bill of 127. Backlog reached a new record of $30.6 billion, which is growth of 7.7% versus prior year. And in fact, that's actually 8.1% when you remove the impact of foreign exchange. And of course, all of our usual forward-looking indicators RFP flows, overall pipeline, and qualified pipeline are up. Turning now to the results for the quarter. Revenue for the second quarter grew 2.3% on a reported basis and 3.5% at constant currency. Compared to last year and excluding COVID-related work from both periods, we grew the top line 5% at constant currency, including approximately 1.5% from acquisitions. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA increased 2.7%, driven by revenue growth and ongoing cost management discipline. Second quarter adjusted diluted EPS of $2.64 increased 8.66% year-over-year. Now I'd like to spend a bit of time on highlighting some of our business activities. Starting with us, IQVIA contracted with the Top 20 client to expand the implementation of our commercial technology ecosystem. IQVIA's AI/ML offerings, including analytics and OCE integrate seamlessly into the clients' technology infrastructure and allow our client to manage their data more effectively and to optimize their customer engagement. In the quarter, IQVIA won a multi-year contract with the top five clients to increase the effectiveness of the digital communication strategy. Here, our innovative solution enables targeted audience selection and custom content delivery. In our first quarter call, we shared a preview of a large deal awarded in April for our current OCE offering. This is a multi-year global implementation for a major division of a top five pharma client with 1,000 users, and it's displacing the incumbent. As you know, IQVIA has a rich history of developing AI for healthcare. For the last 10 years, we've invested heavily in artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms that support our clients from clinical development through commercialization. Our AI offerings are specifically engineered to meet the demanding standards of precision, speed, privacy, and trust that are required in healthcare, whether it's in-patient support services or analytics or pharmacovigilance, our proprietary AI software solutions have become market leading. Let me share a few examples of AI wins and awards in TAS this last call. We launched a GenAI solution, which collects structured and unstructured survey inputs from over 30,000 HCPs across 36 countries in multiple languages and in minutes delivers analytics and insights to our clients on how their interactions and messages about their brand resonated. This work would normally take a week at least for human analysts using existing tools. A Top 10 client awarded IQVIA a contract to implement our centralized GenAI reporting and analytics solution across their entire U.S. sales force, consolidating different legacy tools. IQVIA's comprehensive GenAI solution enables users to ask questions and get contextual responses in the form of charts, graphs, and KPIs. This AI solution also proactively alerts the user of key trends, anomalies, and the changes that would be required. In another example, a U.S. Medtech client selected IQVIA to implement IQVIA's AI solution to onboard and train patients to utilize their medical device for diabetes. IQVIA's AI solution incorporates the real time sentiment analysis, provides automated transcription and smart engagement recommendations. It empowers patients to take more control of their treatment, which, of course, promotes better adherence to treatment protocols. Lastly, for AI in TAS, IQVIA won the award of Best Use of Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare out of 4,500 nominations in the 8th Annual MedTech Breakthrough Awards. IQVIA's leading AI solution here is called SmartSolve Enterprise Quality Management System, eQMS, which simplifies quality compliance and connects regulatory and quality processes for life sciences customers. Moving to real world. IQVIA won an effectiveness study with a mid-sized pharma client focusing on patients who have not responded well to their previous migraine treatments. We were selected due to our strong therapeutic expertise combined with our direct-to-patient approach to accelerate recruitment and reduce site burden. A U.S. EBP client awarded IQVIA a real-world post approval safety and efficacy study in Japan for their coronary intravascular therapy. The aim of the project is to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of their device, which could potentially increase the clients' market share in Japan, as well as help the client register the device in other regions. Within the quarter, a Top 15 pharma client awarded IQVIA a significant contract to study the effectiveness of a therapy for schizophrenia. The study will use data tokenization to link multiple data sources and then apply AI to provide a comprehensive view of patients pre and post-therapy in real world settings to physicians, patients and caretakers. Finally, you may have seen that IQVIA was recognized by a respected independent third-party research organization as a leader in medical affairs and life sciences regulatory operations. IQVIA's global end-to-end solutions enable medical affairs customers to manage and curate the richness of data coming into the organization, transforming evidence into insights that can enable actionable initiatives. Let me now move to R&DS. Let's start with the trending therapeutic area, obesity treatment. A Top 15 pharma client selected IQVIA Labs to conduct globally harmonized high volume testing to ensure accelerated enrollment. It's expected this will result in a significant reduction of study timelines for this therapeutic area, where speed-to-market is key. Our strength in the vaccine development area led to another major role to conduct a Phase III trial for a new influenza vaccine that will enroll approximately 50,000 volunteers. Turning to oncology, which represents, once again our largest therapeutic area in R&DS bookings this quarter. I'll offer a few examples. A Top 20 client selected IQVIA to conduct a large Phase III oncology study focusing on small cell lung cancer, a disease with a high need for effective treatments. We won this study due to our strong therapeutic expertise, data and analytics capabilities as well as our proven delivery approach, which includes a dedicated delivery unit project staffing that is exclusively focused on the clients' study. By the way, for some time now, we've been deploying this unique delivery approach for large customers, who have an especially complex study portfolio across multiple therapeutic areas. A biotech client selected IQVIA to support a large scale global complex Phase III program to test and validate their innovative cell and gene therapy vaccine for colorectal cancer. Lastly, in oncology, a Top 25 pharma client awarded IQVIA a contract to develop an optimum clinical strategy and to execute a bladder cancer study in the U.S. They were awarded this engagement-based on IQVIA's AI enabled site selection and feasibility solutions that will help the clients meet aggressive timelines. We discussed AI initiatives in TAS and, in fact, AI enablement is also pervasive in RDS. A couple of other such examples; a U.S. biotech client awarded IQVIA for full service clinical trials, which are supported by IQVIA's AI enabled data and analytics, increasing the likelihood of success for each trial reducing the risk of protocol amendments as well as the need to add countries and sites after the trial starts. In another example, we were awarded a Pharmacovigilance Project by a large biotech client to manage all case processing work worldwide using our AI capabilities. The IQVIA AI enabled solution is designed to dramatically improve productivity, reduce cost, and enhance data quality and accuracy. We will continue to share more exciting AI initiatives across the businesses, hopefully, at future investor forums. I'll now turn it over to Ron for more details on our financial performance.\nRon Bruehlman: Hey. Thanks, Ari, and good morning, everyone. Let's start by reviewing revenue. Second quarter revenue of $3,814 million, grew 2.3% on a reported basis and 3.5% at constant currency. In the quarter, COVID related revenues were approximately $45 million, which is down about $70 million versus the second quarter of 2023. Excluding all COVID related work from both this year and last, constant currency growth was 5%. Technology & Analytics Solutions revenue was $1,495 million, which was up 2.7% reported and 3.8% at constant currency. And if we exclude COVID work from both years, it was exactly 4% growth. As you may recall, Q1 2023 was the last quarter with meaningful COVID activity in TAS. R&D Solutions revenue of $2,147 million was up 2.4% reported and 3.3% at constant currency. Excluding all COVID-related work, growth at constant currency in R&DS was 6%. And lastly, Contract Sales & Medical Solutions revenue of $172 million, declined 2.3% reported, but grew 2.8% at constant currency. For the first half, total company revenues were $7,551 million, up 2.3% reported and 3.2% at constant currency. Excluding all COVID related work, growth at constant currency was 5.5%. Technology & Analytics Solutions revenue for the first half was $2,948 million, up 1.7% reported and 2.4% in constant currency, and excluding all COVID related work growth at constant currency in TAS in the first half was 3.5%. R&D Solutions' first half revenue of $4,242 million was up 2.9% at actual FX rates and 3.6% at constant currency. Excluding all COVID related work, growth at constant currency in R&DS was 7% for the half. And lastly, CSMS first half revenue of $361 million increased 0.8% reported and 5% at constant currency. Let's move down to P&L now. Our adjusted EBITDA was $887 million for the second quarter, representing growth of 2.7%, while first half adjusted EBITDA was $1,749 million, up 2% year-over-year. Second quarter GAAP net income was $363 million and GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.97. For the first half, we had GAAP net income of $651 million or $3.53 of earnings per diluted share. Adjusted net income was $487 million for the second quarter and adjusted diluted earnings per share were $2.64. For the first half, adjusted net income was $955 million or $5.18 per share. Now, as Ari reviewed, R&D Solutions bookings were again strong in the quarter. Our backlog at June 30 was $30.6 billion, up 7.7% at actual currency and 8.1% at constant currency. Next 12 months revenue from backlog increased to $7.8 billion, growing 6.9% year-over-year. So let's turn now to the balance sheet. As of June 30th, cash-and-cash equivalents totaled $1,545 million and gross debt was $13,258 million, that results in net debt of $11,713 million. Our net leverage ratio ending the quarter was 3.25 times trailing 12 month adjusted EBITDA. Second quarter cash flow from operations was $588 million and capital expenditures were $143 million, and that resulted in free cash flow of $445 million. Okay. Turning to guidance. With the first half of the year now behind us and better forward visibility, we're refining our financial guidance for the balance of the year. For the year, we now expect revenue to be between $15,425 million and $15,525 million. Adjusted EBITDA should be between $3,705 million and $3,765 million and adjusted diluted earnings per share between $11.10 and $11.30. There is no material change to our previous assumptions about COVID related step down, acquisition impacts and foreign exchange impacts. By segment, at constant currency ex-COVID, our full year guidance remains the same and is unchanged versus what we gave you back in February, which is to say TAS will grow this year around 5% and R&DS in the 7% range. Moving now to third quarter guidance, we expect revenue to be between $3,830 million and $3,880 million. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $925 million and $950 million and adjusted diluted EPS should be between $2.76 and $2.86. Now all our guidance assumes that foreign exchange rates as of July 18 continue for the balance of the year. So to summarize, we delivered another solid quarter of financial performance. R&DS had bookings of $2.7 billion with a strong book-to-bill of 1.27. TAS performed well against our expectations. Adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 8.6% year-over-year. We're now leaving behind the interest expense headwinds and are moving back towards resuming double-digit EPS growth. Free cash flow for the quarter and for the first half were strong, driven by strong collections performance, and we remain confident that both TAS and R&DS will achieve the full-year targets for revenue growth we provided at the beginning of the year. And with that, let me hand it back to the operator to open the session for Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Shlomo Rosenbaum of Stifel. Your line is open.\nShlomo Rosenbaum: Hi. Thank you very much for taking my questions. It looks like a very solid quarter and we're seeing the TAS improving, which is definitely heartening. A question I have, Ari and Ron, is just -- the guidance is raised for revenue and EPS at the midpoint, but if you look at the EBITDA guidance, it was lowered a little bit. Maybe you could talk about what's going on and the nature of the revenue that's coming through for the year. And maybe just a little bit also in terms of the kind of pacing, we got the third quarter, so we could imply the fourth quarter, and if you could talk a little bit about the ramp you expect in the fourth quarter? Thank you.\nAri Bousbib: Yeah. Thanks, Shlomo. Look, I wouldn't read much into the tweaks in the guidance. It's -- we review all of our business unit forecast and we build all that up and it falls wherever it falls. The FX is slightly more favorable than it was last time we reported. So that kind of is driving a little bit in aggregate, the higher -- a little bit higher on revenue. Again, I wouldn't read much there. EBITDA, it's -- whatever the mix of business fell, okay? When you have a little bit more of certain offerings than others. And as a result, we've got the margin fell whatever it fell. But look, we're still delivering margin growth and even -- I mean, yeah, I see what you mean. I mean, frankly, I didn't even -- we don't focus on that. These are small tweaks, and I wouldn't -- it could vary again next quarter. So there is nothing other than wherever the mix of business fell, frankly. We're still delivering at this level, what's the margin expansion here, about 30 basis points at the midpoint and 50 at the high end. So that's very strong given the markets we've been navigating here from the -- for the first half. And on the EPS, I think it's largely better control of CapEx, which, in turn, more favorability on D&A. And so, it's below the line basically. That drives the EPS -- the higher point on EPS. Again, these are tweaks. I wouldn't pay much -- I wouldn't draw much conclusion on that.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of David Windley of Jefferies. Your line is open.\nDavid Windley: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Good morning. Ari, you've talked in some of your recent public commentary about price pressure or price expectations from customers in your opening remarks. You mentioned budget sensitivity, I think in the context of TAS. Could you just kind of bring us up to current on your assessment of the market environment in terms of customers' willingness to kind of pay your asking price?\nAri Bousbib: A good question. I did talk about this and -- in the past, and there is no change there. It is true. Again, I mentioned in my introductory remarks, it's not like we've, all of a sudden, moved to a different bullish environment, clients, large pharma to focus on that segment first. It has announced, I mean, there is barely a large pharma company that has not announced a massive cost cutting program, multi-billion dollars, and often that comes first with a review of their procurement practices and their vendors and we are a top vendor to pharma. So there's no surprise here. What I said before is still valid. Those budgetary constraints persist, the cautiousness persists and, of course, we -- it's not like we can price whatever we want. Now clients still need to do some projects, many of them had been postponed and delayed. We see that improving. Our decision timeline had started to improve and now they have improved more dramatically. They're not where they were before this whole cautiousness begun. But they have improved significantly, which is why we feel more confident with the forecast. Pricing, yeah, I mean, look, large pharma clients are more disciplined in their spending and therefore, it's a tougher fight out there in terms of negotiations, no question about that. And it's true in TAS and it's true in R&DS, frankly. At the same time, you've got -- on the R&DS side, on the CRO side, you get really an industry that has kind of segmented itself in a way with three large players and a bunch of smaller ones, including some who are, sometimes desperate for business and becoming more undisciplined with respect to how they go about approaching their bids and so on and so forth and, obviously, clients, fully take -- you can expect clients fully taking advantage of that. So again, the answer to your question is pricing continues to be tough for all the reasons I just mentioned, both on the commercial and on the R&DS side. We, of course, respond with continued increase in our productivity programs, cost containment programs, as well as a lot of deployment of AI within our own operations. Those things take time, obviously, there is always a lag when we implement these solutions before we can get the full benefit. But that's what's happening on pricing. Thank you, David.\nDavid Windley: Yeah. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Anne Samuel of JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nAnne Samuel: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I was hoping perhaps you could speak a little bit more about the performance of your different business segments within TAS and perhaps where you started to see some of that outperformance. Thank you.\nAri Bousbib: Yeah. You mean within TAS, the different segments. Look, I mean the data business continues the same and there's no news there and the rest of the business has become -- begun to improve. Sequentially, we've seen improvements everywhere. Year-over-year, in aggregate, it's up. Again, excluding COVID and FX, the rest of the business, as you know, data is low-single digits, flattish, and the rest of the business, in aggregate, has started to grow mid to high-single digits overall. Real world, I would say, in particular -- real world, in particular, has picked up significantly this past quarter.\nAnne Samuel: That's great to hear. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Elizabeth Anderson of Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nElizabeth Anderson: Hi, guys. Thanks so much for the question this morning. Can you talk about the burn rate maybe in the back half of the year? Is that something you could sort of see based on the mix of business at this point that you think could creep up sequentially? How do you kind of view that as we progress through the back half?\nAri Bousbib: On the clinical side?\nElizabeth Anderson: Yeah.\nAri Bousbib: Yeah. I mean, look, this fluctuates, first of all, I mean the reported revenue and even after excluding COVID and FX is -- sometimes it's hard to predict exactly where pass-throughs are going to come in. And so, some of that quarterly fluctuation, if you will, is pass-through the weeks of pass-throughs. That's essentially what we see this -- what we saw this quarter and probably next quarter and then on rebounding for the fourth quarter. But basically of R&DS, we see a growth exactly where we forecasted it at the beginning of the year, which is in the -- after you adjust for COVID and at constant-currency in the 7% plus percent range. With respect to the mix of products -- of our offerings, as you know, we do have a disproportionate share of the oncology programs out there. Again, not surprising. The critical decision factors here are therapeutic expertise and the ability to enroll patients, which is where our unique capabilities with data analytics and AI solutions come in. And as a result, the mix of our bookings and in our backlog continues to increase towards those more complex studies in oncology as well as rare diseases. So the burn rate is largely influenced by that. You can see, by the way, that this is a trend in the industry. If you look at the burn rate for our competitors, and they are also going down. Now in the first quarter, the first-quarter backlog burn was 7%, is that what I recall was 7% and Q2 backlog burn was about the same, a little bit higher, 7.1%. And for the balance of the year, we're expecting it to be very similar. We are encouraged that the next 12 months' bookings are up. I think, we say, it's -- next 12 months' booking -- next 12 months' revenue from backlog is $7.8 billion. That's up from what we reported first quarter in my recollections is growing, was it $7.3 billion? Yeah. It's up $7.3 billion last -- and then this quarter $7.8 billion, that's about 6.9% up. So we feel confident in our back -- in our conversion and is consequently on our burn of projects and revenue growth in the balance of the year and next year.\nElizabeth Anderson: Great. Thanks.\nAri Bousbib: Yeah. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Max Smock of William Blair. Your line is open.\nMax Smock: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking our questions. And apologies if I missed this, but within R&DS, did you quantify how much RFP flows in the qualified pipeline were up at the end of the second quarter? And then how are you thinking about the timeline for those to convert to potential uptick in bookings? Could we see an acceleration in book-to-bill above 1.3 times before the end of the year here or given kind of where we are in the year, are we now at a point where you think a more meaningful potential rebound in bookings is more of a 2025 event? Thank you.\nAri Bousbib: Thank you, Max. I'm just -- we are laughing here because when did 1.3 become the benchmark? I mean, I know we reported amazing over 1.3 book-to-bill ratios in the past couple of years, largely because of the COVID studies and so on. But we're very happy with 1.27, we're happy with 1.2. We are happy with these book-to-bills. They are very, very strong. And you're talking about a rebound in bookings. We had excellent bookings. I don't know what -- we are happy with this performance. There's no rebound. It's very good. I think the bookings we reported this quarter are the first -- third highest ever, right. So I'm not sure what the question is with respect to bookings. Did you ask about conversion as well or no, I'm sorry, I didn't\u2026\nMax Smock: Yeah. I'm sorry -- you set such a high bar, Ari. But yeah, in terms of the first part of the question.\nAri Bousbib: That's true. We hand the price.\nMax Smock: Yeah. Sorry, victim of expectations. But my first part of the question was just around whether or not you can provide any sort of detail or more detail around just how much RFP flows in the qualified pipeline?\nAri Bousbib: Yeah. I'm sorry. Yeah. So again, RFP flows, total pipeline and qualified pipeline in this area are up basically all around. The qualified pipeline, I think, it was up across the number of 12%, was up 12%. And total pipeline is up single digits. RFP grows as well, right, but mid-teens, right?\nRon Bruehlman: Yeah. RFP grows up single-digits.\nAri Bousbib: Yeah.\nMax Smock: Got it. Thanks for taking the questions.\nAri Bousbib: Thank you. Yeah.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jailendra Singh of Truist Securities. Your line is open.\nJailendra Singh: Thank you and thanks for taking my questions. I want to go back to the individual businesses you talked about in TAS -- RWE and Consulting both improving in the second quarter. Last quarter you called out RWE, some recovery after some slowdown in Q4, Consulting taking a step down. How are you thinking about these individual businesses as you think about TAS expectations in second half considering that recovery in consulting remains relatively volatile? And is RWE back to mid to high-teens growth rate or is there still room for recovery there?\nAri Bousbib: No. I mean, we see overall TAS in the second half in the 6% to 7% range at constant currency, okay? That's what we see after -- obviously, businesses are rolling up their forecasts and they are always higher than that, but we take some contingency, we evaluate the environment and we discount that and that's where we are now in the 6% to 7% range, in aggregate. And you could make the assumptions yourself, you could see that in order to get to that. If 30% of the business is essentially flattish, that's the data. So the 70% has to grow in the high-single-digits in aggregate in order to get us to those numbers. So that's where we see the forecast. And we feel, I should add, very confident based on the leading indicators that we look at.\nJailendra Singh: But your real world numbers sound optimistic.\nAri Bousbib: Which one? Double-digits?\nJailendra Singh: Yeah, well, may not\u2026\nAri Bousbib: No, not yet.\nJailendra Singh: No. That is -- not like that.\nAri Bousbib: No. Not high-teens. No. Maybe could be low-teens, but high-single to low-teens for the real world. Exactly. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Justin Bowers of DB. Your line is open.\nJustin Bowers: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. So just in terms of the strength in TAS and the outlook for the rest of the year, how much of that is, in your sense the underlying market improving versus IQVIA winning its fair share of business with some of the tools that you have? And then, part two of that would be, what are some of the changes that you've made to manage the part of the business this year versus, let's say, last year at this time?\nAri Bousbib: Well, thank you. First of all, it's not like the market is rebounding. I mentioned before that client cautiousness and budgetary discipline continues especially at large pharma. It's not -- didn't go away. But what we did say before was that within the portfolio of offerings that we have, there are certain things that are mission-critical for our clients. And what happened last time -- last year at this time is that we expected those things to happen and they were pushed to the right, okay? They were delayed. We said all along that at some point those things have to be done. And that is what is happening now, and what we see happening in the second half. So it's not like the market overall has grown is that the segments of the market that are -- must-do for our clients are finally happening, and they will be happening in the second half. So that's number one for the market. So from that sense, you could say that the market is a little better in the sense that the clients are willing to spend that money, but, again, I mentioned before, the negotiations are tougher. So to answer the second part of your question, what we are doing differently here is, obviously, being more responsive to our client needs. We are being more accommodating with their terms and we are commercially being more aggressive to make sure that we actually do win those projects that the markets are putting out there, the clients are putting out there for bid.\nJustin Bowers: Understood. One quick follow-up. In terms of the improving decision-making timelines that you referenced earlier too. Is that for -- is that around some of the stuff that was pushed out to the right or is that for some new opportunities as well or just something you're seeing more broadly?\nAri Bousbib: Thank you. It's true. It's true broadly. Obviously, the mission-critical stuff is mission-critical and needs to be done. So yeah, that is improving the overall average, but even -- I would say, even for the rest, I think we've seen improved decision-making. Faster timelines. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Tejas Savant of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nTejas Savant: Hey guys. Good morning, and thanks for the time here. Ari, just following up on that line of questioning on TAS. I guess could you share a little bit of color around what gives you confidence to this improved decision-making timeline sort of dynamic continues here, particularly given the election cycle that sort of heating up as we speak? And then, on the analytics and consulting piece within TAS, are you starting to see the work related to those new drug approvals you talked about both year-to-date and last year starting to show up in the project backlog or is that still upside to come heading into year-end in '25? Thank you.\nAri Bousbib: Thank you. Well, look, I don't think the election has much influence on the day-to-day decision-making with respect to launching of drugs. And in order to response to the second part of your question, the answer is yes. Those approvals, obviously, it's not common for a client to decide that they're not going to launch a drug that's been approved. So -- and there is usually a six months to -- six months to nine months\u2019 time lag before that leads to -- between the approval and the time at which the drug is actually launched, and the work associated with it comes to us, so not much. This was delayed a little bit longer versus what it should have been and some of these projects that should have happened earlier this year are happening in the second half of the year. Again, no surprises here. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Dan Leonard of UBS. Your line is open.\nDan Leonard: Thank you. So I have a question on the guidance. It seems that the inferred Q4 sales ramp compared to Q3 is a bit greater than typical. Can you talk about the drivers of that and perhaps even elaborate further on your conviction in the recovery in TAS in the back half? Thank you.\nAri Bousbib: Yeah. You want to answer that anyone here? I mean, look, first of all, there is recovery in TAS. We just talked about it at length in the past few questions. So that's understandable. Secondly, the compare is more favorable. We had a deterioration in the fourth quarter last year. It was the lowest quarter of the year, last year. And we said all along that there would be a mirror image in '24 versus '23, that is the first quarter will resemble the fourth quarter, the second quarter will resemble the third quarter, etc. So we do see fourth quarter up. But -- and it's not unusual by the way, there is a seasonality in Q4 that you can go back many years. It's always the case that Q4 is much stronger. So these are the three reasons; one, recovery in TAS accelerating; two, compares; and three, seasonality, which is not surprising. Anything else, guys, you want to\u2026\nRon Bruehlman: I think I covered that, as simple as that. Yeah.\nAri Bousbib: Yeah.\nDan Leonard: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Charles Rhyee of TD Cowen. Your line is open.\nCharles Rhyee: Yeah. Thanks, Ari. I want to ask about M&A. I think so far you've spent maybe, was it $220 odd million of -- in terms of acquisitions so far in the first half. Can you talk about sort of what the revenue contribution has been because I think in the guide was about 150 basis points of revenue growth? And just curious, has that been in TAS or in RDS or both? And how much do you still need to maybe do for the back half of the year? Thanks.\nAri Bousbib: Yeah. Thank you so much. Yeah. So look, we said all along that it will be -- acquisition would contribute to a better point to our growth this year. And we wish we would do more acquisitions, but valuations continue to be high and we are -- we have a big pipeline, but it's not always the case that we are able to close. So far for the year, it's a little bit more than a point and it's a little bit more entire than in RDS, but that's it. And look, just -- we haven't spent much so far, but we hope to spend more in the second half and we'll see what happens. Yeah.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Ryskin of Bank of America. Your line is open.\nMichael Ryskin: Great. Thanks for taking the question. I'm not sure you addressed this before, but there have been a couple of prominent cancellations of clinical trials in the industry in the last couple of months. You called out one specifically on 1Q that impacted your performance then -- in your book-to-bill then. Just wondering if cancellations have trended any better recently. I know that the prominent ones always make the news, but just wondering what's happening behind below the surface on that trend.\nAri Bousbib: Yeah. No. I mean, look, I mentioned in my commentary and we've said this every quarter in the past few quarters, and it's just not a secret. The world knows that large pharma -- largely in response to the IRA and hypothetical impacts down the line. Large pharma has been reprioritizing their programs. And they've taken off-the-shelf some programs that they felt were either too competitive with other existing drugs or that didn't have the same risk-return profiles that they had assumed pre-IRA when those programs were launched. So as a result of that, there have been a little bit more cancellations than usual really for the past few quarters. I think, in general, look, we don't tell you what the cancellations are. We report the net bookings. Our average quarterly cancellations are in the $0.5 billion range that has been the case for a long time and that's kind of $500 million plus or minus, whatever, $100 million to $200 million. So some quarters it's less. It could be $300 million or $400 million, some quarters, it could be more $600 million to $700 million or more. Most of these cancellations are $10 million, $15 million, $20 million, $25 million programs. That last quarter, because it was well-publicized and because it was a huge one-time number, we chose to let you know about it. We had had questions. Everyone knew that we were the ones doing that program and pre-call, we had had questions. So we decided to let you know about it. Yes, that's what it was. It was -- I don't remember the exact number in the quarter $4 billion in one shot. But that could happen. We have no -- companies are now usually when they terminate a program. It's partly this reprioritization that I just discussed and sometimes it's simply because of the data. And in the case of the program that we disclosed last quarter, it wasn't a reprioritization, it was simply that the data wasn't supporting a continuation of the program, and essentially the program failed as it often happens in this industry.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jack Wallace of Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open.\nJack Wallace: Hey. Thanks for taking my questions. I just wanted to go back and ask a follow-up to the EBITDA guidance questions from earlier. Ari, you called out that there was some mix-shift impacting margins in the back half of the year, and with the TAS guidance largely reiterated in strong second quarter, I was wondering if you could help us get a better understanding for the mix-shift, which sounds like its intra-segment? Thank you.\nAri Bousbib: Yeah. I don't think I can give you much more color than that. It's just what the chips fail, okay? So [Technical Difficulty] and I know that this would have attracted two questions. We would have to look at it again at this range, it's just -- we just build up our forecast and that's where the most appropriate range fell. It could be also -- we did a little bit more acquisitions this quarter and generally, acquisitions come in at very low margin in the first year. So that could have impacted. It's not a big different number, frankly. So in the grand scheme of things. So I can't give you much more color than that.\nJack Wallace: Fair enough. And then on the positive side here, right, in those CE, you won a sizable chunk of a top-five client. Can you just give us a better understanding for the one or handful of reasons that led that client to switch from the long-time incumbent? Thank you.\nAri Bousbib: I think they liked our solution better. I think it gave them more ability to achieve their goals. I can't go into the details of the program, and that's -- yeah, they just like it better. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Donnelly of Citi. Your line is open.\nPatrick Donnelly: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Ari, you talked a little bit on the capital deployment side about wanting to do more in M&A. Maybe the environment is not too friendly at the moment. But how are you thinking about priorities there? I know you guys have bought back some stock. You seem pretty comfortable with the leverage ratio. So maybe just talk through your priorities, M&A landscape, and then again, I mean, any targets on the leverage side with the debt would be helpful.\nAri Bousbib: Yeah. I -- you came -- the line came across not a little bit blurry, but if I understand you asked about capital deployment and acquisitions. Look, you saw that our cash flow performance was actually very strong in the quarter and that obviously helped continue to reduce our leverage. I think we have on a 12-month trailing basis, we ended the quarter at 3.25 times EBITDA, which is very good. I remind you, we were not too long ago in the high 4s, and we said that we were continuing to deliver naturally as EBITDA grows. Acquisitions, yeah, we would -- look, our long-term guidance always contemplates a couple of points of contribution from acquisitions to continue to boost our top line. So far, we've been able to do just over a point. Obviously, we have a rich pipeline and it's hard for me to predict what acquisition will be the second half or in the years to come. It's a binary outcome. So I don't know. I'm not sure if that was your question, but that's what I heard.\nOperator: Your next question\u2026\nKerri Joseph: Okay. This will be the last question, operator.\nOperator: Understood. Your last question comes from the line of Matt Sykes of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nMatt Sykes: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Ari, you mentioned the strong funding trends in the EBP segment at the same time you're still seeing some caution from large pharma. How should we think about the potential revenue mix-shift to VBP versus large pharma and would there be any implications for FSP versus full-service mix in that? Thank you.\nAri Bousbib: Thank you. Well, look, first of all, when there is a timeline between funding and -- on RFP and then the timeline between an RFP and a booking. So if -- this is a business that has long cycles. So it's good that we have just as we were cautioning you not to panic when funding declines, and we said it's not going to affect us for a while. We don't get excited because funding this quarter was very strong. Yeah. It's good for our midterm and long-term prospects, but it's not like it's going to affect the mix. Also, we have a very large backlog, the largest in the industry. And it's not going to meaningfully change the mix of what we do in the next few quarters and what's large pharma, what's EBP, what's full-service versus what FSP. But you are correct that the more EBP, the more full-service, and that certainly helps mitigate the recent trend we've seen where, as we discussed in the past, large pharma has been swinging the pendulum a little bit more towards FSP as it has happened many times in the history of this industry. So you are correct, from that standpoint, that -- as more EBP funding is there, there'll be more EBP work in the quarters to come. And therefore, when that backlog converts into revenue, there'll be a higher mix of full-service versus FSP relative to what it is now. Thank you.\nOperator: With no further time for questions, I now turn the call back over to Mr. Joseph.\nKerri Joseph: Thank you. Thank you for taking the time to join us today, and we look forward to speaking with you again in our third-quarter 2024 earnings call. The team will be available for the rest of the day to take any follow-up questions you might have. Thank you. Have a good day.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Ari Bousbib",
            "content": "Thank you, Kerri, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today to discuss our second quarter results. IQVIA delivered another quarter of strong operational results with 5% revenue growth, excluding the impact of foreign exchange and COVID related work, and 8.6% growth in adjusted diluted earnings per share. The fundamentals of the industry remain healthy, which supports our confidence in the outlook for our business. On the commercial side, things are starting to gradually improve, and while customers continue to exercise budgetary cautiousness, we see faster decisions and more focus on carrying out mission critical projects such as those associated with launching new drugs. As you recall, new FDA approvals for 2023 were 55, which was the second largest year since 2017. And in fact, year-to-date approvals are at 21, which is in line with the average for the last five years. In the quarter, TAS came in a little better than our expectations, consistent with the improving leading indicators that we cited earlier this year. Both Consulting and Analytics and real world revenue improved sequentially in the second quarter. We said TAS revenue growth for 2024 was going to be the mirror image of 2023. And in fact, TAS revenue growth was about 3% in the first quarter and it was 4% in the second quarter, excluding COVID and foreign exchange. At constant currency and based on looking -- on forward-looking indicators, we remain confident in our full year forecast for TAS. This implies 6% to 7% growth for the balance of the year, resulting in full year mid-single digit growth, again consistent with the target we established for TAS at the beginning of the year. On the clinical side, while we continue to see the trend we have observed over the past year with large pharma reprioritizing their portfolios of programs and reallocating money to the most attractive ones in response largely to the IRA, demand from our large pharma clients in R&DS remains solid. We are also encouraged by the continued acceleration of EBP funding. In fact, BioWorld reports emerging biotech funding for the second quarter was $22.9 billion, which is up 32% versus the prior year. For the first half, biotech funding is about $70 billion, essentially equal to the entire year of 2023. Obviously, it does take time for funding to translate into RFP flows, but certainly, it bodes well for mid-long term prospects in our EBP segment. In the quarter, R&DS recorded good net new bookings of approximately $2.7 billion, representing a book-to-bill of 127. Backlog reached a new record of $30.6 billion, which is growth of 7.7% versus prior year. And in fact, that's actually 8.1% when you remove the impact of foreign exchange. And of course, all of our usual forward-looking indicators RFP flows, overall pipeline, and qualified pipeline are up. Turning now to the results for the quarter. Revenue for the second quarter grew 2.3% on a reported basis and 3.5% at constant currency. Compared to last year and excluding COVID-related work from both periods, we grew the top line 5% at constant currency, including approximately 1.5% from acquisitions. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA increased 2.7%, driven by revenue growth and ongoing cost management discipline. Second quarter adjusted diluted EPS of $2.64 increased 8.66% year-over-year. Now I'd like to spend a bit of time on highlighting some of our business activities. Starting with us, IQVIA contracted with the Top 20 client to expand the implementation of our commercial technology ecosystem. IQVIA's AI/ML offerings, including analytics and OCE integrate seamlessly into the clients' technology infrastructure and allow our client to manage their data more effectively and to optimize their customer engagement. In the quarter, IQVIA won a multi-year contract with the top five clients to increase the effectiveness of the digital communication strategy. Here, our innovative solution enables targeted audience selection and custom content delivery. In our first quarter call, we shared a preview of a large deal awarded in April for our current OCE offering. This is a multi-year global implementation for a major division of a top five pharma client with 1,000 users, and it's displacing the incumbent. As you know, IQVIA has a rich history of developing AI for healthcare. For the last 10 years, we've invested heavily in artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms that support our clients from clinical development through commercialization. Our AI offerings are specifically engineered to meet the demanding standards of precision, speed, privacy, and trust that are required in healthcare, whether it's in-patient support services or analytics or pharmacovigilance, our proprietary AI software solutions have become market leading. Let me share a few examples of AI wins and awards in TAS this last call. We launched a GenAI solution, which collects structured and unstructured survey inputs from over 30,000 HCPs across 36 countries in multiple languages and in minutes delivers analytics and insights to our clients on how their interactions and messages about their brand resonated. This work would normally take a week at least for human analysts using existing tools. A Top 10 client awarded IQVIA a contract to implement our centralized GenAI reporting and analytics solution across their entire U.S. sales force, consolidating different legacy tools. IQVIA's comprehensive GenAI solution enables users to ask questions and get contextual responses in the form of charts, graphs, and KPIs. This AI solution also proactively alerts the user of key trends, anomalies, and the changes that would be required. In another example, a U.S. Medtech client selected IQVIA to implement IQVIA's AI solution to onboard and train patients to utilize their medical device for diabetes. IQVIA's AI solution incorporates the real time sentiment analysis, provides automated transcription and smart engagement recommendations. It empowers patients to take more control of their treatment, which, of course, promotes better adherence to treatment protocols. Lastly, for AI in TAS, IQVIA won the award of Best Use of Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare out of 4,500 nominations in the 8th Annual MedTech Breakthrough Awards. IQVIA's leading AI solution here is called SmartSolve Enterprise Quality Management System, eQMS, which simplifies quality compliance and connects regulatory and quality processes for life sciences customers. Moving to real world. IQVIA won an effectiveness study with a mid-sized pharma client focusing on patients who have not responded well to their previous migraine treatments. We were selected due to our strong therapeutic expertise combined with our direct-to-patient approach to accelerate recruitment and reduce site burden. A U.S. EBP client awarded IQVIA a real-world post approval safety and efficacy study in Japan for their coronary intravascular therapy. The aim of the project is to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of their device, which could potentially increase the clients' market share in Japan, as well as help the client register the device in other regions. Within the quarter, a Top 15 pharma client awarded IQVIA a significant contract to study the effectiveness of a therapy for schizophrenia. The study will use data tokenization to link multiple data sources and then apply AI to provide a comprehensive view of patients pre and post-therapy in real world settings to physicians, patients and caretakers. Finally, you may have seen that IQVIA was recognized by a respected independent third-party research organization as a leader in medical affairs and life sciences regulatory operations. IQVIA's global end-to-end solutions enable medical affairs customers to manage and curate the richness of data coming into the organization, transforming evidence into insights that can enable actionable initiatives. Let me now move to R&DS. Let's start with the trending therapeutic area, obesity treatment. A Top 15 pharma client selected IQVIA Labs to conduct globally harmonized high volume testing to ensure accelerated enrollment. It's expected this will result in a significant reduction of study timelines for this therapeutic area, where speed-to-market is key. Our strength in the vaccine development area led to another major role to conduct a Phase III trial for a new influenza vaccine that will enroll approximately 50,000 volunteers. Turning to oncology, which represents, once again our largest therapeutic area in R&DS bookings this quarter. I'll offer a few examples. A Top 20 client selected IQVIA to conduct a large Phase III oncology study focusing on small cell lung cancer, a disease with a high need for effective treatments. We won this study due to our strong therapeutic expertise, data and analytics capabilities as well as our proven delivery approach, which includes a dedicated delivery unit project staffing that is exclusively focused on the clients' study. By the way, for some time now, we've been deploying this unique delivery approach for large customers, who have an especially complex study portfolio across multiple therapeutic areas. A biotech client selected IQVIA to support a large scale global complex Phase III program to test and validate their innovative cell and gene therapy vaccine for colorectal cancer. Lastly, in oncology, a Top 25 pharma client awarded IQVIA a contract to develop an optimum clinical strategy and to execute a bladder cancer study in the U.S. They were awarded this engagement-based on IQVIA's AI enabled site selection and feasibility solutions that will help the clients meet aggressive timelines. We discussed AI initiatives in TAS and, in fact, AI enablement is also pervasive in RDS. A couple of other such examples; a U.S. biotech client awarded IQVIA for full service clinical trials, which are supported by IQVIA's AI enabled data and analytics, increasing the likelihood of success for each trial reducing the risk of protocol amendments as well as the need to add countries and sites after the trial starts. In another example, we were awarded a Pharmacovigilance Project by a large biotech client to manage all case processing work worldwide using our AI capabilities. The IQVIA AI enabled solution is designed to dramatically improve productivity, reduce cost, and enhance data quality and accuracy. We will continue to share more exciting AI initiatives across the businesses, hopefully, at future investor forums. I'll now turn it over to Ron for more details on our financial performance. Yeah. Thanks, Shlomo. Look, I wouldn't read much into the tweaks in the guidance. It's -- we review all of our business unit forecast and we build all that up and it falls wherever it falls. The FX is slightly more favorable than it was last time we reported. So that kind of is driving a little bit in aggregate, the higher -- a little bit higher on revenue. Again, I wouldn't read much there. EBITDA, it's -- whatever the mix of business fell, okay? When you have a little bit more of certain offerings than others. And as a result, we've got the margin fell whatever it fell. But look, we're still delivering margin growth and even -- I mean, yeah, I see what you mean. I mean, frankly, I didn't even -- we don't focus on that. These are small tweaks, and I wouldn't -- it could vary again next quarter. So there is nothing other than wherever the mix of business fell, frankly. We're still delivering at this level, what's the margin expansion here, about 30 basis points at the midpoint and 50 at the high end. So that's very strong given the markets we've been navigating here from the -- for the first half. And on the EPS, I think it's largely better control of CapEx, which, in turn, more favorability on D&A. And so, it's below the line basically. That drives the EPS -- the higher point on EPS. Again, these are tweaks. I wouldn't pay much -- I wouldn't draw much conclusion on that. A good question. I did talk about this and -- in the past, and there is no change there. It is true. Again, I mentioned in my introductory remarks, it's not like we've, all of a sudden, moved to a different bullish environment, clients, large pharma to focus on that segment first. It has announced, I mean, there is barely a large pharma company that has not announced a massive cost cutting program, multi-billion dollars, and often that comes first with a review of their procurement practices and their vendors and we are a top vendor to pharma. So there's no surprise here. What I said before is still valid. Those budgetary constraints persist, the cautiousness persists and, of course, we -- it's not like we can price whatever we want. Now clients still need to do some projects, many of them had been postponed and delayed. We see that improving. Our decision timeline had started to improve and now they have improved more dramatically. They're not where they were before this whole cautiousness begun. But they have improved significantly, which is why we feel more confident with the forecast. Pricing, yeah, I mean, look, large pharma clients are more disciplined in their spending and therefore, it's a tougher fight out there in terms of negotiations, no question about that. And it's true in TAS and it's true in R&DS, frankly. At the same time, you've got -- on the R&DS side, on the CRO side, you get really an industry that has kind of segmented itself in a way with three large players and a bunch of smaller ones, including some who are, sometimes desperate for business and becoming more undisciplined with respect to how they go about approaching their bids and so on and so forth and, obviously, clients, fully take -- you can expect clients fully taking advantage of that. So again, the answer to your question is pricing continues to be tough for all the reasons I just mentioned, both on the commercial and on the R&DS side. We, of course, respond with continued increase in our productivity programs, cost containment programs, as well as a lot of deployment of AI within our own operations. Those things take time, obviously, there is always a lag when we implement these solutions before we can get the full benefit. But that's what's happening on pricing. Thank you, David. Yeah. You mean within TAS, the different segments. Look, I mean the data business continues the same and there's no news there and the rest of the business has become -- begun to improve. Sequentially, we've seen improvements everywhere. Year-over-year, in aggregate, it's up. Again, excluding COVID and FX, the rest of the business, as you know, data is low-single digits, flattish, and the rest of the business, in aggregate, has started to grow mid to high-single digits overall. Real world, I would say, in particular -- real world, in particular, has picked up significantly this past quarter. On the clinical side? Yeah. I mean, look, this fluctuates, first of all, I mean the reported revenue and even after excluding COVID and FX is -- sometimes it's hard to predict exactly where pass-throughs are going to come in. And so, some of that quarterly fluctuation, if you will, is pass-through the weeks of pass-throughs. That's essentially what we see this -- what we saw this quarter and probably next quarter and then on rebounding for the fourth quarter. But basically of R&DS, we see a growth exactly where we forecasted it at the beginning of the year, which is in the -- after you adjust for COVID and at constant-currency in the 7% plus percent range. With respect to the mix of products -- of our offerings, as you know, we do have a disproportionate share of the oncology programs out there. Again, not surprising. The critical decision factors here are therapeutic expertise and the ability to enroll patients, which is where our unique capabilities with data analytics and AI solutions come in. And as a result, the mix of our bookings and in our backlog continues to increase towards those more complex studies in oncology as well as rare diseases. So the burn rate is largely influenced by that. You can see, by the way, that this is a trend in the industry. If you look at the burn rate for our competitors, and they are also going down. Now in the first quarter, the first-quarter backlog burn was 7%, is that what I recall was 7% and Q2 backlog burn was about the same, a little bit higher, 7.1%. And for the balance of the year, we're expecting it to be very similar. We are encouraged that the next 12 months' bookings are up. I think, we say, it's -- next 12 months' booking -- next 12 months' revenue from backlog is $7.8 billion. That's up from what we reported first quarter in my recollections is growing, was it $7.3 billion? Yeah. It's up $7.3 billion last -- and then this quarter $7.8 billion, that's about 6.9% up. So we feel confident in our back -- in our conversion and is consequently on our burn of projects and revenue growth in the balance of the year and next year. Yeah. Thank you. Thank you, Max. I'm just -- we are laughing here because when did 1.3 become the benchmark? I mean, I know we reported amazing over 1.3 book-to-bill ratios in the past couple of years, largely because of the COVID studies and so on. But we're very happy with 1.27, we're happy with 1.2. We are happy with these book-to-bills. They are very, very strong. And you're talking about a rebound in bookings. We had excellent bookings. I don't know what -- we are happy with this performance. There's no rebound. It's very good. I think the bookings we reported this quarter are the first -- third highest ever, right. So I'm not sure what the question is with respect to bookings. Did you ask about conversion as well or no, I'm sorry, I didn't... That's true. We hand the price. Yeah. I'm sorry. Yeah. So again, RFP flows, total pipeline and qualified pipeline in this area are up basically all around. The qualified pipeline, I think, it was up across the number of 12%, was up 12%. And total pipeline is up single digits. RFP grows as well, right, but mid-teens, right? Yeah. Thank you. Yeah. No. I mean, we see overall TAS in the second half in the 6% to 7% range at constant currency, okay? That's what we see after -- obviously, businesses are rolling up their forecasts and they are always higher than that, but we take some contingency, we evaluate the environment and we discount that and that's where we are now in the 6% to 7% range, in aggregate. And you could make the assumptions yourself, you could see that in order to get to that. If 30% of the business is essentially flattish, that's the data. So the 70% has to grow in the high-single-digits in aggregate in order to get us to those numbers. So that's where we see the forecast. And we feel, I should add, very confident based on the leading indicators that we look at. Which one? Double-digits? No, not yet. No. Not high-teens. No. Maybe could be low-teens, but high-single to low-teens for the real world. Exactly. Thank you. Well, thank you. First of all, it's not like the market is rebounding. I mentioned before that client cautiousness and budgetary discipline continues especially at large pharma. It's not -- didn't go away. But what we did say before was that within the portfolio of offerings that we have, there are certain things that are mission-critical for our clients. And what happened last time -- last year at this time is that we expected those things to happen and they were pushed to the right, okay? They were delayed. We said all along that at some point those things have to be done. And that is what is happening now, and what we see happening in the second half. So it's not like the market overall has grown is that the segments of the market that are -- must-do for our clients are finally happening, and they will be happening in the second half. So that's number one for the market. So from that sense, you could say that the market is a little better in the sense that the clients are willing to spend that money, but, again, I mentioned before, the negotiations are tougher. So to answer the second part of your question, what we are doing differently here is, obviously, being more responsive to our client needs. We are being more accommodating with their terms and we are commercially being more aggressive to make sure that we actually do win those projects that the markets are putting out there, the clients are putting out there for bid. Thank you. It's true. It's true broadly. Obviously, the mission-critical stuff is mission-critical and needs to be done. So yeah, that is improving the overall average, but even -- I would say, even for the rest, I think we've seen improved decision-making. Faster timelines. Thank you. Thank you. Well, look, I don't think the election has much influence on the day-to-day decision-making with respect to launching of drugs. And in order to response to the second part of your question, the answer is yes. Those approvals, obviously, it's not common for a client to decide that they're not going to launch a drug that's been approved. So -- and there is usually a six months to -- six months to nine months' time lag before that leads to -- between the approval and the time at which the drug is actually launched, and the work associated with it comes to us, so not much. This was delayed a little bit longer versus what it should have been and some of these projects that should have happened earlier this year are happening in the second half of the year. Again, no surprises here. Thank you. Yeah. You want to answer that anyone here? I mean, look, first of all, there is recovery in TAS. We just talked about it at length in the past few questions. So that's understandable. Secondly, the compare is more favorable. We had a deterioration in the fourth quarter last year. It was the lowest quarter of the year, last year. And we said all along that there would be a mirror image in '24 versus '23, that is the first quarter will resemble the fourth quarter, the second quarter will resemble the third quarter, etc. So we do see fourth quarter up. But -- and it's not unusual by the way, there is a seasonality in Q4 that you can go back many years. It's always the case that Q4 is much stronger. So these are the three reasons; one, recovery in TAS accelerating; two, compares; and three, seasonality, which is not surprising. Anything else, guys, you want to... Yeah. Yeah. Thank you so much. Yeah. So look, we said all along that it will be -- acquisition would contribute to a better point to our growth this year. And we wish we would do more acquisitions, but valuations continue to be high and we are -- we have a big pipeline, but it's not always the case that we are able to close. So far for the year, it's a little bit more than a point and it's a little bit more entire than in RDS, but that's it. And look, just -- we haven't spent much so far, but we hope to spend more in the second half and we'll see what happens. Yeah. Yeah. No. I mean, look, I mentioned in my commentary and we've said this every quarter in the past few quarters, and it's just not a secret. The world knows that large pharma -- largely in response to the IRA and hypothetical impacts down the line. Large pharma has been reprioritizing their programs. And they've taken off-the-shelf some programs that they felt were either too competitive with other existing drugs or that didn't have the same risk-return profiles that they had assumed pre-IRA when those programs were launched. So as a result of that, there have been a little bit more cancellations than usual really for the past few quarters. I think, in general, look, we don't tell you what the cancellations are. We report the net bookings. Our average quarterly cancellations are in the $0.5 billion range that has been the case for a long time and that's kind of $500 million plus or minus, whatever, $100 million to $200 million. So some quarters it's less. It could be $300 million or $400 million, some quarters, it could be more $600 million to $700 million or more. Most of these cancellations are $10 million, $15 million, $20 million, $25 million programs. That last quarter, because it was well-publicized and because it was a huge one-time number, we chose to let you know about it. We had had questions. Everyone knew that we were the ones doing that program and pre-call, we had had questions. So we decided to let you know about it. Yes, that's what it was. It was -- I don't remember the exact number in the quarter $4 billion in one shot. But that could happen. We have no -- companies are now usually when they terminate a program. It's partly this reprioritization that I just discussed and sometimes it's simply because of the data. And in the case of the program that we disclosed last quarter, it wasn't a reprioritization, it was simply that the data wasn't supporting a continuation of the program, and essentially the program failed as it often happens in this industry. Yeah. I don't think I can give you much more color than that. It's just what the chips fail, okay? So [Technical Difficulty] and I know that this would have attracted two questions. We would have to look at it again at this range, it's just -- we just build up our forecast and that's where the most appropriate range fell. It could be also -- we did a little bit more acquisitions this quarter and generally, acquisitions come in at very low margin in the first year. So that could have impacted. It's not a big different number, frankly. So in the grand scheme of things. So I can't give you much more color than that. I think they liked our solution better. I think it gave them more ability to achieve their goals. I can't go into the details of the program, and that's -- yeah, they just like it better. Thank you. Yeah. I -- you came -- the line came across not a little bit blurry, but if I understand you asked about capital deployment and acquisitions. Look, you saw that our cash flow performance was actually very strong in the quarter and that obviously helped continue to reduce our leverage. I think we have on a 12-month trailing basis, we ended the quarter at 3.25 times EBITDA, which is very good. I remind you, we were not too long ago in the high 4s, and we said that we were continuing to deliver naturally as EBITDA grows. Acquisitions, yeah, we would -- look, our long-term guidance always contemplates a couple of points of contribution from acquisitions to continue to boost our top line. So far, we've been able to do just over a point. Obviously, we have a rich pipeline and it's hard for me to predict what acquisition will be the second half or in the years to come. It's a binary outcome. So I don't know. I'm not sure if that was your question, but that's what I heard. Thank you. Well, look, first of all, when there is a timeline between funding and -- on RFP and then the timeline between an RFP and a booking. So if -- this is a business that has long cycles. So it's good that we have just as we were cautioning you not to panic when funding declines, and we said it's not going to affect us for a while. We don't get excited because funding this quarter was very strong. Yeah. It's good for our midterm and long-term prospects, but it's not like it's going to affect the mix. Also, we have a very large backlog, the largest in the industry. And it's not going to meaningfully change the mix of what we do in the next few quarters and what's large pharma, what's EBP, what's full-service versus what FSP. But you are correct that the more EBP, the more full-service, and that certainly helps mitigate the recent trend we've seen where, as we discussed in the past, large pharma has been swinging the pendulum a little bit more towards FSP as it has happened many times in the history of this industry. So you are correct, from that standpoint, that -- as more EBP funding is there, there'll be more EBP work in the quarters to come. And therefore, when that backlog converts into revenue, there'll be a higher mix of full-service versus FSP relative to what it is now. Thank you."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. Thank you. \n I would now like to turn the call over to Kerri Joseph, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasury. \n Mr. Joseph, please begin your conference. \nKerri Joseph: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our first quarter 2024 earnings call. With me today are Ari Bousbib, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Ron Bruehlman; Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Eric Sherbet, Executive Vice President and General Counsel; Mike Fedock, Senior Vice President, Financial Planning and Analysis; and Gustavo Perrone, Senior Director, Investor Relations. \n Today, we will be referencing a presentation that will be visible during this call for those of you on our webcast. This presentation will also be available following this call in the Events and Presentations section of our IQVIA Investor Relations website at ir.iqvia.com. \n Before we begin, I would like to caution listeners that certain information discussed by management during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those stated or implied by forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties associated with the company's business, which are discussed in the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings. \n In addition, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures on this call, which should be considered a supplement to and not a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the comparable GAAP measures is included in the press release and conference call presentation. \n I would now like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Ari Bousbib. \nAri Bousbib: Thank you, Kerri, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today to discuss our first quarter results. \n We had a strong start to the year. We delivered top and bottom line numbers on or slightly above our expectations. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange and COVID-related work, our revenue grew 6%. We continue to see a favorable demand environment for our industry. On the clinical side, demand from our R&DS clients remain solid. Our backlog reached a new record and grew almost 8% versus prior year. \n Net new bookings for the quarter were approximately $2.6 billion, representing a quarterly book-to-bill of 1.23. This included a substantial cancellation in the CNS area that is in the public domain, and I'm sure many of you are aware of. Excluding this large cancellation, which is well outside the typical cancellation size we see in a quarter, our first quarter book-to-bill ratio would have been over 1.3, actually closer to [ 1.35 ]. \n Our quarterly RFP flow was up 6% year-over-year, and that's in value, meaning in dollar terms, and it was driven by mid- to high single-digit growth in all customer segments, again, in dollar terms. Our qualified pipeline grew double digits versus prior year, again, in value in dollar terms. Emerging biotech funding was very strong according to BioWorld, which we use consistently as a source. First quarter EBP funding was $47.1 billion, which is more than triple the funding of Q1 last year. \n Shifting to TAS, our commercial side of our business, revenue in the quarter grew as expected. With the modest uptick in activity anticipated for later this year, we continue to forecast an improvement in the back half of the year. \n We continue to see some favorable signs. For example, our pipeline remains strong. In our conversations with clients, there is more clarity on budgets, and we are starting to see faster decision timing with some clients compared to the second half of 2023. [ Now this ] said, the toll overall with our clients remains cautious. And the fact is that the uncertain macro environment persists as everyone can tell from the Fed's remarks yesterday.\n Turning now to the results for this quarter. Revenue for the first quarter grew 2.3% on a reported basis and 2.9% at constant currency. Compared to last year, and excluding COVID-related work from both periods, we grew the top line approximately 6% on a constant currency basis, including just over a point of contribution from acquisitions. First quarter adjusted EBITDA came in at $862 million, and first quarter adjusted diluted EPS was $2.54. \n I'd like to share a few highlights of business activity. Let's start with the TAS segment. You will have seen that we are expanding our global strategic partnership with Salesforce. The partnership will integrate innovation from IQVIA OCE with Salesforce's Life Sciences Cloud to provide customers with a new single end-to-end engagement platform, which is expected to be available late 2025. \n This is very exciting news for the industry as we expect to transform the engagement with HCPs and with patients with the next-generation CRM platform that's built on OCE and that's powered by IQVIA data, domain expertise and advanced analytics. \n Separately, and as we discussed in the past, that continues to be an evolution on the way in how the industry manages HCP and patient engagement. For example, there is an ongoing shift in HCP engagement from in-person to digital interactions. On the patient side, there is increased emphasis on direct-to-patient solutions through patient support and market access programs, including financial support, hub services, medical education. \n As you know, we've been investing in building out these digital capabilities, and we are getting good market traction. For example, in the quarter, a top 3 pharma client awarded IQVIA a contract for our smart engagement solution to understand the health care provider online journey across therapeutic areas and factor that in earlier into the drug development process. \n A top 5 pharma bought IQVIA's Omnichannel Navigator solution to assess return on marketing investment, measure customer interactions and campaign performance and make data-driven decisions to optimize marketing strategies. \n A global midsized pharma awarded IQVIA a multiyear contract to implement our commercial compliance solutions. These solutions will allow our clients' interactions with health care professionals to be in compliance with transparency, regulatory obligations in over 30 countries. \n An EBP client bought IQVIA's patient relationship manager offering, which provides a comprehensive real-time view of the patient's journey and helps maximize the impact of their patient support program. \n In general, the TAS segment is seeing more demand for our sophisticated technology-enabled analytics solutions. For example, in the quarter, a top 10 pharma client awarded IQVIA a contract to streamline clinical operation data management processes. IQVIA's technology provides real-time data sharing, eliminating unnecessary file processing and improving the speed of data updates. \n Also in the quarter, a large med tech firm bought the IQVIA offering that enables better stakeholder targeting and go-to-market execution, ultimately enhancing the clients' ROI. \n Moving to real-world. A top 10 pharma company chose IQVIA to conduct a comparative study of the effectiveness of treatments against the standard of care in patients with a specific marker across 10 different cancers. The goal is to help the client gain market access and reimbursement for their treatment, which can be used for multiple types of cancer based on a single biomarker. \n IQVIA was awarded contract by a top 10 pharma to demonstrate the effectiveness of a novel eye movement technology, addressing a common symptom in patients with multiple sclerosis. \n A top 10 pharma client awarded IQVIA, a large real-world respiratory infection vaccine effectiveness study. We were selected based on our strong epidemiologic, scientific and therapeutic expertise as well as our global footprint to augment site identification and operational execution. \n And finally, to conclude my commentary on the TAS segment, I'd like to highlight the work we're doing in public health. It's been an increased area of focus for governments looking to extend life expectancy, reduce health inequalities and improve overall quality of and access to care. \n Some examples of IQVIA's work in this area, one of the largest UN health agencies contracted IQVIA to help with a major initiative to eradicate all types of polio viruses in Africa that focused on children. IQVIA is deploying personnel to improve outbreak response with vaccines and to strengthen polio surveillance and response in hard-to-reach areas. So far, IQVIA's team conducted visits to more than [ 12,000 ] sites and trained over 122,000 health workers across 26 African countries. \n Another example of our work in this area, IQVIA was selected to conduct a large EU-funded project to create a national oncology network and database for one of the European's Ministry of Health to improve the country's low cancer survival rates. A single [ IT ] platform will connect national hospitals and the reimbursement fund in that country. The platform will leverage curated oncology data and analytics to manage patient risk and improve treatments in a cost-efficient manner. \n Lastly, on public health, the Global Fund selected IQVIA to support 13 African countries to improve the visibility of their supply chain performance, ensure the availability of commodities and services, mitigate service disruptions and provide stronger assurance through more frequent on-site spot checks. \n The project focuses on pharmaceutical and diagnostics analytics from over 2,800 facilities for tracer health products in HIV, tuberculosis and malaria. This work is very important to us in public health. It's also extremely important to our global pharma clients, who are extremely active in this area as well. \n Moving to R&DS. Let's start by highlighting 2 more distinguished vaccine development awards. A top 10 pharma selected IQVIA to support the development of a novel respiratory vaccine, which could represent a significant breakthrough as the only vaccine targeting multiple respiratory viruses simultaneously. \n IQVIA laboratory secured a preferred strategic partnership with a top 10 pharma based on IQVIA's unique expertise, innovation and delivery model. As we discussed in the past, there is stronger demand for FSP services, and we continue to win our fair share in this segment as well. For example, in the quarter, we secured an extension of FSP data management services with a leading midsized pharma known for their innovative rare blood disease therapies. \n In the EBP segment, we secured 2 large awards, where we displaced incumbent CROs based on our global scale and AI-enabled capabilities. We were selected by a U.S. West Coast EBP client to conduct 2 large Phase III oncology studies simultaneously. This is a big deal as the client is new to IQVIA and selected us based on our differentiated AI-enabled capabilities as the trial protocol includes complex inclusion, exclusion criteria and usually large patient cohorts and aggressive enrollment timelines. \n We also won another large EBP full-service Phase III trial, displacing the incumbent, again, by leveraging our AI-enabled startup, site identification, activation and enrollment capabilities. \n With that, I will turn it over to Ron for more details on our financial performance. \nRonald Bruehlman: Thanks, Ari, and good morning, everyone. Let's start by reviewing revenue. First quarter revenue of $3.737 billion, grew 2.3% on a reported basis and 2.9% at constant currency. COVID-related revenues were approximately $45 million, down about $105 million versus first quarter of 2023. Excluding all COVID-related work from both this year and last, constant currency growth was approximately 6%. As already mentioned, acquisitions contributed just over 100 basis points to this growth. \n Technology & Analytics Solutions revenue for the first quarter was $1.453 billion, up 0.6% reported and 1% at constant currency. Excluding all COVID-related work, constant currency growth in TAS was 3%. R&D Solutions first quarter revenue was $2.095 billion that was up 3.4% reported and 3.8% in constant currency. And excluding all COVID-related work, constant currency growth in R&DS was 8%. \n Finally, Contract Sales and Medical Solutions, or CSMS, first quarter revenue of $189 million was up 3.8% reported and 7.1% at constant currency. \n Let's move down the P&L. Adjusted EBITDA was $862 million. That's growth of 1.3%. Our first quarter GAAP net income was $288 million, down 0.3% year-over-year; and GAAP diluted earnings per share were $1.56, up 2% year-over-year. Adjusted net income was $468 million for the quarter, up 1.3% year-over-year, and adjusted diluted EPS grew 3.7% to [ $2.54 ]. \n Now it's already reviewed, R&D Solutions delivered another strong quarter of bookings. Our backlog at March 31 stood at a record $30.1 billion, which was 7.9% up year-over-year. And next 12 months revenue from backlog increased to $7.7 [ billion ], growing 6.1% year-over-year. \n Let's turn to the balance sheet. As of March 31, cash and cash equivalents totaled $1.444 billion. Gross debt was $13.536 billion, and the result of those two is net debt of $12.092 million. Our net leverage ratio ended the quarter at 3.38x trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA. First quarter cash flow from operations was $522 million, and capital expenditures were $145 million, resulting in free cash flow of $377 million. \n Turning now to guidance. We are reaffirming our full-year revenue guidance on a constant currency basis. We are adjusting revenue at actual currency downward by $75 million to reflect the strengthening of the U.S. dollar since we last guided. We now expect revenue to be between $15.325 billion and $15.575 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 2.3% to 3.9% on a reported basis. \n Now this guidance now includes a year-over-year FX headwind of approximately 100 basis points. And I'll remind you that when we last guided, we were looking for about 50 basis points of FX headwind. \n We continue to assume approximately $300 million of step-down in COVID-related work and about 100 basis points of contribution to revenue from M&A activity. We're reaffirming our adjusted EBITDA guidance of $3.7 billion to $3.8 billion, which represents year-over-year growth of 3.7% to 6.5%. The impact of FX changes to revenue had a negligible impact on EBITDA. \n We're also reaffirming our adjusted diluted EPS guidance, which continues to be $10.95 to $11.25, up 7.4% to 10.3% versus the prior year.\n Okay. Let me conclude by providing second quarter guidance. For the second quarter, we expect revenue to be between $3.740 billion and [ $3.815 billion ]. This includes a year-over-year FX headwind of approximately 150 basis points, and we anticipate the second quarter will be the toughest quarterly FX compare of the year. As a reminder, the step-down in COVID-related work is weighted towards the first half of the year. \n Also, we continue to expect gradual improvement in TAS revenue growth in the back half of the year. For the second quarter, adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between [ $870 million ] and [ $890 million ], and adjusted diluted EPS is expected to be between $2.54 and $2.64. And all of the guidance I provided assumes that foreign currency rates, as of April 30, continue for the balance of the year.\n So to summarize, Q1 was a strong start to the year. TAS revenue came in as expected, and we continue to look for improvement in the back end of the year. R&DS delivered $2.6 billion of net bookings, bringing backlog to over $30 billion for the first time in our history. \n We continue to see favorable forward-looking indicators in the clinical trial business, such as strong RFP flow, strong qualified pipeline growth and strong biotech funding. And finally, we're reaffirming our earnings guidance for the year, including adjusted diluted EPS growth of 7.4% to 10.3%.\n With that, let me hand it back to the operator for Q&A. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Elizabeth Anderson at Evercore ISI.\n Ms. Anderson, your line is open. You may have yourself muted. \nAri Bousbib: Let's move on to the next one in the queue, operator. \nOperator: We'll go to Shlomo Rosenbaum at Stifel. \nShlomo Rosenbaum: I wanted to ask a little bit about the large cancellation that you called out. You absorbed it into the numbers. Could you give us a little bit more specificity in terms of highlighting what kind of impact would be to revenue or/and also to bookings? Because you're [ rolling ] the revenue due to FX, but you're also absorbing an incremental cancellation that's unusual. And maybe that could help us a little bit with the context over there and then also on the booking side. \nAri Bousbib: Yes. Thank you, Shlomo. Well, look, we don't normally speak to cancellations. As you know, we just provide net new bookings. I might point out, by the way, that we [ haven't ] speak to it, but our gross bookings were the highest -- the second highest in our history before cancellations. \n Now, the reason we highlighted this cancellation is because, look, a typical cancellation is normally in the $15 million, $20 million kind of range. And this one is very, very large. It's almost -- it's about $0.25 billion, okay? So we have done that in the past whenever we've had an unusual cancellation. This one has been in the news. I think everyone knows what we are talking about. And we wanted to reassure everyone that the underlying business continues to be very strong. \n With respect to absorbing it, yes. I mean, look, we are a large company. We are, at any given point in time, working on around 2,500 clinical trials. These are staggered and staged through the year, and revenue flows over several years for each one of those trials. So we are large enough, global enough that we can absorb even such a large cancellation. No change to the guidance. And as Ron pointed out and you reminded us in your question, the adjustment is entirely due to FX. \nRonald Bruehlman: Shlomo, just one thing, I would jump in there. I think you're asking about revenue, too. And obviously, because with an ongoing trial, it does have some impact to our revenue in the current year. But we're absorbing that in our normal numbers. And this is a series of trials, actually a program that would play out over many years. So there isn't an outsized impact in this year. \nOperator: We'll take our next question from Max Smock at William Blair. \nMax Smock: Maybe just following up on [ RFP  flows ] that you saw in the quarter. You mentioned up mid- to high single digits across all customer groups. I think last quarter, you had called out up double digits across all customer groups. \n So I just wanted to get a sense for whether what you saw in terms of RFP flows going into this quarter was in line with your expectations? And then, any thoughts on how we should think about book-to-bill, moving forward? \nAri Bousbib: Again, I wouldn't read a lot in the variation quarter-to-quarter. Just as an example, the RFP flow last year was flat versus the [ '22 ] number. So we think this is very good. It's consistent with our expectations. The large segment, the large pharma was up more in the high single digits in terms of RFP flow. EBP was a little bit higher than that at kind of mid-single growth, depends on the therapies. We had a lot of bookings, infectious diseases and internal medicine, which drove a lot of the growth there. \n The [ awards ] grew well into the teens. So we often look at awards. We report contracted bookings. As you know, some of our peers report awards, which is at an earlier stage in the in the process. And maybe just to reassure you that we haven't come down from what we said at the last quarter as a leading indicator, if you will, awards were up in the double digits and that was driven by large full-service trials, strong EBP as well. \n We look at the qualified pipeline, and the qualified pipeline is up double digits, actually very strong double digits. And it's up again at a record high. So nothing here that has changed versus our expectations. \nOperator: We'll go next to Anne Samuel at JPMorgan. \nAnne McCormick: In the TAS business, you talked about strength in the pipeline and some positive signs and maybe some more positive conversations there. As you're moving through the year, are you seeing your pipeline convert kind of at the same rate that you had initially expected? And with the macro maybe slightly more stable, can you just maybe speak to any potential areas of upside as things are starting to loosen up there? \nAri Bousbib: Yes. Well, I mean, I wouldn't talk about upside here so far. And then the macro is not really stabilizing, unless you call stabilizing [ the fact ] that we now know there won't be a rate cut anytime soon. \n So look, the TAS business is exactly performing exactly as we expected it, same type of performance that we telegraphed in our prior guidance, same growth rate that we anticipated when you exclude COVID and the currency impact. And we continue to see -- again, based on our pipeline, based on budgets [ firming ] up, based on the conversation with clients; continue to expect upside towards the back of the year, second half of the year and more in the back of the year. \n Large pharma companies, as you know, have introduced significant cost reduction programs. And that has driven a lot more cautiousness and scrutiny in the budgets than in prior years. And we've discussed, this is driven by the overall macro environment, maybe some concerns related to IRA long term and preservation of margins. \n As you know, our client base generally is doing fairly well and is reporting very good numbers. So we think that also is an encouraging sign. And usually, our clients have more propensity to spend when they -- when they are out, we are out. And we see that they are doing well. So all of those signs are encouraging. \n I could give you a little bit of color on the business in TAS, just for a perspective. The data business continues to perform exactly as expected. No surprises, they are flattish to up the low single digits. \n The real-world business, which we signaled in the prior quarter earnings call, was slowing down, has actually gone from being a very strong double-digit growth performer to mid-single digits to then negative growth in the fourth quarter, has rebounded somewhat and is now flattish. So we see that we think that we bottom out there. \n And the tech business continues to perform as expected, good and strong. And the analytics and consulting business, which is our shortest cycle business, ebbs and flows in the quarter. It had started to do a little better last quarter. This quarter, it went backwards, and that's why we didn't perform even better than our expectations in TAS. \n So all in all, real-world doing better than we thought. And analytics and consulting doing a little less than we thought, but that's kind of to be expected. It has more variability by definition. And we still have a strong pipeline there. So we think that, that will continue to improve quarter-over-quarter. And that's what gives us confidence that the back end of the year on TAS, we will be good. Again, upside, I don't know. I can't promise that. \nOperator: We'll move to our next question from David Windley at Jefferies. \nDavid Windley: I wanted to transition you to R&DS. You highlighted in your prepared remarks about some of the business wins, you highlighted some FSP deals. I also heard you say though that your RFP flow was strong on the full-service side. \n So given that you've talked in the past about how that FSP does present some margin headwinds, I thought maybe you could update us on the state of play between those 2 models and maybe we've reached some kind of equilibrium there. So just your thoughts on FSP versus [ FSO ]. \nAri Bousbib: Yes. I mean, look as a percentage of our total R&DS revenue, [ FSP ] comprised about 15%. So now, if you -- that's in totality. If you look only at the services portion of the business, meaning excluding pass-throughs, which, as you know in FSP, there typically is no pass-throughs; so that percentage is a little higher and continues, it's a little less somewhere between 20% and 25%, I would say. And it continues to grow a point or 2 every year. \n So of course, it has an impact on margins because FSP margins -- FSP [ contracts ] come at lower margins. But again, we are a large global company, and that just puts more pressure on us to continue to operate with more efficiency, find new areas of productivity, contain costs and offset those margins, those mix -- those unfavorable mix impacts on margins with cost reductions, and we continue to work well on our usual playbook, which is to grow our EBITDA faster than our revenue and consequently increase margins. \nOperator: We'll go next to Jailendra Singh at Truist Securities. \nJailendra Singh: I wanted to follow up on the Salesforce partnership comments. Just curious, if you can share any initial reaction from your OCE customers post that announcement? Or is it still early? \n Also just curious, like what were the conversations leading up to the partnership? Trying to understand what drove the decision to partner with Salesforce, given what IQVIA has seen, what [ HCPs ] prefer for engagement in terms of digital marketing, et cetera. \nAri Bousbib: Thank you. Well, look, as you know, we've carved out a nice position in the global CRM market for Life Sciences, we came from behind much later in the game. I guess we entered the market more than 10 years after the large dominant incumbent in this market. And today, we have a footprint of over 400 clients and about 100,000 seats in the business, which is quite impressive in a few short years. \n Now what happened here is that a dominant competitor has announced a re-platforming of their product from Salesforce to their own in-house platform. Now OCE is based on a Salesforce platform. It's the result of a strategic partnership that has been in the market for over 5 years. And we and Salesforce want to ensure that we continue to have the best product in the market. And we've agreed that it is time to develop the next-generation product. \n We also agreed that it should be based on Salesforce's new Life Science Cloud, which is much more advanced. And as it will be based on the current OCE application to be re-platformed. Now it takes time to do that. It makes sense for Salesforce to take the lead in developing this next-generation application, and it will be based on IQVIA [ IP ]. \n Our existing customers understand all of that. They will continue to be supported for at least the next 5 years, and they are very happy. I can even say yesterday, we won a very significant award on OCE with a large, well-known client, pharma client, and we actually displaced the large dominant player in the space, which have been the incumbent for a long time. \n So our clients are reacting very favorably. They understand the need for the next-generation transition, and we are going to shepherd that process together with Salesforce. When the product is ready the next 2 years or so, we will go to market jointly with Salesforce with this new product platform, and we will help transition customers who wish to do so when they are ready to do so. Strong and positive reaction from the customer base. \nOperator: We'll go next to Ann Hynes at Mizuho Securities. \nAnn Hynes: Ari, wondering what surprised you on the upside most in the quarter and maybe on the downside? And just following up on the last FSP question, thank you for that clarity, you gave us about its 20% to 25% ex pass-throughs. What do you think the max would be over time? \nAri Bousbib: What was the first part? \nAnn Hynes: What surprised to you on the... \nAri Bousbib: I hate to be boring. I had zero surprises this quarter. I mean, for lack of better words, I think this was a boring quarter. It was exact -- it came in exactly as we thought. Look, the nature of business is pretty predictable. The large cancellation was kind of -- it's based on -- really on the results and on the assessment of the environment by the clients. It's always been very well reported. \n And so it usually takes time to unwind the study. And so we knew it was coming. So those -- we know the exact timing when all of this would be finalized, but [ it was ] in the quarter. \n But other than that, frankly, no surprises [ up at the helm ]. Everything came in pretty much on expectations. There always are moving parts, but this was one of the most boring quarters I've seen, nothing -- no drop. That's the way we like it, by the way. \n In terms of your FSP question, it ebbs and flows. I remember my first contacts with this business now almost 8 years ago, I was told FSP is going to be replacing full service, clients are shifting to FSP. And indeed, there was, very similar to today, an effort by some of the large pharma companies, many of them, to bring project management in-house and to essentially shift to these types of models. So I think it's a pendulum. It swings back and forth. \n In a highly specialized studies, it's very hard for a client not to do full service because they don't always have all the competencies in-house. Again, I think we're seeing similar trends as we saw 8 years ago. What we're seeing also might be -- to add a little bit more to this, we're seeing a trend towards what we call hybrid models, where the client starts out with one thing, an FSP program. And as we progress in defining the parameters of the study, we end up taking on more of the tasks. \n And it's kind of in between full service. And it's not fully outsourced. But in that, they [ aren't ]100% FSP either. They're parts of the program that we continue to manage. So it's really more integration with the client, and it becomes more of a closer partnership. \n So I don't see this as a long-term permanent trend to the point where, theoretically, it will become 100% FSP. I don't see that happening. Plus remember, FSP is virtually nonexistent for EBP or midsized pharma. \nOperator: We'll take our next question from Michael Ryskin at Bank of America. \nJohn Kim: This is John Kim on for Mike. I appreciate the FSP comment there. I'll just ask a quick one. On that swing pendulum comment, do you expect that percentage to go down at some point? And in terms of the RFP flows, that sounds great, solid, solid flows. But is there anything that may hinder or delay that turning into sales in the second half? \nAri Bousbib: Okay, thank you. Well, on the FSP comment, I don't know when these things will -- this is a long-cycle business. I remind you that it takes an average 4, 5 years to execute a contract. So we have a very large book of business. I think in our backlog, what is the proportion of that FSP backlog? Is it also about 15%? \nRonald Bruehlman: Yes. \nAri Bousbib: Yes, so our backlog is over $30 billion, and about like somewhere worth $4 billion -- $4.5 billion of that is FSP. So you see the vast majority of the revenue we're going to deliver over the next 4 or 5 years is going to continue to be full-service programs, and it's not about to influence one way or the other. \n It's a slow-moving business. It takes a lot to move the needle one way or the other. We've been continuously on an upward momentum, and that's the way we like it. So no, I don't see that happening. And then certainly the same similar type of commentary on your question about affecting the second half, it is just too short horizon to have an impact. These swings will have an impact [ 4 ] years from now. \nOperator: We'll go next to Charles Rhyee at TD Cowen. \nCharles Rhyee: Ari, you mentioned earlier about winning an [ EBP ] client that's going to do 2 simultaneous studies in oncology. And I'm curious whether decision to do 2 trials at once could be a function of terms in the IRA that kind of benefit companies to do -- the [ local ] trials that want sort of to maximize revenue before potential negotiating on pricing with Medicare. I'm curious if that could be part of the reason. And in general, I guess, as you think about the structure of IRA, do you foresee more companies engaging in multiple trials at the start? And how do you think that could be benefiting for IQVIA in the future? \nAri Bousbib: Yes. Well, I mean that's a clever thought here why it was 2 [ material ] studies, but it happens to be not the case over here. But -- I see what you're thinking about, but that's not the case here. These are 2 different -- it's addressing 2 different diseases with different -- I think it's different molecules. Again, we can give you in post call some more color on this, but I don't think it's because of the IRA. \n Look, what is true is that clients are, with respect to the IRA, trying to accelerate timelines because one of the possible impacts of the IRA is that it will reduce the period of time during which protection will apply -- intellectual property protection will apply. \n And as a result, you want to maximize the revenues then, that, if anything -- and again, that's probably the context for your question, if anything, that kind of induce clients to launch several programs simultaneously. So in this particular case, we're replacing an incumbent, and I think one of them is a rescue study, if I am correct. So that's the context there. \nOperator: We'll go next to Tejas Savant at Morgan Stanley. \nTejas Savant: Ari, I have a few questions here on R&D Solutions. First, just broadly on the pricing environment, are you starting to see more pricing discipline from your peers versus what you saw in the back half of '23? \n Second, on the cancellation in [ CNS ], given the faster burn nature of that work, is there any implication from that for the phasing of R&D revenue through the remainder of '24? \n And then last on AI enablement. You highlighted that as a driver of some of your EBP wins in the quarter, which I thought was quite interesting. Could you just share some color on why it's translating into share gain for you? And what is it you can do with AI that your peers aren't offering yet? \nAri Bousbib: Okay. The three questions are totally independent. So first on pricing. Look, there's no change in pricing here. There continues to be pressure from clients, and price negotiations are always tough. We mentioned before that we're having maybe more pressure than we had before on pricing from large pharma clients as they're working on their savings initiatives, but it's not that different than history, maybe a little more than usual. \n But I think nothing -- with respect to competitors, I can't speak to what they do, I just have no idea, I don't want to know. But look, comes to reason that smaller competitors which have failed largely and have led to them being acquired, are struggling to book business and as a result, could put pressure on pricing. But nothing there that I can signal that's unusual versus what we spoke about in the past. \n Your second question was on cancellation. We spoke before, we address that. No, look, it's a very large cancellation. And yes, it has an impact on revenues over the next few years, including in this year. But we said earlier that we are a large company, and we are absorbing it in our guidance. It's fine. \n So yes, if you will, it would have been better if we hadn't -- if the program hasn't canceled. But it's okay, we're not changing the guidance for that. Our only guidance adjustment, again, is 100% related to foreign currency. \n With respect to your third question on AI, look, AI has -- not saying anything shocking here, AI has a massive amount of opportunity, in general, and I would say, perhaps more limited than people think in health care because data, the ingredients, if you will, are not readily available publicly. \n You can search for medical literature for diagnostics, you could look for jurisprudence for legal opinions. But frankly, to identify patients that are best suited for trials, sites that need to be identified for maximum effectiveness and fastest enrollment, that's really, really tough to get information. And if you ask those questions to a chatbot, you are not going to get the answers. \n However, once you are within our environment, then that's a lot more possible. And so if you think about it, the entire premise of what we set out to do when we merged Quintiles and IMS 8 years ago, was precisely to leverage massive amounts of data and analytics and technology to accelerate clinical development timelines, particularly applicable to oncology, rare disease and difficult-to-enroll patients. \n With the [ advance ] of AI, that set of initiatives becomes even easier. And we've been at it for a while, this is not new to us. But some of the new tools, as you can imagine, are put to good use within our environment, and some of the wins we've had are the direct results of those capabilities. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Luke Sergott at Barclays. \nLuke Sergott: I just kind of want to get a better sense of how to think about the TAS recovery and more on discretionary in the commercial side, so -- and how it relates to drug approvals and things like that. So we only had 10 approvals in this quarter versus 15 last quarter, but we're already starting to see a strong start to April. \n I'm just trying to get a sense of when pharma starts engaging you guys for work and when you start seeing those bookings and then ultimately when it starts flowing through, I know it's different for particular regions, but as the approvals start coming in and accelerating, how to think about the growth in the discretionary pieces that have been slower? \nAri Bousbib: Look, I wish I had a crystal ball here, and I've been wrong before on predicting a comeback, if you will, of the TAS business. So I'll be cautious in my commentary. \n You're right to point to the approvals. I mean, the number of approvals, as you know, in last year, I think there were 55 approvals last year. And that's -- that was I think a record year. It was certainly a very high level, almost 50% more than the prior year and the highest level since, I think, must be '17 or '18. \n Now the new launches and the spend associated with these new launches usually is up significantly for the 5 years that follow these approvals. So we do expect the TAS business to be strong. The wild card is when those launches occur, what clients decide to do. The -- about 50% of the new [ launch ] spend usually occurs within the first 2 years. So again, it happens over the following 5 years and usually the first 2 years. \n I mean, yes, quarter-to-quarter, it was only 10 this quarter. But we think in general, just with the approvals of last year, we should see a rebound coming in. And that's one of the reasons we are somewhat confident that the TAS business will be rebounding more strongly, and the real uptick will come next year. But we see -- given that it has bottomed out here, and we think it has reached the bottom, and we anticipate an improvement in the balance of the year. \n The pipeline is higher than it has ever been, frankly. And we scrub this pipeline continuously, we continue to see improvement in customer sentiment. In Q1, the tone is better, there are more opportunities that have surfaced. This increased optimism for the outlook in '24. \n What happened in the second half of last year in conversations with clients is the budgets became -- we are aware of what clients can spend because they [indiscernible] budget, but the budget got trimmed sometime towards the end of the year, and there was quite a bit of [ uncertainty ] as people were negotiating internally. \n We feel there is more clarity now on budgets, and that helps a lot with confidence for awards in the balance of the year. Also decisions, we measure decision timeline, and that -- those timelines have started to come down and get reduced, which is a favorable sign. \nLuke Sergott: All right. So I guess there's like basically between -- obviously, there's going to be a big difference there in timing, but like safe to assume between like 6 and 12 months lag post an approval of when you actually start working on the launch with the drug company and the commercialization efforts? \nAri Bousbib: That's correct. \nOperator: Yes. That does conclude our Q&A at this time. Mr. Joseph, I'll turn the call back over to you. \nKerri Joseph: Thank you for taking the time to join us today, and we look forward to speaking with you again in our second quarter 2024 earnings call. The team will be available the rest of the day to take any follow-up questions that you'll have. Thank you. \nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Again, thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Ronald Bruehlman",
            "content": "Thanks, Ari, and good morning, everyone. Let's start by reviewing revenue. First quarter revenue of $3.737 billion, grew 2.3% on a reported basis and 2.9% at constant currency. COVID-related revenues were approximately $45 million, down about $105 million versus first quarter of 2023. Excluding all COVID-related work from both this year and last, constant currency growth was approximately 6%. As already mentioned, acquisitions contributed just over 100 basis points to this growth. \n Technology & Analytics Solutions revenue for the first quarter was $1.453 billion, up 0.6% reported and 1% at constant currency. Excluding all COVID-related work, constant currency growth in TAS was 3%. R&D Solutions first quarter revenue was $2.095 billion that was up 3.4% reported and 3.8% in constant currency. And excluding all COVID-related work, constant currency growth in R&DS was 8%. \n Finally, Contract Sales and Medical Solutions, or CSMS, first quarter revenue of $189 million was up 3.8% reported and 7.1% at constant currency. \n Let's move down the P&L. Adjusted EBITDA was $862 million. That's growth of 1.3%. Our first quarter GAAP net income was $288 million, down 0.3% year-over-year; and GAAP diluted earnings per share were $1.56, up 2% year-over-year. Adjusted net income was $468 million for the quarter, up 1.3% year-over-year, and adjusted diluted EPS grew 3.7% to [ $2.54 ]. \n Now it's already reviewed, R&D Solutions delivered another strong quarter of bookings. Our backlog at March 31 stood at a record $30.1 billion, which was 7.9% up year-over-year. And next 12 months revenue from backlog increased to $7.7 [ billion ], growing 6.1% year-over-year. \n Let's turn to the balance sheet. As of March 31, cash and cash equivalents totaled $1.444 billion. Gross debt was $13.536 billion, and the result of those two is net debt of $12.092 million. Our net leverage ratio ended the quarter at 3.38x trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA. First quarter cash flow from operations was $522 million, and capital expenditures were $145 million, resulting in free cash flow of $377 million. \n Turning now to guidance. We are reaffirming our full-year revenue guidance on a constant currency basis. We are adjusting revenue at actual currency downward by $75 million to reflect the strengthening of the U.S. dollar since we last guided. We now expect revenue to be between $15.325 billion and $15.575 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 2.3% to 3.9% on a reported basis. \n Now this guidance now includes a year-over-year FX headwind of approximately 100 basis points. And I'll remind you that when we last guided, we were looking for about 50 basis points of FX headwind. \n We continue to assume approximately $300 million of step-down in COVID-related work and about 100 basis points of contribution to revenue from M&A activity. We're reaffirming our adjusted EBITDA guidance of $3.7 billion to $3.8 billion, which represents year-over-year growth of 3.7% to 6.5%. The impact of FX changes to revenue had a negligible impact on EBITDA. \n We're also reaffirming our adjusted diluted EPS guidance, which continues to be $10.95 to $11.25, up 7.4% to 10.3% versus the prior year.\n Okay. Let me conclude by providing second quarter guidance. For the second quarter, we expect revenue to be between $3.740 billion and [ $3.815 billion ]. This includes a year-over-year FX headwind of approximately 150 basis points, and we anticipate the second quarter will be the toughest quarterly FX compare of the year. As a reminder, the step-down in COVID-related work is weighted towards the first half of the year. \n Also, we continue to expect gradual improvement in TAS revenue growth in the back half of the year. For the second quarter, adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between [ $870 million ] and [ $890 million ], and adjusted diluted EPS is expected to be between $2.54 and $2.64. And all of the guidance I provided assumes that foreign currency rates, as of April 30, continue for the balance of the year.\n So to summarize, Q1 was a strong start to the year. TAS revenue came in as expected, and we continue to look for improvement in the back end of the year. R&DS delivered $2.6 billion of net bookings, bringing backlog to over $30 billion for the first time in our history. \n We continue to see favorable forward-looking indicators in the clinical trial business, such as strong RFP flow, strong qualified pipeline growth and strong biotech funding. And finally, we're reaffirming our earnings guidance for the year, including adjusted diluted EPS growth of 7.4% to 10.3%.\n With that, let me hand it back to the operator for Q&A. Shlomo, just one thing, I would jump in there. I think you're asking about revenue, too. And obviously, because with an ongoing trial, it does have some impact to our revenue in the current year. But we're absorbing that in our normal numbers. And this is a series of trials, actually a program that would play out over many years. So there isn't an outsized impact in this year. Yes."

            "name": "Ari Bousbib",
            "content": "Thank you, Kerri, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today to discuss our first quarter results. \n We had a strong start to the year. We delivered top and bottom line numbers on or slightly above our expectations. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange and COVID-related work, our revenue grew 6%. We continue to see a favorable demand environment for our industry. On the clinical side, demand from our R&DS clients remain solid. Our backlog reached a new record and grew almost 8% versus prior year. \n Net new bookings for the quarter were approximately $2.6 billion, representing a quarterly book-to-bill of 1.23. This included a substantial cancellation in the CNS area that is in the public domain, and I'm sure many of you are aware of. Excluding this large cancellation, which is well outside the typical cancellation size we see in a quarter, our first quarter book-to-bill ratio would have been over 1.3, actually closer to [ 1.35 ]. \n Our quarterly RFP flow was up 6% year-over-year, and that's in value, meaning in dollar terms, and it was driven by mid- to high single-digit growth in all customer segments, again, in dollar terms. Our qualified pipeline grew double digits versus prior year, again, in value in dollar terms. Emerging biotech funding was very strong according to BioWorld, which we use consistently as a source. First quarter EBP funding was $47.1 billion, which is more than triple the funding of Q1 last year. \n Shifting to TAS, our commercial side of our business, revenue in the quarter grew as expected. With the modest uptick in activity anticipated for later this year, we continue to forecast an improvement in the back half of the year. \n We continue to see some favorable signs. For example, our pipeline remains strong. In our conversations with clients, there is more clarity on budgets, and we are starting to see faster decision timing with some clients compared to the second half of 2023. [ Now this ] said, the toll overall with our clients remains cautious. And the fact is that the uncertain macro environment persists as everyone can tell from the Fed's remarks yesterday.\n Turning now to the results for this quarter. Revenue for the first quarter grew 2.3% on a reported basis and 2.9% at constant currency. Compared to last year, and excluding COVID-related work from both periods, we grew the top line approximately 6% on a constant currency basis, including just over a point of contribution from acquisitions. First quarter adjusted EBITDA came in at $862 million, and first quarter adjusted diluted EPS was $2.54. \n I'd like to share a few highlights of business activity. Let's start with the TAS segment. You will have seen that we are expanding our global strategic partnership with Salesforce. The partnership will integrate innovation from IQVIA OCE with Salesforce's Life Sciences Cloud to provide customers with a new single end-to-end engagement platform, which is expected to be available late 2025. \n This is very exciting news for the industry as we expect to transform the engagement with HCPs and with patients with the next-generation CRM platform that's built on OCE and that's powered by IQVIA data, domain expertise and advanced analytics. \n Separately, and as we discussed in the past, that continues to be an evolution on the way in how the industry manages HCP and patient engagement. For example, there is an ongoing shift in HCP engagement from in-person to digital interactions. On the patient side, there is increased emphasis on direct-to-patient solutions through patient support and market access programs, including financial support, hub services, medical education. \n As you know, we've been investing in building out these digital capabilities, and we are getting good market traction. For example, in the quarter, a top 3 pharma client awarded IQVIA a contract for our smart engagement solution to understand the health care provider online journey across therapeutic areas and factor that in earlier into the drug development process. \n A top 5 pharma bought IQVIA's Omnichannel Navigator solution to assess return on marketing investment, measure customer interactions and campaign performance and make data-driven decisions to optimize marketing strategies. \n A global midsized pharma awarded IQVIA a multiyear contract to implement our commercial compliance solutions. These solutions will allow our clients' interactions with health care professionals to be in compliance with transparency, regulatory obligations in over 30 countries. \n An EBP client bought IQVIA's patient relationship manager offering, which provides a comprehensive real-time view of the patient's journey and helps maximize the impact of their patient support program. \n In general, the TAS segment is seeing more demand for our sophisticated technology-enabled analytics solutions. For example, in the quarter, a top 10 pharma client awarded IQVIA a contract to streamline clinical operation data management processes. IQVIA's technology provides real-time data sharing, eliminating unnecessary file processing and improving the speed of data updates. \n Also in the quarter, a large med tech firm bought the IQVIA offering that enables better stakeholder targeting and go-to-market execution, ultimately enhancing the clients' ROI. \n Moving to real-world. A top 10 pharma company chose IQVIA to conduct a comparative study of the effectiveness of treatments against the standard of care in patients with a specific marker across 10 different cancers. The goal is to help the client gain market access and reimbursement for their treatment, which can be used for multiple types of cancer based on a single biomarker. \n IQVIA was awarded contract by a top 10 pharma to demonstrate the effectiveness of a novel eye movement technology, addressing a common symptom in patients with multiple sclerosis. \n A top 10 pharma client awarded IQVIA, a large real-world respiratory infection vaccine effectiveness study. We were selected based on our strong epidemiologic, scientific and therapeutic expertise as well as our global footprint to augment site identification and operational execution. \n And finally, to conclude my commentary on the TAS segment, I'd like to highlight the work we're doing in public health. It's been an increased area of focus for governments looking to extend life expectancy, reduce health inequalities and improve overall quality of and access to care. \n Some examples of IQVIA's work in this area, one of the largest UN health agencies contracted IQVIA to help with a major initiative to eradicate all types of polio viruses in Africa that focused on children. IQVIA is deploying personnel to improve outbreak response with vaccines and to strengthen polio surveillance and response in hard-to-reach areas. So far, IQVIA's team conducted visits to more than [ 12,000 ] sites and trained over 122,000 health workers across 26 African countries. \n Another example of our work in this area, IQVIA was selected to conduct a large EU-funded project to create a national oncology network and database for one of the European's Ministry of Health to improve the country's low cancer survival rates. A single [ IT ] platform will connect national hospitals and the reimbursement fund in that country. The platform will leverage curated oncology data and analytics to manage patient risk and improve treatments in a cost-efficient manner. \n Lastly, on public health, the Global Fund selected IQVIA to support 13 African countries to improve the visibility of their supply chain performance, ensure the availability of commodities and services, mitigate service disruptions and provide stronger assurance through more frequent on-site spot checks. \n The project focuses on pharmaceutical and diagnostics analytics from over 2,800 facilities for tracer health products in HIV, tuberculosis and malaria. This work is very important to us in public health. It's also extremely important to our global pharma clients, who are extremely active in this area as well. \n Moving to R&DS. Let's start by highlighting 2 more distinguished vaccine development awards. A top 10 pharma selected IQVIA to support the development of a novel respiratory vaccine, which could represent a significant breakthrough as the only vaccine targeting multiple respiratory viruses simultaneously. \n IQVIA laboratory secured a preferred strategic partnership with a top 10 pharma based on IQVIA's unique expertise, innovation and delivery model. As we discussed in the past, there is stronger demand for FSP services, and we continue to win our fair share in this segment as well. For example, in the quarter, we secured an extension of FSP data management services with a leading midsized pharma known for their innovative rare blood disease therapies. \n In the EBP segment, we secured 2 large awards, where we displaced incumbent CROs based on our global scale and AI-enabled capabilities. We were selected by a U.S. West Coast EBP client to conduct 2 large Phase III oncology studies simultaneously. This is a big deal as the client is new to IQVIA and selected us based on our differentiated AI-enabled capabilities as the trial protocol includes complex inclusion, exclusion criteria and usually large patient cohorts and aggressive enrollment timelines. \n We also won another large EBP full-service Phase III trial, displacing the incumbent, again, by leveraging our AI-enabled startup, site identification, activation and enrollment capabilities. \n With that, I will turn it over to Ron for more details on our financial performance. Let's move on to the next one in the queue, operator. Yes. Thank you, Shlomo. Well, look, we don't normally speak to cancellations. As you know, we just provide net new bookings. I might point out, by the way, that we [ haven't ] speak to it, but our gross bookings were the highest -- the second highest in our history before cancellations. \n Now, the reason we highlighted this cancellation is because, look, a typical cancellation is normally in the $15 million, $20 million kind of range. And this one is very, very large. It's almost -- it's about $0.25 billion, okay? So we have done that in the past whenever we've had an unusual cancellation. This one has been in the news. I think everyone knows what we are talking about. And we wanted to reassure everyone that the underlying business continues to be very strong. \n With respect to absorbing it, yes. I mean, look, we are a large company. We are, at any given point in time, working on around 2,500 clinical trials. These are staggered and staged through the year, and revenue flows over several years for each one of those trials. So we are large enough, global enough that we can absorb even such a large cancellation. No change to the guidance. And as Ron pointed out and you reminded us in your question, the adjustment is entirely due to FX. Again, I wouldn't read a lot in the variation quarter-to-quarter. Just as an example, the RFP flow last year was flat versus the [ '22 ] number. So we think this is very good. It's consistent with our expectations. The large segment, the large pharma was up more in the high single digits in terms of RFP flow. EBP was a little bit higher than that at kind of mid-single growth, depends on the therapies. We had a lot of bookings, infectious diseases and internal medicine, which drove a lot of the growth there. \n The [ awards ] grew well into the teens. So we often look at awards. We report contracted bookings. As you know, some of our peers report awards, which is at an earlier stage in the in the process. And maybe just to reassure you that we haven't come down from what we said at the last quarter as a leading indicator, if you will, awards were up in the double digits and that was driven by large full-service trials, strong EBP as well. \n We look at the qualified pipeline, and the qualified pipeline is up double digits, actually very strong double digits. And it's up again at a record high. So nothing here that has changed versus our expectations. Yes. Well, I mean, I wouldn't talk about upside here so far. And then the macro is not really stabilizing, unless you call stabilizing [ the fact ] that we now know there won't be a rate cut anytime soon. \n So look, the TAS business is exactly performing exactly as we expected it, same type of performance that we telegraphed in our prior guidance, same growth rate that we anticipated when you exclude COVID and the currency impact. And we continue to see -- again, based on our pipeline, based on budgets [ firming ] up, based on the conversation with clients; continue to expect upside towards the back of the year, second half of the year and more in the back of the year. \n Large pharma companies, as you know, have introduced significant cost reduction programs. And that has driven a lot more cautiousness and scrutiny in the budgets than in prior years. And we've discussed, this is driven by the overall macro environment, maybe some concerns related to IRA long term and preservation of margins. \n As you know, our client base generally is doing fairly well and is reporting very good numbers. So we think that also is an encouraging sign. And usually, our clients have more propensity to spend when they -- when they are out, we are out. And we see that they are doing well. So all of those signs are encouraging. \n I could give you a little bit of color on the business in TAS, just for a perspective. The data business continues to perform exactly as expected. No surprises, they are flattish to up the low single digits. \n The real-world business, which we signaled in the prior quarter earnings call, was slowing down, has actually gone from being a very strong double-digit growth performer to mid-single digits to then negative growth in the fourth quarter, has rebounded somewhat and is now flattish. So we see that we think that we bottom out there. \n And the tech business continues to perform as expected, good and strong. And the analytics and consulting business, which is our shortest cycle business, ebbs and flows in the quarter. It had started to do a little better last quarter. This quarter, it went backwards, and that's why we didn't perform even better than our expectations in TAS. \n So all in all, real-world doing better than we thought. And analytics and consulting doing a little less than we thought, but that's kind of to be expected. It has more variability by definition. And we still have a strong pipeline there. So we think that, that will continue to improve quarter-over-quarter. And that's what gives us confidence that the back end of the year on TAS, we will be good. Again, upside, I don't know. I can't promise that. Yes. I mean, look as a percentage of our total R&DS revenue, [ FSP ] comprised about 15%. So now, if you -- that's in totality. If you look only at the services portion of the business, meaning excluding pass-throughs, which, as you know in FSP, there typically is no pass-throughs; so that percentage is a little higher and continues, it's a little less somewhere between 20% and 25%, I would say. And it continues to grow a point or 2 every year. \n So of course, it has an impact on margins because FSP margins -- FSP [ contracts ] come at lower margins. But again, we are a large global company, and that just puts more pressure on us to continue to operate with more efficiency, find new areas of productivity, contain costs and offset those margins, those mix -- those unfavorable mix impacts on margins with cost reductions, and we continue to work well on our usual playbook, which is to grow our EBITDA faster than our revenue and consequently increase margins. Thank you. Well, look, as you know, we've carved out a nice position in the global CRM market for Life Sciences, we came from behind much later in the game. I guess we entered the market more than 10 years after the large dominant incumbent in this market. And today, we have a footprint of over 400 clients and about 100,000 seats in the business, which is quite impressive in a few short years. \n Now what happened here is that a dominant competitor has announced a re-platforming of their product from Salesforce to their own in-house platform. Now OCE is based on a Salesforce platform. It's the result of a strategic partnership that has been in the market for over 5 years. And we and Salesforce want to ensure that we continue to have the best product in the market. And we've agreed that it is time to develop the next-generation product. \n We also agreed that it should be based on Salesforce's new Life Science Cloud, which is much more advanced. And as it will be based on the current OCE application to be re-platformed. Now it takes time to do that. It makes sense for Salesforce to take the lead in developing this next-generation application, and it will be based on IQVIA [ IP ]. \n Our existing customers understand all of that. They will continue to be supported for at least the next 5 years, and they are very happy. I can even say yesterday, we won a very significant award on OCE with a large, well-known client, pharma client, and we actually displaced the large dominant player in the space, which have been the incumbent for a long time. \n So our clients are reacting very favorably. They understand the need for the next-generation transition, and we are going to shepherd that process together with Salesforce. When the product is ready the next 2 years or so, we will go to market jointly with Salesforce with this new product platform, and we will help transition customers who wish to do so when they are ready to do so. Strong and positive reaction from the customer base. What was the first part? I hate to be boring. I had zero surprises this quarter. I mean, for lack of better words, I think this was a boring quarter. It was exact -- it came in exactly as we thought. Look, the nature of business is pretty predictable. The large cancellation was kind of -- it's based on -- really on the results and on the assessment of the environment by the clients. It's always been very well reported. \n And so it usually takes time to unwind the study. And so we knew it was coming. So those -- we know the exact timing when all of this would be finalized, but [ it was ] in the quarter. \n But other than that, frankly, no surprises [ up at the helm ]. Everything came in pretty much on expectations. There always are moving parts, but this was one of the most boring quarters I've seen, nothing -- no drop. That's the way we like it, by the way. \n In terms of your FSP question, it ebbs and flows. I remember my first contacts with this business now almost 8 years ago, I was told FSP is going to be replacing full service, clients are shifting to FSP. And indeed, there was, very similar to today, an effort by some of the large pharma companies, many of them, to bring project management in-house and to essentially shift to these types of models. So I think it's a pendulum. It swings back and forth. \n In a highly specialized studies, it's very hard for a client not to do full service because they don't always have all the competencies in-house. Again, I think we're seeing similar trends as we saw 8 years ago. What we're seeing also might be -- to add a little bit more to this, we're seeing a trend towards what we call hybrid models, where the client starts out with one thing, an FSP program. And as we progress in defining the parameters of the study, we end up taking on more of the tasks. \n And it's kind of in between full service. And it's not fully outsourced. But in that, they [ aren't ]100% FSP either. They're parts of the program that we continue to manage. So it's really more integration with the client, and it becomes more of a closer partnership. \n So I don't see this as a long-term permanent trend to the point where, theoretically, it will become 100% FSP. I don't see that happening. Plus remember, FSP is virtually nonexistent for EBP or midsized pharma. Okay, thank you. Well, on the FSP comment, I don't know when these things will -- this is a long-cycle business. I remind you that it takes an average 4, 5 years to execute a contract. So we have a very large book of business. I think in our backlog, what is the proportion of that FSP backlog? Is it also about 15%? Yes, so our backlog is over $30 billion, and about like somewhere worth $4 billion -- $4.5 billion of that is FSP. So you see the vast majority of the revenue we're going to deliver over the next 4 or 5 years is going to continue to be full-service programs, and it's not about to influence one way or the other. \n It's a slow-moving business. It takes a lot to move the needle one way or the other. We've been continuously on an upward momentum, and that's the way we like it. So no, I don't see that happening. And then certainly the same similar type of commentary on your question about affecting the second half, it is just too short horizon to have an impact. These swings will have an impact [ 4 ] years from now. Yes. Well, I mean that's a clever thought here why it was 2 [ material ] studies, but it happens to be not the case over here. But -- I see what you're thinking about, but that's not the case here. These are 2 different -- it's addressing 2 different diseases with different -- I think it's different molecules. Again, we can give you in post call some more color on this, but I don't think it's because of the IRA. \n Look, what is true is that clients are, with respect to the IRA, trying to accelerate timelines because one of the possible impacts of the IRA is that it will reduce the period of time during which protection will apply -- intellectual property protection will apply. \n And as a result, you want to maximize the revenues then, that, if anything -- and again, that's probably the context for your question, if anything, that kind of induce clients to launch several programs simultaneously. So in this particular case, we're replacing an incumbent, and I think one of them is a rescue study, if I am correct. So that's the context there. Okay. The three questions are totally independent. So first on pricing. Look, there's no change in pricing here. There continues to be pressure from clients, and price negotiations are always tough. We mentioned before that we're having maybe more pressure than we had before on pricing from large pharma clients as they're working on their savings initiatives, but it's not that different than history, maybe a little more than usual. \n But I think nothing -- with respect to competitors, I can't speak to what they do, I just have no idea, I don't want to know. But look, comes to reason that smaller competitors which have failed largely and have led to them being acquired, are struggling to book business and as a result, could put pressure on pricing. But nothing there that I can signal that's unusual versus what we spoke about in the past. \n Your second question was on cancellation. We spoke before, we address that. No, look, it's a very large cancellation. And yes, it has an impact on revenues over the next few years, including in this year. But we said earlier that we are a large company, and we are absorbing it in our guidance. It's fine. \n So yes, if you will, it would have been better if we hadn't -- if the program hasn't canceled. But it's okay, we're not changing the guidance for that. Our only guidance adjustment, again, is 100% related to foreign currency. \n With respect to your third question on AI, look, AI has -- not saying anything shocking here, AI has a massive amount of opportunity, in general, and I would say, perhaps more limited than people think in health care because data, the ingredients, if you will, are not readily available publicly. \n You can search for medical literature for diagnostics, you could look for jurisprudence for legal opinions. But frankly, to identify patients that are best suited for trials, sites that need to be identified for maximum effectiveness and fastest enrollment, that's really, really tough to get information. And if you ask those questions to a chatbot, you are not going to get the answers. \n However, once you are within our environment, then that's a lot more possible. And so if you think about it, the entire premise of what we set out to do when we merged Quintiles and IMS 8 years ago, was precisely to leverage massive amounts of data and analytics and technology to accelerate clinical development timelines, particularly applicable to oncology, rare disease and difficult-to-enroll patients. \n With the [ advance ] of AI, that set of initiatives becomes even easier. And we've been at it for a while, this is not new to us. But some of the new tools, as you can imagine, are put to good use within our environment, and some of the wins we've had are the direct results of those capabilities. Look, I wish I had a crystal ball here, and I've been wrong before on predicting a comeback, if you will, of the TAS business. So I'll be cautious in my commentary. \n You're right to point to the approvals. I mean, the number of approvals, as you know, in last year, I think there were 55 approvals last year. And that's -- that was I think a record year. It was certainly a very high level, almost 50% more than the prior year and the highest level since, I think, must be '17 or '18. \n Now the new launches and the spend associated with these new launches usually is up significantly for the 5 years that follow these approvals. So we do expect the TAS business to be strong. The wild card is when those launches occur, what clients decide to do. The -- about 50% of the new [ launch ] spend usually occurs within the first 2 years. So again, it happens over the following 5 years and usually the first 2 years. \n I mean, yes, quarter-to-quarter, it was only 10 this quarter. But we think in general, just with the approvals of last year, we should see a rebound coming in. And that's one of the reasons we are somewhat confident that the TAS business will be rebounding more strongly, and the real uptick will come next year. But we see -- given that it has bottomed out here, and we think it has reached the bottom, and we anticipate an improvement in the balance of the year. \n The pipeline is higher than it has ever been, frankly. And we scrub this pipeline continuously, we continue to see improvement in customer sentiment. In Q1, the tone is better, there are more opportunities that have surfaced. This increased optimism for the outlook in '24. \n What happened in the second half of last year in conversations with clients is the budgets became -- we are aware of what clients can spend because they [indiscernible] budget, but the budget got trimmed sometime towards the end of the year, and there was quite a bit of [ uncertainty ] as people were negotiating internally. \n We feel there is more clarity now on budgets, and that helps a lot with confidence for awards in the balance of the year. Also decisions, we measure decision timeline, and that -- those timelines have started to come down and get reduced, which is a favorable sign. That's correct."
