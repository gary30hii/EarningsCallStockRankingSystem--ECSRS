At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2020 Discover Financial Services Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session.  Thank you. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Eric Wasserstrom, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nEric Wasserstrom: Thank you, Maria, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to this morning's call. I'll begin on Slide 2 of our earnings presentation, which you can find in the financial section of our Investor Relations website, investorrelations.discover.com. Our discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause the actual results to differ materially. Please refer to our notices regarding forward-looking statements that appear in today's press release and the presentation. Our call today will include remarks from our CEO, Roger Hochschild; and John Greene, our Chief Financial Officer. As we conclude our formal comments, there will be time for a question-and-answer session. During the Q&A session, please limit yourself to one question. And if you have a follow-up question, please get back into queue, so we can accommodate as many participants as possible. Finally, I'd like to extend a tremendous thank you to Craig Streem for all of his help and support over the past few weeks and for his friendship and guidance over the past many years. So, thank you, Craig. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Roger.\nRoger Hochschild: Thanks, Eric, and thanks to our listeners for joining today's call. I too want to add a farewell to Craig, and thank him for many years of service to Discover, dating all the way back to great support in our original spin-off from Morgan Stanley. Our strong fourth quarter results were the capstone to good performance in a very challenging year, proving the value and resilience of our digital banking business model. While the economic impacts of the coronavirus pandemic were expansive, our business stood up to these challenges and we are in $799 million after-tax for the fourth quarter and over $1.1 billion for the full-year. Our fourth quarter results underscore the capital generation of our model. While our revenues were down 4% year-over-year, our outstanding credit performance, combined with the actions we took to reduce our funding costs and control our expenses, enabled us to exit the year with a 30% ROE in the fourth quarter. Looking back on the full-year, our operating results highlight the strength of our business and the execution of our team. We proactively adapted to the many ways in which the pandemic has altered our operating environment, including changes in consumer spending patterns, repayment trends and borrowing habits. Discover has always provided best-in-class customer service and this did not change with the pandemic. While other issuers faced significant challenges with long hold times, there was no disruption to our outstanding service as we leveraged our digital capabilities and our 100% U.S.-based customer service. We kept average hold times under five minutes through the trough of the downturn and they quickly returned to normal levels of under one minute.\nJohn Greene: Thank you, Roger, and good morning, everyone. I'll walk through our fourth quarter results, starting on Slide 4. We earned $799 million in net income, or $2.59 per share. These results included several one-time expenses, totaling $137 million. Excluding these, EPS would have been $2.94. There were a number of factors, both positive and negative, that influenced our performance during the year. Importantly, our results for 2020 reflect proactive management of our funding and operating cost and our conservative approach to credit management. These factors helped offset the revenue impacts of elevated payment trends and lower sales volumes. However, we're seeing some positive signs with a return to sales growth in the quarter and continued expansion of our net interest margin. In the fourth quarter, net interest income was down 2%, reflecting a 5% decline in average receivables and lower loan yield. This was mostly offset by decreased funding costs driven by lower market rates and management of our deposit costs. Non-interest income was 14% lower, driven by higher rewards costs from strong engagement in the 5% category this quarter, a one-time write-off of certain real estate facilities and lower loan fee income also contributed to the year-over-year decrease.\nOperator: Thank you.  We'll take our first question from Moshe Orenbuch from Credit Suisse.\nMoshe Orenbuch: Great. Thanks, and welcome, Eric. And if Craig is listening, it's been a pleasure working with you, too. I guess both, Roger and John, you talked about the idea of increasing marketing expenses into 2021. Could you just kind of flesh that out a little bit, talk a little \u2013 talk some about what it\u2019s \u2013 how much you'd like to grow accounts? What you're looking for? What signals would drive you to step on the gas a little harder or pull your foot off? And - because you've seen some of your competitors already start to spend the marketing. We don't know yet what that's generated. But maybe just talk about that a little bit.\nRoger Hochschild: Yes. Thanks, Moshe. So, you saw how we're thinking about the expense base for 2021. And then, I'll talk more specifically around marketing and new customer acquisition and growth. So, in terms of expenses, the business is committed to driving positive operating leverage over the mid-term. Now, opportunities in 2021 will dictate how much marketing dollars we ultimately end up spending for new customer acquisition. But in terms of the overall expense base, there will be incremental dollars for marketing, new customer acquisition and third-party recovery fees. As the courts reopen, we expect that those fees will increase consistent with the level of recoveries that we hope to achieve on bankrupt accounts. So, outside of those areas, we're targeting to keep expenses flat across the business. Now, certain accounts may go higher, certain may go lower, but the way you can think about it is growth initiatives, incremental spend, the balance of the income statement in terms of expenses will be flat to down. In terms of new account growth, what we're targeting is mid-single digits. Maybe if we're fortunate, we see some opportunities, upper single-digit account growth. And we hope that will translate into increased loan balances. We didn't give any specific guidance on loan balances because of the broad economy uncertainty there; and frankly, repayment trends have been pretty remarkable; and with it, potential new round of stimulus, that could further increase the prepayment trends. So, that's how we're thinking about growth and expenses. So, if there's a follow-up, we could take a quick follow-up. If not, we'll head on to the next question.\nMoshe Orenbuch: Great. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani of KBW.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Thanks. Good morning, and my congratulations to Eric and Craig as well. Wanted to drill down on the credit quality and reserve assumptions. I understand sort of the reversion to the mean assumption given the underlying unemployment rate. However, I think Moody's has been improving their laws, their unemployment assumptions and that rate is declining sort of in the second-half of this year and into 2022. I'm just curious sort of how to put sort of your assumption that the loss rates will get to the reserve levels - those embedded in the reserve assumptions? And at what point do you reassess that? Is there something seeing inside your portfolio that's leading you to be more conservative? Thanks.\nJohn Greene: Okay. Thanks, Sanjay. So, I'll take this one as well. So, first, let me start off by saying we're very pleased with the portfolio's performance. So, the resiliency of our customer base has been remarkably strong. So, in terms of the modeled assumptions - so in my script, I talked about 8% unemployment at the end of 2021. I realize that's higher than where we are today from a reported number. And we also assumed GDP growth of 2.7%. Now, there are some folks forecasting an increase in GDP as well. So, as we thought about the reserves and the positioning of the balance sheet, there's a couple of things that we took into account. So first is the overall unemployment numbers. There's about 10.7 million people out of work. There's another 7.3 million people that aren't included in the unemployment number due to the fact that they haven't actively worked - looked for work in the past four weeks. So, to me, where we are from a life of loan loss reserving standpoint made perfect sense is conservative. We didn't feel like we had enough data points at this point, given the level of uncertainty to make a material change to the absolute level of reserves in the fourth quarter, given a life of loan reserving assumption. But I can say this, we're going to continue to look at our portfolio and the macro environment. We're going to look specifically at the trajectory of unemployment and the type of unemployment. So, we're seeing unemployment levels transition from service workers to white collar workers, who would more likely be representative of our customer base and the impact of stimulus. So today, we're well positioned, and we're going to continue to reassess it, first quarter, second quarter and into the second-half of next year and make appropriate adjustments.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Rick Shane of JPMorgan.\nRick Shane: Good morning, and congratulations, Eric and Craig, when I saw the - I'm hoping you're listening when I saw the voluntary early retirement, I hope you're a reasonable chunk of that number. Sorry. When we think about what you've said in terms of marketing and adding new accounts, that makes sense. There will presumably be a lag in loan growth as you add accounts. Historically, when you started to grow the portfolio, again, it's been led by wallet share gains and line limit increases. I'm curious when you think you might take that sort of brownout on line limit increases off? And how we should think also about rewards rate as you think about wallet share going forward?\nRoger Hochschild: Yes. So, I'll start it on the rewards rate. We tend to keep our rewards program very stable. It provides a lot of value. And so, while you've seen competitors make dramatic changes, we feel like our leadership position in cash rewards serves as well. So, we have in the past talked about a low single-digit increase in rewards rate due to structural changes. That will likely continue. But beyond that, we feel very good about where we're positioned and the competitiveness of our program. In terms of growth, it's always been a mix of new accounts and stimulating the existing portfolio. And so, it will remain that going forward. In terms of what would get us to loosen credit, I think many of the indicators that John talked about, right? So, getting better line of sight in the direction of white-collar employment is probably the most critical one.\nRick Shane: Got it. Okay. Thank you, guys.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mark DeVries of Barclays.\nMark DeVries: I've got a follow-up to Sanjay's question. Clearly, the credit performance you've experienced so far is much better than you would have expected, just given all of the different macro assumptions. And so, my question is, what do you think you need to see in the data before you feel comfortable releasing reserves?\nJohn Greene: So first will be the performance of the portfolio. So, what's happening on specific roll rates, are they holding or are they deteriorating, consistent with what our modeled expectations are? Broad macro is going to be important. We also do know that if there's another round of stimulus, that will - which isn't baked into our reserve assumptions-- we do know that that will have an impact on a couple of factors - certainly, delinquency, repayment rate and ultimately charge-offs and required provisions. So, we'll keep an eye on that. Roger and I both talked about white collar employment levels and  will also be new jobless claims. So, putting those factors together with a strong overview on how the portfolio itself is performing, will be the key factors in determining what we do with reserves in 2021.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley.\nBetsy Graseck: I had a couple of questions on the buybacks that you announced. I just wanted to understand if the buyback announced - like, what kind of CET1 you're thinking about when you are putting forth that buyback estimate? And then the second question that's related to that has to do with whether or not you've embedded reserve releases in your estimates for that? I mean, because of the four-quarter trailing, federal right now is - kind of circular reference there. So, wanted to understand how you're thinking about reserve releases and what your target CET1 is?\nJohn Greene: So, we continue to target 10.5%. In terms of how we thought about buybacks this year, the first piece I would say is, we wanted to ensure we're prudent with our capital, given the level of uncertainty. We do have the Fed constraints in terms of the four-quarter average of net income. And so, the first quarter and - well, the second quarter and first quarter of 2020 are impacting that calculation for the first quarter of '21. And then, we're also thinking about the CECL transition impact, which will be somewhere between 200 and 250 basis points as we think about CET1. So ultimately, we didn't want to be out at the far edge of the buyback envelope. We felt that $1.1 billion was an appropriate return of capital given a level of uncertainty. And that will take a dent out of, what I'll say is, the excess capital that we have right now. But our earnings power will be really important and that will give us an opportunity to reassess that in 2022 as well.\nBetsy Graseck: And then just separately, a follow-up question here on how you're thinking about the interchange rate? I mean, there's been a couple of - there's been some pressure on it recently after years of improving. I just wanted to understand, is the recent behavior more of a short-term phenomenon, less T&E? Or is there something else going on that we should be thinking about remodeling out that one?\nJohn Greene: Yes. Yes. So, the fourth quarter did come down a little bit. And we can largely point to mix as there was a strong pull away from the traditional online - or excuse me, the brick-and-mortar retailers to the online retailers, which certainly impacted it. But from our perspective, very well aligned with our 5% categories in the fourth quarter, which also drove incremental sales through our card. And ultimately, we think it will translate into other forms of revenue, specifically interest income as balances revolves.\nBetsy Graseck: So, this quarter was primarily the 5% cash back on the dot-coms that got obviously utilized very, very fully?\nJohn Greene: Yes.\nOperator: Our next question comes from line of Bill Carcache of Wolfe Research.\nBill Carcache: I'd like to echo my congratulations to Eric and Craig. I wanted to ask about the net interest margin. And I believe that 10.63% is the highest we've ever seen. Can you talk about whether the trough is behind us? How sustainable this level is and the extent to which you see room - margins to actually expand from here, given the room for deposit re-pricing and remixing towards lower cost deposits that you see from here?\nJohn Greene: Yes. Sure. Sure, Bill. So, from the trough, our second half NIM improved by nearly 80 basis points, incredible. So, obviously, we can't run that trajectory in perpetuity. So, a way to think about that is we ended the fourth quarter at the 10.63% that you just mentioned. My view is that we still have some opportunity on deposit pricing, especially, if there's another round of stimulus because that will put a lot of liquidity in the market and the competition for deposits will further abate. Now, how much, ultimately, room we have there, uncertain. Is it 10, 20 or more bps, to be determined? But my view, at least 10 bps, very conservative view. The maturity profile, we included that information in the deck to allow folks to be able to model through some improvements that we'll see there. And then - so frankly, some things that are pushing against net interest margin, especially in the second half of the year. If the credit losses do accelerate as we've indicated, that will put some dampening pressure on net interest margin. So, broadly speaking, we do see further room for expansion there. But I would jump from the fourth quarter number and do those steps I just mentioned to get to a reasonable way of thinking about the balance of the year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Don Fandetti of Wells Fargo.\nDon Fandetti: Rogers, if you could comment on what you think about the sort of long-term growth rate of the card business? If it's been impacted by - you have a lot of new areas like personal loans, you have buy-now pay-later. Is this just on the edges or do you think that this has some impact on the growth of the card industry? And could you be wrong on that, I guess? And could some of these new initiatives and FinTechs be more impactful?\nRoger Hochschild: I certainly could be wrong. So, I'll say that upfront. But we have not seen either of those have an impact on card loan growth. And you've seen that in the past, whether it's been a home equity loan boom, where a lot of people are doing cash out refis and using that to pay down debt. A lot of consumers seem to carry a level of credit card debt that they are comfortable with, certainly our base, and they tend to revert back to that amount. And so buy-now pay-later is the most recent trend that's out there. We're looking at that very carefully and have yet to be able to see an impact on our revolving loan balances. So, in my decades in this business, there's always something that's going to kill off credit cards. But so far, the growth trajectory of the industry remains solid. Now. it is a mature business. But we also - as we think about our growth, it's a combination of where the industry goes, but also our ability to take share from our competitors and capture a disproportionate of student, young adults who are coming into the industry. And so, we feel good about that.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Barker of Piper Sandler.\nKevin Barker: Just wanted to follow-up on your - your guidance for losses to increase in the second half of 2021 and then likely remain elevated into 2022? I mean, are you envisioning, just given the current economic environment, that these are likely that we're going to have a plateau in 2022? Or is it going to be like a slow decline after we peak in the second half of 2021, just given what your view is on the economy and how things are playing out so far?\nJohn Greene: Yes. Okay. So, at this point, there's a bit of both art and science in terms of modeling kind of peak charge-offs. And what we've seen as we've gone through this pandemic is the peak has continued to push into future periods. And essentially, that's what we're seeing today. It's hard to believe, given the level of absolute unemployment and those folks that are outside of the employment ranks that aren't in the unemployment number, that there isn't going to be some material impact to credit and charge-offs at some point. The roll rates we're seeing right now in terms of - from aging buckets, one to the next, are incredibly strong, which is positive. So that means, by itself, there can't be an acceleration of charge-offs in - at least in the first four months of the year. Beyond that, you would expect, given the unemployment numbers that the roll rates will deteriorate, charge-offs will increase and continue to increase until there's absolute stability. So, we're seeing a peak in late 2021 and that could carry through into 2022 and then moderate as the towns go back and the economic - the broad macros improve. So, that's how we're thinking about it. I'm not sure if we've got it 100% right. If we don't, we're going to adjust accordingly.\nKevin Barker: And then the follow-up on your comments about targeting to keep expenses flat across the business, is that relative to account growth? Or is that saying, we're - year-over-year absolute expenses will remain flat in 2021?\nJohn Greene: Yes. So, I want to be careful here. It wasn't absolute expenses. So, what I tried to do is distinguish between those expenses that will help us accelerate growth. And we expect those to increase. Those that aren't targeted to accelerate growth, we expect will remain flat to down. We expect - if you go through kind of line items of the expense base, salaries and wages, we've done some things this year to level that off, including the voluntary early retirement program. We have activated our procurement organization around third-party spend, and we've driven a lot of productivity through that. We have looked at every single line item on the expense base and we're making determinations on whether or not those expenses will help us drive long-term growth. If the answer is yes, maybe will increase. If the answer is no, they're going to be flat to down.\nKevin Barker: So just to be clear, those expenses that are driving growth, should they be in line with account growth or be above or below, just dependent upon what you're seeing underlying the business?\nJohn Greene: So maybe one way of looking at that, for card, new accounts as an example, we expect our cost per account to be below what we saw in 2019. And that's with a tighter credit box and reflects the benefits we're seeing from some of our investments in advanced analytics as well as just the differentiation and appeal of our product.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Bob Napoli of William Blair.\nBob Napoli: I think I've said goodbye to Craig, like at least eight times over the last few decades. I don't think it's going to be the last one for some reason, but good luck. Roger, just - and so the world has come Discover's direction, if you would, I think the digital banking, branches banking structure that you have and then you have the unique asset of the network, obviously. But what are you working on? There's a lot of changes. While the markets come your direction, there's a lot of new businesses, direct banks, digital banks and development of companies like Venmo or private companies, Chime. Are there things that you're doing as you look at this to be on offense to expand the ecosystem of your products and services to try to get direct deposits to get more of, let's say, transaction banking accounts as well? What are you doing on the banking side? With all of the innovation in the market, where is Discover investing?\nRoger Hochschild: Yes. So, great question. If the world is coming your way, you've got to keep moving to stay ahead. And so, that is our focus. We've always stood for innovation back to our founding and inventing credit card rewards, but more recently with everything from the FICO score on statements, ability to freeze your account. And so, you can rest assure that that focus is still there on a pipeline of customer-driven innovation across all of our products. Specifically, in the deposit side, we think there's a lot of opportunity to get into transaction accounts. It will be a while before they become a material part of our funding base. But with our low-cost direct-to-consumer digital model as well as the advantage we have from being exempt from the Durbin interchange caps because we own our proprietary network, we're uniquely positioned for a bank over $10 billion. And so, it isn't maybe the primary focus right now, just given the excess level of fundings, but it is a critical initiative. And we feel good about our ability to compete both against traditional branch-based banks, but also against any of the new FinTech players.\nBob Napoli: I'd love some color on what else you look - you're thinking about there. But as you look at the - your customers - the customers that you're adding, is there any change in the demographic mix of the new customers you're adding? There's a lot of times we are getting commentary or questions around, well, the millennials are not going to borrow on their credit cards the way others did. And there are other new forms of credit. Is Discover getting the same share of those younger customers? And are you keeping them? Do you feel there's anything to the thought that the millennials will be less likely to use credit cards? And, I mean, if so, are you looking at other products like buy-now pay-later?\nRoger Hochschild: So, in terms of millennials, based on the data we see, we're either the leading or one of the leading underwriters for college students. And the brand is incredibly strong. We have college students and young adults that appreciate sort of the leading digital functionality, as well as some of the innovations I talked about. And we're seeing very similar usage patterns as we saw in prior generations of customers. So, we're very excited about the growth there. And I think being in the student loan business and the second largest originator, helped to get our brand out there in front of the next-generation of consumers.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of John Hecht of Jefferies.\nJohn Hecht: Congratulations to Eric and Craig, as everybody else has said. And thank you guys for taking the questions. Maybe follow-on to Bob's question, but in a different way. I mean, you guys have tightened - over the past several quarters, you've had substantial net paydowns. I'm wondering, has your kind of back book composition changed in a good or bad way, or a positive or, I guess, negative way based on those patterns?\nRoger Hochschild: I would say nothing dramatic. And part of the advantage we had, we have been tightening for a number of years coming into this. We felt like we were late cycle and talked about that with you guys on the call. Clearly, we didn't expect it to end the way it did in early 2020. But that helped us from having to take some of the magnitude of changes, but I think some of our competitors did. So, we try and be consistent in how we run the business. And so, we've targeted the same prime consumer. And I think drove have not seen any dramatic shifts in terms of our composition, either with the new accounts we're booking or our existing portfolio.\nJohn Hecht: And the second question is private student lending. I think you guys referred to some market share gains in the recent periods. I know there's been some shifts in terms of other big banks that are exiting that segment. And then there's a new administration and then maybe some changing policy or some thoughts about potential changing policy. Maybe just some commentary given your momentum there and your outlook there given those factors?\nRoger Hochschild: Yes. So, I would say there's always a lot of discussion about what might happen in Washington about student loans. I would say, keep in mind, that over 90% of student loans are the federal student loan program. And so, that's where a lot of the attention is focused, very different animal in terms of the, quite frankly, lack of underwriting of that product and the losses they experienced compared to how we go to market. So, we feel really good about the business, clearly benefited from one of the larger players stepping back. But we believe we would have gained share even if they hadn't. And so, it reflects the fact that the brand is well-positioned. It resonates with consumers and we take the same approach in terms of customer experience and differentiation with the student loan product as we do on the card side.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mihir Bhatia of Bank of America.\nMihir Bhatia: Maybe just staying with some of your non-card products. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about just the outlook in competitive intensity you are seeing for some of the - whether it's student loans, personal loans, even just on the network side of your business? I know there has been a focus to grow some of that too. So maybe just talk a little bit about what you're expecting from those businesses as we head into 2021? Thank you.\nRoger Hochschild: Sure. So, I'll start on the payment side. Always, very intense competition. In the payment side, we compete largely against two very large players. So, especially in debit, it's really head-to-head competition for merchant routing day in, day out. We don't expect that to change. But I feel good about the products we have, and we have a great team on it. In terms of other products, we talked about student loans. For personal loans, we have modestly widened credit on that. That was the product we tightened the most, just given the volatile in the downturn. We've loosened up, I would say, marginally, and feel good about what we're originating, positioned a little differently than most. We've always had a relatively narrow credit box for that, and those loans are, sort of, bigger ticket debt consolidation primarily. But I would say across all of our products, given the returns we get, these are all highly competitive, very challenging markets, and that sort of occurs day in, day out.\nMihir Bhatia: And then just if I could quickly follow-up on some of your NIM comments. I know you mentioned the funding side of the balance sheet, optimizing that. Is there also an opportunity a little bit to optimize on the asset side of the balance sheet? Maybe you were running with a little bit of excess cash in 2020 given the downturn, or is that fairly well-optimized already? Thank you.\nRoger Hochschild: Yes, thanks. I'll jump in on that one. Yes, we do have some excess liquidity right now, and there is an opportunity to continue to move that forward. Now we're going to, I'll say, gauge that based on the level of asset growth because asset growth will consume that liquidity. And we've built a plan that assumes a level of growth. So. that's one point. The other piece is around deposit pricing and how we price the deposits coming in, turning into cash. And then in terms of balance sheet positioning, we are mildly asset-sensitive right now. So, in a rising rate environment, that will also be beneficial to net interest margin. So quite honestly, the liquidity, I think, will take care of itself over time. And the positioning of the balance sheet in terms of asset sensitivity, very, very positive to be accretive to net interest margin in a rising rate environment.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Meng Jiao of Deutsche Bank.\nMeng Jiao: Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to get a sense on how you guys are thinking about deposit growth specifically, both direct-to-consumer and the broker deposits? I guess for DTC, it's now, I guess, 62% of total funding. I believe, previously you mentioned a longer-term target of 70% of the funding stack. Is that hard to still hold? Or do you expect DTC deposits to be even higher as a percentage of the funding stack going forward?\nJohn Greene: Yes. So, we're targeting 70%, 80%. So, 62%, you're correct on the number. So direct-to-consumer, our proposition has been very, very positive. We don't compete on the basis of price, which has been a good thing in terms of helping us to modulate some of the liquidity that we have. But also, the fact that deposits continue to grow shows that there is a level of loyalty and trust with the Discover brand. In terms of the broker CDs, we actually use that almost as a valve of sorts, right? So as our funding needs increase, we'll go more heavily into brokered CDs. As they decrease, we shrink it. So that's the way we've managed it traditionally. It's going to continue to be a liquidity channel for us, but a, what I'd say, less important channel over time in terms of total quantum of deposits.\nMeng Jiao: And then a second question. Just broad based, is there, I guess, anything structurally different in regards to releasing reserves under CECL than the prior method of looking at allowance reserves?\nJohn Greene: Not so much structurally. I mean, we've got a thorough process that considers all the elements of CECL under GAAP. The one thing I would say is the life of loan reserving does require more modeling and, frankly, a greater level of judgment given how far out into the horizon you're projecting losses. So, there's certainly a very strong governance element. There's a science to it, and then there is a level of professional judgment or art to it as well. So - yes, same could be said for incurred, but the horizon is much more difficult given timing of what we're trying to project.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, we have time for one more question. Our final question will come from the line of Dominick Gabriele of Oppenheimer.\nDominick Gabriele: Thanks so much for taking my questions. Can we just think about a potential windfall of excess capital from reserve releases? Excuse me. If that was to happen and the economic situation persisted the way it is today and you felt comfortable releasing the reserves, can you talk about the breakdown of how you would use that excess capital? I mean, when tax reform came, then there was a flood of capital. Companies started talking about we'll do half, about a third for growth, a third for capital return, a third for investment in technology, something like that. Can you talk about how you think about those pieces, should a flood of capital come your way? Thanks.\nRoger Hochschild: Yes. I'll let John talk about capital return, but I would say, our business does not let itself to rapid deployment of capital, right? We market on a consistent basis, sort of flooding the market in a given quarter based on the amount of capital we have, I don't think makes sense from a long-term standpoint. The same holds true for technology, right? A lot of it is about spending smart, not just putting huge amounts of money. So, I have a real hard - if we do have a quarter with a big reserve release, there may be some things. If the margin in terms of investments in the business, that by and large it will fall to the bottom line. And I'll let John pick it up there.\nJohn Greene: Yes. And so, Dominick, I do appreciate your optimism regarding a flood of capital as a result of reserve releases and a powerful economy. Our priorities actually remain the same, so in terms of how we think about capital and allocating the dollars first to growth then to dividend and share repurchases, and then the last priority would be small M&A, I think, bolt-on capabilities or certain niche products that we think will drive long-term shareholder value. So, no change there. We go through an annual capital planning process here as most financial services institutions do. And we share the outlook with our Board and our priorities. And obviously, there's some regulatory constraints that we manage too as well. And then we'll make good long-term decisions to generate profitable growth and shareholder return.\nDominick Gabriele: And then if we just think about the - if you look at the NIM in particular and the - this quarter, and the interest charge-off reduction in the quarter, that had a big impact on the yield. And so, could you just talk about the balance between, let's say, that interest and fee charge-off even just reverting to normalized levels, not including the spike of losses, let's say? But has that sort of just normalized over 2021 versus some of the benefits you have on the interest expense savings that you're doing, given all the - what you're doing there? Maybe if you balance those two against each other, could you still see kind of NIM expansion or levels in 2021 versus stable to improving versus 2020? Thanks.\nJohn Greene: Yes. We - Dominick, we do see opportunities for NIM expansion even in the face of increased interest charge-offs as the portfolio matures and contends with some of the economic stress. But the numbers in terms of quantum, I'm probably not going to get into that level of detail on the call here. But I will go back to what I said earlier in one of my questions in terms of how to think about it. So, we do see an opportunity for NIM expansion. And that - some of that will be tapered by credit and the impact of delinquencies. But even contemplating that, there will be a level of expansion.\nEric Wasserstrom: All right. Well, thank you all very much for joining us. Anyone who has additional questions, please give us a ring. Emily and I will be here to answer questions. And have a great day.\nRoger Hochschild: Thanks, everybody.\nOperator: And thank you ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thanks, Eric, and thanks to our listeners for joining today's call. I too want to add a farewell to Craig, and thank him for many years of service to Discover, dating all the way back to great support in our original spin-off from Morgan Stanley. Our strong fourth quarter results were the capstone to good performance in a very challenging year, proving the value and resilience of our digital banking business model. While the economic impacts of the coronavirus pandemic were expansive, our business stood up to these challenges and we are in $799 million after-tax for the fourth quarter and over $1.1 billion for the full-year. Our fourth quarter results underscore the capital generation of our model. While our revenues were down 4% year-over-year, our outstanding credit performance, combined with the actions we took to reduce our funding costs and control our expenses, enabled us to exit the year with a 30% ROE in the fourth quarter. Looking back on the full-year, our operating results highlight the strength of our business and the execution of our team. We proactively adapted to the many ways in which the pandemic has altered our operating environment, including changes in consumer spending patterns, repayment trends and borrowing habits. Discover has always provided best-in-class customer service and this did not change with the pandemic. While other issuers faced significant challenges with long hold times, there was no disruption to our outstanding service as we leveraged our digital capabilities and our 100% U.S.-based customer service. We kept average hold times under five minutes through the trough of the downturn and they quickly returned to normal levels of under one minute. Yes. Thanks, Moshe. So, you saw how we're thinking about the expense base for 2021. And then, I'll talk more specifically around marketing and new customer acquisition and growth. So, in terms of expenses, the business is committed to driving positive operating leverage over the mid-term. Now, opportunities in 2021 will dictate how much marketing dollars we ultimately end up spending for new customer acquisition. But in terms of the overall expense base, there will be incremental dollars for marketing, new customer acquisition and third-party recovery fees. As the courts reopen, we expect that those fees will increase consistent with the level of recoveries that we hope to achieve on bankrupt accounts. So, outside of those areas, we're targeting to keep expenses flat across the business. Now, certain accounts may go higher, certain may go lower, but the way you can think about it is growth initiatives, incremental spend, the balance of the income statement in terms of expenses will be flat to down. In terms of new account growth, what we're targeting is mid-single digits. Maybe if we're fortunate, we see some opportunities, upper single-digit account growth. And we hope that will translate into increased loan balances. We didn't give any specific guidance on loan balances because of the broad economy uncertainty there; and frankly, repayment trends have been pretty remarkable; and with it, potential new round of stimulus, that could further increase the prepayment trends. So, that's how we're thinking about growth and expenses. So, if there's a follow-up, we could take a quick follow-up. If not, we'll head on to the next question. Yes. So, I'll start it on the rewards rate. We tend to keep our rewards program very stable. It provides a lot of value. And so, while you've seen competitors make dramatic changes, we feel like our leadership position in cash rewards serves as well. So, we have in the past talked about a low single-digit increase in rewards rate due to structural changes. That will likely continue. But beyond that, we feel very good about where we're positioned and the competitiveness of our program. In terms of growth, it's always been a mix of new accounts and stimulating the existing portfolio. And so, it will remain that going forward. In terms of what would get us to loosen credit, I think many of the indicators that John talked about, right? So, getting better line of sight in the direction of white-collar employment is probably the most critical one. I certainly could be wrong. So, I'll say that upfront. But we have not seen either of those have an impact on card loan growth. And you've seen that in the past, whether it's been a home equity loan boom, where a lot of people are doing cash out refis and using that to pay down debt. A lot of consumers seem to carry a level of credit card debt that they are comfortable with, certainly our base, and they tend to revert back to that amount. And so buy-now pay-later is the most recent trend that's out there. We're looking at that very carefully and have yet to be able to see an impact on our revolving loan balances. So, in my decades in this business, there's always something that's going to kill off credit cards. But so far, the growth trajectory of the industry remains solid. Now. it is a mature business. But we also - as we think about our growth, it's a combination of where the industry goes, but also our ability to take share from our competitors and capture a disproportionate of student, young adults who are coming into the industry. And so, we feel good about that. Yes. So, great question. If the world is coming your way, you've got to keep moving to stay ahead. And so, that is our focus. We've always stood for innovation back to our founding and inventing credit card rewards, but more recently with everything from the FICO score on statements, ability to freeze your account. And so, you can rest assure that that focus is still there on a pipeline of customer-driven innovation across all of our products. Specifically, in the deposit side, we think there's a lot of opportunity to get into transaction accounts. It will be a while before they become a material part of our funding base. But with our low-cost direct-to-consumer digital model as well as the advantage we have from being exempt from the Durbin interchange caps because we own our proprietary network, we're uniquely positioned for a bank over $10 billion. And so, it isn't maybe the primary focus right now, just given the excess level of fundings, but it is a critical initiative. And we feel good about our ability to compete both against traditional branch-based banks, but also against any of the new FinTech players. So, in terms of millennials, based on the data we see, we're either the leading or one of the leading underwriters for college students. And the brand is incredibly strong. We have college students and young adults that appreciate sort of the leading digital functionality, as well as some of the innovations I talked about. And we're seeing very similar usage patterns as we saw in prior generations of customers. So, we're very excited about the growth there. And I think being in the student loan business and the second largest originator, helped to get our brand out there in front of the next-generation of consumers. I would say nothing dramatic. And part of the advantage we had, we have been tightening for a number of years coming into this. We felt like we were late cycle and talked about that with you guys on the call. Clearly, we didn't expect it to end the way it did in early 2020. But that helped us from having to take some of the magnitude of changes, but I think some of our competitors did. So, we try and be consistent in how we run the business. And so, we've targeted the same prime consumer. And I think drove have not seen any dramatic shifts in terms of our composition, either with the new accounts we're booking or our existing portfolio. Yes. So, I would say there's always a lot of discussion about what might happen in Washington about student loans. I would say, keep in mind, that over 90% of student loans are the federal student loan program. And so, that's where a lot of the attention is focused, very different animal in terms of the, quite frankly, lack of underwriting of that product and the losses they experienced compared to how we go to market. So, we feel really good about the business, clearly benefited from one of the larger players stepping back. But we believe we would have gained share even if they hadn't. And so, it reflects the fact that the brand is well-positioned. It resonates with consumers and we take the same approach in terms of customer experience and differentiation with the student loan product as we do on the card side. Sure. So, I'll start on the payment side. Always, very intense competition. In the payment side, we compete largely against two very large players. So, especially in debit, it's really head-to-head competition for merchant routing day in, day out. We don't expect that to change. But I feel good about the products we have, and we have a great team on it. In terms of other products, we talked about student loans. For personal loans, we have modestly widened credit on that. That was the product we tightened the most, just given the volatile in the downturn. We've loosened up, I would say, marginally, and feel good about what we're originating, positioned a little differently than most. We've always had a relatively narrow credit box for that, and those loans are, sort of, bigger ticket debt consolidation primarily. But I would say across all of our products, given the returns we get, these are all highly competitive, very challenging markets, and that sort of occurs day in, day out. Yes, thanks. I'll jump in on that one. Yes, we do have some excess liquidity right now, and there is an opportunity to continue to move that forward. Now we're going to, I'll say, gauge that based on the level of asset growth because asset growth will consume that liquidity. And we've built a plan that assumes a level of growth. So. that's one point. The other piece is around deposit pricing and how we price the deposits coming in, turning into cash. And then in terms of balance sheet positioning, we are mildly asset-sensitive right now. So, in a rising rate environment, that will also be beneficial to net interest margin. So quite honestly, the liquidity, I think, will take care of itself over time. And the positioning of the balance sheet in terms of asset sensitivity, very, very positive to be accretive to net interest margin in a rising rate environment. Yes. I'll let John talk about capital return, but I would say, our business does not let itself to rapid deployment of capital, right? We market on a consistent basis, sort of flooding the market in a given quarter based on the amount of capital we have, I don't think makes sense from a long-term standpoint. The same holds true for technology, right? A lot of it is about spending smart, not just putting huge amounts of money. So, I have a real hard - if we do have a quarter with a big reserve release, there may be some things. If the margin in terms of investments in the business, that by and large it will fall to the bottom line. And I'll let John pick it up there. Thanks, everybody."

            "name": "John Greene",
            "content": "Thank you, Roger, and good morning, everyone. I'll walk through our fourth quarter results, starting on Slide 4. We earned $799 million in net income, or $2.59 per share. These results included several one-time expenses, totaling $137 million. Excluding these, EPS would have been $2.94. There were a number of factors, both positive and negative, that influenced our performance during the year. Importantly, our results for 2020 reflect proactive management of our funding and operating cost and our conservative approach to credit management. These factors helped offset the revenue impacts of elevated payment trends and lower sales volumes. However, we're seeing some positive signs with a return to sales growth in the quarter and continued expansion of our net interest margin. In the fourth quarter, net interest income was down 2%, reflecting a 5% decline in average receivables and lower loan yield. This was mostly offset by decreased funding costs driven by lower market rates and management of our deposit costs. Non-interest income was 14% lower, driven by higher rewards costs from strong engagement in the 5% category this quarter, a one-time write-off of certain real estate facilities and lower loan fee income also contributed to the year-over-year decrease. Okay. Thanks, Sanjay. So, I'll take this one as well. So, first, let me start off by saying we're very pleased with the portfolio's performance. So, the resiliency of our customer base has been remarkably strong. So, in terms of the modeled assumptions - so in my script, I talked about 8% unemployment at the end of 2021. I realize that's higher than where we are today from a reported number. And we also assumed GDP growth of 2.7%. Now, there are some folks forecasting an increase in GDP as well. So, as we thought about the reserves and the positioning of the balance sheet, there's a couple of things that we took into account. So first is the overall unemployment numbers. There's about 10.7 million people out of work. There's another 7.3 million people that aren't included in the unemployment number due to the fact that they haven't actively worked - looked for work in the past four weeks. So, to me, where we are from a life of loan loss reserving standpoint made perfect sense is conservative. We didn't feel like we had enough data points at this point, given the level of uncertainty to make a material change to the absolute level of reserves in the fourth quarter, given a life of loan reserving assumption. But I can say this, we're going to continue to look at our portfolio and the macro environment. We're going to look specifically at the trajectory of unemployment and the type of unemployment. So, we're seeing unemployment levels transition from service workers to white collar workers, who would more likely be representative of our customer base and the impact of stimulus. So today, we're well positioned, and we're going to continue to reassess it, first quarter, second quarter and into the second-half of next year and make appropriate adjustments. So first will be the performance of the portfolio. So, what's happening on specific roll rates, are they holding or are they deteriorating, consistent with what our modeled expectations are? Broad macro is going to be important. We also do know that if there's another round of stimulus, that will - which isn't baked into our reserve assumptions-- we do know that that will have an impact on a couple of factors - certainly, delinquency, repayment rate and ultimately charge-offs and required provisions. So, we'll keep an eye on that. Roger and I both talked about white collar employment levels and  will also be new jobless claims. So, putting those factors together with a strong overview on how the portfolio itself is performing, will be the key factors in determining what we do with reserves in 2021. So, we continue to target 10.5%. In terms of how we thought about buybacks this year, the first piece I would say is, we wanted to ensure we're prudent with our capital, given the level of uncertainty. We do have the Fed constraints in terms of the four-quarter average of net income. And so, the first quarter and - well, the second quarter and first quarter of 2020 are impacting that calculation for the first quarter of '21. And then, we're also thinking about the CECL transition impact, which will be somewhere between 200 and 250 basis points as we think about CET1. So ultimately, we didn't want to be out at the far edge of the buyback envelope. We felt that $1.1 billion was an appropriate return of capital given a level of uncertainty. And that will take a dent out of, what I'll say is, the excess capital that we have right now. But our earnings power will be really important and that will give us an opportunity to reassess that in 2022 as well. Yes. Yes. So, the fourth quarter did come down a little bit. And we can largely point to mix as there was a strong pull away from the traditional online - or excuse me, the brick-and-mortar retailers to the online retailers, which certainly impacted it. But from our perspective, very well aligned with our 5% categories in the fourth quarter, which also drove incremental sales through our card. And ultimately, we think it will translate into other forms of revenue, specifically interest income as balances revolves. Yes. Yes. Sure. Sure, Bill. So, from the trough, our second half NIM improved by nearly 80 basis points, incredible. So, obviously, we can't run that trajectory in perpetuity. So, a way to think about that is we ended the fourth quarter at the 10.63% that you just mentioned. My view is that we still have some opportunity on deposit pricing, especially, if there's another round of stimulus because that will put a lot of liquidity in the market and the competition for deposits will further abate. Now, how much, ultimately, room we have there, uncertain. Is it 10, 20 or more bps, to be determined? But my view, at least 10 bps, very conservative view. The maturity profile, we included that information in the deck to allow folks to be able to model through some improvements that we'll see there. And then - so frankly, some things that are pushing against net interest margin, especially in the second half of the year. If the credit losses do accelerate as we've indicated, that will put some dampening pressure on net interest margin. So, broadly speaking, we do see further room for expansion there. But I would jump from the fourth quarter number and do those steps I just mentioned to get to a reasonable way of thinking about the balance of the year. Yes. Okay. So, at this point, there's a bit of both art and science in terms of modeling kind of peak charge-offs. And what we've seen as we've gone through this pandemic is the peak has continued to push into future periods. And essentially, that's what we're seeing today. It's hard to believe, given the level of absolute unemployment and those folks that are outside of the employment ranks that aren't in the unemployment number, that there isn't going to be some material impact to credit and charge-offs at some point. The roll rates we're seeing right now in terms of - from aging buckets, one to the next, are incredibly strong, which is positive. So that means, by itself, there can't be an acceleration of charge-offs in - at least in the first four months of the year. Beyond that, you would expect, given the unemployment numbers that the roll rates will deteriorate, charge-offs will increase and continue to increase until there's absolute stability. So, we're seeing a peak in late 2021 and that could carry through into 2022 and then moderate as the towns go back and the economic - the broad macros improve. So, that's how we're thinking about it. I'm not sure if we've got it 100% right. If we don't, we're going to adjust accordingly. Yes. So, I want to be careful here. It wasn't absolute expenses. So, what I tried to do is distinguish between those expenses that will help us accelerate growth. And we expect those to increase. Those that aren't targeted to accelerate growth, we expect will remain flat to down. We expect - if you go through kind of line items of the expense base, salaries and wages, we've done some things this year to level that off, including the voluntary early retirement program. We have activated our procurement organization around third-party spend, and we've driven a lot of productivity through that. We have looked at every single line item on the expense base and we're making determinations on whether or not those expenses will help us drive long-term growth. If the answer is yes, maybe will increase. If the answer is no, they're going to be flat to down. So maybe one way of looking at that, for card, new accounts as an example, we expect our cost per account to be below what we saw in 2019. And that's with a tighter credit box and reflects the benefits we're seeing from some of our investments in advanced analytics as well as just the differentiation and appeal of our product. Yes. So, we're targeting 70%, 80%. So, 62%, you're correct on the number. So direct-to-consumer, our proposition has been very, very positive. We don't compete on the basis of price, which has been a good thing in terms of helping us to modulate some of the liquidity that we have. But also, the fact that deposits continue to grow shows that there is a level of loyalty and trust with the Discover brand. In terms of the broker CDs, we actually use that almost as a valve of sorts, right? So as our funding needs increase, we'll go more heavily into brokered CDs. As they decrease, we shrink it. So that's the way we've managed it traditionally. It's going to continue to be a liquidity channel for us, but a, what I'd say, less important channel over time in terms of total quantum of deposits. Not so much structurally. I mean, we've got a thorough process that considers all the elements of CECL under GAAP. The one thing I would say is the life of loan reserving does require more modeling and, frankly, a greater level of judgment given how far out into the horizon you're projecting losses. So, there's certainly a very strong governance element. There's a science to it, and then there is a level of professional judgment or art to it as well. So - yes, same could be said for incurred, but the horizon is much more difficult given timing of what we're trying to project. Yes. And so, Dominick, I do appreciate your optimism regarding a flood of capital as a result of reserve releases and a powerful economy. Our priorities actually remain the same, so in terms of how we think about capital and allocating the dollars first to growth then to dividend and share repurchases, and then the last priority would be small M&A, I think, bolt-on capabilities or certain niche products that we think will drive long-term shareholder value. So, no change there. We go through an annual capital planning process here as most financial services institutions do. And we share the outlook with our Board and our priorities. And obviously, there's some regulatory constraints that we manage too as well. And then we'll make good long-term decisions to generate profitable growth and shareholder return. Yes. We - Dominick, we do see opportunities for NIM expansion even in the face of increased interest charge-offs as the portfolio matures and contends with some of the economic stress. But the numbers in terms of quantum, I'm probably not going to get into that level of detail on the call here. But I will go back to what I said earlier in one of my questions in terms of how to think about it. So, we do see an opportunity for NIM expansion. And that - some of that will be tapered by credit and the impact of delinquencies. But even contemplating that, there will be a level of expansion."

Our discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. Please refer to our notices regarding forward-looking statements that appear in today's earnings press release and presentation. Our call today will include remarks from our CEO, Roger Hochschild, and John Greene, our Chief Financial Officer.

During the Q&A session, please limit yourself to one question, and if you have a follow-up please queue back in so we can accommodate as many participants as possible. And now as always it\u2019s my pleasure to turn the call over to Roger.\nRoger Hochschild: Thank you, Craig. And thanks to our listeners for joining today's call. In these uniquely challenging times, I'm pleased with Discover\u2019s results and how well our business model has performed. In the third quarter, we are in $771 million after tax or $2.45 per share. We clearly benefited from the actions we took in the first half of this year to protect employees, manage credit risk, and control costs while preserving momentum on long-term investments. While significant uncertainty remains as to the extent and timing of a recovery, we were pleased to see the return to year-over-year sales growth in September. Managing credit remains a top priority. We entered this recession from a strong credit position due to our traditionally conservative approach to underwriting as well as actions taken over the past few years to reduce our contingent liability and tighten credit at the margin. We quickly implemented changes to credit policy at the onset of the pandemic, including tightening criteria for new accounts in line increases and additional income verification. While we saw very strong credit performance this quarter, we expect to see deterioration in the coming quarters as the prime consumer may be impacted by increasing permanent white collar unemployment. That said, we believe we have taken the appropriate credit actions and don't see the need to make significant changes at this time. The improvements in sales volume continued during the quarter with a return to growth in the month of September. Sales have improved across all categories with particular strength in online retail, home improvement, and everyday spend categories partially offset by continued weakness in travel and entertainment spending. Loan growth continues to be affected by the pandemic, with total loans down 4% year-over-year, including card loans down 6% and personal loans down 5%. The drop in spending during the pandemic and our own credit tightening has impacted loan growth. But another driver has been a significantly higher payment rate in our card and personal loan portfolios. Consumers have had improved household cash flows due to reduced spending and government stimulus and have taken this opportunity to boost savings and make larger payments against their loans. In our student loan business, originations in the peak season were down year-over-year, reflecting the large number of students who chose not to enroll this fall. Even in this challenging environment, our organic student loans were up 7% reflecting innovative features like our multiyear loan and our strong competitive position. In terms of operating expenses we remain on track to deliver $400 million of cost reductions this year, while continuing to invest in core capabilities, such as advanced analytics to increase efficiency and drive long-term value. In conclusion, this quarter our business generated high returns as we remained focused on discipline credit management, profitable growth, and an industry leading customer experience supported by our 100% U.S. based customer service. The economic environment remains uncertain but our strong capital and liquidity and the actions we've taken to strengthen the business position allows us to continue to drive long-term value for our shareholders. I\u2019d now ask John to discuss key aspects of our financial results in more detail.\nJohn Greene: Thank you, Roger. And good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. I\u2019ll walk through our results, starting on Slide 4. We earned $2.45 per share driven by solid credit performance of our portfolio and significantly lower operating expenses. While total revenue was down from last year reflecting the slowdown in the economy, sales volume turned positive in September and net interest margin expanded nicely. Net interest income was down 6%, as the impact of lower market rates was partially offset by lower funding cost. In addition, average receivables were down 3% contributing to the decline in net interest income. Non-interest income was down 10% driven by lower fee income, reflecting fewer late fee incidences and the impact of lower overall spending on cash advance fees. The decrease in net discount and interchange revenue was driven by sales volume in the quarter. The provision for credit loss is improved by nearly $50 million from the prior year as a result of a decline in net charge-offs in a lower reserve build. Operating expenses were down 9% year-over-year driven by marketing expenses and professional fees. Turning to loan growth on Slide 5, total loans were down 4% from the prior year driven by a 6% decrease in card receivables. Lower card receivables were driven by three factors, a higher payment rate as customers continue to be mindful of their debt obligations. A decline in promotional balances as a result of credit tightening, which will benefit net interest margin going forward. And third, lower sales volume. In the quarter sales were down just 1% on a year-over-year basis. Sales returned to growth in September up 4% year-over-year, with improvement in all categories, grocery, retail and home improvement were very strong. The trend continued through the first half of October with sales up 7%. In our other lending products, organic student loans increased 7% from the prior year and personal loans decreased 5%. Moving to Slide 6, our net interest margin bottomed out in the second quarter and improved 38 basis points to 10.19% in the current quarter, relative to the second quarter NIM increased primarily due to favorable consumer deposit pricing. Since June 30, we have decreased our online savings rate 41 basis points down to [0.60%]. Approximately two-thirds of our consumer deposits are indeterminate maturity accounts, primarily savings, which has provided an immediate benefit from deposit rates decreases. Average consumer deposits were up 22% year-over-year, and up $2.7 billion from the second quarter. Looking at Slide 7, you can see how our funding mix has changed overtime. We're also providing details on our funding maturities and corresponding rates over the next couple of years. Given our current excess liquidity position, we expect to issue very little wholesale debt in the near-term. The majority of our new deposits have been in online savings. And we would expect this trend to continue in the current low rate environment. As we move towards our target at 70% to 80% of funding from consumer deposits, we expect to see continued benefits to net interest margin. Turning to Slide 8, total operating expenses were down $102 million or 9% in the prior year. Marketing and business development expense was down $90 million or 39%. The bulk of the reduction was in brand marketing and card acquisition. Professional fees decreased $38 million or 20% mainly driven by lower third-party recovering fees related to foreclosure, as well as favorable vendor pricing adjustments. Employee compensation was up $32 million or 7% driven by staffing increases mainly in technology, as well as higher average salaries and benefit costs. To date, we've realized approximately 90% of the targeted $400 million of expense reductions we discussed over the past two quarters. We are on track to deliver the remaining 10% in the fourth quarter and continue to review the business for efficiency opportunities. Turning now to Slide 9 showing credit metrics. Credit performance remained very strong in third quarter. Cards net charge-offs dollars actually came down $7 million, while the rate increased 13 basis points Sequentially, the card net charge-off rate improved 45 basis points. The 30 plus delinquency rate improved 59 basis points from last year and 26 basis points from the prior quarter as credit performance of our card portfolio continued to be stable, demonstrating the strength of our prime revolver customer base. Our private student loan portfolio had another quarter of strong credit performance with net charge-offs down 1 basis points compared to the prior year. Excluding purchase loans, the 30 plus delinquency rate improved 37 basis points from the prior year and 8 basis points sequentially. Credit performance in our personal loan portfolio continued to be very strong this quarter, reflecting our disciplined underwriting and the benefit of credit actions implemented over the past several years. Net charge-offs improved 130 basis points and the 30 plus delinquency rate was down 39 basis points from the prior year. While overall credit performance remained strong through the third quarter, we expect the economic environment to lead to deterioration and consumer credit, with delinquencies slightly increasing in 2021. The timing of the rise in delinquency and subsequent losses could be impacted if there is a second government stimulus program or economic trends shift materially. Slide 10 shows our allowance for credit losses. In the quarter we added $42 million to the allowance driven by a $354 million increase in organic student loans. Other loan products were generally flat from the prior quarter. With the backdrop of an uncertain by improving macroeconomic environment, we modeled several different scenarios and maintained a conservative view in the quarter. Our key macro assumptions were an unemployment rate of 11% at the end of 2020 and slowly recovering over the next several years. We also considered the current trends in unemployment and the increasing number of COVID cases. Moving to Slide 11, our Common Equity Tier 1 ratio increased 50 basis points sequentially, primarily due to the decline in loan balance. In March, we suspended our share buyback program in response to the economic environment at that time and it remained suspended. We have continued to fund our quarterly dividend at $0.44 per share. We are in the process of preparing our second stress test submission and will determine our share repurchase and dividend actions subjected to the final stress capital buffer, regulatory and rating agency expectations and Board approval. In summary, solid results in the third quarter. The portfolio remained stable with improvements in overall delinquency levels. Reserves are flat except for those pertaining to student loans where the balance and commitment levels increased. Net interest margins improved from the second quarter and is trending positively as a result of our aggressive deposit pricing. And finally, strong execution on our targeted expense reductions. With that, I'll turn the call back to her operator Maria to open up the lines for Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani of KBW.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Thanks. Good morning and good quarter. Appreciate all the color on reserves and provisions. Roger, clearly there's nothing that we see within the credit metrics. That suggests a weakness outside of the headlines on potential white collar layoffs. Are there any specific signs that you're seeing inside the portfolio that lead you to be concerned? And how significant the change in the environment would there have to be for you guys to have to build reserves again.\nRoger Hochschild: So I'll let John to cover the part about reserves Sanjay. But in terms of the environment, I think that the jobless claims numbers and we'll see what this week has but seven straight weeks over [800,000] and more and more of that permanent unemployment and white collar is a reason for ongoing concern. But I think as you look at our portfolio, I'm very pleased with the performance across all products. And you can see that from the broadest metric, we just close the 30-day delinquency rate.\nJohn Greene: Yes, and Sanjay, in terms of reserving, we modeled a number of different assumptions and took conservative approach across the board. What we saw was actually, as Roger said, excellent underlying portfolio performance. There is, there is a level of concern in terms of jobless claims and the impact on prime consumers. But today, we don't see anything that -- that's out there that would suggest that reserves are -- I'll say weak or deep strengthening at this point. We did model a second round of stimulus. We don't know if that's going to happen. There's some reason to be optimistic, but no one can tell that on this sorts of things these days. So we'll say, but what we'll look at through the quarter, the fourth quarter, and make a call in terms of what's appropriate from a GAAP standpoint.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from one of Rick Shane of JP Morgan.\nRick Shane: Thanks, guys, and good morning. Look, we're entering, what's historically the most important part of the year in terms of spending in consumer behavior? I'm curious -- two things you're seeing an uptick in spending, which is a good sign. I'm curious how you will approach this from a marketing and rewards perspective, we know you pull back a little bit to this point to manage expenses. But given the consumer seems to be rebounding, will you be a little bit more aggressive on rewards or marketing as we head into the holiday season?\nRoger Hochschild: Yes, thanks, Rick. In terms of marketing, while we did cut expenses, in line with the economic environment, we have continued to market across all of our products, and have been very excited actually about the quality of new accounts we're bringing in on the card book, as well as some of the costs we're seeing as competitors pulled back more aggressively. Now, I do expect some of that to normalize over time. But again, we're going to continue marketing through the fourth quarter. In terms of the rewards program, so our program is well suited to this environment. Consumers prefer cash over miles. I think a lot of the miles programs I see in the marketplace are struggling to add relevance and redemption options. And in particular, our strong partnerships with PayPal and Amazon, some of the programs we're already putting in market with Amazon will serve us well in the fourth quarter.\nRick Shane: Great. That's very helpful. Thank you guys.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Don Fandetti of Wells Fargo.\nDon Fandetti: Hi, good morning. So Roger, I mean these are the times where you can potentially step in and gain share and be opportunistic. We saw American Express buy Kabbage, do you have any thoughts on your position of strength? How you could use that maybe on acquisitions or you going to just sort of hold tight given the uncertainty?\nRoger Hochschild: Yes. I think we are leveraging that position of strength. I believe we're gaining share both in terms of sales and loans and card and had a very strong peak season for student loans. Acquisitions are a little more challenging. And so as we think about how we use capital, the top priority is supporting organic growth. Next comes a mix of dividends and buybacks. Acquisitions tend to be a distant third, our primary interest is in the payment space. But while valuations have come in a bit, especially where cross border type of company, they're still very high. And so a lot of what we're seeing opportunities for either investments, partnerships, so we'll look at it, but I think we're probably more likely to be aggressive on the organic side, subject to our conservative credit policy than making acquisitions.\nDon Fandetti: Okay, just one quick clarification. What percentage of the portfolio is promo right now? Because it sounds like that's going to help on the card yield going forward?\nJohn Greene: Yes, it's come down recently. We've been intentional about that in terms of taking a look at promo balances as well as balance transfers. So\u2026\nDon Fandetti: And so I think -- usually you guys are in the mid teens or somewhere in that range?\nJohn Greene: Yes, it's, right around 15 or so.\nDon Fandetti: Okay. All right. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Bill Carcache of Wolfe Research.\nBill Carcache: Thank you. Good morning, Roger and John. It's encouraging to see positive operating leverage in this environment. That's consistent with what we've seen over the last decade plus from you guys, but there had been some concern among investors when you guys gave guidance earlier this year pre-COVID that is cover may have lost its expensive discipline and that the reason that you guys had at the time guided to negative operating leverage was due to years of chronic underinvestment? Roger, understanding that there will always be one-off investments that need to be made. But that aside, you speak to your confidence level and being able to continue to generate consistent positive operating leverage as we look to the other side of this?\nRoger Hochschild: Yes, thanks, Bill. So first, having been here for over 20 years, I have to maybe disagree with the phrase chronic underinvestment, I think our investments have been appropriate. But at the beginning of the year, we saw an opportunity to invest more. And so I would characterize it that way. Clearly, the year changed dramatically. And hopefully, you've seen very strong expense discipline in terms of the target we put out there and how well we're progressing against that target. It's a little challenging just to look at operating leverage, because that includes well of course day-to-day corporate type expenses that we're always trying to bring down. But then also marketing investments that drive profitable growth and high returning accounts. And so it's a blend of those two. But again, I think you can expect to see the continued expense discipline that I think has always been a hallmark here to discover our overall lower cost operating model. But we will invest according to the opportunities we see in the marketplace. And I guess I'd point you to the returns we're generating as an example of the effectiveness of that business model even through extremely challenging cycles.\nBill Carcache: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Nash of Goldman Sachs.\nRyan Nash: Hey, good morning, guys.\nRoger Hochschild: Good morning.\nJohn Greene: Good morning.\nRyan Nash: John, on net interest margin, you saw some really nice expansion. You talked about, the benefits that you're seeing from lower promo activity. Can you maybe just talk about some of the puts and takes from here as the yields are obviously going to be improving? And it seems like the funding tailwinds are sizable over the next couple of quarters. So if we had peaked out in the low to 40s, could we actually, potentially see the margin, somewhere in excess of that over the next few quarters?\nJohn Greene: Yes. So, we were mindful in terms of what we included here in the presentation as well as in terms of the comments. To provide, frankly, an additional insight in terms of what's happening to the funding mix, maturity profile, and the cost of our dead stack and what you can see there is based on the maturity profile, and the cost we're seeing versus online deposits, that there will be an opportunity to expand net interest margin. Now, that subject to a lot of different things, right, obviously, there's one piece, which is the health of the portfolio. And that's been strong. Certainly, the mix of revolvers and transactors will also have an impact and typically impacts the fourth quarter a bit. But, overall, as you look at where we are this quarter, I see some upside from that, from my advantage point today.\nRyan Nash: Got it. And maybe if I can ask a follow-up question from a topic that was hidden before. So John, I think in your prepared remarks, you commented that you're looking for additional efficiencies, maybe can you just help us understand and maybe Roger can hop in on this too, of the 90% of the $400 million that you've saved? How much of that was just investments that have been deferred versus actual core efficiencies that you guys have identified and taken out? And, what could this mean for the trajectory of the cost base outside of marketing as we look into 2021? Thanks.\nJohn Greene: Yes. So thanks. So I would characterize it this way is the $400 million of cost savings from the previous guidance. I wouldn't necessarily call that a deferral, what I would say is, we took a look at the economic environment and took $400 million for planned spending. Now, as I said in the March remarks, which you clearly picked up and Ryan was that the bulk of that has been on marketing and brand. Now as we look through the balance of this year, and some of the actions that we took, we saw benefits across the host of P&L line, expense line specifically. And we're going to use that frankly as a new benchmark in order to really make some determinations on what we need to spend in 2021 to ensure that we continue to grow profitably. I would say that if the economic environment continues to improve, it's natural that we're going to spend more money on customer acquisition in order to drive profitable growth into the future. But the other expense lines, professional fees, information processing other miscellaneous expense, we're going to keep a foot on those to ensure that we're disciplined about how we're spending the dollars.\nRyan Nash: Great. Thanks for the color.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Moshe Orenbuch of Credit Suisse.\nMoshe Orenbuch: Great, thanks. Most of my questions have been asked and answered. But I guess, I sort of I am struck by the fact that the efficiency ratio in the quarter was actually better than it was in 2019. And you're kind of demonstrating, certainly likely to be the best growth and spend volume and one of the better growths if not the best in receivables or smallest decline. And I guess I'm also struck by stuff we see in the industry, that there's continued more cash back mail from some of your big competitors were that wasn't as bigger focus. And so, kind of maybe, some of this has been discussed already. But I'm sort of struck by that, it seems like you have an opportunity. And, where does -- where can you direct that attention? And, how much do you have in kind of available whether it's spending on rewards or marketing, like, what are the tools? And how are you going to use them over the next few quarters, particularly now, as we're going into the holiday season? Thanks.\nRoger Hochschild: Yes, thanks Moshe. We're using all the tools we have available, I would point out there's still a good amount of economic uncertainty. And so we are not changing credit policy on the card side, I think we want to see more signs of sustained recovery. But the cash back program is resonating well as I said earlier. And there's always a lot of competition in cash rewards from major issuers. So I wouldn't necessarily characterize it as more intense than ever, but it is a time where consumers are rethinking which cards they want, do they really need another frequent flyer miles at this point. And then the other part is the only major issue with no fees on any of our card products, but knowing you'll see, message resonates surprisingly well. But then [indiscernible] we're seeing great strength on the other side of the balance sheet on the deposit side, where we compete the same way, right, good value, but an outstanding customer experience. So we're really excited. Certainly uncertainty as to what the holiday season will bring, as I talked to retailers out there. But I feel good about our ability to continue to gain share.\nMoshe Orenbuch: Thanks very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Barker of Piper Sandler.\nKevin Barker: Good morning. I just like to follow up on some of the NIM comments. You're seeing some a little bit more resiliency on the asset yields, in particular, from the personal loans and card rates. Could you talk about, the competitive environment in both those products and your expectations for those yields at least in the next couple of quarters, just given the resiliency that we've seen in the near-term?\nJohn Greene: Yes. So we look at the card yield, that will overall be relatively stable subject to kind of the mix of balance transfers and promos. And as I said earlier we're going to be mindful in terms of those sorts of decisions. If we can do that, do some promos or balance transfers safely in their credit environment we'll do that because it would be high returning by returning customers. But the leverage that we're going to get in future quarters will come out of the funding base.\nRoger Hochschild: Yes, and Kevin may one thing I'd add to. As we said pricing, given how hard it is to re-price card after the Court Act, we're not reacting to specific competitors in a given quarter. We're taking, working closely with finance a very disciplined through the cycle book and so it's really where our growth is occurring. And that promo mix, it'll drive it as opposed to reacting to competitors.\nKevin Barker: Yes, that'll make sense. And then regarding the liability side, the order of magnitude in the drop in liability costs over the last couple quarters are obviously very strong. Just given the rate environment, how much more room do you feel like you have to bring deposit costs lower, just given the current rate environment and the outside liquidity on your balance sheet?\nJohn Greene: Yes. So we continue to look at that. And the decision would be subject to two factors, one, the amount of liquidity we have on a balance sheet. And right now we're in a situation we have access to liquidity. And then the second piece of the equation is the competitive landscape. And then third, which is a consideration of the business is certainly the customer relationships and ensuring that our long-term good quality customers aren't feeling like they're impacted in a way that's unfair. Now, with all that said I'm seeing a persistent low rate environment. And with a persistent low rate environment, I do believe that there is some amount of room price downward. But again, it's caveated by all those points that I just mentioned.\nKevin Barker: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Robert Napoli of William Blair.\nRobert Napoli: Thank you and good morning. I just wondered what your built -- what you built into your reserves as far as the trajectory of charge-offs. And I would expect, I mean, I guess you're not really given where delinquencies are, you are not expecting to see charge-offs move up much in the fourth quarter and then more back half weighted to 2021?\nJohn Greene: Yes, so I would start off by saying that, the portfolio performance versus what we thought it potentially could be, when we close the book in March has been extraordinarily strong. And we're really, really pleased by that. In terms of trajectory of both delinquencies and charge-offs, yes, we are seeing certainly a push from \u201820 into \u201821. And the absolute quantum of that will obviously depend on all the factors that we built into our reserve calculation, GDP, unemployment, new jobless claims, stimulus, or lack thereof. So we will, we're going to monitor the portfolio, but to kind of net it for you and the other folks that are on the call, \u201820 looks super solid \u201821 level of uncertainty and we expect the bubble to push through into -- certainly, beginning maybe in the midpoint of the year into the second half of \u201821.\nRobert Napoli: Thank you. And then follow up with just jobless claims 787,000 this morning a big improvement that ridiculously high that's right. But yes, I mean, direct bank your position Roger is a direct bank. It gives and I think it's the right strategy for the long-term. Are there new products or services or then you're planning to build through that direct bank? And when we have, obviously a lot of these Neo banks that are delivering different products, and maybe to different demographic than discover focuses on but where do you see opportunities to leverage off of your direct bank strategy?\nRoger Hochschild: So in terms of positioning ourselves as the leading digital bank, I think we're in great shape. And it's leveraging the products we already have. I don't see the need for expanding our products. If you look at the breath from home equity to a broad range of deposit products, including checking our debit accounts or great strength of course on the card side, personal loans. So we have the products, I think the opportunity is building awareness of the products we have and that can drive a lot of growth. So I'm very excited about where we're positioned. I'd say maybe one of the big differences versus the Neo banks is perhaps a different focus around profitability. So we'll see how that plays out over the long-term, but I couldn't be more excited about where we're positioned.\nRobert Napoli: Thank you. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mihir Bhatia of Bank of America.\nMihir Bhatia: Good morning. Thank you for taking the question. [indiscernible] did I hear correctly, you said your [indiscernible] model the second round of stimulus in your modeling for credit?\nRoger Hochschild: Yes. Yes, we did. There's an input in our modeling, reflecting a second round of stimulus.\nMihir Bhatia: And then just one quick one on the -- if you can update on the network business, specifically, I was looking at -- it looks like your volumes are growing very nicely in both [pulse] and network performance. But yet, you attribute the revenue decline to both of those businesses. So I'm just wondering, what is happening there or is it just competitive factors is there a mix issue, just hoping to get a little more color on that? Thank you.\nRoger Hochschild: Yes. Thanks for the question. So it was actually a combination of two things. So there was a bit of a mix, shift to some products with lower fees and rates. There was also some higher incentives that came through based on the mix that we enjoyed in the quarter. I would say that in terms of overall volume it was up 16%, year-over-year at least for pulse. And certainly, we're happy about that, we are continuing to look at the mix and incentives to ensure we're driving appropriate level of profitability for the investments we're making there in the payments business.\nMihir Bhatia: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley.\nBetsy Graseck: Hi, good morning.\nRoger Hochschild: Good morning Betsy.\nJohn Greene: Good morning.\nBetsy Graseck: Couple questions, just first off on the outlook for growth. I know typically, it's a function of account growth and balances per account. And obviously, you've had some shrinkage recently, because of the spend levels that we all know about. I'm just wondering if we could dig into the account growth aspect of that equation, just understand how account growth has been going? What COVID has meant to account growth, how you flexed? And do you see any opportunity to accelerate account growth from here as we go into the back half of the year and into \u201821?\nRoger Hochschild: Yes, so just one thing on the receivables growth, the higher payment rate is a big factor as well. So good news on what it's doing on the deposit side of our business. But that is having a significant impact on loan growth for both card and personal loans. In terms of new accounts, while we don't disclose a number on that, what I would say is that we think we probably sustained to account marketing, more than a lot of competitors as I look at industry metrics. And so we feel good about that, and kept our marketing spend sort of appropriate for the environment and for our somewhat narrowed credit box with the changes we made earlier in the year. So I would not expect dramatic changes until we get more certainty in terms of the pace of recovery, but we continued to market across all of our products.\nBetsy Graseck: Okay. So you've been pleased with your account growth that you've generated over the past couple of quarters? That's what I'm hearing from you, Roger, is that right?\nRoger Hochschild: Yes. And in particular, I think we pulled out on the last goal, some of the costs per account that we were seeing in different channels as competitors pull back more.\nBetsy Graseck: Right. Okay, and then just separately on credit and the outlook for credit here. One of the questions is around stimulus. And if you don't get it, how much did that impact potential changes in the reserve. And then the other piece is on the mortgage forbearance, I think, I believe a majority of your customers have mortgages, and I'm wondering if you know through credit data checks, how many of those people are benefiting today from the mortgage forbearance and does that feed into your reserve analysis as well? Thanks.\nJohn Greene: Okay. Yes, so let's talk about the credit outlook and then handle the mortgage question on the back end. So in terms of the stimulus that we modeled, and it is one of many inputs, and we'll look at what happens in the fourth quarter and see how the roll rates are progressing in the portfolio through the quarter to get -- I'll say, a bottoms up view of actually, the impact there. So no specific information on that other than to say that underlying roll rates are far more positive than we thought they would be at this time. And if another round of stimulus doesn't come in, I think that's going to be tough for a number of people that have been impacted by the pandemic. And progressively it will start to impact the prime revolver base. And that's why we're conservative in terms of our reserve outlook here for the third quarter. But overall, again, we're pleased with our positioning. Now, in terms of the mortgage forbearance that we really don't have any data on that. What we are seeing is our home equity business continues to, it's open for business, we are underwriting standards that have tightened mildly through this and it's positioned pretty well and open for business.\nBetsy Graseck: Okay. Thanks, John. Appreciate the color.\nJohn Greene: You're welcome.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Meng Jiao of Deutsche Bank.\nMeng Jiao: Great. Good morning, thanks for taking my call. I wanted to take a look at a capital trend [indiscernible] invest and I know that you guys are in the midst of preparing the second stress of submission. But I was wondering, in terms of timing as to when you would get a better sense of the economy in order to possibly execute the buybacks one more time, is it in the back half of \u201821 into more into \u201822. Just any thoughts on when you guys feel you would have more clarity in terms of the economy in order to reinstate that buyback program? Thank you.\nJohn Greene: Great. Thanks for the question. So we're submitting our second round of stress tests in November. And including there are a number of judgments. I'm not going to get into the details would be premature on that. I would say, as you take a look at the capital trends for the business, they're super solid, our capital levels are higher than our targeted levels. And Roger was specific in terms of our cheering of capital allocation priorities. So there's no change to that. And we're going to work through kind of the details with the Fed, other regulators rating agency and then board. Sorry, I can't be more specific than that at this point.\nRoger Hochschild: Maria next question?\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mark DeVries of Barclays.\nMark DeVries: Yes, thanks. Just wanted to drill down a little bit further on the funding tailwinds. Could you give us a better sense of kind of what mix you're targeting between the DTC and affinity deposits and the broker? Is there a minimum level of broker that you want to maintain? And also kind of what's the funding difference between those two, just to give us a sense of how much your deposit funding on average could compress?\nJohn Greene: We want to keep the broker CD channel open. So we'll continue to attest that the relative change or difference between the direct to consumer and the broker deposits narrowed, narrowed significantly in the early stages of the pandemic, there was a substantial difference and the market took care of that and narrowed the gap. We do enjoyed slightly better pricing, if it's direct relationship versus through a broker so that -- what that will be our focus in terms of overall kind of mix of those, I would expect the broker channel to continue to contract a bit and the direct channels expand.\nMark DeVries: Okay. And in the, with such low funding on the ABS, why not maintain that or expand that or they are like, liquidity concerns of having assets on income or that you're managing to or is there something else I'm not thinking about?\nJohn Greene: No, the cost there on the ABS, that's reflected is net of the hedge impacts. So fortunately, we hedge those and have a nice benefit coming through over the next couple of years. The actual outside contract rate on those ABS transactions quite a bit higher than that. So that was -- frankly that was the rates we are enjoying, there's just good work on the part of our Treasury team to hedge that. So we'll continue to ensure that the ABS channel is there and present and available to us. But it will certainly come down as maturity profile indicates.\nMark DeVries: Okay, got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Dominick Gabriele of Oppenheimer.\nDominick Gabriele: Hey, good morning. Thanks so much for taking my question. I just wanted to see if we could kind of square this circle around unemployment and where the unemployment rate is and the kind of liquidity that the consumer has been given up and so this day, and it sounds like we've -- both agree that, delinquencies, probably given this liquidity don't even start rising until the first of the year. And so when you think about your expectation for unemployment at 11 by yearend, and where we are, and the idea of a white collar rush of unemployment, that would be quite the rush of white collar unemployment versus the amount of people that are unemployed now versus a steady state. And so can you just talked about where the -- perhaps the job losses come from, and why it's a large magnitude of white collar versus still unemployed call it blue collar that we saw now, and how that's influencing your outlook for the 11% unemployment rate? Thanks.\nJohn Greene: Yes. Thanks, Dominick. So you touched on a lot there. And I would sum that up by saying there's a level of uncertainty around what actually will happen on unemployment. Now, the 11% does feel at this point, like, I'll call it a robust number. But what we're trying to get a good clarity on it as the service workers who initially were impacted by the pandemic containment activity went to the unemployment ranks, some of those have returned, we certainly have seen some indications across the economy that across the nation and frankly the world that it could be a tough winter here from a COVID standpoint. So that's going to further impact not only service industry, but the entire economy. And so as we sit here today, we're mindful of that as a risk and continue to kind of maintain the reserves where they are. So we don't expect there to be a rush of white collar unemployment. But what will be clear and we've seen some of this already, is businesses are sizing both their professional staff and the blue collar staff for the business at hand. And there's enough indications today that there could be some contraction and as such the unemployment numbers not exactly an easy number to predict but we feel like as an input to our model, it is appropriate at this point.\nDominick Gabriele: Great, thank you. And if I could just have one follow-up here. I really appreciate that. And if you look at the other expenses in the expense base. It looks like the acceptance incentives came down as well as fraud even though we're kind of in this more online environment. Could you talk about what you're doing on the fraud side? And how that was -- and did you renegotiate in the global acceptance or is that a function of just volume and mix year-over-year versus the third quarter of \u201919 and how your expense base and other expense came down? Thanks so much. I really appreciate it.\nJohn Greene: Yes, so in terms of fraud, it doesn't reflect any, renegotiations with any of our merchant partners. Fraud is one of the areas where we're deploying advanced analytics, and next generation [technical difficulty]. Yes, and then I would just add, in terms of the other expense line, so. So we did see lower global acceptance, expense in the quarter. And that's a function of two things a little better on the economy and liability associated with some of our partners executing on kind of terms associated with previous incentive agreements. And then, frankly, just a level of uncertainty that's caused us to be cautious on I\u2019ll say signing up new rich incentive deals. Now we're still doing that, where it makes sense. But in terms of timing little bit cautious on that one. But we've seen, actually great effectiveness from our procurement team, driving year-over-year savings on the entire indirect cost base. And we're still, as we said, in the remark, investing in advanced analytics and some digital capabilities that driving up information processing, but my expectation is that we continue that we are and we will continue to get more efficient and overall information processing and technology spend.\nDominick Gabriele: Great. Thanks and congrats on the quarter.\nRoger Hochschild: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Bill Carcache of Wolfe Research .\nBill Carcache: Thank you. Quick follow up on the credit. There has been a lot of touch [indiscernible] around booming credit headwinds in the TDR portfolio, can you discuss how that [indiscernible]?\nJohn Greene: Yes, So thanks for the question, Bill. So you folks don't have the TDR disclosures but will come out or come out in the Q1 it's published. And what you'll see there is relative to the first quarter TDR volumes will be substantially down. But there's also the impact of the CARES Act with a regulatory exclusion for certain modifications that banks such as ours make. So we can put those two together and compare where we are in the third quarter versus where we were in the first quarter and called the first quarter of pre-pandemic relatively stable. So the point there is that there's not an abundance of activities or a massive jump in any sorts of activities there. That's impacting delinquencies. We do these programs to improve the cash flows of the company, and ensure that when there's a temporary issue with a customer, that they can manage through it and return to paying their bills. So from a credit standpoint, TDR standpoint, there's been good execution from our customer service teams.\nBill Carcache: Thanks John.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, that was our final question. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Craig Streem for any additional or closing remarks.\nCraig Streem: Thank you, Maria. Thanks, everybody, for your interest. Enjoyed the conversation this morning and we are available for any follow-up questions that you may have. Thanks have a good day.\nRoger Hochschild: Thank you everyone.\nOperator: Thank you ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thank you, Craig. And thanks to our listeners for joining today's call. In these uniquely challenging times, I'm pleased with Discover's results and how well our business model has performed. In the third quarter, we are in $771 million after tax or $2.45 per share. We clearly benefited from the actions we took in the first half of this year to protect employees, manage credit risk, and control costs while preserving momentum on long-term investments. While significant uncertainty remains as to the extent and timing of a recovery, we were pleased to see the return to year-over-year sales growth in September. Managing credit remains a top priority. We entered this recession from a strong credit position due to our traditionally conservative approach to underwriting as well as actions taken over the past few years to reduce our contingent liability and tighten credit at the margin. We quickly implemented changes to credit policy at the onset of the pandemic, including tightening criteria for new accounts in line increases and additional income verification. While we saw very strong credit performance this quarter, we expect to see deterioration in the coming quarters as the prime consumer may be impacted by increasing permanent white collar unemployment. That said, we believe we have taken the appropriate credit actions and don't see the need to make significant changes at this time. The improvements in sales volume continued during the quarter with a return to growth in the month of September. Sales have improved across all categories with particular strength in online retail, home improvement, and everyday spend categories partially offset by continued weakness in travel and entertainment spending. Loan growth continues to be affected by the pandemic, with total loans down 4% year-over-year, including card loans down 6% and personal loans down 5%. The drop in spending during the pandemic and our own credit tightening has impacted loan growth. But another driver has been a significantly higher payment rate in our card and personal loan portfolios. Consumers have had improved household cash flows due to reduced spending and government stimulus and have taken this opportunity to boost savings and make larger payments against their loans. In our student loan business, originations in the peak season were down year-over-year, reflecting the large number of students who chose not to enroll this fall. Even in this challenging environment, our organic student loans were up 7% reflecting innovative features like our multiyear loan and our strong competitive position. In terms of operating expenses we remain on track to deliver $400 million of cost reductions this year, while continuing to invest in core capabilities, such as advanced analytics to increase efficiency and drive long-term value. In conclusion, this quarter our business generated high returns as we remained focused on discipline credit management, profitable growth, and an industry leading customer experience supported by our 100% U.S. based customer service. The economic environment remains uncertain but our strong capital and liquidity and the actions we've taken to strengthen the business position allows us to continue to drive long-term value for our shareholders. I'd now ask John to discuss key aspects of our financial results in more detail. So I'll let John to cover the part about reserves Sanjay. But in terms of the environment, I think that the jobless claims numbers and we'll see what this week has but seven straight weeks over [800,000] and more and more of that permanent unemployment and white collar is a reason for ongoing concern. But I think as you look at our portfolio, I'm very pleased with the performance across all products. And you can see that from the broadest metric, we just close the 30-day delinquency rate. Yes, thanks, Rick. In terms of marketing, while we did cut expenses, in line with the economic environment, we have continued to market across all of our products, and have been very excited actually about the quality of new accounts we're bringing in on the card book, as well as some of the costs we're seeing as competitors pulled back more aggressively. Now, I do expect some of that to normalize over time. But again, we're going to continue marketing through the fourth quarter. In terms of the rewards program, so our program is well suited to this environment. Consumers prefer cash over miles. I think a lot of the miles programs I see in the marketplace are struggling to add relevance and redemption options. And in particular, our strong partnerships with PayPal and Amazon, some of the programs we're already putting in market with Amazon will serve us well in the fourth quarter. Yes. I think we are leveraging that position of strength. I believe we're gaining share both in terms of sales and loans and card and had a very strong peak season for student loans. Acquisitions are a little more challenging. And so as we think about how we use capital, the top priority is supporting organic growth. Next comes a mix of dividends and buybacks. Acquisitions tend to be a distant third, our primary interest is in the payment space. But while valuations have come in a bit, especially where cross border type of company, they're still very high. And so a lot of what we're seeing opportunities for either investments, partnerships, so we'll look at it, but I think we're probably more likely to be aggressive on the organic side, subject to our conservative credit policy than making acquisitions. Yes, thanks, Bill. So first, having been here for over 20 years, I have to maybe disagree with the phrase chronic underinvestment, I think our investments have been appropriate. But at the beginning of the year, we saw an opportunity to invest more. And so I would characterize it that way. Clearly, the year changed dramatically. And hopefully, you've seen very strong expense discipline in terms of the target we put out there and how well we're progressing against that target. It's a little challenging just to look at operating leverage, because that includes well of course day-to-day corporate type expenses that we're always trying to bring down. But then also marketing investments that drive profitable growth and high returning accounts. And so it's a blend of those two. But again, I think you can expect to see the continued expense discipline that I think has always been a hallmark here to discover our overall lower cost operating model. But we will invest according to the opportunities we see in the marketplace. And I guess I'd point you to the returns we're generating as an example of the effectiveness of that business model even through extremely challenging cycles. Good morning. Yes, thanks Moshe. We're using all the tools we have available, I would point out there's still a good amount of economic uncertainty. And so we are not changing credit policy on the card side, I think we want to see more signs of sustained recovery. But the cash back program is resonating well as I said earlier. And there's always a lot of competition in cash rewards from major issuers. So I wouldn't necessarily characterize it as more intense than ever, but it is a time where consumers are rethinking which cards they want, do they really need another frequent flyer miles at this point. And then the other part is the only major issue with no fees on any of our card products, but knowing you'll see, message resonates surprisingly well. But then [indiscernible] we're seeing great strength on the other side of the balance sheet on the deposit side, where we compete the same way, right, good value, but an outstanding customer experience. So we're really excited. Certainly uncertainty as to what the holiday season will bring, as I talked to retailers out there. But I feel good about our ability to continue to gain share. Yes, and Kevin may one thing I'd add to. As we said pricing, given how hard it is to re-price card after the Court Act, we're not reacting to specific competitors in a given quarter. We're taking, working closely with finance a very disciplined through the cycle book and so it's really where our growth is occurring. And that promo mix, it'll drive it as opposed to reacting to competitors. So in terms of positioning ourselves as the leading digital bank, I think we're in great shape. And it's leveraging the products we already have. I don't see the need for expanding our products. If you look at the breath from home equity to a broad range of deposit products, including checking our debit accounts or great strength of course on the card side, personal loans. So we have the products, I think the opportunity is building awareness of the products we have and that can drive a lot of growth. So I'm very excited about where we're positioned. I'd say maybe one of the big differences versus the Neo banks is perhaps a different focus around profitability. So we'll see how that plays out over the long-term, but I couldn't be more excited about where we're positioned. Yes. Yes, we did. There's an input in our modeling, reflecting a second round of stimulus. Yes. Thanks for the question. So it was actually a combination of two things. So there was a bit of a mix, shift to some products with lower fees and rates. There was also some higher incentives that came through based on the mix that we enjoyed in the quarter. I would say that in terms of overall volume it was up 16%, year-over-year at least for pulse. And certainly, we're happy about that, we are continuing to look at the mix and incentives to ensure we're driving appropriate level of profitability for the investments we're making there in the payments business. Good morning Betsy. Yes, so just one thing on the receivables growth, the higher payment rate is a big factor as well. So good news on what it's doing on the deposit side of our business. But that is having a significant impact on loan growth for both card and personal loans. In terms of new accounts, while we don't disclose a number on that, what I would say is that we think we probably sustained to account marketing, more than a lot of competitors as I look at industry metrics. And so we feel good about that, and kept our marketing spend sort of appropriate for the environment and for our somewhat narrowed credit box with the changes we made earlier in the year. So I would not expect dramatic changes until we get more certainty in terms of the pace of recovery, but we continued to market across all of our products. Yes. And in particular, I think we pulled out on the last goal, some of the costs per account that we were seeing in different channels as competitors pull back more. Maria next question? Thank you. Thank you everyone."

            "name": "John Greene",
            "content": "Thank you, Roger. And good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. I'll walk through our results, starting on Slide 4. We earned $2.45 per share driven by solid credit performance of our portfolio and significantly lower operating expenses. While total revenue was down from last year reflecting the slowdown in the economy, sales volume turned positive in September and net interest margin expanded nicely. Net interest income was down 6%, as the impact of lower market rates was partially offset by lower funding cost. In addition, average receivables were down 3% contributing to the decline in net interest income. Non-interest income was down 10% driven by lower fee income, reflecting fewer late fee incidences and the impact of lower overall spending on cash advance fees. The decrease in net discount and interchange revenue was driven by sales volume in the quarter. The provision for credit loss is improved by nearly $50 million from the prior year as a result of a decline in net charge-offs in a lower reserve build. Operating expenses were down 9% year-over-year driven by marketing expenses and professional fees. Turning to loan growth on Slide 5, total loans were down 4% from the prior year driven by a 6% decrease in card receivables. Lower card receivables were driven by three factors, a higher payment rate as customers continue to be mindful of their debt obligations. A decline in promotional balances as a result of credit tightening, which will benefit net interest margin going forward. And third, lower sales volume. In the quarter sales were down just 1% on a year-over-year basis. Sales returned to growth in September up 4% year-over-year, with improvement in all categories, grocery, retail and home improvement were very strong. The trend continued through the first half of October with sales up 7%. In our other lending products, organic student loans increased 7% from the prior year and personal loans decreased 5%. Moving to Slide 6, our net interest margin bottomed out in the second quarter and improved 38 basis points to 10.19% in the current quarter, relative to the second quarter NIM increased primarily due to favorable consumer deposit pricing. Since June 30, we have decreased our online savings rate 41 basis points down to [0.60%]. Approximately two-thirds of our consumer deposits are indeterminate maturity accounts, primarily savings, which has provided an immediate benefit from deposit rates decreases. Average consumer deposits were up 22% year-over-year, and up $2.7 billion from the second quarter. Looking at Slide 7, you can see how our funding mix has changed overtime. We're also providing details on our funding maturities and corresponding rates over the next couple of years. Given our current excess liquidity position, we expect to issue very little wholesale debt in the near-term. The majority of our new deposits have been in online savings. And we would expect this trend to continue in the current low rate environment. As we move towards our target at 70% to 80% of funding from consumer deposits, we expect to see continued benefits to net interest margin. Turning to Slide 8, total operating expenses were down $102 million or 9% in the prior year. Marketing and business development expense was down $90 million or 39%. The bulk of the reduction was in brand marketing and card acquisition. Professional fees decreased $38 million or 20% mainly driven by lower third-party recovering fees related to foreclosure, as well as favorable vendor pricing adjustments. Employee compensation was up $32 million or 7% driven by staffing increases mainly in technology, as well as higher average salaries and benefit costs. To date, we've realized approximately 90% of the targeted $400 million of expense reductions we discussed over the past two quarters. We are on track to deliver the remaining 10% in the fourth quarter and continue to review the business for efficiency opportunities. Turning now to Slide 9 showing credit metrics. Credit performance remained very strong in third quarter. Cards net charge-offs dollars actually came down $7 million, while the rate increased 13 basis points Sequentially, the card net charge-off rate improved 45 basis points. The 30 plus delinquency rate improved 59 basis points from last year and 26 basis points from the prior quarter as credit performance of our card portfolio continued to be stable, demonstrating the strength of our prime revolver customer base. Our private student loan portfolio had another quarter of strong credit performance with net charge-offs down 1 basis points compared to the prior year. Excluding purchase loans, the 30 plus delinquency rate improved 37 basis points from the prior year and 8 basis points sequentially. Credit performance in our personal loan portfolio continued to be very strong this quarter, reflecting our disciplined underwriting and the benefit of credit actions implemented over the past several years. Net charge-offs improved 130 basis points and the 30 plus delinquency rate was down 39 basis points from the prior year. While overall credit performance remained strong through the third quarter, we expect the economic environment to lead to deterioration and consumer credit, with delinquencies slightly increasing in 2021. The timing of the rise in delinquency and subsequent losses could be impacted if there is a second government stimulus program or economic trends shift materially. Slide 10 shows our allowance for credit losses. In the quarter we added $42 million to the allowance driven by a $354 million increase in organic student loans. Other loan products were generally flat from the prior quarter. With the backdrop of an uncertain by improving macroeconomic environment, we modeled several different scenarios and maintained a conservative view in the quarter. Our key macro assumptions were an unemployment rate of 11% at the end of 2020 and slowly recovering over the next several years. We also considered the current trends in unemployment and the increasing number of COVID cases. Moving to Slide 11, our Common Equity Tier 1 ratio increased 50 basis points sequentially, primarily due to the decline in loan balance. In March, we suspended our share buyback program in response to the economic environment at that time and it remained suspended. We have continued to fund our quarterly dividend at $0.44 per share. We are in the process of preparing our second stress test submission and will determine our share repurchase and dividend actions subjected to the final stress capital buffer, regulatory and rating agency expectations and Board approval. In summary, solid results in the third quarter. The portfolio remained stable with improvements in overall delinquency levels. Reserves are flat except for those pertaining to student loans where the balance and commitment levels increased. Net interest margins improved from the second quarter and is trending positively as a result of our aggressive deposit pricing. And finally, strong execution on our targeted expense reductions. With that, I'll turn the call back to her operator Maria to open up the lines for Q&A. Yes, and Sanjay, in terms of reserving, we modeled a number of different assumptions and took conservative approach across the board. What we saw was actually, as Roger said, excellent underlying portfolio performance. There is, there is a level of concern in terms of jobless claims and the impact on prime consumers. But today, we don't see anything that -- that's out there that would suggest that reserves are -- I'll say weak or deep strengthening at this point. We did model a second round of stimulus. We don't know if that's going to happen. There's some reason to be optimistic, but no one can tell that on this sorts of things these days. So we'll say, but what we'll look at through the quarter, the fourth quarter, and make a call in terms of what's appropriate from a GAAP standpoint. Yes, it's come down recently. We've been intentional about that in terms of taking a look at promo balances as well as balance transfers. So... Yes, it's, right around 15 or so. Good morning. Yes. So, we were mindful in terms of what we included here in the presentation as well as in terms of the comments. To provide, frankly, an additional insight in terms of what's happening to the funding mix, maturity profile, and the cost of our dead stack and what you can see there is based on the maturity profile, and the cost we're seeing versus online deposits, that there will be an opportunity to expand net interest margin. Now, that subject to a lot of different things, right, obviously, there's one piece, which is the health of the portfolio. And that's been strong. Certainly, the mix of revolvers and transactors will also have an impact and typically impacts the fourth quarter a bit. But, overall, as you look at where we are this quarter, I see some upside from that, from my advantage point today. Yes. So thanks. So I would characterize it this way is the $400 million of cost savings from the previous guidance. I wouldn't necessarily call that a deferral, what I would say is, we took a look at the economic environment and took $400 million for planned spending. Now, as I said in the March remarks, which you clearly picked up and Ryan was that the bulk of that has been on marketing and brand. Now as we look through the balance of this year, and some of the actions that we took, we saw benefits across the host of P&L line, expense line specifically. And we're going to use that frankly as a new benchmark in order to really make some determinations on what we need to spend in 2021 to ensure that we continue to grow profitably. I would say that if the economic environment continues to improve, it's natural that we're going to spend more money on customer acquisition in order to drive profitable growth into the future. But the other expense lines, professional fees, information processing other miscellaneous expense, we're going to keep a foot on those to ensure that we're disciplined about how we're spending the dollars. Yes. So we look at the card yield, that will overall be relatively stable subject to kind of the mix of balance transfers and promos. And as I said earlier we're going to be mindful in terms of those sorts of decisions. If we can do that, do some promos or balance transfers safely in their credit environment we'll do that because it would be high returning by returning customers. But the leverage that we're going to get in future quarters will come out of the funding base. Yes. So we continue to look at that. And the decision would be subject to two factors, one, the amount of liquidity we have on a balance sheet. And right now we're in a situation we have access to liquidity. And then the second piece of the equation is the competitive landscape. And then third, which is a consideration of the business is certainly the customer relationships and ensuring that our long-term good quality customers aren't feeling like they're impacted in a way that's unfair. Now, with all that said I'm seeing a persistent low rate environment. And with a persistent low rate environment, I do believe that there is some amount of room price downward. But again, it's caveated by all those points that I just mentioned. Yes, so I would start off by saying that, the portfolio performance versus what we thought it potentially could be, when we close the book in March has been extraordinarily strong. And we're really, really pleased by that. In terms of trajectory of both delinquencies and charge-offs, yes, we are seeing certainly a push from \u201820 into \u201821. And the absolute quantum of that will obviously depend on all the factors that we built into our reserve calculation, GDP, unemployment, new jobless claims, stimulus, or lack thereof. So we will, we're going to monitor the portfolio, but to kind of net it for you and the other folks that are on the call, \u201820 looks super solid \u201821 level of uncertainty and we expect the bubble to push through into -- certainly, beginning maybe in the midpoint of the year into the second half of \u201821. Good morning. Okay. Yes, so let's talk about the credit outlook and then handle the mortgage question on the back end. So in terms of the stimulus that we modeled, and it is one of many inputs, and we'll look at what happens in the fourth quarter and see how the roll rates are progressing in the portfolio through the quarter to get -- I'll say, a bottoms up view of actually, the impact there. So no specific information on that other than to say that underlying roll rates are far more positive than we thought they would be at this time. And if another round of stimulus doesn't come in, I think that's going to be tough for a number of people that have been impacted by the pandemic. And progressively it will start to impact the prime revolver base. And that's why we're conservative in terms of our reserve outlook here for the third quarter. But overall, again, we're pleased with our positioning. Now, in terms of the mortgage forbearance that we really don't have any data on that. What we are seeing is our home equity business continues to, it's open for business, we are underwriting standards that have tightened mildly through this and it's positioned pretty well and open for business. You're welcome. Great. Thanks for the question. So we're submitting our second round of stress tests in November. And including there are a number of judgments. I'm not going to get into the details would be premature on that. I would say, as you take a look at the capital trends for the business, they're super solid, our capital levels are higher than our targeted levels. And Roger was specific in terms of our cheering of capital allocation priorities. So there's no change to that. And we're going to work through kind of the details with the Fed, other regulators rating agency and then board. Sorry, I can't be more specific than that at this point. We want to keep the broker CD channel open. So we'll continue to attest that the relative change or difference between the direct to consumer and the broker deposits narrowed, narrowed significantly in the early stages of the pandemic, there was a substantial difference and the market took care of that and narrowed the gap. We do enjoyed slightly better pricing, if it's direct relationship versus through a broker so that -- what that will be our focus in terms of overall kind of mix of those, I would expect the broker channel to continue to contract a bit and the direct channels expand. No, the cost there on the ABS, that's reflected is net of the hedge impacts. So fortunately, we hedge those and have a nice benefit coming through over the next couple of years. The actual outside contract rate on those ABS transactions quite a bit higher than that. So that was -- frankly that was the rates we are enjoying, there's just good work on the part of our Treasury team to hedge that. So we'll continue to ensure that the ABS channel is there and present and available to us. But it will certainly come down as maturity profile indicates. Yes. Thanks, Dominick. So you touched on a lot there. And I would sum that up by saying there's a level of uncertainty around what actually will happen on unemployment. Now, the 11% does feel at this point, like, I'll call it a robust number. But what we're trying to get a good clarity on it as the service workers who initially were impacted by the pandemic containment activity went to the unemployment ranks, some of those have returned, we certainly have seen some indications across the economy that across the nation and frankly the world that it could be a tough winter here from a COVID standpoint. So that's going to further impact not only service industry, but the entire economy. And so as we sit here today, we're mindful of that as a risk and continue to kind of maintain the reserves where they are. So we don't expect there to be a rush of white collar unemployment. But what will be clear and we've seen some of this already, is businesses are sizing both their professional staff and the blue collar staff for the business at hand. And there's enough indications today that there could be some contraction and as such the unemployment numbers not exactly an easy number to predict but we feel like as an input to our model, it is appropriate at this point. Yes, so in terms of fraud, it doesn't reflect any, renegotiations with any of our merchant partners. Fraud is one of the areas where we're deploying advanced analytics, and next generation [technical difficulty]. Yes, and then I would just add, in terms of the other expense line, so. So we did see lower global acceptance, expense in the quarter. And that's a function of two things a little better on the economy and liability associated with some of our partners executing on kind of terms associated with previous incentive agreements. And then, frankly, just a level of uncertainty that's caused us to be cautious on I'll say signing up new rich incentive deals. Now we're still doing that, where it makes sense. But in terms of timing little bit cautious on that one. But we've seen, actually great effectiveness from our procurement team, driving year-over-year savings on the entire indirect cost base. And we're still, as we said, in the remark, investing in advanced analytics and some digital capabilities that driving up information processing, but my expectation is that we continue that we are and we will continue to get more efficient and overall information processing and technology spend. Yes, So thanks for the question, Bill. So you folks don't have the TDR disclosures but will come out or come out in the Q1 it's published. And what you'll see there is relative to the first quarter TDR volumes will be substantially down. But there's also the impact of the CARES Act with a regulatory exclusion for certain modifications that banks such as ours make. So we can put those two together and compare where we are in the third quarter versus where we were in the first quarter and called the first quarter of pre-pandemic relatively stable. So the point there is that there's not an abundance of activities or a massive jump in any sorts of activities there. That's impacting delinquencies. We do these programs to improve the cash flows of the company, and ensure that when there's a temporary issue with a customer, that they can manage through it and return to paying their bills. So from a credit standpoint, TDR standpoint, there's been good execution from our customer service teams."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Second Quarter 2020 Discover Financial Services Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I will now like to turn the call over to Mr. Craig Streem, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nCraig Streem: Christ, thank you very much. And welcome, everybody, to our call this morning. We will begin on Slide 2 of the earnings presentation, which you can find in the Financials section of our Investor Relations website, investorrelations.discover.com. Our discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. Please refer to our notices regarding forward-looking statements that appear in today's earnings press release and the presentation. Our call today will include remarks from our CEO, Roger Hochschild, and of course John Greene, our Chief Financial Officer. And after we conclude our formal comments, there will be time for Q&A Session. And we ask you please, to limit yourself to one question, and if you have a follow-up we'd like you to queue back in towards the end and we'll try to accommodate as many participants as we can. And now it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Roger.\nRoger Hochschild: Thanks Craig. And thanks to our listeners for joining today's call. On last quarter's call, we discussed the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our employees, customers, and business. While I am pleased with our execution in the second quarter, we remain in a very challenging environment with considerable uncertainty as our country continues to struggle to stop the spread of COVID-19 and the impact on our economy remains very significant. Of course, the safety of our employees continues to be a top priority. All areas of the firm, including our hundred percent U.S.-based customer service team are operating effectively in a remote environment. And we have informed employees they will not be required to return to our physical locations until after January 1, 2021 at the earliest. Our operating model supports our commitment to providing flexible work arrangements as long as necessary to ensure the safety of our staff and their families. For our customers we continue to provide an industry-leading service experience, leveraging our digital capabilities and with average answer times in our call centers remaining at pre-pandemic levels of under one minute. Our products are well positioned as consumers increasingly look for value in these challenging times. We are the only major bank with no annual fees on any of our credit cards and no fees on any of our deposit products. Our leadership position in cash rewards and flexible redemption options, including point-of-sale with Amazon and PayPal are serving us well as consumers are increasingly shopping online and concerns over the safety of travel are limiting the appeal of airline miles. We have continued to support impacted customers with our Skip-a-Pay programs. Since we launched this program in mid-March we have helped over 662,000 customers across all of our products. And in fact, about 60% of total loans enrolled have already exited the program. The Skip-a-Pay program was intended to be a short term option, and we plan to end program enrollments in August. After that, we'll continue to offer assistance to those who qualify on a customer-by-customer basis. Now to our results for the quarter. We generated a net loss of $368 million or $1.20 per share. The most significant driver of this was a $1.3 billion reserve build in recognition of further deterioration in the macro economic outlook, subsequent to March 31. The credit performance in our portfolio has been stable, and we believe that the actions we've taken over the past few years, including reducing our contingent liability and the additional credit actions we implemented in March position us well. Nevertheless, the reserve build reflects our view that persistent, long-term unemployment will increasingly impact prime consumer lending portfolios. The pandemic continued to have a significant impact on sales volume, as well as loan growth through the quarter. We saw sales down 16% and 3% lower car loans, while down year-over-year, both compared favorably versus other issuers, principally due to our greater concentration in every day and online spend categories, as opposed to T&E. Operating expenses of $1.1 billion were flat to the prior year and included a $59 million onetime impairment charge to our Diners business, related to the impacts of the slowdown in global teeny spending. Excluding this operating expenses were down 6% year-over-year. We remain on track to deliver the $400 million of expense reductions we previously announced, even as we continue to invest in core capabilities, including analytics and data science. We expect these investments to strengthen our ability to achieve profitable growth and shareholder value to improve targeting and personalization, better underwriting decisions and enhanced collection strategies, just to name a few of the benefits. We're also responding to shifts in consumer preferences with our investments in contactless and secure remote commerce. Since the end of 2019, we have seen a 70% increase in contactless spending. I'm pleased to say we are on track to have most of our top 200 merchants enabled for contactless in 2020 and to have contactless cards issued to the majority of our card members by the end of the year. Consumers have also shifted to much more online spending, which makes our investments in secure remote commerce and our partnership with the other major networks to implement Click to Pay even more significant. Our disciplined approach to capital management and liquidity remains a top priority for us, particularly in the current environment. We have continued to see very strong demand for our consumer deposit products even as we have been reducing rates. Consumer deposits are now nearly 60% of total funding, and we have reduced our online savings rate 59 basis points since early March. Discover has a very strong financial foundation, loyal customers and a proven business model. I am confident that we have taken the correct actions to strengthen the Discover franchise and we are well prepared to continue to drive long-term value to our shareholders and customers. I'll now ask John to discuss key aspects of our financial results in more detail.\nJohn Greene: Thank you, Roger. And good morning, everyone. Taking a look at the quarter, we're pleased with our response to the rapidly shifting economic environment, including taking appropriate actions to manage expense, capital, credit and liquidity. Our capital position combined with advances in analytics and credit risk management put us in great shape to return to profitable growth when conditions are right. Today, a recap of the financial results for the quarter and provide details on our credit performance and loan provisions. Similar to last quarter, I won't review our standard slides on low growth, payment volumes, or revenue and expense, but you can find our traditional disclosures on slides, 11 to 16 in the appendix to this presentation. On Slide 4, looking at key elements of the income statement, revenue, net of interest expense decreased 7% in the second quarter, primarily driven by lower net interest income due to NIM compression and lower net discount and interchange revenue reflecting decreased sales volume. Net interest margin was 9.81% for the quarter, down 66 basis points from the prior year. This was driven by three factors. Average loans were flat year-over-year, reflecting the lower sales volume. Loan yields declined as the average prime rate was 225 basis points lower on a year-over-year basis due to Fed rate cuts in 2019 and a 150 basis points cut in March this year. These were partially offset by lower funding costs. We moved aggressively to reduce our deposit rates. Gross discount and interchange revenue decreased 18%, driven by the decline in sales volume. This was partially offset by a 16% decrease in rewards costs. Other income was up due to a $44 million gain on sale of an equity investment. The provision for credit losses was $2 billion and included net charge offs of $767 million, which were up 7% from last year and a $1.3 billion increase in reserves, primarily due to further deterioration in the economic outlook. I'll provide additional comments on credit with the next slide. Operating expenses were flat to the prior year, but down 6% excluding a one-time item. Marketing and business development expense was 42% lower year-over-year as we responded to the significant slowdown in the U.S. economy. The majority of the expense reduction was in brand marketing and card acquisition costs as we align marketing spend with the impacts of the economic environment and tightened credit criteria. Offsetting this in our Diners Club International business we booked a $59 million non-cash intangible asset impairment charge as a result of the slowdown and cross border travel and entertainment spending. Apart from the one-time impairment charge, we anticipate realizing $400 million of expense reductions from our previous guidance range. We made good progress on the expense front in the second quarter, and we'll continue this momentum through the balance of the year. As the economic environment evolves, we'll continue to monitor and take actions on expenses as conditions warrant. Turning now to Slide 5, showing credit metrics. Credit performance remained stable in the quarter. Card charge-offs increased 41 basis points from the prior year mainly due to seasoning of loan growth. The credit card 30 plus delinquency rate was down 17 basis points from last year and down 45 basis points from the prior quarter. The lower delinquency rate reflects the overall stability of the card portfolio with a very modest impact from the Skip-a-Pay program. Our private student loan portfolio reported strong credit metrics in the quarter with net charge-off nearly flat to the prior year. The 30 plus delinquency rate went down 25 basis points from the prior year and 18 basis points lower than the prior quarter. Credit performance in this product continues to benefit from tight underwriting and a high percentage of co-signed loans. Personal loan net charge-offs decreased 90 basis points year-over-year. The 30 plus delinquency rate was 42 basis points lower than the prior year and down 24 basis points from the prior quarter. These credit metrics benefit from disciplined underwriting and our strong customer service and collection efforts. While the overall portfolio performance has been stable through the second quarter, we do expect to see some deterioration in consumer credit in coming quarters. Moving to Slide 6, which shows our allowance for credit losses. In the quarter, we added $1.3 billion to be allowance primarily due to further deterioration in the macro economic outlook. As we considered the level of allowances needed, we modeled several different scenarios. This scenario to which we gave the greatest weight included a sharp increase in peak unemployment to a rate of 16% recovering to 11% at the end of 2020, followed by a slow recovery over the next few years. We assumed an annualized real GDP decline of 30% quarter-over-quarter or down 10% on a year-over-year basis. The quarterly reserve calculation also included an overlay which considers the impact of the Skip-a-Pay program leveraging our previous experience with disaster relief. We also considered unemployment reports in June and July, which showed higher permanent unemployment and the impact of recent increases in COVID-19 cases. Turning to Slide 7, which detailed sales trends by category through mid-July. Total card sales volume decreased 16% in the second quarter. The greatest weekly decline was in mid-April when total sales were down 33% for the week ending April 18, since then we've seen steady improvement across almost every category as the economy reopened. Sales were down just 3% through the first half of July. Since then we have seen steady improvement across almost every category as the economy reopened. We continue to see positive trends in retail, which were up 7% in the second quarter and 15% in the first half of July. Within the retail category, home improvements has been exceptionally strong up 19% in the quarter on high consumer demand. We also benefited from adding Home Depot to our 5% rewards category. Strong online spending growth also contributed to solid retail sales in the quarter. Travel, restaurants and gas continue to be the most negatively impacted categories. Slide 8 highlights enrollment trends in our Skip-a-Pay program which offers relief to customers experiencing financial stress due to the pandemic. We saw the peak in the cards program during the first week of April at $673 million. First time enrollments have steadily decreased since then. In the week of July 12, enrollment's decreased to just $35 million. To date, we enrolled a total of $3.4 billion in card loans. However, the majority of customers needed only one month of assistance and as of July 13, over 70% of card loans were no longer enrolled. Off those, out of the program approximately 80% have returned to making payments. Moving to Slide 9. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio increased 40 basis points sequentially, mainly due to decline in loan balances. In March, we suspended our share buyback program in response to the economic environment at the time and it remained suspended to-date. We've continued to fund our quarterly dividend at $0.44 per share of common stock in line with requirements provided by our regulators and approved by our Board of Directors. Our preliminary stress capital buffer was set at 3.5% with the final SCB expected towards the end of the third quarter. We will determine our share repurchase and dividend actions subject to the final stress capital buffer, any other regulatory limitations and board approval. Our liquidity portfolio remains strong with $27 billion in liquid assets and has increased over $7 billion from March 31. Since the onset of the pandemic, we have been a leader in reducing rates on our consumer deposit products. Nevertheless, we've continued to see strong demand with average consumer deposits increasing 22% year-over-year and now making up 60% of total funding. We'll continue to look for opportunities to reduce deposit costs. To summarize the quarter we're pleased with our results, given the extremely challenging environment. We took swift action on expenses and are continuing to invest in core capabilities, so we're prepared for the recovery when it comes. Outside of a one-time item, operating expenses were down as we started to benefit from our expense reduction programs. Credit performance remained stable, but some deterioration is expected in the coming quarters. We took a conservative reserving approach and added $1.3 billion to the allowance for credit losses, and finally capital and liquidity both remained strong. While we remain conservative given the continued level of economic uncertainty, we feel good about the actions we've taken to date and the strength of the Discover franchise. Before we open up the call for Q&A, I wanted to announce that after a career in consumer finance, including many years at Discover, Craig Streem has informed us of his desire to retire. I am sure most, if not all of you have interacted with Craig over that time and enjoyed a great relationship with him. He has been an important partner to Roger, our leadership team and for me. He has been a wonderful team member and a terrific help with my transition into the company. Craig is going to continue to lead the IR Team until his successor has been named and is in place. So you will have plenty of opportunity to wish him well, as we all do. That concludes our formal remarks. So I'll turn the call back to our operator to open up the lines for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Thank you. Good morning. I'm glad you guys are doing well and congratulations, Craig. I guess my questions on the reserve build. I'm curious if you feel like with this reserve build that you're pretty much done provided there's no significant change to the macro outlook. And then I know John, you mentioned the forbearance or the Skip-a-Pay has positively impacted delinquencies by a modest amount. But maybe you could just talk about what will drive the impacts that you are expecting in the next few quarters in credit quality? Thanks.\nRoger Hochschild: Hey, Sanjay its Roger. I'll cover the first part and then pass it to John. So in the reserve we \u2013 I think took a conservative approach and use the \u2013 an economic outlook that was considerably worse than the end of Q1. Under CECL, as you know, right that is reserved for the life of loan for the loans we have on our balance sheet. And so further reserve increases would mean that we add further deterioration in the economic environment or would be based on the growth of the balance sheet as we look ahead. And I'll pass it to John for the second one.\nJohn Greene: Yes. So Sanjay, just to echo those comments, we feel very good about the overall reserve and the conservative approach we took especially given when you look at the overall portfolio performance that we've seen today and actions we've taken backs as far as 2017 on the personal loans business. So overall we feel very comfortable with our reserve today. And as the economic conditions unfold, that'll have an impact either plus or minus on the overall reserve. The forbearance programs have acted exactly as we had hoped. They've helped some customers managed through the pandemic and as I said in my prepared remarks, most \u2013 the high majority of the people who entered the card program have exited and are repaying. So a very, very mild impact to delinquency reporting as well.\nSanjay Sakhrani: I'm just curious, is there a specific number in terms of the amount of benefit from the forbearance impact?\nJohn Greene: Yes. So it's actually relatively small and the delinquency numbers somewhere between 5 basis points and 10 basis points.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Okay. Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Bob Napoli with William Blair.\nBob Napoli: Thank you, and good morning. Craig, it's been a long time. Congratulations and I hope you have some great plans. We\u2019ve been talking for long time?\nCraig Streem: Thanks Bob. Yes. Thank you.\nBob Napoli: Roger, so you've been with Discover a long-time. You've seen a lot of recession's and changes. I just wanted \u2013 I was hoping you could give some thoughts on what you see are going to be a permanent changes to the industry. And maybe just, I mean, if he could get John, since you could give us some color on how much of your spend today is online and what it was prior to the pandemic?\nRoger Hochschild: Sure. So I was going to say in my 20 plus years at Discover, I've seen a lot of things, but I've never seen anything like this in terms of this speed and magnitude of the impact the pandemic has had on the economy. I don't think any of us in business has seen this. Nevertheless, I feel like we were very, very well positioned for this going in, and I think over the long-term what you've seen is really an acceleration of some trends that were already there. So the migration out of branch to digital channels, which again as always been part of our business mode. Consumers shifting from physical to digital purchases and there I think our advantage of having our proprietary network and the work we're doing with other major networks on SRC will be helpful. For a physical purchases, the shift to contact less, so those are really some trends that have been there, but have accelerated in a very significant way as a result of the COVID pandemic.\nJohn Greene: And Bob, in terms of the sales trends, we haven't \u2013 we haven't broken it down out between brick-and-mortar and online. But what I \u2013 what I can point you to is retail in my prepared comments in terms of the growth we've seen there, a lion's share of that has been as a result of online retailers and you know the major players there, which is driving I\u2019ll say further demise of the brick-and-mortar retailers and accelerating the digital channel for card. Things that Discover offers in terms of the network and our secure remote commerce that we're working on, all those will position us well for that growing trend.\nBob Napoli: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo.\nDon Fandetti: Hi, good morning. Kind of a short-term question, and if you could talk a little bit about the NIM outlook in the near-term? And then Roger, longer-term coming out of the credit crisis if I recall you guys came out and took share, and we're positioned pretty well. I know we're in the midst of this, but how are you thinking about the other side of this \u2013 the consumer is going to have a fair amount of savings. And do you look at these types of opportunities as market share gain, or is that too premature to be thinking about that?\nJohn Greene: Okay. So when I start with NIM question? So in the first quarter, our NIM was 10.21%, and then in the second quarter it came down to 9.81%. I'm not going to give a bunch of detail here, but what I can say is, we look at the second quarter as likely the trough on NIM overall. What we've been able to do is execute pretty well in terms of deposit pricing and our funding stack has meant such that more expensive funding sources are fading away, and we're getting a benefit there. So since the pandemic, just to give you some details we decreased our online savings by about 60 basis points. That's an immediate benefit to net interest margin in the company. And then through the balance of the year, we're going to continue to look for opportunities. So some of that will be based on the funding of our balance sheet, and some of it will be based on the competitive environment that we're dealing with.\nRoger Hochschild: Yes. And in terms of gaining share, I think it's never too early to think about that. It feels like we're gaining share in the card business in terms of loans and sales this quarter, from what I've seen from competitors reporting, and that's within the significantly tightened credit box that we have. One of the capabilities we've been working on is, is just the ability to react more quickly and that helped us react very quickly to the pandemic in terms of tightening credit across our products. But that should also help when job losses abate and it becomes time to widen the credit box as well. So we feel good about our capabilities and our ability to gain share across all of our products.\nDon Fandetti: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse.\nMoshe Orenbuch: Great, thanks. I guess I was \u2013 I was hoping you could talk a little bit about the performance that you've seen with respect to borrowers that are exiting forbearance, and the fact that you're assuming kind of 11% unemployment at year-end. So as we think about the likelihood of either needing more or less reserving like, how do you think about the information that we're going to get over the next several months in terms of how we think about the reserving levels as we go forward?\nRoger Hochschild: Moshe, thanks for the question. So, and it's a great question, and honestly it's a bit of art and science. So what we have seen in terms of customers exiting is about 80% of those customers are making payments and is \u2013 and close to 80% of those are making full payments. So we're feeling very good about the customers coming out of the programs. Now to be honest, those segments inherently are likely to be a little bit more risky. So we continue to watch the differentiation on customers who elected to enter into one of the Skip-a-Pay programs to see if there's any potential issue, but as you step back from it, the overall size of the portfolio versus the customers who have elected to go into Skip-a-Pay program relatively small, right? So...\nMoshe Orenbuch: Right.\nRoger Hochschild: So we're looking at the impact as very, very mild. The delinquency trends have been, from my standpoint very, very encouraging and I think that's, that's a function of some of the government stimulus, function of our collections operations and the value of a credit card overall versus other payment forms or other payment forms as well as what it means in terms of ability to operate in the digital economy. So we like the fact that our portfolio has a high concentration of credit cards, and we also think that we'll come here to the top on the payment prioritization through even a tough downturn.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.\nBetsy Graseck: Hi, good morning.\nRoger Hochschild: Good morning.\nBetsy Graseck: Craig, I'm going to miss you.\nCraig Streem: Likewise Betsy. Thank you. I appreciate that. Thanks.\nBetsy Graseck: Okay. So back to work. The question I have is just around the reserving level. I know you already addressed one question on that earlier in the Q&A, but I've been getting some investor questions regarding how to think about the reserves that you're building today versus the loss experience you had during the great financial crisis? Now granted it's very different environment, but the unemployment rate is relatively high and a little bit higher than what we had during the GFC. So I thought I'd take the opportunity to ask you how you would answer that question. How should I think about what the right reserving level is for today's book versus the losses that you had during the 2008 crisis? Thanks.\nRoger Hochschild: So let me start by talking a bit about the unemployment rate and then I'll pass it to John to talk on the reserves. I think the unemployment rate we're seeing now is very different. And we've talked a bit about temporary unemployment, as well as the impact on sort of entry level retail, entry level hospitality, entry level restaurant. And so you can't map total unemployment to loses and a prime card base the way that you saw that pattern in last downturn. And so things like permanent unemployment, you need to adjust to that. And so we're not just looking at the raw unemployment numbers as we do our modeling. I'll pass to John to talk a bit about the reserve.\nJohn Greene: And then Betsy, just one other piece and it's a relatively important difference here when you go back in time on the great recession versus where we are today. So, the overall the industry, the quality of the originations is much better today than it was at the great recession or prior to that. In general, higher FICOS across every single form of lending product. Delinquency levels coming into the recession \u2013 this recession versus the Great Recession are lower. Consumer financial obligation load is significantly lower today than it was coming into the Great Recession and debt service load was also lower today. So the consumer is stronger coming into this recession than coming into the Great Recession. The traditional links between unemployment and delinquency and charge-offs, we're trying to model that. It's really hard to nail that down right now, given all the government stimulus. But overall, as I look at where we are today and based on our underwriting and where card loan comes into payment priorities, I feel like we're very, very well positioned versus where the company was coming into the Great Recession. And then we also talked about inactive lines. We've taken inactive lines down nearly numbers close to $70 billion. So we're prepared for the worst, but I feel like we're in a better position.\nBetsy Graseck: And you've got this really high savings rate going on right now. I mean do you use that in your analysis as a kind of bridge to a lower unemployment rate as you're thinking about reserving?\nJohn Greene: Yes. We didn't actually quantify that. But as we were making determinations on economic scenarios and frankly, the overall quantum of reserves and reserve coverage, it was a point that helped us get to where we arrived.\nBetsy Graseck: Got it. Okay, thanks very much.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Mark DeVries with Barclays.\nMark DeVries: Yes, thanks. Could you give us a little more color about what we should expect from delinquency and charge-off formation in the coming quarters? And how, if at all, those expectations and your reserve levels are impacted by your expectations for benefits from different forms of government stimulus and different forms of lender forbearance across your customers' different financial obligations?\nJohn Greene: Okay. So a tricky question. So I'll start with how we're expecting delinquencies and charge-offs to roll in. So as I said earlier, the books held up really, really well. Delinquency levels have come down. We do think some of that is as a result of stimulus. We also feel like our teams are doing a great job in terms of interacting with our customer base to help the customers get through tough times, those that are experiencing some trouble. The trajectory of charge-offs, based on what we're seeing right now, looks like we would expect elevated charge-offs starting more in the fourth quarter and then coming into 2021. Frankly, it's tough to call right now because we're modeling out unprecedented scenarios here. But I think a good way to think about it is charge-offs elevating in 2021, perhaps peaking in the later part of 2021, depending on the economic scenario that we're dealing with and then starting to tail off in 2022. In terms of delinquency, delinquency will \u2013 we think will start to tick up in the fourth quarter, perhaps as early as the third quarter, but we're not seeing any indicators yet and then continue into 2021. In terms of the government programs, we did nothing in our modeling to reflect what's been kicked around right now in Washington in terms of the next round of stimulus. So I think that could certainly push out the curve a little bit in terms of both delinquency and charge-offs.\nRoger Hochschild: Yes. I mean, I think, as you think about the importance of the government programs, it's less about the $1,200 check that a family gets as you think about life of loan losses and what that will support. It's really the impact of those on the overall economy and keeping the trough from being too deep. So to John's point, we really think about it just in terms of at a macro level as opposed to what those checks may do in one month for a given household.\nMark DeVries: Okay, got it. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Meng Jiao with Deutsche Bank.\nMeng Jiao: Hi, good morning guys. A quick question, I guess, on the average balance sheet. I saw that average cash and securities were up materially this quarter. Just trying to get a sense on how you guys are thinking about the securities portfolio and whether or not you would extend duration to pick up some yield given the NIM at trough in 2Q? Thanks.\nRoger Hochschild: Yes, we\u2019ve been pleased with how \u2013 actually, how the balance sheet has come together. Certainly, the asset side has been strong as we talked about in the prepared comments. On the liability side, we've seen great appetite on our \u2013 for our deposit products, which is positive. We have also been able to avoid wholesale funding. We're not looking to substantially change any of the duration of any of the liabilities that we see on the balance sheet. We've effectively added interest rate, basically a balanced interest rate risk position. So we're feeling good about that.\nCraig Streem: Cristal?\nOperator: Your last question comes from the line of line of Kevin Barker with Piper Sandler.\nKevin Barker: Good morning. So we've seen a lot of controversy around the dividend on with several competitors or even some other banks. I was just wondering how much \u2013 how you think about the dividend going forward and how much of a priority is to maintain it given some shareholders look at it as important or just maybe how you think about it, given the trajectory of your earnings?\nJohn Greene: Yes, so I would guide you to sort of looking back over the last 10 years where you've seen a very clear strategy from Discover. Given the high returns we generate from our business, an important part of how we manage capital is returning it to shareholders in the form of a dividend, and we've had historically a measured increase to those dividends as well as buying back stock. And we're very disciplined and, to a lesser extent, involved in M&A. So that's what we like to do. I would say until the environment improves, it's quite safe to expect continued heavy regulatory focus on return of capital. And so we will have to adjust our strategies accordingly. Certainly, if they keep going with the four quarters rule, that's something that \u2013 again, it will depend going forward, but that's something that we've looked at. But I think we're going to watch and work with our regulators on this, but management's intent is unchanged. And so we'll have to see how it goes.\nKevin Barker: Okay. And then regarding your comments on the charge-off rate peaking into late 2021, I mean, I think, we would have expected a little bit more of a big bulge coming out of the deferral periods and the expiring of a lot of the stimulus. Could you just talk about how the \u2013 what the cycle is going to look like or how you envision it playing out with charge-offs playing out in the early 2021? And then what it looks like in the back half?\nRoger Hochschild: Yes. So we're seeing that the portfolio continues to be really, really stable, as I said. The payment programs, we saw obviously, the disclosed level of entries into the programs and then a surprisingly high number from our perspective exiting after one payment, which to me was a good sign. As they exited, the payment percentage or payment rate of those customers has held up very, very strong. So we're comfortable with that. So if you just look at where we are as of June 30 and then just do a kind of straight role model it out, it's hard to see any massive increases in charge-offs for the balance of the year even if things deteriorate from the consumer standpoint. So that means what we're likely to see is charge-offs grow through the year slowly and then, I wouldn't call it a bulge, but a higher level of overall charge-offs in the middle to second half of 2021. Now that's what \u2013 that's how we're seeing it today. I certainly would caveat that and say that consumer behavior is really difficult to predict here in a time such as this. Sorry, I can't be more specific on that.\nKevin Barker: Yes, it\u2019s very uncertain time, I understand. Thank you.\nOperator: I will now turn the floor back over to Craig Streem for any additional closing remarks.\nCraig Streem: Thanks Cristal. Just thank you, everybody, for your interest. As always, we're available, get back to us if you need any follow-up. Thanks. Have a good day.\nRoger Hochschild: Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Roger Hochschild",
            "content": "Thanks Craig. And thanks to our listeners for joining today's call. On last quarter's call, we discussed the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our employees, customers, and business. While I am pleased with our execution in the second quarter, we remain in a very challenging environment with considerable uncertainty as our country continues to struggle to stop the spread of COVID-19 and the impact on our economy remains very significant. Of course, the safety of our employees continues to be a top priority. All areas of the firm, including our hundred percent U.S.-based customer service team are operating effectively in a remote environment. And we have informed employees they will not be required to return to our physical locations until after January 1, 2021 at the earliest. Our operating model supports our commitment to providing flexible work arrangements as long as necessary to ensure the safety of our staff and their families. For our customers we continue to provide an industry-leading service experience, leveraging our digital capabilities and with average answer times in our call centers remaining at pre-pandemic levels of under one minute. Our products are well positioned as consumers increasingly look for value in these challenging times. We are the only major bank with no annual fees on any of our credit cards and no fees on any of our deposit products. Our leadership position in cash rewards and flexible redemption options, including point-of-sale with Amazon and PayPal are serving us well as consumers are increasingly shopping online and concerns over the safety of travel are limiting the appeal of airline miles. We have continued to support impacted customers with our Skip-a-Pay programs. Since we launched this program in mid-March we have helped over 662,000 customers across all of our products. And in fact, about 60% of total loans enrolled have already exited the program. The Skip-a-Pay program was intended to be a short term option, and we plan to end program enrollments in August. After that, we'll continue to offer assistance to those who qualify on a customer-by-customer basis. Now to our results for the quarter. We generated a net loss of $368 million or $1.20 per share. The most significant driver of this was a $1.3 billion reserve build in recognition of further deterioration in the macro economic outlook, subsequent to March 31. The credit performance in our portfolio has been stable, and we believe that the actions we've taken over the past few years, including reducing our contingent liability and the additional credit actions we implemented in March position us well. Nevertheless, the reserve build reflects our view that persistent, long-term unemployment will increasingly impact prime consumer lending portfolios. The pandemic continued to have a significant impact on sales volume, as well as loan growth through the quarter. We saw sales down 16% and 3% lower car loans, while down year-over-year, both compared favorably versus other issuers, principally due to our greater concentration in every day and online spend categories, as opposed to T&E. Operating expenses of $1.1 billion were flat to the prior year and included a $59 million onetime impairment charge to our Diners business, related to the impacts of the slowdown in global teeny spending. Excluding this operating expenses were down 6% year-over-year. We remain on track to deliver the $400 million of expense reductions we previously announced, even as we continue to invest in core capabilities, including analytics and data science. We expect these investments to strengthen our ability to achieve profitable growth and shareholder value to improve targeting and personalization, better underwriting decisions and enhanced collection strategies, just to name a few of the benefits. We're also responding to shifts in consumer preferences with our investments in contactless and secure remote commerce. Since the end of 2019, we have seen a 70% increase in contactless spending. I'm pleased to say we are on track to have most of our top 200 merchants enabled for contactless in 2020 and to have contactless cards issued to the majority of our card members by the end of the year. Consumers have also shifted to much more online spending, which makes our investments in secure remote commerce and our partnership with the other major networks to implement Click to Pay even more significant. Our disciplined approach to capital management and liquidity remains a top priority for us, particularly in the current environment. We have continued to see very strong demand for our consumer deposit products even as we have been reducing rates. Consumer deposits are now nearly 60% of total funding, and we have reduced our online savings rate 59 basis points since early March. Discover has a very strong financial foundation, loyal customers and a proven business model. I am confident that we have taken the correct actions to strengthen the Discover franchise and we are well prepared to continue to drive long-term value to our shareholders and customers. I'll now ask John to discuss key aspects of our financial results in more detail. Hey, Sanjay its Roger. I'll cover the first part and then pass it to John. So in the reserve we \u2013 I think took a conservative approach and use the \u2013 an economic outlook that was considerably worse than the end of Q1. Under CECL, as you know, right that is reserved for the life of loan for the loans we have on our balance sheet. And so further reserve increases would mean that we add further deterioration in the economic environment or would be based on the growth of the balance sheet as we look ahead. And I'll pass it to John for the second one. Sure. So I was going to say in my 20 plus years at Discover, I've seen a lot of things, but I've never seen anything like this in terms of this speed and magnitude of the impact the pandemic has had on the economy. I don't think any of us in business has seen this. Nevertheless, I feel like we were very, very well positioned for this going in, and I think over the long-term what you've seen is really an acceleration of some trends that were already there. So the migration out of branch to digital channels, which again as always been part of our business mode. Consumers shifting from physical to digital purchases and there I think our advantage of having our proprietary network and the work we're doing with other major networks on SRC will be helpful. For a physical purchases, the shift to contact less, so those are really some trends that have been there, but have accelerated in a very significant way as a result of the COVID pandemic. Yes. And in terms of gaining share, I think it's never too early to think about that. It feels like we're gaining share in the card business in terms of loans and sales this quarter, from what I've seen from competitors reporting, and that's within the significantly tightened credit box that we have. One of the capabilities we've been working on is, is just the ability to react more quickly and that helped us react very quickly to the pandemic in terms of tightening credit across our products. But that should also help when job losses abate and it becomes time to widen the credit box as well. So we feel good about our capabilities and our ability to gain share across all of our products. Moshe, thanks for the question. So, and it's a great question, and honestly it's a bit of art and science. So what we have seen in terms of customers exiting is about 80% of those customers are making payments and is \u2013 and close to 80% of those are making full payments. So we're feeling very good about the customers coming out of the programs. Now to be honest, those segments inherently are likely to be a little bit more risky. So we continue to watch the differentiation on customers who elected to enter into one of the Skip-a-Pay programs to see if there's any potential issue, but as you step back from it, the overall size of the portfolio versus the customers who have elected to go into Skip-a-Pay program relatively small, right? So... So we're looking at the impact as very, very mild. The delinquency trends have been, from my standpoint very, very encouraging and I think that's, that's a function of some of the government stimulus, function of our collections operations and the value of a credit card overall versus other payment forms or other payment forms as well as what it means in terms of ability to operate in the digital economy. So we like the fact that our portfolio has a high concentration of credit cards, and we also think that we'll come here to the top on the payment prioritization through even a tough downturn. Good morning. So let me start by talking a bit about the unemployment rate and then I'll pass it to John to talk on the reserves. I think the unemployment rate we're seeing now is very different. And we've talked a bit about temporary unemployment, as well as the impact on sort of entry level retail, entry level hospitality, entry level restaurant. And so you can't map total unemployment to loses and a prime card base the way that you saw that pattern in last downturn. And so things like permanent unemployment, you need to adjust to that. And so we're not just looking at the raw unemployment numbers as we do our modeling. I'll pass to John to talk a bit about the reserve. Yes. I mean, I think, as you think about the importance of the government programs, it's less about the $1,200 check that a family gets as you think about life of loan losses and what that will support. It's really the impact of those on the overall economy and keeping the trough from being too deep. So to John's point, we really think about it just in terms of at a macro level as opposed to what those checks may do in one month for a given household. Yes, we've been pleased with how \u2013 actually, how the balance sheet has come together. Certainly, the asset side has been strong as we talked about in the prepared comments. On the liability side, we've seen great appetite on our \u2013 for our deposit products, which is positive. We have also been able to avoid wholesale funding. We're not looking to substantially change any of the duration of any of the liabilities that we see on the balance sheet. We've effectively added interest rate, basically a balanced interest rate risk position. So we're feeling good about that. Yes. So we're seeing that the portfolio continues to be really, really stable, as I said. The payment programs, we saw obviously, the disclosed level of entries into the programs and then a surprisingly high number from our perspective exiting after one payment, which to me was a good sign. As they exited, the payment percentage or payment rate of those customers has held up very, very strong. So we're comfortable with that. So if you just look at where we are as of June 30 and then just do a kind of straight role model it out, it's hard to see any massive increases in charge-offs for the balance of the year even if things deteriorate from the consumer standpoint. So that means what we're likely to see is charge-offs grow through the year slowly and then, I wouldn't call it a bulge, but a higher level of overall charge-offs in the middle to second half of 2021. Now that's what \u2013 that's how we're seeing it today. I certainly would caveat that and say that consumer behavior is really difficult to predict here in a time such as this. Sorry, I can't be more specific on that. Thank you."

            "name": "John Greene",
            "content": "Thank you, Roger. And good morning, everyone. Taking a look at the quarter, we're pleased with our response to the rapidly shifting economic environment, including taking appropriate actions to manage expense, capital, credit and liquidity. Our capital position combined with advances in analytics and credit risk management put us in great shape to return to profitable growth when conditions are right. Today, a recap of the financial results for the quarter and provide details on our credit performance and loan provisions. Similar to last quarter, I won't review our standard slides on low growth, payment volumes, or revenue and expense, but you can find our traditional disclosures on slides, 11 to 16 in the appendix to this presentation. On Slide 4, looking at key elements of the income statement, revenue, net of interest expense decreased 7% in the second quarter, primarily driven by lower net interest income due to NIM compression and lower net discount and interchange revenue reflecting decreased sales volume. Net interest margin was 9.81% for the quarter, down 66 basis points from the prior year. This was driven by three factors. Average loans were flat year-over-year, reflecting the lower sales volume. Loan yields declined as the average prime rate was 225 basis points lower on a year-over-year basis due to Fed rate cuts in 2019 and a 150 basis points cut in March this year. These were partially offset by lower funding costs. We moved aggressively to reduce our deposit rates. Gross discount and interchange revenue decreased 18%, driven by the decline in sales volume. This was partially offset by a 16% decrease in rewards costs. Other income was up due to a $44 million gain on sale of an equity investment. The provision for credit losses was $2 billion and included net charge offs of $767 million, which were up 7% from last year and a $1.3 billion increase in reserves, primarily due to further deterioration in the economic outlook. I'll provide additional comments on credit with the next slide. Operating expenses were flat to the prior year, but down 6% excluding a one-time item. Marketing and business development expense was 42% lower year-over-year as we responded to the significant slowdown in the U.S. economy. The majority of the expense reduction was in brand marketing and card acquisition costs as we align marketing spend with the impacts of the economic environment and tightened credit criteria. Offsetting this in our Diners Club International business we booked a $59 million non-cash intangible asset impairment charge as a result of the slowdown and cross border travel and entertainment spending. Apart from the one-time impairment charge, we anticipate realizing $400 million of expense reductions from our previous guidance range. We made good progress on the expense front in the second quarter, and we'll continue this momentum through the balance of the year. As the economic environment evolves, we'll continue to monitor and take actions on expenses as conditions warrant. Turning now to Slide 5, showing credit metrics. Credit performance remained stable in the quarter. Card charge-offs increased 41 basis points from the prior year mainly due to seasoning of loan growth. The credit card 30 plus delinquency rate was down 17 basis points from last year and down 45 basis points from the prior quarter. The lower delinquency rate reflects the overall stability of the card portfolio with a very modest impact from the Skip-a-Pay program. Our private student loan portfolio reported strong credit metrics in the quarter with net charge-off nearly flat to the prior year. The 30 plus delinquency rate went down 25 basis points from the prior year and 18 basis points lower than the prior quarter. Credit performance in this product continues to benefit from tight underwriting and a high percentage of co-signed loans. Personal loan net charge-offs decreased 90 basis points year-over-year. The 30 plus delinquency rate was 42 basis points lower than the prior year and down 24 basis points from the prior quarter. These credit metrics benefit from disciplined underwriting and our strong customer service and collection efforts. While the overall portfolio performance has been stable through the second quarter, we do expect to see some deterioration in consumer credit in coming quarters. Moving to Slide 6, which shows our allowance for credit losses. In the quarter, we added $1.3 billion to be allowance primarily due to further deterioration in the macro economic outlook. As we considered the level of allowances needed, we modeled several different scenarios. This scenario to which we gave the greatest weight included a sharp increase in peak unemployment to a rate of 16% recovering to 11% at the end of 2020, followed by a slow recovery over the next few years. We assumed an annualized real GDP decline of 30% quarter-over-quarter or down 10% on a year-over-year basis. The quarterly reserve calculation also included an overlay which considers the impact of the Skip-a-Pay program leveraging our previous experience with disaster relief. We also considered unemployment reports in June and July, which showed higher permanent unemployment and the impact of recent increases in COVID-19 cases. Turning to Slide 7, which detailed sales trends by category through mid-July. Total card sales volume decreased 16% in the second quarter. The greatest weekly decline was in mid-April when total sales were down 33% for the week ending April 18, since then we've seen steady improvement across almost every category as the economy reopened. Sales were down just 3% through the first half of July. Since then we have seen steady improvement across almost every category as the economy reopened. We continue to see positive trends in retail, which were up 7% in the second quarter and 15% in the first half of July. Within the retail category, home improvements has been exceptionally strong up 19% in the quarter on high consumer demand. We also benefited from adding Home Depot to our 5% rewards category. Strong online spending growth also contributed to solid retail sales in the quarter. Travel, restaurants and gas continue to be the most negatively impacted categories. Slide 8 highlights enrollment trends in our Skip-a-Pay program which offers relief to customers experiencing financial stress due to the pandemic. We saw the peak in the cards program during the first week of April at $673 million. First time enrollments have steadily decreased since then. In the week of July 12, enrollment's decreased to just $35 million. To date, we enrolled a total of $3.4 billion in card loans. However, the majority of customers needed only one month of assistance and as of July 13, over 70% of card loans were no longer enrolled. Off those, out of the program approximately 80% have returned to making payments. Moving to Slide 9. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio increased 40 basis points sequentially, mainly due to decline in loan balances. In March, we suspended our share buyback program in response to the economic environment at the time and it remained suspended to-date. We've continued to fund our quarterly dividend at $0.44 per share of common stock in line with requirements provided by our regulators and approved by our Board of Directors. Our preliminary stress capital buffer was set at 3.5% with the final SCB expected towards the end of the third quarter. We will determine our share repurchase and dividend actions subject to the final stress capital buffer, any other regulatory limitations and board approval. Our liquidity portfolio remains strong with $27 billion in liquid assets and has increased over $7 billion from March 31. Since the onset of the pandemic, we have been a leader in reducing rates on our consumer deposit products. Nevertheless, we've continued to see strong demand with average consumer deposits increasing 22% year-over-year and now making up 60% of total funding. We'll continue to look for opportunities to reduce deposit costs. To summarize the quarter we're pleased with our results, given the extremely challenging environment. We took swift action on expenses and are continuing to invest in core capabilities, so we're prepared for the recovery when it comes. Outside of a one-time item, operating expenses were down as we started to benefit from our expense reduction programs. Credit performance remained stable, but some deterioration is expected in the coming quarters. We took a conservative reserving approach and added $1.3 billion to the allowance for credit losses, and finally capital and liquidity both remained strong. While we remain conservative given the continued level of economic uncertainty, we feel good about the actions we've taken to date and the strength of the Discover franchise. Before we open up the call for Q&A, I wanted to announce that after a career in consumer finance, including many years at Discover, Craig Streem has informed us of his desire to retire. I am sure most, if not all of you have interacted with Craig over that time and enjoyed a great relationship with him. He has been an important partner to Roger, our leadership team and for me. He has been a wonderful team member and a terrific help with my transition into the company. Craig is going to continue to lead the IR Team until his successor has been named and is in place. So you will have plenty of opportunity to wish him well, as we all do. That concludes our formal remarks. So I'll turn the call back to our operator to open up the lines for Q&A. Yes. So Sanjay, just to echo those comments, we feel very good about the overall reserve and the conservative approach we took especially given when you look at the overall portfolio performance that we've seen today and actions we've taken backs as far as 2017 on the personal loans business. So overall we feel very comfortable with our reserve today. And as the economic conditions unfold, that'll have an impact either plus or minus on the overall reserve. The forbearance programs have acted exactly as we had hoped. They've helped some customers managed through the pandemic and as I said in my prepared remarks, most \u2013 the high majority of the people who entered the card program have exited and are repaying. So a very, very mild impact to delinquency reporting as well. Yes. So it's actually relatively small and the delinquency numbers somewhere between 5 basis points and 10 basis points. And Bob, in terms of the sales trends, we haven't \u2013 we haven't broken it down out between brick-and-mortar and online. But what I \u2013 what I can point you to is retail in my prepared comments in terms of the growth we've seen there, a lion's share of that has been as a result of online retailers and you know the major players there, which is driving I'll say further demise of the brick-and-mortar retailers and accelerating the digital channel for card. Things that Discover offers in terms of the network and our secure remote commerce that we're working on, all those will position us well for that growing trend. Okay. So when I start with NIM question? So in the first quarter, our NIM was 10.21%, and then in the second quarter it came down to 9.81%. I'm not going to give a bunch of detail here, but what I can say is, we look at the second quarter as likely the trough on NIM overall. What we've been able to do is execute pretty well in terms of deposit pricing and our funding stack has meant such that more expensive funding sources are fading away, and we're getting a benefit there. So since the pandemic, just to give you some details we decreased our online savings by about 60 basis points. That's an immediate benefit to net interest margin in the company. And then through the balance of the year, we're going to continue to look for opportunities. So some of that will be based on the funding of our balance sheet, and some of it will be based on the competitive environment that we're dealing with. And then Betsy, just one other piece and it's a relatively important difference here when you go back in time on the great recession versus where we are today. So, the overall the industry, the quality of the originations is much better today than it was at the great recession or prior to that. In general, higher FICOS across every single form of lending product. Delinquency levels coming into the recession \u2013 this recession versus the Great Recession are lower. Consumer financial obligation load is significantly lower today than it was coming into the Great Recession and debt service load was also lower today. So the consumer is stronger coming into this recession than coming into the Great Recession. The traditional links between unemployment and delinquency and charge-offs, we're trying to model that. It's really hard to nail that down right now, given all the government stimulus. But overall, as I look at where we are today and based on our underwriting and where card loan comes into payment priorities, I feel like we're very, very well positioned versus where the company was coming into the Great Recession. And then we also talked about inactive lines. We've taken inactive lines down nearly numbers close to $70 billion. So we're prepared for the worst, but I feel like we're in a better position. Yes. We didn't actually quantify that. But as we were making determinations on economic scenarios and frankly, the overall quantum of reserves and reserve coverage, it was a point that helped us get to where we arrived. Okay. So a tricky question. So I'll start with how we're expecting delinquencies and charge-offs to roll in. So as I said earlier, the books held up really, really well. Delinquency levels have come down. We do think some of that is as a result of stimulus. We also feel like our teams are doing a great job in terms of interacting with our customer base to help the customers get through tough times, those that are experiencing some trouble. The trajectory of charge-offs, based on what we're seeing right now, looks like we would expect elevated charge-offs starting more in the fourth quarter and then coming into 2021. Frankly, it's tough to call right now because we're modeling out unprecedented scenarios here. But I think a good way to think about it is charge-offs elevating in 2021, perhaps peaking in the later part of 2021, depending on the economic scenario that we're dealing with and then starting to tail off in 2022. In terms of delinquency, delinquency will \u2013 we think will start to tick up in the fourth quarter, perhaps as early as the third quarter, but we're not seeing any indicators yet and then continue into 2021. In terms of the government programs, we did nothing in our modeling to reflect what's been kicked around right now in Washington in terms of the next round of stimulus. So I think that could certainly push out the curve a little bit in terms of both delinquency and charge-offs. Yes, so I would guide you to sort of looking back over the last 10 years where you've seen a very clear strategy from Discover. Given the high returns we generate from our business, an important part of how we manage capital is returning it to shareholders in the form of a dividend, and we've had historically a measured increase to those dividends as well as buying back stock. And we're very disciplined and, to a lesser extent, involved in M&A. So that's what we like to do. I would say until the environment improves, it's quite safe to expect continued heavy regulatory focus on return of capital. And so we will have to adjust our strategies accordingly. Certainly, if they keep going with the four quarters rule, that's something that \u2013 again, it will depend going forward, but that's something that we've looked at. But I think we're going to watch and work with our regulators on this, but management's intent is unchanged. And so we'll have to see how it goes."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning. My name is Maria and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the First Quarter 2020 Discover Financial Services Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Craig Streem, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nCraig Streem: Sure. Thanks a lot, Maria. Good morning, everybody and welcome to our call. We will begin on Slide 2 of our earnings presentation, which you can find as always in the Financials section of our Investor Relations website, investorrelations.discover.com.Our discussion this morning contains certain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. Please refer to our notices regarding forward-looking statements that appear on today\u2019s earnings press release and presentation. Our call this morning will include remarks from our CEO, Roger Hochschild and from John Greene, our Chief Financial Officer. And after we conclude our formal comments, there will be time as Maria said for question-and-answer session. During the Q&A session, we would appreciate that if you limit yourself initially to one question, if you have a follow-up maybe queue back in, so we can be sure to accommodate as many participants as possible.And now, it\u2019s my pleasure to turn the call over to Roger.\nRoger Hochschild: Thanks, Craig and thanks to our listeners for joining today\u2019s call. I hope all of you and your families are staying healthy and safe during these very challenging times. I would also like to take a moment to acknowledge and thank the healthcare workers, first responders, grocery store workers and many others, who have working so hard and often great personal sacrifice for the benefit of our communities and country. We will be a bit different than our traditional earnings calls. After my opening remarks, John will discuss our first quarter results with a particular focus on the reserve builds. I will then come back and provide additional information as to what we have been seeing since the end of the first quarter.Here at Discover, our top priority has been the health and safety of our employees. Our headquarters functions moved to work from home on March 16 with minimal disruption. And our technology team and field leadership did an incredible job getting nearly all of our 8,000 Discover call center team members working from the safety of their homes within two weeks. Our robust business continuity plans, digital business model and a 100% U.S. based customer service helped ensure our representatives were ready even as we faced an unprecedented increase in call volumes from concerned customers impacted by the coronavirus. Early on in the crisis, we answered 95% of calls in less than 5 minutes and for April, as our team got more comfortable working from home, average full-times have been under 1 minute.We are providing significant support to our customers across every product that helped them through this crisis. We have expanded payment plans across our credit card, student and personal loan and home equity products and waived fees on CD early withdrawals for customers who need emergency access to their funds. Our strong capital position and balanced funding model are also a source of strength. John will provide additional detail, but I am especially pleased with the strong demand we are seeing for our deposit products.Some of the early impacts of the pandemic can be seen in our first quarter results, specifically in sales volume and card loan growth. For the company overall, we generated a net loss of $61 million or $0.25 per share as the benefits of solid growth in average loans were more than offset by higher provision expense. As we adopted the CECL reserve methodology on January 1, the reserve build this quarter reflected the life of loan view as well as an outlook for a weaker economy and higher unemployment. Actions we have taken since the crisis began, includes significant tightening of underwriting for new card and personal loan accounts with additional employment verification. And we have pulled back on balance transfer offers and line increases.As I have mentioned on prior calls, for the last 18 months, we have been tightening credit at the margin as we have felt for some time that we are on late credit cycle. But given the present environment, we are adopting a significantly more cautious view. To give you a sense for how our card portfolio compares today with how it looked at the end of 2007, our contingent liability meaning the total open-to-buy for our card products has been reduced from roughly 5.7x loans to around 2.7x and the percentage of the portfolio below a FICO score of 660 has gone from 26% at that time down to 19% at the end of 2019. So while we are not immune from the impacts of deterioration in the economy, our portfolio significantly better positioned than it was ahead of the last financial crisis. In addition to our credit actions, we are taking a hard look at operating expenses to ensure investments align with the economic environment. We are implementing approximately $400 million of cost reductions over the remaining three quarters of 2020 and we will continue to review expense levels as the economic environment evolves.I will now ask John to discuss key aspects of our financial results in more detail, then I will come back to discuss the current environment.\nJohn Greene: Thank you, Roger and good morning everyone. Before I begin, I want to echo Roger\u2019s thanks to all the people working on the frontline through the pandemic. I also want to thank all of Discover associates. They have pivoted to a work from home environment, while maintaining their high service levels and professionalism throughout. Today, I will summarize the results for the quarter then provide details on our credit performance and loan provisions. I will conclude with an update on capital and funding trends before turning the call back over to Roger to summarize our COVID-19 response actions.In light of the uncertainty in the economy, we are withdrawing our previously provided guidance. But as Roger mentioned, we are targeting $400 million of cost reductions through the balance of the year with the majority in the second half. Our expense actions include reducing account acquisition expense, cutting spending on brand awareness and consideration activities, and reducing vendor and technology spend. We will continue to review all discretionary spending as the payback on incremental spend has changed.In the interest of focusing our comments this morning on the impacts of the pandemic and our responses, we are not going to review our customary slides on loan growth, payment volumes and revenue, so you can find additional disclosures on Slide 11 to 16 in the appendix to this presentation. And as always, we are happy to take questions on these or any other aspects of the quarterly results.On Slide 4, looking at key elements of the income statement, revenue, net of interest expense, increased 5% this quarter driven primarily by a 6% increase in average loans and a $35 million net gain in our payment services segment principally from the sale of a portion of an equity investment. Net interest margin was 10.21% for the first quarter. This was down 25 basis points year-over-year due largely to lower loan yields as a prime rate came down in response to Fed rate cuts in September and October of last year. This was partially offset by lower funding costs. The additional Fed rate cuts in March of this year will impact net interest margin beginning in the second quarter.Provisions for credit losses included net charge-off of $769 million, up 8% from last year and an increase in reserves of approximately $1 billion, reflecting a deterioration in the economic outlook. I will have some additional comments in credit in a moment, but before we turn to the next slide, I want to discuss operating expenses. They were up 13% from their prior year first quarter. The increase was principally due to higher compensation expense, increased marketing cost and investments in technology.Turning now to Slide 5 showing our key credit metrics, credit performance remained stable in the first quarter. We did not see any discernible impacts from the national COVID-19 containment activities or from our own credit mitigation actions in response. Card charge-offs increased 15 basis points from last year\u2019s quarter due principally to seasoning of loan growth. The credit card 30-plus delinquency rate was up 17 basis points from last year, but flat versus the prior quarter with both metrics reflecting consistent performance in typical seasonal patterns. Our private student loan and personal loan portfolios also had credit performance in the quarter with both showing slight improvements in charge-off and delinquency rates.On Slide 6, you will see our allowance for credit losses. We added $2.5 billion to the allowance for credit losses in January of this year as we transition to a life of loan CECL basis. At the end of the quarter, we added approximately $1 billion to the allowance largely due to changes in the macroeconomic forecast. The reserve build assumes unemployment rising to more than 9%, recovering through 2022 and a decline in GDP of nearly 18%. We also included our best estimate of reserve implications of the government stimulus programs. As the economic outlook evolves and the impacts of the various government relief programs become more clear, we will adjust our allowance accordingly.Turning to Slide 7, our common equity Tier 1 ratio increased 10 basis points sequentially, mainly due to a decrease in loan balances partially offset by capital returns. For purpose of calculating regulatory capital, we have elected to defer recognition of the CECL Day 1 adjustment for 2 years. So we will begin to phase in our Day 1 CECL impact in 2022 with 100% saved in by 2025. The federal banking regulators have also provided a phase in for the Day 2 impacts of CECL with 25% of the quarterly reserve build also being deferred until 2022 and then create the same as the Day 1 deferral. Our payout ratio, which includes buybacks, was 99% over the last 12 months.As Roger noted, we have suspended our share buyback program, but we will continue to fund our regular quarterly dividends. Our liquidity position remains very strong. As of the end of the quarter, we had $19 billion in liquid assets, $6 billion in committed borrowing capacity through privately placed asset-backed securitizations, and $35 billion in borrowing capacity at the Federal Reserve discount window. As of April 20, our liquid assets have grown to more than $23 billion. In addition to those forms of actual and committed liquidity, we have access to funding through our direct-to-consumer deposit channel with average deposits increasing 20% year-over-year and now making up over 55% of total funding. Based on the strength of consumer demand yesterday, we reduced rates on our savings account by 10 basis points and will continue to look for opportunities to do so.In summary, good progress on the expense front. Liquidity is robust. Capital remains strong and we continue to monitor and manage our credit exposure. And now I will turn the call back over to Roger.\nRoger Hochschild: Thanks, John. While we will not be providing new guidance given the uncertain economic outlook, I do want to provide you with an update on two key areas, where the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting our business in a way that was not captured in the Q1 results.On Slide 8, we are giving you a detailed look at sales volume trends to illustrate how COVID-19 has affected cardholder spending in April as compared to the much smaller impact we saw on the first quarter sales. The first column shows the composition of sales by category for the full year 2019. So you can see where our cardholders spend is normally distributed by industry. We then give you the year-over-year growth percentages for the first quarter of 2020 and month-to-date April. On a day-adjusted basis everyday sales which includes gas, groceries, and wholesale clubs and makes up about 22% of total sales, so growth of 10% during the quarter.So far in April however, everyday sales are down 14% year-over-year as increased spending on groceries is more than offset by a 60% reduction in spend in petroleum. Discretionary spend is down 33% driven by the travel category, which although only 8% of cardholder spending is down 99% and by retail, which is down 11%. As long as stay at home orders remain in place and many businesses remained closed, we expect the weak sales volume trend to continue and future trends will depend upon the pace of the recovery.Turning to Slide 9, I want to take you through the Skip-a-Payment programs we have implemented to help our customers during this period of economic difficulty. We have recognized that COVID-19 has placed financial stress on the Discover customers who maybe out of work or has suffered reduced wages. One of the key differences in this downturn compared to the great recession of 2008, 2010, has been the staggering pace of job loss, but also the amount of government stimulus and the potential for many of those jobs to be restored after a hopefully brief period of unemployment. Therefore, we are offering support to those impacted by COVID-19 with Skip-a-Payment programs available across all of our products, many modeled on the relief we traditionally provide for natural disaster.Through the first half of April, we have enrolled over 450,000 customers and roughly $3.8 billion in receivables in Skip-a-Payment programs to provide financial relief to our customers across our lending products. The receivables enrolled now represent 4% of total loans, but we are encouraged that the number of daily enrollments has been declining since the level peaked in late March. We will continue to work with these customers closely and potentially extend programs when required to meet the customers\u2019 needs.Let me close by summarizing some of the actions we have taken to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. We have shifted virtually all of our employees to work from home in a sustainable model that still continues to provide an industry leading customer experience across all of our products. We have taken swift and meaningful action to adjust our credit policies to reflect the new environment continuing to lend, but with tightened standards for new accounts and for growing existing accounts. We are implementing expense reduction initiatives while preserving key investments that will allow us to grow our business over the long-term and we are prepared for additional actions as the environment evolves.While our capital position is strong, we have suspended our share repurchase program in order to enhance our capital base. Clearly, we will have some challenging quarters ahead, but I am confident that we have taken the correct actions. None of us can perceive when the pandemic impacts will subside and allow the U.S. economy to begin to recover, but Discover is well positioned for the recovery that we know will eventually come. We have a loyal customer base, committed employees and a strong financial foundation to build from as we look to deliver long-term value to our customers and shareholders.That concludes our formal remarks. So I will turn the call back to our operator, Maria to open the line for Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Bob Napoli of William Blair.\nBob Napoli: Thank you and good morning, everybody. Hope everybody is well. A question on your outlook for unemployment and GDP that you are reserving for the life of the loans and I know you gave some numbers, but are you \u2013 can you just go over those numbers for 2020, 2021 and what you are expecting as far as recovery and what effects will that have on loan growth?\nJohn Greene: Okay. Thanks Bob. This is John. I will take a shot at that. So there is a wide degree of economic forecast that we took a look at while we are building our models and ultimately our allowance. So what we have built in was unemployment peaking at 9% and staying relatively high through the balance of this year. So about 7% through the end of the year and then it recovers slowly through 2022, so not expecting a real quick recovery and rather slow in our allowances as reflected that dynamic as we modeled it out. The loan \u2013 and your second part of your question on loan growth, the loan growth will be depending on how we see the economy and the recovery proceeding. As Roger mentioned in his comments, we have been cautious coming into this cycle. And when the pandemic hit we have pulled back further, so loan growth will be subject to essentially the recovery of the economy.\nBob Napoli: But we would expect to see loans declining I guess from here at least for the next quarter or two, I mean, is that fair?\nRoger Hochschild: You know Bob there are lot of factors that will go into where loans go. Certainly, the retail spend numbers that I gave you will have a significant impact on that. The credit action and expense actions we have taken will have an impact on loan growth as well. But to John\u2019s point, there is a lot of uncertainty that will be determined by the pace of the recovery.\nBob Napoli: Thank you. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani of KBW.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Thanks. Good morning. And I hope you guys are doing well as well. I guess it\u2019s been pretty well documented that since the end of March some of the economic forecasts have actually been revised worse. So, could you just talk about how that might be contemplated in the future whether or not you guys thing it should be? And then also how you guys are incorporating some of these Skip-a-Payment to cure rates and such inside your loss assumptions?\nJohn Greene: Okay. Thank you. So there is, as I said in my response to last question is, there is a wide degree of variation on the estimate. So when we put this together, we were looking at what a likely scenario was. Now, the economic backdrop continues to evolve. So we certainly did consider that. There are some overlays related to how we think about recoveries. And certainly, we did put a mild overlay in for the government stimulus programs, but it is uncertain. And if the economy deteriorates further and we don\u2019t see a recovery that will have reserve implications if it runs out as we have modeled that will also play through into the balance sheet in the P&L. So, I know I am not being real specific on your answer, but at this point given the uncertainty, this was our best estimate. In terms of your second part of your question on Skip-a-Pay, so that \u2013 the nature of that program is for card is that an inbound call will happen. The customer, if they are impacted by COVID will get an automatic basically payment deferral. They won\u2019t have to make the payment. If they call back second time, they can get a second deferral on the payment. And after that, they would either pay and go current or continue to kind of roll into delinquency buckets and ultimately charge-offs. So as we provisioned we thought about life of loan provisions and feel like we did a reasonably good job of capturing the dynamics on the portfolio. The one impact on Skip-a-Pay is that if the customer is in trouble and is unable to pay, it will result in up to a 2-month deferral into charge-off just by the nature of how things roll, but I do want to point that just over 80% of those customers who entered into to the Skip-a-Pay program were current at that time.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Okay. And just to clarify I guess that the same forecasts you used for your assumptions in the first quarter, have those actually been revised for the worst in early into the second quarter and if everything remain the same, would that mean that there would have to be an additional provision or are you saying that it\u2019s really subjective based on sort of how you are seeing things on fall based on your own forecast?\nJohn Greene: Yes. So there is a number of factor and I am not trying to be elusive here, Sanjay, but unemployment and GDP contraction are obviously key inputs. The duration of the slowdown will also be important. Geographic input impacts are important. Job classes are important. So ultimately, it will be a matter of the pace of the recovery, but just to go back and clarify my remarks, so we assumed just over 9% unemployment levels at a peak and then a very, very slow recovery in 2020 and then coming into 2022?\nRoger Hochschild: And Sanjay, just to build on that, the reserve is calculated at a point in time. And so we will go through a similar process next quarter. My guess is there will be a lot of ups and downs in economic forecast between now and then. And I would contrast that with in terms of how we make our credit decisions that is done on a near continuous basis in a much more granular level. And so we are looking by industry sector, we are looking by geographic area, we are making decisions on who we book, line assignment, how much employment verification we do. So I contrast the reserve calculation with how we are managing credit, which is near continuous.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Okay, great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mark DeVries of Barclays.\nMark DeVries: Yes, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. It sounds like your macro assumptions are not too dissimilar from the last recession as far as kind of where unemployment peaks and the pace of the recovery. Yet, the card reserve reflects cumulative losses that are probably less than half of what you are experienced in \u201808/09 timeframe. Could you talk about how the portfolios change in the manner that to make sure you are comfortable that losses won\u2019t approach what we saw in the last recession?\nJohn Greene: There is a couple of important pieces related to the portfolio that changed. So Roger mentioned this in his comments in terms of the open to buy. So, the open to buy has reduced by about $54 billion from the last recession to this recession. Average FICO scores in the portfolio have increased between 500 and 600 basis points, which is a material change. Our underwriting frankly is far more sophisticated than it was 10 years ago. And frankly, the actions that this business undertook when the pandemic started to actually drive some real difficult employment numbers, was drastic and very, very quick. So, I don\u2019t know if there is a perfect corollary between the last recession and this recession time will tell, but certainly, I feel like the business is well positioned and took decisive action. And again if the economic outlook changes, we will adjust the reserves and the allowance accordingly.\nMark DeVries: Okay, fair enough. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Don Fandetti of Wells Fargo. Don, your line is open. Make sure you are not on mute.\nDon Fandetti: Yes, John. Trying to sort of tie you to a specific number on the stimulus, is it realistic that could you have as you have looked at your scenarios maybe a point or two lower net charge-offs from stimulus? And then secondarily, most financial institutions have said there would probably be another reserve build, a sizable reserve build in Q2, just wanted to \u2013 I know you have talked a lot about it, but is that the case as you sit here today in April?\nJohn Greene: So, real difficult to answer at this point. So, we are going to monitor the economy and our portfolio and actually how our customers are performing and make appropriate calls on reserve builds in subsequent quarters. In terms of the government stimulus programs, the impact that we have modeled was relatively modest so I don\u2019t know if I would go to a full percentage point on charge offs but there was a mild impact and as we see that on full it will become more clear. The key thing on the stimulus programs at least initially was would be unemployment checks going out in the $600 as a benefit that\u2019s a front loaded impact and we will have to see how things develop on the back half of the year.\nDon Fandetti: Okay, thank you. That\u2019s helpful.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Bill Carcache of Nomura.\nBill Carcache: Thank you. Good morning Roger and John. I was hoping to follow-up on your thoughts about the potential benefit from government relief programs specifically on the Paycheck Protection Program, can you comment on the idea that unemployed consumers were receiving payments under PPP and therefore are not receiving unemployment insurance maybe understanding the true level of initial claims which you guys have always cited as an important leading indicator of credit performance? And then if we extend line of thinking how much of a concern is there that like those receiving unemployment insurance employees participating in PPP faced uncertainty about their employment outlook and still have to make decisions about which builds to pay first, what that means for the unsecured credit card, but just I guess the overall consensus view seems to be that PPP is a positive in the near-term but it is not a longer term fix. I was just hoping that you could maybe speak a little bit more to drag us to a broad potential that the PPP program will benefit your loss experience and you confidence level of that? Thanks.\nRoger Hochschild: Yes, I mean I think all of the government stimulus provides a benefit, but given the depth of the decrease in economic activity, what we all really need is for the economy to start backup again and that will depend on the pace of re-openings in different states and is impossible for us to forecast as we sit here. Some of the traditional relationships may breakdown a bit a lot of initial unemployment claims have been driven by I would say entry level employees in retail restaurant other industries that may have less of a correlation with what we see in our prime card base s o there isn\u2019t necessarily even the same one-to-one interaction that we would have seen in previous downturns where the job mix was different and that job mix may change over time during this recession as well so I would summarize with the government programs are helpful but what we really need is the economy to get going again and so why this will depend on the pace of the recovery/\nBill Carcache: Thanks. That\u2019s helpful. I guess maybe if I could just follow-up with the conceptual question on CECL I guess a different way of asking would come up and the idea that if macro conditions were to continue to deteriorate related to your expectations at the end of Q1 at a high level, is it reasonable to expect that we will see additional reserve building? And then therefore when condition start deteriorating we will start seeing additional reserve building and maybe a kind of another way to ask that as if you can envision a scenario where you will need to continue to build more reserves even after economic conditions start to improve so just trying to get the big picture idea of CECL is going to work?\nRoger Hochschild: Okay. So big picture if the economic conditions continue to deteriorate there will be two dynamics that are likely to happen one would be CECL life of loan provisions would increase, so the allowance would increase we would also take appropriate actions to ensure that our portfolio was stable and that the lending activity we were doing made sense, so you could expect that the portfolio frankly might not increase and would actually decrease and if that was the case we would see some level of offset as a result of reserve releases tied to the portfolio size or the overall loan size so there is multiple dynamics there that come into play, but I hope that\u2019s conceptually helpful.\nBill Carcache: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg of Bank of America.\nMihir Bhatia: Hi, thank you for taking my question. I just wanted to ask a little bit more about just the forbearance programs, sorry, firstly, this is Mihir on for Jason. I wanted to ask about the forbearance programs and the Skip-a-Pay? Are you also continuing to look at typical modification programs and can you just help us a little bit with the mechanics in terms of just how you deal with the fact with whether you do a credit limit available to borrow etcetera for those who seek either of these programs? And just how you expect that to lead like if it\u2019s Skip-a-Pay whether you \u2013 will people be transitioning from that if they continue to grow through the delinquency buckets to your other modification programs or is it that once you do the Skip-a-Pay now you don\u2019t \u2013 you aren\u2019t eligible for some of those other programs, so just want to understand a little bit more on how you are dealing with some of the delinquencies? Thank you.\nRoger Hochschild: Yes, it\u2019s Roger. Let me try it at a high level. As John described, for card, it\u2019s a 2 months program, up to 2 months for Skip-a-Pay, but they do 1 month less than 5% have renewed for the second month. So, we will see how that plays out over time. We do still have our program for customers that need a longer period of assistance. Regulators have been encouraging us and others to maximize the support we provide for customers, but again, I think it really does depend on the pace of recovery. As John pointed out, over 80% of those taking advantage of Skip-a-Pay are current. And so our hope would be and again that\u2019s why we have modeled it after some of the disaster relief programs we traditionally had that they will require a shorter bridge and then we will be able to get back to paying their builds, if not we have longer term programs to assist them.\nMihir Bhatia: And just \u2013 sorry just to clarify on that one, do you do anything with the longer \u2013 with Skip-a-Pay that there is no change to their credit limits available to borrowers, etcetera, correct?\nRoger Hochschild: No, for those who have signed up for Skip-a-Pay, it does not impact their credit limits.\nMihir Bhatia: Understood. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Rick Shane of JPMorgan.\nRick Shane: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions this morning. Thank you for all the information on the Skip-a-Pay. I am curious what you are seeing in terms of payment behaviors for consumers who are on Skip-a-Pay programs. Are you seeing an increase in consumers who are making minimum payments on a monthly basis?\nJohn Greene: So, we are still [Technical Difficulty] pattern to emerge and part of it is driven by the drastic reduction in sales volume that you have seen. But I would say that reduction in sales is relatively equal across transactors and revolvers. And so it\u2019s balanced in that way, but what happens with payment rate, I think will be determined on how quickly those sales ramp up, some people making larger payments and you can see from the inflow into our deposit products, there are lot of households were still okay, but are looking to fortify their position. So I think it\u2019s too early to really pick out a pattern in terms of the impact of all these changes on payment rate.\nRick Shane: Got it, okay. And look we share your view on looking at this in the context of a natural disaster in terms of how the challenges emerge, but one thing that historically has been subsequent to a natural disaster are significant insurance payments into those regions, which create things like huge cash inflows we have seen deposit spikes associated with that. I don\u2019t necessarily think that we are going to see that this time. Is it your view that, that will actually change the post event payment behavior and credit characteristics?\nRoger Hochschild: There is a lot of speculation out there. In some ways, this is like a natural disaster, in other ways, there is a big debate in terms of the resurgence of economic activity that you get from rebuilding after disaster. You won\u2019t quite have that here. And so is the economic \u2013 people aren\u2019t going to go to twice as many restaurants. And so is that economic activity just lost? I would say probably while you don\u2019t have the degree of insurance payments, you do have an unprecedented amount of governmental assistance and my guess is you will continue to see additional programs. So that is probably bit of an offset compared to what you would have seen coming out of insurance.\nRick Shane: Got it. Hey, thank you for taking my questions and we wish everybody their health and safety. Thank you.\nRoger Hochschild: Thanks, Rick.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Barker of Piper Sandler.\nKevin Barker: Thanks. Just maybe with regards to the liability side of the balance sheet, are you seeing changes in behavior on your deposit buys and what are your expectations going into the second and third quarter on just overall deposit growth given the different stimulus checks combined with the stress across unemployment, I know it\u2019s difficult to really pinpoint it, but it seems like there could be a lot of overlays where we might actually see a little bit of pickup in deposits and then maybe a decline. Can you just give us a little idea on your expectations there?\nJohn Greene: Yes. So I think supply and demand are starting to come into balance, but it\u2019s going to take another quarter or so. The appetite for our deposit products has actually been very, very good. We have traditionally been second or third on the bank rate table. We have been \u2013 recently been a little bit more aggressive on the downward side based on the overall demand for our products. So I think certain people are coming out of equities and looking for a safe place to put their cash. I think other folks have looked at our offerings and our service levels and decided that we are a good spot and they have chosen us. So as we look forward in future, I will say, future quarters, it will be subject to a couple of things. So the supply and the demand factors, what our competitors are doing and then obviously our performance, but we look to kind of move on the deposit pricing to actually pullback some of the NIM that was impacted by the Fed actions.\nKevin Barker: Okay. And then in regard to some of the programs that you laid out with the $400 million expense savings, could you assume that, that\u2019s off of what your previous guidance was or is that slightly separate from? What do you expect?\nJohn Greene: No, thank you. Yes, that was off the previous guidance. And as we said when we issued it was \u2013 it would be based on a strict payback analysis. So are we going to get long-term returns for the incremental investment with the economic backdrop changing we of course made the appropriate decisions.\nKevin Barker: Thanks for taking my questions.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of John Hecht of Jefferies.\nJohn Hecht: Good morning guys and thanks very much for taking my questions. The first question is where are we on utilization rates and average balances and how did that compare to maybe a period like entering the vast recession?\nRoger Hochschild: I am sorry can you repeat the first part of that question?\nJohn Hecht: Utilization.\nRoger Hochschild: Utilization rates. So as you look at overall utilization rates for the portfolio, I think we show that the amount of contingent liability, i.e., the ratio of, which is kind of the opposite of utilization, is significantly down from prior years. So, one as part of the credit tightening that we have done over the last several years, a key component has been tightening contingent liability and tightening that exposure?\nJohn Hecht: Okay, thank you. And then currently quantify the effects of the rate changes in March yet, how much of the impact to benchmark rates did you see in the quarter, I know it was later in the quarter and what do we think about NIM trends over the next quarter or two?\nJohn Greene: Okay. So we didn\u2019t see any impact in the quarter from the said reductions at the end of March. So there is about 150 basis points of reduction. So we have \u2013 we are not giving guidance but I am going to give you a couple of points in terms of how to think about it. So the 150 basis points hit, there is an impact for three quarters of the year on that. Our deposit betas have traditionally been about 50%. We took some proactive steps early in the year reducing overall deposit rates by 20 basis points to 50 basis points depending on the product. And then we are pulling back on the promo mix, which should also help rates. So you put those factors together and I think it draws a picture of how our NIM could look for the year. Now the quarterly trends are going to be a little bit different based on what\u2019s happening in the particular quarter on revolver and transactor mix.\nJohn Hecht: Perfect. Thank you guys very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Moshe Orenbuch of Credit Suisse.\nMoshe Orenbuch: Great, thanks. Roger, maybe as you kind of sit and think and obviously you are going to be doing less marketing but you\u2019re going to be doing it kind of in a different mix of products. And as you think about Discover\u2019s product set and service niche, kind of how do you think about what you are going to be doing and where there are opportunities to capitalize, and maybe if you could also just throw in thoughts on rewards competition in this environment as well? Thanks.\nRoger Hochschild: Yes, thanks Moshe for the question. One of the things we\u2019re trying to do is keep an eye on the opportunity in this environment. And so even as we\u2019ve made cuts we continue to make investments as well that will strengthen Discover, build the brand, and make sure we\u2019re in great shape for the future. So we\u2019re excited about the partnership with Quibi that just launched. Products such as our Miles Card where you have the ability to redeem at Amazon and PayPal, that\u2019s a lot more useful than programs that were structured just around travel. Our third quarter promotion is for restaurants, for the 5% program. We think that will resonate very, very well. And our rewards rate and product is really structured well for a wide variety of scenarios. So for example, issuers that have big sign up bonuses, they are having to extend the period to earn those because of the reduced level of retail sales and complaints from their customers where ours is just a flat match for the first year of spending. So we\u2019re very excited about where our products are positioned. We\u2019ve talked a lot about the traction we\u2019re getting in deposits. I also think a lot of our messages really will resonate in this environment. Who wants to waste money on a credit card with an annual fee? And we\u2019re the only one with only no annual fee products. So we\u2019re really excited about some of the opportunities we\u2019re seeing in this environment.\nMoshe Orenbuch: Great. I would assume that you would expect better \u2013 whether it\u2019s a response rate or conversion rates and things, you know like that in this \u2013 while marketing is lower you might have some of that?\nRoger Hochschild: Yes, we are seeing \u2013 and some of it plays out in the personal loan space for example, some of the traditional competitors and the fin-techs who do not have robust funding models are cutting very, very aggressively. So even with reduced marketing, we\u2019re still hoping to generate good results.\nMoshe Orenbuch: Great. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley.\nBetsy Graseck: Hi, good morning, and thanks for all the comments. A couple of questions. Just one earlier, I think you mentioned something about how this recession is going to be very different from previous ones in part because of the quick job losses and then expected recoveries. Do you know the job types by customer that you have?\nRoger Hochschild: We get it at the time of underwriting so some of it can drift over time. It varies a bit by product. We have much better information for the personal loan customers, is an example. We don\u2019t have our student loan customers given they haven\u2019t been employed. So it does vary, but I would say, we have very strong for personal loans and a good amount on the card portfolio.\nBetsy Graseck: Okay. And then separately on the reserving as you know, folks like us who are looking at the reserve levels relative to the 2018 bank loan stress test just to get a sense as to how you are comping this upcoming recession versus that stress loss scenario that you ran a couple of years ago? And when we look at that the credit card reserve that you\u2019ve taken is running, if my math is right, around 45%ish of that stress loss period, but the other consumer is running much higher. And on the other consumer products I think it averages around high \u201880%s, low \u201890%s. So I was just wondering is there a reason why you feel this kind of recession is going to be tougher on that other consumer and does it have to do with your answer you just gave or is there anything else there?\nRoger Hochschild: I would say it really has to do with more technical differences between the nature of those two different stresses. A lot of it has to do with when a recovery comes in. So just comparing scenarios based on peak loss can give you different numbers. So I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s anything different we\u2019re seeing by asset class. It\u2019s more technical based on those scenarios.\nBetsy Graseck: Okay. And then just two other quick ones, when people sign up for Skip-a-Pay, and let\u2019s say they go for the one month, is it automatic that they can go for the two months or they have to call in every time or check it on the e-mail?\nRoger Hochschild: Yes, Betsy, they have to call in on the card side.\nBetsy Graseck: Okay, alright. And I guess with the call times being extremely low, that\u2019s not going to be a challenge for them. And then lastly, on the forbearance side with the call-ins that you\u2019ve been receiving, from the slide deck, obviously, it shows that the beginning of April was the peak and I got a few questions overnight. Why do you think that\u2019s the case that the requests for Skip-a-Pay have already started to decelerate at a time when unemployment claims are still rising here?\nJohn Greene: Yes, that\u2019s a good question. Some of it could be related to the government stimulus programs and then it could be just the cycle. We do expect the trend to decline and then a modest pick up as they approach into the second month for certain customers, but we will have to see.\nRoger Hochschild: Yes, I mean, I guess I would probably point to, a), people may have a better feel of what stress is coming their way even before they\u2019re actually unemployed and so they may have called us, knowing that their boss say, hey, we got one week left and then we\u2019re closing down. So there isn\u2019t necessarily that line of sight. The second thing, my personal view is unemployment claims have actually been gated by capacity to process as opposed to each week 6 million people are losing their jobs. And so, that\u2019s why we would have seen the bubble earlier, because we didn\u2019t have that same capacity constraint that I believe you\u2019ve seen around unemployment claims.\nBetsy Graseck: Okay. That would be great. It would be great to update that as you get in front of people to over the quarter. Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Meng Jiao of Deutsche Bank.\nMeng Jiao: Hey, good morning guys. One quick question, I guess on the Skip-a-Pay payment. Can you guys give further demographics, I guess on what you\u2019re seeing in these customers? I mean, is it-is it safe to assume that the lower FICO score customers are the ones currently enrolling in the Skip-a-Pay payments or is that too much of a generalization?\nRoger Hochschild: I would say, we talked about over for a card at least over 80% are current. They are relatively highly utilized in terms of the amount of balance. But there\u2019s actually a mix of some that are transactors as well historically in that. So that\u2019s probably the information we\u2019re willing to provide at this time.\nMeng Jiao: Okay. Thank you.\nCraig Streem: Maria, our last question.\nOperator: Our last question comes from the line of Bob Napoli of William Blair.\nBob Napoli: [Technical Difficulty]\nRoger Hochschild: Bob, you are very hard to hear. Bob?\nBob Napoli: [Technical Difficulty]\nJohn Greene: Yes, hey, Bob, I am sorry, hey, this is John.\nCraig Streem: Maria, it sounds like we may have a line crossed or some other call. I am not sure if that\u2019s the questioner. Something sounded really strange there.\nOperator: And I went ahead and removed Bob from the queue.\nCraig Streem: Okay. And you can prompt if there is anything else and if not, we will terminate the call.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And I am showing no further questions sir. I would like to turn it back over for management for any additional or closing remarks.\nRoger Hochschild: Thanks, Maria. Everybody, thank you for your attention, your interest this morning and we will talk to you again as needed. Thanks.\nJohn Greene: Stay safe. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude the first quarter 2020 Discover Financial Services conference call. You may now disconnect.",

I would also like to take a moment to acknowledge and thank the healthcare workers, first responders, grocery store workers and many others, who have working so hard and often great personal sacrifice for the benefit of our communities and country. We will be a bit different than our traditional earnings calls. After my opening remarks, John will discuss our first quarter results with a particular focus on the reserve builds. I will then come back and provide additional information as to what we have been seeing since the end of the first quarter.Here at Discover, our top priority has been the health and safety of our employees. Our headquarters functions moved to work from home on March 16 with minimal disruption. And our technology team and field leadership did an incredible job getting nearly all of our 8,000 Discover call center team members working from the safety of their homes within two weeks. Our robust business continuity plans, digital business model and a 100% U.S. based customer service helped ensure our representatives were ready even as we faced an unprecedented increase in call volumes from concerned customers impacted by the coronavirus. Early on in the crisis, we answered 95% of calls in less than 5 minutes and for April, as our team got more comfortable working from home, average full-times have been under 1 minute.We are providing significant support to our customers across every product that helped them through this crisis. We have expanded payment plans across our credit card, student and personal loan and home equity products and waived fees on CD early withdrawals for customers who need emergency access to their funds. Our strong capital position and balanced funding model are also a source of strength. John will provide additional detail, but I am especially pleased with the strong demand we are seeing for our deposit products.Some of the early impacts of the pandemic can be seen in our first quarter results, specifically in sales volume and card loan growth. For the company overall, we generated a net loss of $61 million or $0.25 per share as the benefits of solid growth in average loans were more than offset by higher provision expense. As we adopted the CECL reserve methodology on January 1, the reserve build this quarter reflected the life of loan view as well as an outlook for a weaker economy and higher unemployment. Actions we have taken since the crisis began, includes significant tightening of underwriting for new card and personal loan accounts with additional employment verification. And we have pulled back on balance transfer offers and line increases.As I have mentioned on prior calls, for the last 18 months, we have been tightening credit at the margin as we have felt for some time that we are on late credit cycle. But given the present environment, we are adopting a significantly more cautious view. To give you a sense for how our card portfolio compares today with how it looked at the end of 2007, our contingent liability meaning the total open-to-buy for our card products has been reduced from roughly 5.7x loans to around 2.7x and the percentage of the portfolio below a FICO score of 660 has gone from 26% at that time down to 19% at the end of 2019. So while we are not immune from the impacts of deterioration in the economy, our portfolio significantly better positioned than it was ahead of the last financial crisis. In addition to our credit actions, we are taking a hard look at operating expenses to ensure investments align with the economic environment. We are implementing approximately $400 million of cost reductions over the remaining three quarters of 2020 and we will continue to review expense levels as the economic environment evolves.I will now ask John to discuss key aspects of our financial results in more detail, then I will come back to discuss the current environment. Thanks, John. While we will not be providing new guidance given the uncertain economic outlook, I do want to provide you with an update on two key areas, where the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting our business in a way that was not captured in the Q1 results.On Slide 8, we are giving you a detailed look at sales volume trends to illustrate how COVID-19 has affected cardholder spending in April as compared to the much smaller impact we saw on the first quarter sales. The first column shows the composition of sales by category for the full year 2019. So you can see where our cardholders spend is normally distributed by industry. We then give you the year-over-year growth percentages for the first quarter of 2020 and month-to-date April. On a day-adjusted basis everyday sales which includes gas, groceries, and wholesale clubs and makes up about 22% of total sales, so growth of 10% during the quarter.So far in April however, everyday sales are down 14% year-over-year as increased spending on groceries is more than offset by a 60% reduction in spend in petroleum. Discretionary spend is down 33% driven by the travel category, which although only 8% of cardholder spending is down 99% and by retail, which is down 11%. As long as stay at home orders remain in place and many businesses remained closed, we expect the weak sales volume trend to continue and future trends will depend upon the pace of the recovery.Turning to Slide 9, I want to take you through the Skip-a-Payment programs we have implemented to help our customers during this period of economic difficulty. We have recognized that COVID-19 has placed financial stress on the Discover customers who maybe out of work or has suffered reduced wages. One of the key differences in this downturn compared to the great recession of 2008, 2010, has been the staggering pace of job loss, but also the amount of government stimulus and the potential for many of those jobs to be restored after a hopefully brief period of unemployment. Therefore, we are offering support to those impacted by COVID-19 with Skip-a-Payment programs available across all of our products, many modeled on the relief we traditionally provide for natural disaster.Through the first half of April, we have enrolled over 450,000 customers and roughly $3.8 billion in receivables in Skip-a-Payment programs to provide financial relief to our customers across our lending products. The receivables enrolled now represent 4% of total loans, but we are encouraged that the number of daily enrollments has been declining since the level peaked in late March. We will continue to work with these customers closely and potentially extend programs when required to meet the customers' needs.Let me close by summarizing some of the actions we have taken to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. We have shifted virtually all of our employees to work from home in a sustainable model that still continues to provide an industry leading customer experience across all of our products. We have taken swift and meaningful action to adjust our credit policies to reflect the new environment continuing to lend, but with tightened standards for new accounts and for growing existing accounts. We are implementing expense reduction initiatives while preserving key investments that will allow us to grow our business over the long-term and we are prepared for additional actions as the environment evolves.While our capital position is strong, we have suspended our share repurchase program in order to enhance our capital base. Clearly, we will have some challenging quarters ahead, but I am confident that we have taken the correct actions. None of us can perceive when the pandemic impacts will subside and allow the U.S. economy to begin to recover, but Discover is well positioned for the recovery that we know will eventually come. We have a loyal customer base, committed employees and a strong financial foundation to build from as we look to deliver long-term value to our customers and shareholders.That concludes our formal remarks. So I will turn the call back to our operator, Maria to open the line for Q&A. You know Bob there are lot of factors that will go into where loans go. Certainly, the retail spend numbers that I gave you will have a significant impact on that. The credit action and expense actions we have taken will have an impact on loan growth as well. But to John's point, there is a lot of uncertainty that will be determined by the pace of the recovery. And Sanjay, just to build on that, the reserve is calculated at a point in time. And so we will go through a similar process next quarter. My guess is there will be a lot of ups and downs in economic forecast between now and then. And I would contrast that with in terms of how we make our credit decisions that is done on a near continuous basis in a much more granular level. And so we are looking by industry sector, we are looking by geographic area, we are making decisions on who we book, line assignment, how much employment verification we do. So I contrast the reserve calculation with how we are managing credit, which is near continuous. Yes, I mean I think all of the government stimulus provides a benefit, but given the depth of the decrease in economic activity, what we all really need is for the economy to start backup again and that will depend on the pace of re-openings in different states and is impossible for us to forecast as we sit here. Some of the traditional relationships may breakdown a bit a lot of initial unemployment claims have been driven by I would say entry level employees in retail restaurant other industries that may have less of a correlation with what we see in our prime card base s o there isn't necessarily even the same one-to-one interaction that we would have seen in previous downturns where the job mix was different and that job mix may change over time during this recession as well so I would summarize with the government programs are helpful but what we really need is the economy to get going again and so why this will depend on the pace of the recovery/ Okay. So big picture if the economic conditions continue to deteriorate there will be two dynamics that are likely to happen one would be CECL life of loan provisions would increase, so the allowance would increase we would also take appropriate actions to ensure that our portfolio was stable and that the lending activity we were doing made sense, so you could expect that the portfolio frankly might not increase and would actually decrease and if that was the case we would see some level of offset as a result of reserve releases tied to the portfolio size or the overall loan size so there is multiple dynamics there that come into play, but I hope that's conceptually helpful. Yes, it's Roger. Let me try it at a high level. As John described, for card, it's a 2 months program, up to 2 months for Skip-a-Pay, but they do 1 month less than 5% have renewed for the second month. So, we will see how that plays out over time. We do still have our program for customers that need a longer period of assistance. Regulators have been encouraging us and others to maximize the support we provide for customers, but again, I think it really does depend on the pace of recovery. As John pointed out, over 80% of those taking advantage of Skip-a-Pay are current. And so our hope would be and again that's why we have modeled it after some of the disaster relief programs we traditionally had that they will require a shorter bridge and then we will be able to get back to paying their builds, if not we have longer term programs to assist them. No, for those who have signed up for Skip-a-Pay, it does not impact their credit limits. There is a lot of speculation out there. In some ways, this is like a natural disaster, in other ways, there is a big debate in terms of the resurgence of economic activity that you get from rebuilding after disaster. You won't quite have that here. And so is the economic \u2013 people aren't going to go to twice as many restaurants. And so is that economic activity just lost? I would say probably while you don't have the degree of insurance payments, you do have an unprecedented amount of governmental assistance and my guess is you will continue to see additional programs. So that is probably bit of an offset compared to what you would have seen coming out of insurance. Thanks, Rick. I am sorry can you repeat the first part of that question? Utilization rates. So as you look at overall utilization rates for the portfolio, I think we show that the amount of contingent liability, i.e., the ratio of, which is kind of the opposite of utilization, is significantly down from prior years. So, one as part of the credit tightening that we have done over the last several years, a key component has been tightening contingent liability and tightening that exposure? Yes, thanks Moshe for the question. One of the things we're trying to do is keep an eye on the opportunity in this environment. And so even as we've made cuts we continue to make investments as well that will strengthen Discover, build the brand, and make sure we're in great shape for the future. So we're excited about the partnership with Quibi that just launched. Products such as our Miles Card where you have the ability to redeem at Amazon and PayPal, that's a lot more useful than programs that were structured just around travel. Our third quarter promotion is for restaurants, for the 5% program. We think that will resonate very, very well. And our rewards rate and product is really structured well for a wide variety of scenarios. So for example, issuers that have big sign up bonuses, they are having to extend the period to earn those because of the reduced level of retail sales and complaints from their customers where ours is just a flat match for the first year of spending. So we're very excited about where our products are positioned. We've talked a lot about the traction we're getting in deposits. I also think a lot of our messages really will resonate in this environment. Who wants to waste money on a credit card with an annual fee? And we're the only one with only no annual fee products. So we're really excited about some of the opportunities we're seeing in this environment. Yes, we are seeing \u2013 and some of it plays out in the personal loan space for example, some of the traditional competitors and the fin-techs who do not have robust funding models are cutting very, very aggressively. So even with reduced marketing, we're still hoping to generate good results. We get it at the time of underwriting so some of it can drift over time. It varies a bit by product. We have much better information for the personal loan customers, is an example. We don't have our student loan customers given they haven't been employed. So it does vary, but I would say, we have very strong for personal loans and a good amount on the card portfolio. I would say it really has to do with more technical differences between the nature of those two different stresses. A lot of it has to do with when a recovery comes in. So just comparing scenarios based on peak loss can give you different numbers. So I wouldn't say it's anything different we're seeing by asset class. It's more technical based on those scenarios. Yes, Betsy, they have to call in on the card side. Yes, I mean, I guess I would probably point to, a), people may have a better feel of what stress is coming their way even before they're actually unemployed and so they may have called us, knowing that their boss say, hey, we got one week left and then we're closing down. So there isn't necessarily that line of sight. The second thing, my personal view is unemployment claims have actually been gated by capacity to process as opposed to each week 6 million people are losing their jobs. And so, that's why we would have seen the bubble earlier, because we didn't have that same capacity constraint that I believe you've seen around unemployment claims. I would say, we talked about over for a card at least over 80% are current. They are relatively highly utilized in terms of the amount of balance. But there's actually a mix of some that are transactors as well historically in that. So that's probably the information we're willing to provide at this time. Bob, you are very hard to hear. Bob? Thanks, Maria. Everybody, thank you for your attention, your interest this morning and we will talk to you again as needed. Thanks."

            "name": "John Greene",
            "content": "Thank you, Roger and good morning everyone. Before I begin, I want to echo Roger's thanks to all the people working on the frontline through the pandemic. I also want to thank all of Discover associates. They have pivoted to a work from home environment, while maintaining their high service levels and professionalism throughout. Today, I will summarize the results for the quarter then provide details on our credit performance and loan provisions. I will conclude with an update on capital and funding trends before turning the call back over to Roger to summarize our COVID-19 response actions.In light of the uncertainty in the economy, we are withdrawing our previously provided guidance. But as Roger mentioned, we are targeting $400 million of cost reductions through the balance of the year with the majority in the second half. Our expense actions include reducing account acquisition expense, cutting spending on brand awareness and consideration activities, and reducing vendor and technology spend. We will continue to review all discretionary spending as the payback on incremental spend has changed.In the interest of focusing our comments this morning on the impacts of the pandemic and our responses, we are not going to review our customary slides on loan growth, payment volumes and revenue, so you can find additional disclosures on Slide 11 to 16 in the appendix to this presentation. And as always, we are happy to take questions on these or any other aspects of the quarterly results.On Slide 4, looking at key elements of the income statement, revenue, net of interest expense, increased 5% this quarter driven primarily by a 6% increase in average loans and a $35 million net gain in our payment services segment principally from the sale of a portion of an equity investment. Net interest margin was 10.21% for the first quarter. This was down 25 basis points year-over-year due largely to lower loan yields as a prime rate came down in response to Fed rate cuts in September and October of last year. This was partially offset by lower funding costs. The additional Fed rate cuts in March of this year will impact net interest margin beginning in the second quarter.Provisions for credit losses included net charge-off of $769 million, up 8% from last year and an increase in reserves of approximately $1 billion, reflecting a deterioration in the economic outlook. I will have some additional comments in credit in a moment, but before we turn to the next slide, I want to discuss operating expenses. They were up 13% from their prior year first quarter. The increase was principally due to higher compensation expense, increased marketing cost and investments in technology.Turning now to Slide 5 showing our key credit metrics, credit performance remained stable in the first quarter. We did not see any discernible impacts from the national COVID-19 containment activities or from our own credit mitigation actions in response. Card charge-offs increased 15 basis points from last year's quarter due principally to seasoning of loan growth. The credit card 30-plus delinquency rate was up 17 basis points from last year, but flat versus the prior quarter with both metrics reflecting consistent performance in typical seasonal patterns. Our private student loan and personal loan portfolios also had credit performance in the quarter with both showing slight improvements in charge-off and delinquency rates.On Slide 6, you will see our allowance for credit losses. We added $2.5 billion to the allowance for credit losses in January of this year as we transition to a life of loan CECL basis. At the end of the quarter, we added approximately $1 billion to the allowance largely due to changes in the macroeconomic forecast. The reserve build assumes unemployment rising to more than 9%, recovering through 2022 and a decline in GDP of nearly 18%. We also included our best estimate of reserve implications of the government stimulus programs. As the economic outlook evolves and the impacts of the various government relief programs become more clear, we will adjust our allowance accordingly.Turning to Slide 7, our common equity Tier 1 ratio increased 10 basis points sequentially, mainly due to a decrease in loan balances partially offset by capital returns. For purpose of calculating regulatory capital, we have elected to defer recognition of the CECL Day 1 adjustment for 2 years. So we will begin to phase in our Day 1 CECL impact in 2022 with 100% saved in by 2025. The federal banking regulators have also provided a phase in for the Day 2 impacts of CECL with 25% of the quarterly reserve build also being deferred until 2022 and then create the same as the Day 1 deferral. Our payout ratio, which includes buybacks, was 99% over the last 12 months.As Roger noted, we have suspended our share buyback program, but we will continue to fund our regular quarterly dividends. Our liquidity position remains very strong. As of the end of the quarter, we had $19 billion in liquid assets, $6 billion in committed borrowing capacity through privately placed asset-backed securitizations, and $35 billion in borrowing capacity at the Federal Reserve discount window. As of April 20, our liquid assets have grown to more than $23 billion. In addition to those forms of actual and committed liquidity, we have access to funding through our direct-to-consumer deposit channel with average deposits increasing 20% year-over-year and now making up over 55% of total funding. Based on the strength of consumer demand yesterday, we reduced rates on our savings account by 10 basis points and will continue to look for opportunities to do so.In summary, good progress on the expense front. Liquidity is robust. Capital remains strong and we continue to monitor and manage our credit exposure. And now I will turn the call back over to Roger. Okay. Thanks Bob. This is John. I will take a shot at that. So there is a wide degree of economic forecast that we took a look at while we are building our models and ultimately our allowance. So what we have built in was unemployment peaking at 9% and staying relatively high through the balance of this year. So about 7% through the end of the year and then it recovers slowly through 2022, so not expecting a real quick recovery and rather slow in our allowances as reflected that dynamic as we modeled it out. The loan \u2013 and your second part of your question on loan growth, the loan growth will be depending on how we see the economy and the recovery proceeding. As Roger mentioned in his comments, we have been cautious coming into this cycle. And when the pandemic hit we have pulled back further, so loan growth will be subject to essentially the recovery of the economy. Okay. Thank you. So there is, as I said in my response to last question is, there is a wide degree of variation on the estimate. So when we put this together, we were looking at what a likely scenario was. Now, the economic backdrop continues to evolve. So we certainly did consider that. There are some overlays related to how we think about recoveries. And certainly, we did put a mild overlay in for the government stimulus programs, but it is uncertain. And if the economy deteriorates further and we don't see a recovery that will have reserve implications if it runs out as we have modeled that will also play through into the balance sheet in the P&L. So, I know I am not being real specific on your answer, but at this point given the uncertainty, this was our best estimate. In terms of your second part of your question on Skip-a-Pay, so that \u2013 the nature of that program is for card is that an inbound call will happen. The customer, if they are impacted by COVID will get an automatic basically payment deferral. They won't have to make the payment. If they call back second time, they can get a second deferral on the payment. And after that, they would either pay and go current or continue to kind of roll into delinquency buckets and ultimately charge-offs. So as we provisioned we thought about life of loan provisions and feel like we did a reasonably good job of capturing the dynamics on the portfolio. The one impact on Skip-a-Pay is that if the customer is in trouble and is unable to pay, it will result in up to a 2-month deferral into charge-off just by the nature of how things roll, but I do want to point that just over 80% of those customers who entered into to the Skip-a-Pay program were current at that time. Yes. So there is a number of factor and I am not trying to be elusive here, Sanjay, but unemployment and GDP contraction are obviously key inputs. The duration of the slowdown will also be important. Geographic input impacts are important. Job classes are important. So ultimately, it will be a matter of the pace of the recovery, but just to go back and clarify my remarks, so we assumed just over 9% unemployment levels at a peak and then a very, very slow recovery in 2020 and then coming into 2022? There is a couple of important pieces related to the portfolio that changed. So Roger mentioned this in his comments in terms of the open to buy. So, the open to buy has reduced by about $54 billion from the last recession to this recession. Average FICO scores in the portfolio have increased between 500 and 600 basis points, which is a material change. Our underwriting frankly is far more sophisticated than it was 10 years ago. And frankly, the actions that this business undertook when the pandemic started to actually drive some real difficult employment numbers, was drastic and very, very quick. So, I don't know if there is a perfect corollary between the last recession and this recession time will tell, but certainly, I feel like the business is well positioned and took decisive action. And again if the economic outlook changes, we will adjust the reserves and the allowance accordingly. So, real difficult to answer at this point. So, we are going to monitor the economy and our portfolio and actually how our customers are performing and make appropriate calls on reserve builds in subsequent quarters. In terms of the government stimulus programs, the impact that we have modeled was relatively modest so I don't know if I would go to a full percentage point on charge offs but there was a mild impact and as we see that on full it will become more clear. The key thing on the stimulus programs at least initially was would be unemployment checks going out in the $600 as a benefit that's a front loaded impact and we will have to see how things develop on the back half of the year. So, we are still [Technical Difficulty] pattern to emerge and part of it is driven by the drastic reduction in sales volume that you have seen. But I would say that reduction in sales is relatively equal across transactors and revolvers. And so it's balanced in that way, but what happens with payment rate, I think will be determined on how quickly those sales ramp up, some people making larger payments and you can see from the inflow into our deposit products, there are lot of households were still okay, but are looking to fortify their position. So I think it's too early to really pick out a pattern in terms of the impact of all these changes on payment rate. Yes. So I think supply and demand are starting to come into balance, but it's going to take another quarter or so. The appetite for our deposit products has actually been very, very good. We have traditionally been second or third on the bank rate table. We have been \u2013 recently been a little bit more aggressive on the downward side based on the overall demand for our products. So I think certain people are coming out of equities and looking for a safe place to put their cash. I think other folks have looked at our offerings and our service levels and decided that we are a good spot and they have chosen us. So as we look forward in future, I will say, future quarters, it will be subject to a couple of things. So the supply and the demand factors, what our competitors are doing and then obviously our performance, but we look to kind of move on the deposit pricing to actually pullback some of the NIM that was impacted by the Fed actions. No, thank you. Yes, that was off the previous guidance. And as we said when we issued it was \u2013 it would be based on a strict payback analysis. So are we going to get long-term returns for the incremental investment with the economic backdrop changing we of course made the appropriate decisions. Okay. So we didn't see any impact in the quarter from the said reductions at the end of March. So there is about 150 basis points of reduction. So we have \u2013 we are not giving guidance but I am going to give you a couple of points in terms of how to think about it. So the 150 basis points hit, there is an impact for three quarters of the year on that. Our deposit betas have traditionally been about 50%. We took some proactive steps early in the year reducing overall deposit rates by 20 basis points to 50 basis points depending on the product. And then we are pulling back on the promo mix, which should also help rates. So you put those factors together and I think it draws a picture of how our NIM could look for the year. Now the quarterly trends are going to be a little bit different based on what's happening in the particular quarter on revolver and transactor mix. Yes, that's a good question. Some of it could be related to the government stimulus programs and then it could be just the cycle. We do expect the trend to decline and then a modest pick up as they approach into the second month for certain customers, but we will have to see. Yes, hey, Bob, I am sorry, hey, this is John. Stay safe. Thank you."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2021 Discover Financial Services Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. . I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Eric Wasserstrom, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nEric Wasserstrom: Thank you, Britney, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to this morning's call. I'll begin on Slide 2 of our earnings  find in the Financials section of our Investor Relations website, investorrelations.discover.com. Our discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. Please refer to our notices regarding forward-looking statements that appear in our fourth quarter earnings press release and presentation. Our call today will include remarks from our CEO, Roger Hochschild; and John Green, our Chief Financial Officer. After we conclude our formal comments, there will be time for a question-and-answer session. During the Q&A session, you will be permitted to ask one question, followed by one follow-up question. After your follow-up question, please return to the queue.  Now, it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Roger.\nRoger Hochschild: Thanks, Eric, and thanks to our listeners for joining today's call. I'll begin by reviewing the highlights and key metrics for the year, then John will take you through the details of our fourth quarter results and our perspectives on 2022. 2021 was another year of unique challenges related to the pandemic, and I'm very pleased that once again, the Discover team was able to successfully execute against our business priorities in a fluid operating environment. This was evident in our fourth quarter results which were the capstone to an outstanding year. For the fourth quarter, we earned $1.1 billion after tax or $3.64 per share; and for the full year, $5.4 billion after tax or $17.83 per share. These results underscore the strength of our differentiated model and were achieved as we continue to make meaningful enhancements to our capabilities and invest for future growth. Let me share a few examples from this past year. Throughout 2021, we continue to make advancements to our data and analytics platform, enhancing our capabilities in areas including targeting, collections and fraud detection. We also made investments in machine learning to provide faster and better insights to improve customer personalization. And we continue to modernize our infrastructure and build out our hybrid cloud platform. We also opened a new customer care center in Chatham, a vibrant African-American community on Chicago South side. Once fully operational, the center will provide nearly 1,000 full-time jobs. Our Chatham Center challenges the traditional notions of corporate site selection, has helped us connect with a talented pool of diverse candidates and suppliers, is transforming how we approach diversity, equity and inclusion and it is already performing at an industry-leading level. We hope our commitment to Chatham will serve as a springboard for further economic development in other areas that have long been denied opportunity. Slide 4 of our presentation captures another important element of our results, which was our pivot into new account acquisition as the economic recovery took hold in late 2020 and early 2021. In the face of intensifying competition, our value proposition of cashback rewards, no annual fee and industry-leading service remain very attractive to consumers. The strong level of card acquisition contributed to our return to loan growth over the second half of last year. In payments, we continue to expand our business, increase network volume and establish new strategic partnerships. We expanded global acceptance and announced new network alliances in Portugal, Bahrain, Jordan and Malaysia that will benefit us as cross-border travel recovers. We remain committed to building out our international acceptance, and we'll continue to make investments to expand our reach. Our record earnings through the year generated significant capital, which we continue to put to good use. In addition to our investments in acquisition, brands, technology and people, we also returned significant capital to shareholders through dividends and buybacks by repurchasing $2.3 billion of common stock and increasing our quarterly dividend by 14%. As we look forward into 2022, I'm very optimistic about the trajectory of our business. While macroeconomic conditions created strong tailwinds this past year, we acted on opportunities to strengthen our business, actions that will drive long-term value this year and beyond. We start the new year in an excellent position, and I'm confident that our integrated digital banking and payments model will continue to create long-term value for our shareholders and customers. I'll now ask John to discuss key aspects of our quarterly financial results in more detail.\nJohn Greene: Thank you, Roger, and good morning, everyone. As we review our fourth quarter results, I echo Roger's point that the actions we took last year position us for strong performance in 2022 and beyond. I'll begin with our financial summary on Slide 5. Our strong fourth quarter results were characterized by accelerating receivable growth, provision leverage and increased investments in marketing and brand. Revenue, net of interest expense, increased 4% from the prior year. Excluding a $139 million unrealized loss on our equity investments, total revenue was up 9%. Net interest income increased 4% driven by growth in average receivables and an 18 basis point improvement in our net interest margin, which was sequentially flat at 10.81%. Our NIM trend reflects the continued benefit from decreased funding cost and lower interest charge-offs, though these were partially offset in the fourth quarter by a higher mix of promotional rate balances. The growth in receivables was largely driven by card, which was up 4% year-over-year and 6% sequentially. The primary drivers of year-over-year growth were continued strong sales volume and significant new account growth throughout 2021, which was up 23% year-over-year and 13% versus 2019. As has been the case for most of last year, a significant portion of the benefits from strong sales and new accounts was offset by the sustained high payment rate. The payment rate leveled off during the quarter but remains approximately 500 basis points above pre-pandemic levels. We currently expect that the payment rate will decline slightly over the course of 2022. However, our expectations for card receivable growth is robust, as I'll detail in a few moments. Our student loan portfolio also contributed to our growth. Organic student loans were up 4% over the prior year, benefiting from the return to in-person learning in 2021. We continue to gain share in this product and are well positioned for continued organic expansion. Personal loans decreased 3% year-over-year, mainly driven by high payment rates, but were sequentially flat as we returned our underwriting criteria to pre-pandemic levels. The second significant driver of our revenue growth was higher net discount/interchange revenue, which increased $103 million or 43%, driven by a 25% increase in sales volume year-over-year. The strong volume has continued into this year. Sales are up 24% through the first half of January. One significant item that relates to our net discount and interchange revenue is our rewards cost, and having covered most of our key revenue drivers, I'll point your attention to the reward rate reflected on Slide 8. We continue to benefit from strong card member engagement with our cashback rewards program. Our rewards costs increased versus last year on higher sales volume. However, the reward rate declined 3 basis points year-over-year and 9 basis points sequentially. This reflects the benefit of our integrated model and our discipline in managing the program while delivering substantial value to card members and merchant partners. For the full year 2021, our rewards rate was 1.37%, up 2 basis points from the prior year. Consistent with the historical trend, we expect about 2 basis points to 4 basis points of annual rewards cost inflation, driven mostly by shifts in mix. Now, I'd like to spend a moment speaking about expense trends on Slide 9. Total operating expenses increased $34 million or 3% year-over-year. Focusing on the most significant items here, marketing expense was up $112 million as we continue to invest in new account growth and brand marketing with the launch of our new media campaign, which went live across all channels in the quarter. This pushed our marketing expense towards the top end of our previously guided range. Employee compensation was down $5 million year-over-year, driven mainly by a $26 million charge last year. Excluding this, our comp expense was up 4% year-over-year, driven largely by a higher bonus accrual. Information processing was down $73 million year-over-year and professional fees increased as a result of higher recovery fees. Moving to credit on Slide 10, the net charge-off rate improved to 1.37% in the quarter, a decrease of 101 basis points year-over-year and a 9 basis point improvement from the prior quarter. Net charge-off dollars were down 218 million from the prior year and decreased 12 million sequentially. Strong credit performance continued across all products. Card net charge-offs were down 113 basis points from the prior year and personal loans were 158 basis points lower. Student loan charge-offs increased slightly but remained very low at 0.8%. Moving to the allowance for credit losses on Slide 11, our reserve rate continued to decline, dropping 38 basis points to 7.3%. Two factors contributed to the decrease in reserve rate. First, we released $50 million from reserves during the quarter, driven by the continued strong credit performance of our portfolio and the relative stability of the macroeconomic outlook. These factors were partially offset by the 5% increase in total loans from the prior quarter. Our future reserves will be dictated by our portfolio credit trends, our receivable growth and any changes to our macroeconomic assumptions. Looking at Slide 12, we remain extremely well capitalized and above our 10.5% target with a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 14.8%. We continue to demonstrate our commitment of returning capital to shareholders as we executed on our share repurchase plan and bought back $773 million of common stock in the quarter and paid a dividend of $0.50 per share. Looking at funding, average consumer deposits decreased 3% year-over-year and declined 1% sequentially. This sequential decline was driven by a 5% decrease in consumer CDs, while savings and money market deposits increased slightly. We managed our excess liquidity down throughout 2021 and finished the year with consumer deposits representing 68% of total funding. We will continue to target 70% to 80% of funding from the starts. Moving to Slide 13 where we'll provide some perspectives on 2022. We entered the year in a very strong position, and our outlook reflects this. We expect loan growth in the high single digits. This view is based on current expectations of sales trends and the contribution from recently acquired accounts, combined with a very modest decline in the payment rate. We believe this view of payment rates substantially derisked our loan growth forecast. We expect our NIM rate to be relatively in line with the full year of 2021 and with quarter-to-quarter variability. We expect to benefit from higher loan yields with rising interest rates. This may be offset by other factors, including a higher mix of promotional rate balances, some degree of credit normalization and higher deposit rates, which will be subject to funding needs and competitive dynamics. Turning to expenses, we expect our total GAAP expenses will increase at a mid-single-digit rate this year. We'll continue to invest for growth as we see profitable opportunities and currently expect that our marketing investments will be above 2019 levels. Outside of marketing, we expect operating costs to increase at a low single-digit percent level, reflecting disciplined expense control. Our commitment to positive operating leverage over the medium term remains a priority. We expect net credit losses will average in the range of 2.2% to 2.6% for the full year. As credit normalizes from historically low levels in 2021, we expect net charge-offs to increase sequentially over the course of the year. Lastly, we remain committed to returning substantial capital to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. As of this week, we had approximately $780 million remaining on our share repurchase authorization that expires at the end of March and expect to announce a new share repurchase authorization next quarter. In summary, we had an excellent fourth quarter and full year with accelerating loan growth driven by robust account acquisition and strong sales volumes, excellent credit performance and a reduction in the reserve rate, disciplined management of operating cost and sustained return of excess capital to shareholders. I'm exceptionally pleased with Discover's execution against our business priorities in 2021. Our value proposition continues to resonate with consumers. We prudently invested for growth, resulting in significant new account growth and strong sales. We continue to optimize our funding mix and actively manage core deposit costs. These actions and the improved macroeconomic outlook have positioned us well. With that, I'll turn the call back to our operator, Britney, to open the line for Q&A.\nOperator: . We'll take our first question from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse.\nMoshe Orenbuch: Thanks and congratulations on pretty strong numbers here. Maybe just focus on the account growth, it was up 11%. Could you talk about like how that compares in terms of just raw numbers of accounts to where you would have been pre-pandemic in the cost? And anything you've done kind of from a difference in channel or credit box to get there?\nRoger Hochschild: Yes, we don't disclose the number of new accounts. But what I would say in terms of credit, our card credit policies are pretty much on top of where they were pre-pandemic. Costs have gone up since the low levels that we saw during the pandemic as we sort of kept marketing and a lot of others pulled back. But I would say, as we look forward into 2022, our expectation is that the cost per account will be roughly where it was pre-pandemic.\nMoshe Orenbuch: And just as a follow-up, very pleased to hear that the commitment to operating leverage and the numbers you put out there would suggest kind of an upper single-digit revenue growth rate and a mid-single-digit expense growth rate. Could you talk about even if it's unlikely, what would happen to your expense expectations if revenue growth just didn't materialize? Like how would you make adjustments there?\nJohn Greene: Yes. Hey, Moshe, I'll take that one. So we'll react based on the company performance and opportunities that we see in the marketplace. So, over the past couple of years, I feel like the team has done a really, really good job in terms of making calls, in terms of expense allocations. We'll continue to do that to make sure that we're positioned for growth and marching towards the positive operating leverage that we talked about.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Mark DeVries with Barclays.\nMark DeVries: Could you give us a little more color about what you're seeing in credit right now? I mean, I think the guidance around charge-offs calls for some pretty meaningful normalization in 2022. And what kind of gets you to the low end of that guidance range and what gets you to the high end?\nJohn Greene: Great. Mark, thanks for the questions. So what we're seeing in the portfolio is really, really strong performance. I think the numbers in the quarter demonstrate that. We are seeing some difference between higher FICO and lower FICO account performance overall within expectations. So what we're projecting here is a slow normalization of credit, and in terms of the guidance that we reflected here, we've got pretty good line of sight to the first 6 months, just as the accounts will go through the normal roll rates and gives us an ability to predict quite accurately. Once we get out beyond 6 months, we rely more heavily on our models and the models themselves are built with a number of assumptions. '21 was -- frankly, was a tough year to call based on how we had designed our models and what actually happened in the portfolio. So what we decided to do is give, from my standpoint, a relatively broad range that we think over time we'll be able to tighten. And in terms of lower end versus higher end, strong portfolio performance, the slight difference that we saw between the higher FICO and the lower FICOs, that continuing to kind of roll out as we expect. And a positive macro environment should bring us towards the lower end.\nMark DeVries: Just a follow-up on that. On the model that you use, is there some element of just mean reversion when charge-offs are this low relative to kind of normal that will push your estimates higher even if kind of all the macro drivers seem like they're more of a tailwind than a headwind?\nJohn Greene: Yes. There is a level of mean revision in there in the second part of the year. And just -- one other piece of, I'll say, information, so you can think about the breakout, at least this is how we thought about it, of charge-offs, the predominant piece in the second half of the year. So you can think 45-55 split between first half and second half. And we'll continue to update that over the year.\nOperator: We will take our next question from John Hecht with Jefferies.\nJohn Hecht: Just thinking about NIM. Understanding you guys are guiding for a relatively flat NIM this year, but even thinking this year and beyond given that we're in a rate hike cycle you're in -- I guess, the last cycle was 2015 to 2019, and your card yields went up about 50% of the Fed funds changes and prime changes, and your cost of capital went -- or your deposits went up a little less than that. I'm just wondering as we go into this rate cycle, should we expect any differences in that kind of -- in that call it, NIM input range, is there any mix shift in the deposits that will cause the betas to be different there or is there any different policies with respect to zero balance transfers that we should think about just in terms of the quarter-to-quarter fluctuations as the government or the Fed raises rates?\nJohn Greene: Yes, it's actually a pretty complex question there. So rather than try to hit each of the elements, I'll give you a view in terms of how we thought about NIM for 2021. So we do expect some impact to NIM from credit normalization. We also -- we also are expecting a higher mix of BT and promotional balances, which will also impact net interest margin. We do get nice fees from that, but certainly, net interest margin will be impacted. The revolve rate as the payment rate starts to normalize, we'll see some benefits there. Fed funds rate changes, we plan for 2, 2 in the year. If there's more, that will create some upside. And in terms of impact there, you could expect per Fed change somewhere between 3 bps and 5 bps on a total year basis on NIM depending on timing. And then funding, we're still going to see some funding benefit from the actions we did to optimize our debt stack in '20 and '21. So from that standpoint, it gets us to about flat, but there's a lot of moving pieces. In terms of deposit pricing, there's still a wide gap between where we're priced and the brick-and-mortar banks are priced. So somewhere close to 45 basis points. Now the digital banks, most have increased deposit pricing, about 10 basis points over the past 3 to 4 weeks. We're a lagger on that. At some point, our funding needs and competitive dynamics will be such that we'll take a look and make appropriate changes and we'll do that throughout the year. So the deposit betas, specifics around that, I would rather think about competitive dynamics and funding needs in order to get a view on how we're going to price deposits on the up cycle.\nJohn Hecht: A follow-up question, I guess, unrelated is, you're in the zone of where you were on your allowance levels as we entered post CECL implementation and pandemic era. Are we at a point now where you kind of say this is the new base for ALL ex changes that are economic forecast? Or is there any kind of further room for allowance bleeds tied to increases during the last couple of years?\nJohn Greene: Yes. So we go through a pretty robust process every single quarter to make sure that our reserves are fairly stated under GAAP. Now when we did CECL day 1, we had -- we were seeing charge-offs in the low 3s, and we ended up posting reserve rate of, I think it was 6.09%. So as we look at where we are today, where it's at around 7.2, assuming strong credit performance and a positive macroeconomic outlook, my sense is that there is some opportunity to take that reserve rate closer to day 1.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Rick Shane with JPMorgan.\nRichard Shane: I'm actually curious if there's some sort of 80-20 rule that impacts payment rate. What I'm curious is, if you guys have done any analysis on revolve versus transaction behavior differing by spending categories specifically like everyday spend versus large episodic spend. And I'm wondering if what we're seeing in terms of payment rates with all the other factors is being impacted by BNPL.\nJohn Greene: Yes. I wouldn't say there's an 80-20 rule on payment rate. So quite honestly, as we looked at it, in 2021, we didn't call the curve right. And so what we did in the '22 guidance is assumed a very modest decrease in payment rate. We felt like that derisked our loan growth. In terms of kind of behaviors between revolvers and transactors, that payment rate's been relatively consistent. The 1 difference in our portfolio is the new accounts that we originated in 2020 tended to be higher FICOs. So more of those tend to transact versus revolve. But we'll see as the liquidity ends up getting used in the overall economy and what that does to payment rates. So we've modeled it multiple different ways. There's really no standard rule of thumb. It's frankly somewhat dynamic in terms of what we're seeing month-to-month and quarter-to-quarter.\nRoger Hochschild: And just to build on that, we look pretty carefully by merchant, by customer segment. There's nothing to support a view that buy now, pay later is having any impact on payment rate.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.\nSanjay Sakhrani: First question, I guess, for Roger, just on the competitive backdrop. Obviously, we've gotten bank earnings and a lot of the large banks are talking about investing more in marketing, and you guys have some pretty aggressive growth targets. How should we think about sort of the risks to that target given the competitive backdrop?\nRoger Hochschild: Good question, Sanjay. As I mentioned earlier, our forecast for next year is cost per account, relatively flat to where it was before the pandemic. And so I think this sort of focus on competition is a little bit overblown. The card business is just always competitive. You have big players with good capabilities. Each issuer out there has their set of products, set of channels. And I think some natural limits on how much money they can be put to work effectively. So I don't see it as a particularly high risk to our 2022 growth forecast. And we have a very differentiated product, we're seeing good benefits on the acquisition side, from our investments in analytics. So we feel good even in the current environment.\nSanjay Sakhrani: And I guess I have one for John. The noninterest income revenue line has done quite well over the course of this year, even excluding -- obviously, excluding the investment gains. Could you just talk about what kind of growth we should expect in that line going forward?\nJohn Greene: Yes. So the big driver there was obviously discount and interchange revenue, which was up 28% year-over-year and then after rewards cost 43% in the quarter. So super strong growth there, which that will generally run consistent with sales, and we're expecting sales not to stay in the mid 20s, but kind of come down to kind of strong double-digits and then into weaker double-digits by the fourth quarter. I don\u2019t know if that's right or not, it seems like there's been a lot of benefit from the new account acquisition and also where our card has been positioned with people's wallets. So that's been positive. There's also the factor that people are using less cash and charging more. So that'll continue to benefit sales, interchange and net discount and interchange.  In terms of the other items, the amount of cash in the economy actually helped cash advance fees which was positive. And our expectation is that we'll have outside of discount and interchange growth, growth fairly similar to net interest income. \nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. \nBetsy Graseck: One, maybe it's a little bit of a theoretical question, but I'm just trying to understand how you are thinking about borrower capacity, the borrowing capacity of your customer set relative to pre-COVID. And I am asking the question because, jobs more available, wages rising. So that seems like they might have more capacity to borrow, but then we've got inflation increasing. So how do you think through those things?\nRoger Hochschild: It will, of course, vary by segment. But certainly, households that are seeing rising incomes will have a greater ability for debt service. And for many households, that's how they determine how much debt they take on. It's complicated a bit by some households still having pent-up savings from strong earnings and not many opportunities to spend. And of course, other costs going up, whether it's child care or day-to-day expenses, on 1 hand, will drive increases in sales. But on the other hand, decreases disposable income for debt service. So a mix of factors, but we, net-net, we'd expect strong consumer demand for credit next year.\nBetsy Graseck: Okay. And then as I'm thinking about the other legs of the loan growth platform here, student loan and personal, could you talk through how you see those drivers impacting the 2022 growth guide that you've got?\nRoger Hochschild: Sure. So student loans, we feel really good about where we're positioned in the market, our products, our brand, our ability to take share. What's a bit the wildcard is just enrollment. And I think enrollments were down year-over-year, which was a surprise to, I think, the entire higher education industry. There's a bit of a correlation, the stronger the job market fewer people decide to pursue an education because they're making too much outside. So I think it will be more that factor, and we'll see peak season. But I'm confident in our ability to continue gaining share. For personal loans, we took a little longer to return to pre-pandemic credit criteria for that product, just given the higher volatility. But as John said, quarter-over-quarter, we're now flat. And so we would expect that to return to growth in 2022.\nBetsy Graseck: And the balance transfer activity, there's a bit of a link between personal and card. I know balance transfer comes before personal loan growth, but how's that legging in at this stage? Is that -- has there been a take-up beginning there yet or is that more of a back half '22 outlook?\nRoger Hochschild: So John talked about promotional balances as having an impact on NIM. I would say a lot of that is driven by new accounts. So as you ramp up new accounts, you'll see that, but also portfolio activity as well.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Kevin Barker with Piper Sandler.\nKevin Barker: Given your growth rates that you're projecting out there, I mean do you feel like you can achieve sub-40% efficiency ratio sometime in the foreseeable future, whether it be run rate close to late '22, maybe early 2023?\nJohn Greene: We specifically commented on positive operating leverage. So as we deliver that, obviously, the efficiency ratio will improve. My expectation is that we can get into the high 30s within the medium term. So we built the plan essentially contemplating significant investment in marketing and then working through the other elements of the cost structure in order to create as much efficiency and capacity to drive new growth. As that model continues to build upon itself, my expectation is that those high 30 numbers are certainly very, very achievable.\nKevin Barker: And then a follow-up on some of your comments around credit. I believe you said you expect it to increase sequentially throughout the year. Did I hear that correctly? And then I mean, could you just give us a little bit more detail on your expectations for the cadence of net charge-offs, given we're at an exceptionally low level? And typically, you have quite a bit of seasonality. Can you just give us a little bit more color around your expected cadence on charge-offs throughout the year?\nJohn Greene: Yes. So it will be difficult to expand more deeply upon the comments that I've already made. So we do expect it to increase sequentially. There is some degree of seasonality I don't view that as like a material driver to what we're going to be seeing. And I also mentioned that the charge-offs are more first half of the year, and that we've got pretty decent line of sight to the first half. So that's split out somewhere around 45 first half, 55 second half is probably as deep as I can go on the charge-off numbers right now.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo.\nDon Fandetti: Roger, as you come out of the pandemic, I was just curious if there's any areas of strategic interest, new products, et cetera, that you're looking at. It's been pretty consistent for the last several years.\nRoger Hochschild: Yes. Certainly, we're always looking for new opportunities on the payment side of our business. And there, the versatility of our capabilities, you saw some of that with our partnership with Sezzle in terms of our ability to provide easier connectivity to merchants. So on the payment side, both in the U.S. and globally, we're looking for opportunities. On the card side, we feel really good about the product set we have. We are virtually 100% focused on consumer. I think there is a huge opportunity to continue to grow our non-card products. And so we talked about investing more in marketing our deposit products before the pandemic. Clearly, when we were in a significant excess liquidity position. It didn't make sense to put a lot of marketing behind deposits. But that's something I would expect to see in 2022.\nDon Fandetti: And any changes on your international acceptance push? Or is it sort of you just kind of inch your way into growth?\nRoger Hochschild: We continue to push out. I think what you heard in the call, our favorite way of expanding internationally through network-to-network partnerships. It is just much more cost-effective than working with individual acquirers, although we do that as well. There's also a big focus on acceptance in the U.S. around the migration to digital. So working with other networks on secure remote commerce, everything from transit implementations, but again, we're now up to 26 net-to-net partnerships, and feel that there's room to continue growing recently announced a partnership in Serbia actually this week.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Dominick Gabriele with Oppenheimer.\nDominick Gabriele: I just want to follow up on one of the answers you had before. Do you think that the ability to reach more customers and spur spend through marketing has an overall direct relationship between which FICO band or income level these customers have? And is this why you think perhaps there could be those diminishing returns on marketing investment at perhaps slightly different overall rates between what customer base 1 issuer may have versus another? And I have a follow-up.\nRoger Hochschild: Yes. I don't think we said we expected diminishing returns on marketing. Credit is pretty similar to what it was pre-pandemic and I mentioned our projected cost per account. And a lot of our marketing does go to new accounts. Cost per account, we're projecting that to be pretty much on top of where it was pre-pandemic. Different issuers certainly have different business models. There's one who's particularly focused on subprime, others are much more aggressive at the super prime. We have been very clear for many, many years that ours is a lend-focused business going after that prime revolver segment. We've tailored our products for that, our underwriting capabilities. And again, we feel very good about the return we're getting on the dollars we spend in marketing.\nDominick Gabriele: And can you maybe talk about how the competitive landscape is evolving and what products are likely to either meaningfully compete, not ultimately compete and somewhat compete with your everyday spend credit card products? And perhaps maybe which spend categories may be most of that competition could reside versus least likely?\nRoger Hochschild: Yes. I think clearly, what everyone's watching is buy now pay later. As I mentioned earlier, we haven't seen that have a noticeable impact on our base. In my mind, it's closer to traditional sales finance. So there have always been competing products out there, whether it's on the private label side, whether it's personal loans for debt consolidation, et cetera. So we focus on getting a broad mix of spend. Even through this year, we're seeing strong performance across every category. Travel is holding up actually in January surprisingly well, given the state of that pandemic. So we think we'll continue to grow across categories. And in fact, as one of the beauties of our 5% program, it sort of reinforces different categories of spend on a rotating basis as opposed to products that are really particularly tailored to an individual category of spend.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Robert Napoli with William Blair.\nRobert Napoli: Roger, John, nice quarter. I really like the guide on loan growth versus expense growth. Just on the expense growth side, I mean, if you -- there's a lot of investment going on in certainly at some of the major banks on technology. And I know that Discover has invested in technology over the years. I would just -- maybe just your thought process on where your tech stack stands, is -- your thoughts on private cloud versus public cloud and the need to invest to compete over the next several years?\nRoger Hochschild: Yes, good question. I think our perspective may be a little different than some of the big banks. And of course, we have a narrower range of businesses. So I can't really comment on some of their investment. Certainly, we are focused on competing with the fintechs, but it's not just about spending money. It reminds me of -- it's like someone saying, I'm just going to keep eating more and more until I lose weight. The competition -- those fintechs are not spending more on technology. Our focus is around capabilities, it's on agility, it's on speed to market. And so if you look at last year, once you sort of sort through for onetime items, technology spend was relatively flat, but that doesn't mean there wasn't a huge focus around our capabilities. We've talked about our investments in data and analytics. So it's really more about speed, and you don't get there just through sheer dollars of spending.\nRobert Napoli: And I guess -- I mean, I guess private cloud versus public cloud and the importance of your cloud strategy\u2026\nRoger Hochschild: Yes, so great question. We're focused on a hybrid cloud strategy, so a mix of both. I think there's -- sometimes companies seem to take a purist element that there's something great about having 100% of your applications on the cloud, whether or not your GL resides on the cloud, it\u2019s not going to really make a difference for your business. But we are heavy users of the public cloud, in particular, for our data and analytics areas where the speed and massive amounts of storage are critically important.\nRobert Napoli: And if I could just sneak in, your spend growth was really strong. How much of that is inflation? But what are your thoughts on inflation and how it affects your business, and the impact that maybe it's having on the spend growth numbers you reported, which were pretty strong?\nJohn Greene: Yes, Bob, I'll take that. We've been really pleased with the sales running through the card. The inflation has had a small impact. So you think kind of on average, maybe 1% to 2% in \u201821. In \u201822, we didn't model that out specifically. My sense is it would be 2%.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Mihir Bhatia with Bank of America.\nMihir Bhatia: Maybe first, I just wanted to go back and just clarify a little bit about your guidance. I just want to make sure I understand some of the key assumptions embedded in there. So first, like on payment rates, I think you said you expect it to slightly decline a little bit in 2022. And I was wondering, if we were to see normalization happen a little bit faster, let's say, they normalize back to the normalized levels in 2022, would that push your loan growth up to like low double-digits or am I -- or is that like too ambitious in terms of like the impact? What I'm trying to understand is the impact of the payment rate on loan growth there? And then just also related to just this guidance question just on rate hikes, and I apologize if I missed this in your earlier comments. Did you say how many rate hikes or how many basis points you were assuming in your guidance?\nJohn Greene: Yes. So we assumed -- thanks for the questions. We assumed 2 rate hikes in our guidance. And in terms of payment rate, as I said, very modest improvement, so -- or a reduction. So if payment rate were to normalize at the pace you just described, which I don't think it will, but if it were to do that, it would certainly be very accretive to the loan growth. I'm not going to get into specifics whether it takes us to double-digits or not.\nMihir Bhatia: Okay, no, I understand. That's helpful though. And then just wanted to -- the other question I will ask is just about understanding your credit underwriting or risk appetite currently, you did mention normalization is happening maybe a little bit more on the lower FICOs. Have you tweaked your underwriting or marketing in the last few weeks or quarters in response to that or is it still very much as expected, so it's all systems go?\nRoger Hochschild: Yes. No, we haven't. And I think it's important to note that the life of loan losses, assumptions we use for new account underwriting is not driven by where losses are currently. So John  all portfolio performance and what we're seeing. But we use sort of by segment and actually by individual account forecasts of life of loan as we determine our marketing and credit criteria.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Bill Carcache with Wolfe Research.\nBill Carcache: Is there any reason to be concerned about the pace of credit normalizing faster than receivables growth?\nJohn Greene: From my perspective, no, and I'll tell you why. First, the macros are the macroeconomic conditions that are super positive, right? So there's more job openings than there are people looking for jobs. The consumers will have more dollars into their paycheck as a result of this inflation. And there is a substantial amount of savings still left in the economy from -- largely from kind of change in behaviors and government stimulus. So I'm not frankly seeing that as a risk in 2023 -- excuse me, 2022. As we get out into 2023, there's less certainty around that.\nBill Carcache: Maybe a related follow-up, there's a lot of consternation around NCOs normalizing higher, but do you think that the environment that we're in today, where you're seeing the revenue benefits from the accelerating loan growth that you're putting up on 1 hand, and then also on top of that, you've also got the reserve rate remaining well above day 1 levels. And so when you think about the risk of growth, headwinds and the need to build reserves on that strong loan growth that you're seeing, the risk that, that overwhelms the revenue benefits from the loan growth and the fact that the reserve rate is higher, can you talk to that interplay and how you're thinking about that?\nJohn Greene: Yes. So when we -- let me start with the reserves because it plays into the rest of your question. So when we looked at reserves for the quarter, what we wanted to see was the impact of the ending, the end of most of the government support programs. Most ended in September. So we had 1 quarter worth of data. We looked at it, we saw no real change to the portfolio dynamics. We're hoping to see another quarter and then reevaluate overall reserve rate. But that day 1 number and the -- I'll say, the normalized charge-offs in the 3s would support a view that down the road, we'll have some opportunity on reserves. In terms of new vintages and the kind of charge-off impacts from those, this company has been through years and years of cycles with new vintages. We're very thoughtful in terms of how we do the underwriting. We've got some improvements from the -- within underwriting from the advanced analytic tools that we've put in place. So my sense is a portfolio seasons, we're going to see some increase in charge-offs, but well within the expectations of how we underwrite and well within the expectations of this guidance and the macroeconomic outlook.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Meng Jiao with Deutsche Bank.\nMengxian Jiao: I wanted to follow up with the question on the competitive environment. We've seen a few competitors coming in with new offerings. And I was sort of hoping for some more color as to whether you've seen any read-throughs to possibly yields, possibly tightening or sort of anything else outside of elevated marketing spend with this increase in competition?\nRoger Hochschild: Yes, great question. In general, the competition takes the form of higher rewards, increased marketing spend. You'll see some players start putting up big onetime signing bonuses as they look to grow. Some players may start extending their promotional periods. But given sort of the inability to reprice cards post CARD Act, you tend not to see it drive yield compression. And as I mentioned earlier, a lot of those products and the competition seems to be targeting that sort of super prime transactor segment, that is not one that we aggressively go after. So our projection for flat cost per account next year reflects our view on our ability to compete in this environment.\nMengxian Jiao: And then secondly, John, I wanted to sort of circle back on your comments regarding the difference that you're seeing between higher and lower FICO scores. I mean, are you sort of seeing that in early-stage delinquency sort of diverging? Just any other further details that you might be able to provide in that specific difference.\nJohn Greene: Yes. It's in the kind of roll to one, so on delinquent bucket out there. And the fact that we're talking about it is, I'll say, is intended to indicate that we're paying attention to the entire portfolio, and that we have a growing comfort in terms of how the credit outlook is in the performance of the company into '22.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Bill Ryan with Seaport Research Partners.\nWilliam Ryan: Just a couple of things, first, on promotional balances. Looking at your portfolio today as a percent of the total, where are you versus kind of like the history of the company or the historic norm, if you will? And what is the typical duration of the promotional balances? And then I'll go ahead and ask the second question, but looked like there's a little bit of a drop in protection product revenue this quarter as a percent of the portfolio. I was just curious if there's any specific call-outs there?\nJohn Greene: So the kind of the promotional balance content of the portfolio, we tend not to kind of go into expansive detail about that. So my comments on net interest margins should give an indication that we intend to use that as a tool to help some origination activity. In terms of the protection revenue, so we have an existing product that we stopped marketing some time ago. It\u2019s essentially providing value to the customer set. But if you don't market a tool, obviously, revenue line gets impacted. We have a new product that we launched, very, very soft launch that we actually haven't done any broad marketing yet. So my expectation is that, that line will be flat to down in '22.\nEric Wasserstrom: All right, well, Britney, I think we're going to conclude our call here, but thank you all for joining us. And if there's any additional follow-ups, please reach out to us here at Investor Relations. Thank you, and have a great morning.\nOperator: This does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time, and have a wonderful day.",

            "content": "Thanks, Eric, and thanks to our listeners for joining today's call. I'll begin by reviewing the highlights and key metrics for the year, then John will take you through the details of our fourth quarter results and our perspectives on 2022. 2021 was another year of unique challenges related to the pandemic, and I'm very pleased that once again, the Discover team was able to successfully execute against our business priorities in a fluid operating environment. This was evident in our fourth quarter results which were the capstone to an outstanding year. For the fourth quarter, we earned $1.1 billion after tax or $3.64 per share; and for the full year, $5.4 billion after tax or $17.83 per share. These results underscore the strength of our differentiated model and were achieved as we continue to make meaningful enhancements to our capabilities and invest for future growth. Let me share a few examples from this past year. Throughout 2021, we continue to make advancements to our data and analytics platform, enhancing our capabilities in areas including targeting, collections and fraud detection. We also made investments in machine learning to provide faster and better insights to improve customer personalization. And we continue to modernize our infrastructure and build out our hybrid cloud platform. We also opened a new customer care center in Chatham, a vibrant African-American community on Chicago South side. Once fully operational, the center will provide nearly 1,000 full-time jobs. Our Chatham Center challenges the traditional notions of corporate site selection, has helped us connect with a talented pool of diverse candidates and suppliers, is transforming how we approach diversity, equity and inclusion and it is already performing at an industry-leading level. We hope our commitment to Chatham will serve as a springboard for further economic development in other areas that have long been denied opportunity. Slide 4 of our presentation captures another important element of our results, which was our pivot into new account acquisition as the economic recovery took hold in late 2020 and early 2021. In the face of intensifying competition, our value proposition of cashback rewards, no annual fee and industry-leading service remain very attractive to consumers. The strong level of card acquisition contributed to our return to loan growth over the second half of last year. In payments, we continue to expand our business, increase network volume and establish new strategic partnerships. We expanded global acceptance and announced new network alliances in Portugal, Bahrain, Jordan and Malaysia that will benefit us as cross-border travel recovers. We remain committed to building out our international acceptance, and we'll continue to make investments to expand our reach. Our record earnings through the year generated significant capital, which we continue to put to good use. In addition to our investments in acquisition, brands, technology and people, we also returned significant capital to shareholders through dividends and buybacks by repurchasing $2.3 billion of common stock and increasing our quarterly dividend by 14%. As we look forward into 2022, I'm very optimistic about the trajectory of our business. While macroeconomic conditions created strong tailwinds this past year, we acted on opportunities to strengthen our business, actions that will drive long-term value this year and beyond. We start the new year in an excellent position, and I'm confident that our integrated digital banking and payments model will continue to create long-term value for our shareholders and customers. I'll now ask John to discuss key aspects of our quarterly financial results in more detail. Yes, we don't disclose the number of new accounts. But what I would say in terms of credit, our card credit policies are pretty much on top of where they were pre-pandemic. Costs have gone up since the low levels that we saw during the pandemic as we sort of kept marketing and a lot of others pulled back. But I would say, as we look forward into 2022, our expectation is that the cost per account will be roughly where it was pre-pandemic. And just to build on that, we look pretty carefully by merchant, by customer segment. There's nothing to support a view that buy now, pay later is having any impact on payment rate. Good question, Sanjay. As I mentioned earlier, our forecast for next year is cost per account, relatively flat to where it was before the pandemic. And so I think this sort of focus on competition is a little bit overblown. The card business is just always competitive. You have big players with good capabilities. Each issuer out there has their set of products, set of channels. And I think some natural limits on how much money they can be put to work effectively. So I don't see it as a particularly high risk to our 2022 growth forecast. And we have a very differentiated product, we're seeing good benefits on the acquisition side, from our investments in analytics. So we feel good even in the current environment. It will, of course, vary by segment. But certainly, households that are seeing rising incomes will have a greater ability for debt service. And for many households, that's how they determine how much debt they take on. It's complicated a bit by some households still having pent-up savings from strong earnings and not many opportunities to spend. And of course, other costs going up, whether it's child care or day-to-day expenses, on 1 hand, will drive increases in sales. But on the other hand, decreases disposable income for debt service. So a mix of factors, but we, net-net, we'd expect strong consumer demand for credit next year. Sure. So student loans, we feel really good about where we're positioned in the market, our products, our brand, our ability to take share. What's a bit the wildcard is just enrollment. And I think enrollments were down year-over-year, which was a surprise to, I think, the entire higher education industry. There's a bit of a correlation, the stronger the job market fewer people decide to pursue an education because they're making too much outside. So I think it will be more that factor, and we'll see peak season. But I'm confident in our ability to continue gaining share. For personal loans, we took a little longer to return to pre-pandemic credit criteria for that product, just given the higher volatility. But as John said, quarter-over-quarter, we're now flat. And so we would expect that to return to growth in 2022. So John talked about promotional balances as having an impact on NIM. I would say a lot of that is driven by new accounts. So as you ramp up new accounts, you'll see that, but also portfolio activity as well. Yes. Certainly, we're always looking for new opportunities on the payment side of our business. And there, the versatility of our capabilities, you saw some of that with our partnership with Sezzle in terms of our ability to provide easier connectivity to merchants. So on the payment side, both in the U.S. and globally, we're looking for opportunities. On the card side, we feel really good about the product set we have. We are virtually 100% focused on consumer. I think there is a huge opportunity to continue to grow our non-card products. And so we talked about investing more in marketing our deposit products before the pandemic. Clearly, when we were in a significant excess liquidity position. It didn't make sense to put a lot of marketing behind deposits. But that's something I would expect to see in 2022. We continue to push out. I think what you heard in the call, our favorite way of expanding internationally through network-to-network partnerships. It is just much more cost-effective than working with individual acquirers, although we do that as well. There's also a big focus on acceptance in the U.S. around the migration to digital. So working with other networks on secure remote commerce, everything from transit implementations, but again, we're now up to 26 net-to-net partnerships, and feel that there's room to continue growing recently announced a partnership in Serbia actually this week. Yes. I don't think we said we expected diminishing returns on marketing. Credit is pretty similar to what it was pre-pandemic and I mentioned our projected cost per account. And a lot of our marketing does go to new accounts. Cost per account, we're projecting that to be pretty much on top of where it was pre-pandemic. Different issuers certainly have different business models. There's one who's particularly focused on subprime, others are much more aggressive at the super prime. We have been very clear for many, many years that ours is a lend-focused business going after that prime revolver segment. We've tailored our products for that, our underwriting capabilities. And again, we feel very good about the return we're getting on the dollars we spend in marketing. Yes. I think clearly, what everyone's watching is buy now pay later. As I mentioned earlier, we haven't seen that have a noticeable impact on our base. In my mind, it's closer to traditional sales finance. So there have always been competing products out there, whether it's on the private label side, whether it's personal loans for debt consolidation, et cetera. So we focus on getting a broad mix of spend. Even through this year, we're seeing strong performance across every category. Travel is holding up actually in January surprisingly well, given the state of that pandemic. So we think we'll continue to grow across categories. And in fact, as one of the beauties of our 5% program, it sort of reinforces different categories of spend on a rotating basis as opposed to products that are really particularly tailored to an individual category of spend. Yes, good question. I think our perspective may be a little different than some of the big banks. And of course, we have a narrower range of businesses. So I can't really comment on some of their investment. Certainly, we are focused on competing with the fintechs, but it's not just about spending money. It reminds me of -- it's like someone saying, I'm just going to keep eating more and more until I lose weight. The competition -- those fintechs are not spending more on technology. Our focus is around capabilities, it's on agility, it's on speed to market. And so if you look at last year, once you sort of sort through for onetime items, technology spend was relatively flat, but that doesn't mean there wasn't a huge focus around our capabilities. We've talked about our investments in data and analytics. So it's really more about speed, and you don't get there just through sheer dollars of spending. Yes, so great question. We're focused on a hybrid cloud strategy, so a mix of both. I think there's -- sometimes companies seem to take a purist element that there's something great about having 100% of your applications on the cloud, whether or not your GL resides on the cloud, it's not going to really make a difference for your business. But we are heavy users of the public cloud, in particular, for our data and analytics areas where the speed and massive amounts of storage are critically important. Yes. No, we haven't. And I think it's important to note that the life of loan losses, assumptions we use for new account underwriting is not driven by where losses are currently. So John  all portfolio performance and what we're seeing. But we use sort of by segment and actually by individual account forecasts of life of loan as we determine our marketing and credit criteria. Yes, great question. In general, the competition takes the form of higher rewards, increased marketing spend. You'll see some players start putting up big onetime signing bonuses as they look to grow. Some players may start extending their promotional periods. But given sort of the inability to reprice cards post CARD Act, you tend not to see it drive yield compression. And as I mentioned earlier, a lot of those products and the competition seems to be targeting that sort of super prime transactor segment, that is not one that we aggressively go after. So our projection for flat cost per account next year reflects our view on our ability to compete in this environment."

            "name": "John Greene",
            "content": "Thank you, Roger, and good morning, everyone. As we review our fourth quarter results, I echo Roger's point that the actions we took last year position us for strong performance in 2022 and beyond. I'll begin with our financial summary on Slide 5. Our strong fourth quarter results were characterized by accelerating receivable growth, provision leverage and increased investments in marketing and brand. Revenue, net of interest expense, increased 4% from the prior year. Excluding a $139 million unrealized loss on our equity investments, total revenue was up 9%. Net interest income increased 4% driven by growth in average receivables and an 18 basis point improvement in our net interest margin, which was sequentially flat at 10.81%. Our NIM trend reflects the continued benefit from decreased funding cost and lower interest charge-offs, though these were partially offset in the fourth quarter by a higher mix of promotional rate balances. The growth in receivables was largely driven by card, which was up 4% year-over-year and 6% sequentially. The primary drivers of year-over-year growth were continued strong sales volume and significant new account growth throughout 2021, which was up 23% year-over-year and 13% versus 2019. As has been the case for most of last year, a significant portion of the benefits from strong sales and new accounts was offset by the sustained high payment rate. The payment rate leveled off during the quarter but remains approximately 500 basis points above pre-pandemic levels. We currently expect that the payment rate will decline slightly over the course of 2022. However, our expectations for card receivable growth is robust, as I'll detail in a few moments. Our student loan portfolio also contributed to our growth. Organic student loans were up 4% over the prior year, benefiting from the return to in-person learning in 2021. We continue to gain share in this product and are well positioned for continued organic expansion. Personal loans decreased 3% year-over-year, mainly driven by high payment rates, but were sequentially flat as we returned our underwriting criteria to pre-pandemic levels. The second significant driver of our revenue growth was higher net discount/interchange revenue, which increased $103 million or 43%, driven by a 25% increase in sales volume year-over-year. The strong volume has continued into this year. Sales are up 24% through the first half of January. One significant item that relates to our net discount and interchange revenue is our rewards cost, and having covered most of our key revenue drivers, I'll point your attention to the reward rate reflected on Slide 8. We continue to benefit from strong card member engagement with our cashback rewards program. Our rewards costs increased versus last year on higher sales volume. However, the reward rate declined 3 basis points year-over-year and 9 basis points sequentially. This reflects the benefit of our integrated model and our discipline in managing the program while delivering substantial value to card members and merchant partners. For the full year 2021, our rewards rate was 1.37%, up 2 basis points from the prior year. Consistent with the historical trend, we expect about 2 basis points to 4 basis points of annual rewards cost inflation, driven mostly by shifts in mix. Now, I'd like to spend a moment speaking about expense trends on Slide 9. Total operating expenses increased $34 million or 3% year-over-year. Focusing on the most significant items here, marketing expense was up $112 million as we continue to invest in new account growth and brand marketing with the launch of our new media campaign, which went live across all channels in the quarter. This pushed our marketing expense towards the top end of our previously guided range. Employee compensation was down $5 million year-over-year, driven mainly by a $26 million charge last year. Excluding this, our comp expense was up 4% year-over-year, driven largely by a higher bonus accrual. Information processing was down $73 million year-over-year and professional fees increased as a result of higher recovery fees. Moving to credit on Slide 10, the net charge-off rate improved to 1.37% in the quarter, a decrease of 101 basis points year-over-year and a 9 basis point improvement from the prior quarter. Net charge-off dollars were down 218 million from the prior year and decreased 12 million sequentially. Strong credit performance continued across all products. Card net charge-offs were down 113 basis points from the prior year and personal loans were 158 basis points lower. Student loan charge-offs increased slightly but remained very low at 0.8%. Moving to the allowance for credit losses on Slide 11, our reserve rate continued to decline, dropping 38 basis points to 7.3%. Two factors contributed to the decrease in reserve rate. First, we released $50 million from reserves during the quarter, driven by the continued strong credit performance of our portfolio and the relative stability of the macroeconomic outlook. These factors were partially offset by the 5% increase in total loans from the prior quarter. Our future reserves will be dictated by our portfolio credit trends, our receivable growth and any changes to our macroeconomic assumptions. Looking at Slide 12, we remain extremely well capitalized and above our 10.5% target with a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 14.8%. We continue to demonstrate our commitment of returning capital to shareholders as we executed on our share repurchase plan and bought back $773 million of common stock in the quarter and paid a dividend of $0.50 per share. Looking at funding, average consumer deposits decreased 3% year-over-year and declined 1% sequentially. This sequential decline was driven by a 5% decrease in consumer CDs, while savings and money market deposits increased slightly. We managed our excess liquidity down throughout 2021 and finished the year with consumer deposits representing 68% of total funding. We will continue to target 70% to 80% of funding from the starts. Moving to Slide 13 where we'll provide some perspectives on 2022. We entered the year in a very strong position, and our outlook reflects this. We expect loan growth in the high single digits. This view is based on current expectations of sales trends and the contribution from recently acquired accounts, combined with a very modest decline in the payment rate. We believe this view of payment rates substantially derisked our loan growth forecast. We expect our NIM rate to be relatively in line with the full year of 2021 and with quarter-to-quarter variability. We expect to benefit from higher loan yields with rising interest rates. This may be offset by other factors, including a higher mix of promotional rate balances, some degree of credit normalization and higher deposit rates, which will be subject to funding needs and competitive dynamics. Turning to expenses, we expect our total GAAP expenses will increase at a mid-single-digit rate this year. We'll continue to invest for growth as we see profitable opportunities and currently expect that our marketing investments will be above 2019 levels. Outside of marketing, we expect operating costs to increase at a low single-digit percent level, reflecting disciplined expense control. Our commitment to positive operating leverage over the medium term remains a priority. We expect net credit losses will average in the range of 2.2% to 2.6% for the full year. As credit normalizes from historically low levels in 2021, we expect net charge-offs to increase sequentially over the course of the year. Lastly, we remain committed to returning substantial capital to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. As of this week, we had approximately $780 million remaining on our share repurchase authorization that expires at the end of March and expect to announce a new share repurchase authorization next quarter. In summary, we had an excellent fourth quarter and full year with accelerating loan growth driven by robust account acquisition and strong sales volumes, excellent credit performance and a reduction in the reserve rate, disciplined management of operating cost and sustained return of excess capital to shareholders. I'm exceptionally pleased with Discover's execution against our business priorities in 2021. Our value proposition continues to resonate with consumers. We prudently invested for growth, resulting in significant new account growth and strong sales. We continue to optimize our funding mix and actively manage core deposit costs. These actions and the improved macroeconomic outlook have positioned us well. With that, I'll turn the call back to our operator, Britney, to open the line for Q&A. Yes. Hey, Moshe, I'll take that one. So we'll react based on the company performance and opportunities that we see in the marketplace. So, over the past couple of years, I feel like the team has done a really, really good job in terms of making calls, in terms of expense allocations. We'll continue to do that to make sure that we're positioned for growth and marching towards the positive operating leverage that we talked about. Great. Mark, thanks for the questions. So what we're seeing in the portfolio is really, really strong performance. I think the numbers in the quarter demonstrate that. We are seeing some difference between higher FICO and lower FICO account performance overall within expectations. So what we're projecting here is a slow normalization of credit, and in terms of the guidance that we reflected here, we've got pretty good line of sight to the first 6 months, just as the accounts will go through the normal roll rates and gives us an ability to predict quite accurately. Once we get out beyond 6 months, we rely more heavily on our models and the models themselves are built with a number of assumptions. '21 was -- frankly, was a tough year to call based on how we had designed our models and what actually happened in the portfolio. So what we decided to do is give, from my standpoint, a relatively broad range that we think over time we'll be able to tighten. And in terms of lower end versus higher end, strong portfolio performance, the slight difference that we saw between the higher FICO and the lower FICOs, that continuing to kind of roll out as we expect. And a positive macro environment should bring us towards the lower end. Yes. There is a level of mean revision in there in the second part of the year. And just -- one other piece of, I'll say, information, so you can think about the breakout, at least this is how we thought about it, of charge-offs, the predominant piece in the second half of the year. So you can think 45-55 split between first half and second half. And we'll continue to update that over the year. Yes, it's actually a pretty complex question there. So rather than try to hit each of the elements, I'll give you a view in terms of how we thought about NIM for 2021. So we do expect some impact to NIM from credit normalization. We also -- we also are expecting a higher mix of BT and promotional balances, which will also impact net interest margin. We do get nice fees from that, but certainly, net interest margin will be impacted. The revolve rate as the payment rate starts to normalize, we'll see some benefits there. Fed funds rate changes, we plan for 2, 2 in the year. If there's more, that will create some upside. And in terms of impact there, you could expect per Fed change somewhere between 3 bps and 5 bps on a total year basis on NIM depending on timing. And then funding, we're still going to see some funding benefit from the actions we did to optimize our debt stack in '20 and '21. So from that standpoint, it gets us to about flat, but there's a lot of moving pieces. In terms of deposit pricing, there's still a wide gap between where we're priced and the brick-and-mortar banks are priced. So somewhere close to 45 basis points. Now the digital banks, most have increased deposit pricing, about 10 basis points over the past 3 to 4 weeks. We're a lagger on that. At some point, our funding needs and competitive dynamics will be such that we'll take a look and make appropriate changes and we'll do that throughout the year. So the deposit betas, specifics around that, I would rather think about competitive dynamics and funding needs in order to get a view on how we're going to price deposits on the up cycle. Yes. So we go through a pretty robust process every single quarter to make sure that our reserves are fairly stated under GAAP. Now when we did CECL day 1, we had -- we were seeing charge-offs in the low 3s, and we ended up posting reserve rate of, I think it was 6.09%. So as we look at where we are today, where it's at around 7.2, assuming strong credit performance and a positive macroeconomic outlook, my sense is that there is some opportunity to take that reserve rate closer to day 1. Yes. I wouldn't say there's an 80-20 rule on payment rate. So quite honestly, as we looked at it, in 2021, we didn't call the curve right. And so what we did in the '22 guidance is assumed a very modest decrease in payment rate. We felt like that derisked our loan growth. In terms of kind of behaviors between revolvers and transactors, that payment rate's been relatively consistent. The 1 difference in our portfolio is the new accounts that we originated in 2020 tended to be higher FICOs. So more of those tend to transact versus revolve. But we'll see as the liquidity ends up getting used in the overall economy and what that does to payment rates. So we've modeled it multiple different ways. There's really no standard rule of thumb. It's frankly somewhat dynamic in terms of what we're seeing month-to-month and quarter-to-quarter. Yes. So the big driver there was obviously discount and interchange revenue, which was up 28% year-over-year and then after rewards cost 43% in the quarter. So super strong growth there, which that will generally run consistent with sales, and we're expecting sales not to stay in the mid 20s, but kind of come down to kind of strong double-digits and then into weaker double-digits by the fourth quarter. I don't know if that's right or not, it seems like there's been a lot of benefit from the new account acquisition and also where our card has been positioned with people's wallets. So that's been positive. There's also the factor that people are using less cash and charging more. So that'll continue to benefit sales, interchange and net discount and interchange.  In terms of the other items, the amount of cash in the economy actually helped cash advance fees which was positive. And our expectation is that we'll have outside of discount and interchange growth, growth fairly similar to net interest income. We specifically commented on positive operating leverage. So as we deliver that, obviously, the efficiency ratio will improve. My expectation is that we can get into the high 30s within the medium term. So we built the plan essentially contemplating significant investment in marketing and then working through the other elements of the cost structure in order to create as much efficiency and capacity to drive new growth. As that model continues to build upon itself, my expectation is that those high 30 numbers are certainly very, very achievable. Yes. So it will be difficult to expand more deeply upon the comments that I've already made. So we do expect it to increase sequentially. There is some degree of seasonality I don't view that as like a material driver to what we're going to be seeing. And I also mentioned that the charge-offs are more first half of the year, and that we've got pretty decent line of sight to the first half. So that's split out somewhere around 45 first half, 55 second half is probably as deep as I can go on the charge-off numbers right now. Yes, Bob, I'll take that. We've been really pleased with the sales running through the card. The inflation has had a small impact. So you think kind of on average, maybe 1% to 2% in \u201821. In \u201822, we didn't model that out specifically. My sense is it would be 2%. Yes. So we assumed -- thanks for the questions. We assumed 2 rate hikes in our guidance. And in terms of payment rate, as I said, very modest improvement, so -- or a reduction. So if payment rate were to normalize at the pace you just described, which I don't think it will, but if it were to do that, it would certainly be very accretive to the loan growth. I'm not going to get into specifics whether it takes us to double-digits or not. From my perspective, no, and I'll tell you why. First, the macros are the macroeconomic conditions that are super positive, right? So there's more job openings than there are people looking for jobs. The consumers will have more dollars into their paycheck as a result of this inflation. And there is a substantial amount of savings still left in the economy from -- largely from kind of change in behaviors and government stimulus. So I'm not frankly seeing that as a risk in 2023 -- excuse me, 2022. As we get out into 2023, there's less certainty around that. Yes. So when we -- let me start with the reserves because it plays into the rest of your question. So when we looked at reserves for the quarter, what we wanted to see was the impact of the ending, the end of most of the government support programs. Most ended in September. So we had 1 quarter worth of data. We looked at it, we saw no real change to the portfolio dynamics. We're hoping to see another quarter and then reevaluate overall reserve rate. But that day 1 number and the -- I'll say, the normalized charge-offs in the 3s would support a view that down the road, we'll have some opportunity on reserves. In terms of new vintages and the kind of charge-off impacts from those, this company has been through years and years of cycles with new vintages. We're very thoughtful in terms of how we do the underwriting. We've got some improvements from the -- within underwriting from the advanced analytic tools that we've put in place. So my sense is a portfolio seasons, we're going to see some increase in charge-offs, but well within the expectations of how we underwrite and well within the expectations of this guidance and the macroeconomic outlook. Yes. It's in the kind of roll to one, so on delinquent bucket out there. And the fact that we're talking about it is, I'll say, is intended to indicate that we're paying attention to the entire portfolio, and that we have a growing comfort in terms of how the credit outlook is in the performance of the company into '22. So the kind of the promotional balance content of the portfolio, we tend not to kind of go into expansive detail about that. So my comments on net interest margins should give an indication that we intend to use that as a tool to help some origination activity. In terms of the protection revenue, so we have an existing product that we stopped marketing some time ago. It's essentially providing value to the customer set. But if you don't market a tool, obviously, revenue line gets impacted. We have a new product that we launched, very, very soft launch that we actually haven't done any broad marketing yet. So my expectation is that, that line will be flat to down in '22."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Third Quarter 2021 Discover Financial Services Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker's remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. . . Thank you and I will now turn the call over to Mr. Eric Wasserstrom, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nEric Wasserstrom: Thank you, Ashley, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to today's call. I'll begin on Slide two of our earnings presentation, which you can find in the financial section of our Investor Relations website, investorrelations.discover.com. Our discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially.  Please refer to our notices regarding forward-looking statements that appear in our Third Quarter earnings press release and presentation. Our call today will include remarks from our CEO, Roger Hochschild and John Greene, our Chief Financial Officer. After we conclude our formal comments, there will be time for a question-and-answer session. During the Q&A session, we request that you ask one question, followed by one follow-up question. After follow-up question, please return to the queue. Now it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Roger.\nRoger Hochschild: Thank you, Eric. And thanks to our listeners for joining today's call. We had another period of strong financial results in the third quarter with earnings of $1.1 billion after-tax or $3.54 per share. In many respects, these results reflected the unique benefits of our integrated Digital Banking and Payments model, which continues to be a source of significant competitive advantage by supporting our value proposition to consumers and merchants, and differentiating our brand. These advantages enabled our continued investment in account acquisition, technology, and analytics while generating substantial capital. In an environment characterized by new entrants and intensifying competition, we believe the strength of our model position us to accelerate our growth. Underlying our results this quarter were 3 important advancements. The first was our return to year-over-year receivables growth, which is driven by our investment in acquisition and brand marketing, and continued strong sales trends. Total sales were up 27% over 2019 levels with strong momentum across all categories.  Even travel sales increased, and while they dropped a bit in August due to concerns related to the Delta variant, travel has steadily improved since that. We also continued to see attractive opportunities for account acquisition and increased our marketing investments to take advantage of this. While the competitive environment has intensified, new account so are now up 17% over 2019, reflecting the strength of our value proposition. This value proposition remains anchored in our industry-leading onshore customer service model, no annual fees, and useful and transparent rewards.  While some of our peers had to reinvigorate their rewards offerings at substantial cost, our rewards costs were up only 6 basis points year-over-year, and nearly all of this increase was driven by higher consumer spending, as evidenced in our strong discount revenue. Given these dynamics, we will continue investing in new accounts as long as the environment supports profitable opportunities and our robust account growth and our expectations for modest improvement in payment rates supports so our view of stronger receivables growth in 2022.  The second key trend was credit, which remained exceptionally strong. Our disciplined approach to credit management and favorable economic trends contributed to a record low net charge-off rate and continued low delinquencies. The delinquency outlook affirmed our expectations that losses will be below last year's levels for the full year and supported additional reserve releases during the quarter. And the third is the continued expansion of our payments business.  Both saw a meaningful increase in debit volume with 9% growth year-over-year, and a 26% increase over the third quarter of 2019, demonstrating both the impact of the recovery and an increase in debit use through the pandemic. Our Diners business has also started to see some improvement from the global recovery with volume up 12% from the prior year. As the global economy recovers, we will continue to look for opportunities to expand our international reach. In summary, our value proposition continues to be attractive and our Integrated Digital Banking and Payments model supports profitable long-term customer relationships and is highly capital-generated. I continue to feel very good about our prospects for future growth. I'll now ask John to discuss key aspects of our financial results in more detail.\nJohn Greene: Thank you, Roger. And good morning, everyone. Once again, our results this quarter reflect strong execution and that continued economic recovery. Looking at our financial summary results on Page 4, there are 3 key things I want to call out. First, our total revenue net of interest expense is up 8% from their prior year, excluding a $167 million unrealized loss due to market adjustments on our equity investments, including this, revenue is up 2% for the quarter. Second, is a continuation of very strong credit performance. Net charge-offs were down 343 million from the prior year, which supported a $165 million reserve release this quarter. Lastly, we continue investing for growth with increased marketing spend, higher operating expenses in other area were largely related to the economic recovery.  I'll go over the details of our quarterly results in our full year outlook on the following slides. Looking at loan growth on Slide 5. We saw the return to growth this quarter with ending loans up 1% over the prior year, and up 2%, sequentially. Card loans were the primary driver and we're also up 1% year-over-year and 2% over the prior quarter. The year-over-year increase in card receivables was driven by strong sales volume and robust account acquisition. Sales growth continued to accelerate and was up 27% over the third quarter of 2019. Year-to-date new accounts were up 27% from their prior year and up 17% over 2019 levels.  The contribution from these factors was mostly offset by the ongoing high-payment rates as household savings and cash flows remain elevated. The payment rate was approximately 500 basis points over pre -pandemic levels. We anticipate that the payment rate will moderate a bit as most federal COVID support programs have ended and consumer savings rates have started to decrease. That said, we expect payment rates to remain above historical levels through 2022. Looking at our other lending products. Organic student loans increased 4% from the prior year with originations up 7% as most schools have returned to the normal in-person learning model.  Personal loans decreased 4% driven by high payment rates. Our underwriting criteria have returned to pre -pandemic level, and we expect a return to growth in this product in future periods. Moving to slide 6. Net interest margin was 10.8% up 61 basis points from the prior year, and 12 basis points from the prior quarter. Compared to the prior quarter, the increase in net interest margin was primarily driven by lower interest charge-offs and lower funding costs. This was partially offset by higher mix of promotional rate balances. Card loan yield was up one basis point sequentially as lower interest charge-offs were offset by the increased promotional balance mix.  Yields on personal loans declined 15 basis points sequentially, due to lower pricing. The margin continued to benefit from lower funding cost primarily driven by maturities of higher rate  and an increased mix of lower rate savings and money market balances. Average consumer deposits were flat year-over-year, and declined 1% from the prior quarter. The quarter-over-quarter decline was largely driven by consumer CDs. We also saw a slight decline in savings and money market deposits as consumers continue to spend excess levels of liquidity. We also continue to optimize our funding stack.  Late in September, we executed our first ABS issuance since October 2019, consisting of a $1.2 billion security with a 3-year fixed rate coupon up 58 basis points, and a 5-year $600 million security with a fixed coupon of a 103 basis points. These were our lowest ABS coupons ever and show good execution and timing by our treasury team. Looking at revenue on Slide 7, total non-interest income increased 90 million or 20% over the prior year, excluding the unrealized loss on equity investments.  Net discount and interchange revenue was up 61 million or 26%, driven by strong sales volume. This was partially offset by increased rewards costs due to high sales in the 5% category, which was restaurants and PayPal, both this year and last. We continue to benefit from strong sales through our partnership with PayPal, while restaurant sales were up 62% year-over-year as dining activity recovered. Loans fee income was up 21 million or 21% primarily driven by lower late fee charge-offs and higher non-sufficient funds and cash advance fees. Looking at Slide 8, total operating expenses were up $185 million or 18% from the prior year. The details reflect our focus on investing for future growth while managing our operating costs.  Employee compensation increased 12 million driven by a higher bonus accrual in the current year. Excluding bonuses, employee compensation was down 3% from their prior year from lower headcount. Marketing expense increased 70 million, supporting another quarter of strong new account growth. Other expense included a $50 million legal accrual. Professional fees were up $47 million primarily due to higher recovery fees  reopening combined with strong credit and economic conditions have driven an increase in recoveries and their associated fees, year-to-date recoveries were up 20% compared to the prior year. The benefits of these costs is reflected in lower credit losses. Moving to slide 9.  The trend of sustained strong credit performance, continued. Total net charge-offs were a record low at 1.46% down a 154 basis points year-over-year and 66 basis points sequentially. Total net charge-off dollars decreased 343 million from their prior year and were down 131 million quarter-over-quarter. Credit performance was strong across all products as evidenced by the net charge-off rates on card, private student loans, and personal loans. Moving to the allowance for credit losses on slide 10. This quarter, we released a $165 million from the reserves and our reserve rate drop 35 basis points to 7.7%.  The reserve release reflects continued strong credit performance and a largely stable macroeconomic outlook. The impact of these was partially offset by 2% increase in loans from the prior quarter. Our economic dysfunctions include an unemployment rate of approximately 5.5% by year-end, and GDP growth of just over 6%. These assumptions were slightly less positive than those used in the Second Quarter, but still reflect a strong at economic outlook. Looking at Slide 11, our common equity Tier 1 for the period was 15.5%, well above our 10.5% target. We repurchased $815 million of common stock and, as we had previously announced, increased our dividend payable by 14% to $0.50 per share.  These actions reflect our commitment to returning capital to our shareholders. On funding, we continue to make progress towards our goal of having deposits be 70% to 80% of our funding mix. Deposits now make up 68% of total funding, up from 62 in the prior year. Wrapping up on slide 12. Our outlook for 2021 has not changed and reflects continued strong execution against our financial and strategic objectives. In summary, we remain well-positioned for profitable growth from improving loan trends.  Credit performance trends remained favorable, reflecting positive macroeconomic conditions and our approach to underwriting and credit management. Investments for growth have supported the significant increase in new accounts while we've contained operating expenses. Lastly, our Integrated Digital Banking and Payments model is highly capital-generative, allowing us to invest for growth and return capital to shareholders. We look forward to providing our outlook for 2022 on our conference call in January. With that, I will turn the call back to our Operator, Ashley, to open the line for Q&A.\nOperator:  We do remind you that you please pick up your handset for optimal sound quality. And we'll take our first question from John Pancari with Evercore ISI, please go ahead.\nJohn Pancari: Good morning. Wanted to see if you could give us a little more color on your payment rate expectations. I know you expect them to remain elevated through 2022, but just wanted to see if you're starting to see signs of accounts that typically revolve. I'm starting to see some decline to payment rates there. And then I guess how material of an inflection you think we can see through 2022 or do you think that's not likely until '23? Thanks.\nRoger Hochschild: Great. Alright. Thanks for the question. The payment rate has been persistently high And what we did see in the month of September was that ticked down mildly. It did increase from July to August, which was frankly a bit of a surprise. But as I look -- as I looked at the data, we're seeing here in terms of revolve, and then the forecasted trends, my expectation is that in the fourth quarter, it will continue to step down.  Some of that has to do with governments support programs ending in September and some of it has to do with the holiday season. And then as we look on the holiday season into 2022, I do expect that it will continue to step towards a normalized rate. But, frankly, I don't think that'll happen until 2023. How do we think about the implications from that? Certainly, the payment rate is a bit of a headwind to growth. But what we've seen is really strong account acquisition and strong sales growth,\nJohn Greene: which to date has helped offset some of that payment rate impact. So overall, we feel very, very comfortable that 20 -- the balance of '21 and then 22, we'll have a bit of tailwind related to both payment rates declining and then strong, strong execution from the new accounts and sales growth.\nJohn Pancari: Got it. Okay. Thanks, John. And then on the account acquisition front, I know you indicated that you expect marketing costs to be higher in the second half. So if you can give us a little bit more detail around your expectation there and how they could trend for the fourth quarter. And then does that imply that you could see some continued upside pressure into 2022 on marketing as you drive account acquisition in light of pressured payment rates?\nJohn Greene: Yes. So from a marketing standpoint, we spend the money as we see opportunity to drive profitable new accounts. And, frankly, we've had a great quarter and a great year with that. The third quarter spend actually came in mildly lower than what we originally anticipated, and the guidance I had provided on the last call was that we would approximate the 2019 levels of total marketing expense. I think it'll be a little bit under that, largely not because of opportunities, but basically kind of some process oriented stuff in terms of account targeting. So we feel like the money we'll spend in the fourth quarter will certainly generate positive new account growth. It will pick up from third quarter certainly, and provide us a good trajectory for 2022.\nJohn Pancari: Great. Thanks for taking my questions.\nJohn Greene: Thank you.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nRyan Nash: Hey. Good morning, everyone.\nRoger Hochschild: Morning.\nRyan Nash: Roger, you talked about intense competition and the impact of new entrants. Can you maybe just expand on those points about what you're seeing competitively, how you think Discover is positioned for it, and where do you believe this is having the biggest impact on your business and how are you responding to it? Thanks.\nRoger Hochschild: Sure, thanks for the question. I think my actual comment was good growth in the face of intense competition, and I think that really sums it up well. The competition in the card business is always intense. We were lucky enough to have a lapse in 2020. And so some show of extraordinarily good cost per account. But it's what we're used to facing. It'll vary based on which issuers are refreshing their cards or have more of a desire than growth for growth than others.  But I think our focus on a clear, differentiated value proposition has resulted in continued strong generation of new accounts. And I'm excited about what I see. In terms of the new entrants, we see that less in the core credit cards space. But I would say very, very aggressive competition around personal loans by in that scenario where we focused on the long-term, remain disciplined in our underwriting and what we're willing to invest in new accounts and are used to seeing competitors come and go.\nRyan Nash: Got it. And if I could ask a follow-up question to the question John asked prior, So John, in terms of marketing with the level you'd be hitting in the Fourth Quarter as it steps up a little bit, is -- should we think about that as a go-forward run rate? Are there more investments that needed to be made? And then second, there was comments about  increasing and -- as it relates to marketing, can you maybe just help us understand where are we today versus pre -pandemic levels, and what is the strategy the continued increase balance transfer activity on a go-forward basis? Thank you.\nJohn Greene: Sure. On the marketing spent, that will be determined -- are determined based on the opportunities we see as, as we look at 22, we do see a continued benign credit environment and frankly a very strong opportunity to drive profitable new account growth. As that opportunity continues to persist, we'll continue to spend marketing dollars. What I would suggest is we concentrate here on 2021 And then in the January call, we'll talk about '22 in terms of the opportunities there.  But I'll leave you with this point that the fourth-quarter trajectory should help inform what we intend to spend in 2022. In terms of balance transfers, we did see a impact from some of the increased balance transfers that we executed in early part of '21 and the third quarter in terms of mild impacts to margin. We will continue to take a look at that space and see what we can generate profitably. It's been a good source of account acquisition for us historically and will continue to remain disciplined and put those prime revolver accounts on the balance transfer.\nRyan Nash: Thanks for taking my questions.\nJohn Greene: Thank you, Ryan.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nDon Fandetti: Hi, good morning. I guess, Roger, a little bit of a longer-term question around your debit business. It seems like we're going to have more direct-to-bank payments in the United States over time and there's a lot going on, PayPal potentially buying Pinterest. Can you talk about how you see debit evolving over the long-term, and are there any implications given that you own a network?\nRoger Hochschild: Sure. Great question. There are always, I would say, new payment schemes and methods out there. A lot of them though, tend to rely on existing payments. So you think about when Apple launched their wallet. Even PayPal, the vast majority of their volume is processed to existing payment networks. And debit processing is incredibly complex and quite frankly very low margin, and very efficient as you look at how the 3 major debit networks, as MasterCard and Visa operate.  And right now, given the interchange caps that a lot of banks have, the economics for them are relatively thin. So while we look at what the Fed might be proposing what goes on in other markets, I don't see anything in the near or even medium-term that looks like it has the potential. And quite frankly, you're starting to see an increase in volume here on the debit side. Even a lot of the buy now pay later players are leveraging debit for their payments.\nDon Fandetti: You don't see debit really going away per se and being replaced by direct-to-account payments in the U.S.?\nRoger Hochschild: No. The risk management of payments is quite complex in terms of both fraud and identity. There are lot of processes and controls that the major networks have in place. There's a robust ecosystem if you think about point-of-sale devices, merchant acquirers. And so, to think that that will change suddenly, I see is a low probability.\nDon Fandetti: Thank you.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nBetsy Graseck: Hi. Hey, Roger, just following up on that. Is there an opportunity for you to take your debit network and debit capabilities, and expand it into that new, I wouldn't call it new, I guess, but into that revitalized interest in debit that we're seeing?\nRoger Hochschild: Yes. Great question, Betsy. Certainly we have a unique set of network assets and can provide connectivity to merchants whether through proxy card numbers or a series of other technologies, and work closely with a number of Fintechs around that. So that's the core of some of what we do with Sezzle. Actually that was the beginning of our relationship with Marqeta many years ago and they are a lot of others that are either in the market now, or but were in discussions with. So I think the pulse on the debit assets we have combined with our signature network or an advantage and one that we look to monetize.\nBetsy Graseck: Okay. And then as we're thinking about the dance that's coming over the next couple of years between loan growth and credit normalization. Can you help us understand how you're thinking about managing that trajectory? Because what I heard earlier in the call is you've been getting more and more efficient at account acquisition, right? Part of your marketing spend coming in lower than expected or at least lower than consensus than we expected, is a function of you doing something, I don't know if it's cloud or technology or what, to get more efficient at account targeting and account acquisition.  So on the one hand, you've got that running in a very positive direction. You talked about the payment rates being a little bit of a headwind to monetizing that but at the same time, we've got credit normalizing. So is there an opportunity for you to pull levers on marketing to generate some more loan growth, or is it more likely to come from the personal loan side or the student loan side, as credits normalizing, how should we think about how you're managing that?\nJohn Greene: Betsy, I'll take this one. So there's a lot to that question. Let me just give a view in terms of what we're seeing as we closed out the third quarter. As I mentioned, the payment rate is stepping down and from August to September we expect that to continue. That will help certainly drive loan growth. My sense is today that there is a relationship between the payment rate and sales activity. So the persistently high payment rate, I think, has driven sales activity across the industry.  Now, we benefited, I would say slightly disproportionately in terms of driving incremental sales, partly due to the acquisition point you mentioned. So there's 2 dynamics, but third dynamic is credit normalizing. And my sense is that credit normalization will continue through '22 into '23. So today where I said I'm positive on credit. So those factors in the aggregate and addition to the point you mentioned in terms of account targeting, I think position us pretty well in '22 for positive loan growth, not the specific full come a little bit later in January when we give our view. But we're all positive on that front today.\nBetsy Graseck: Okay. And then could you touch on what's driving that account acquisition being more efficient? You mentioned the process-oriented improvements or what specifically are you talking about there?\nRoger Hochschild: So Betsy, it's Roger again. A lot of the enhancements that we're seeing are leveraging the advanced analytics. And so that's really helping both on the underwriting side with swap in swap outs as well as better targeting combined with investments we're making from beginning to end in the Marchex stock. And we think those are already serving as well, but there's also plenty of upside as we continue to focus on that area.\nBetsy Graseck: Got it. All right. Thank you.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Bill Carcache with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nBill Carcache: Thank you. Good morning, Roger and John.\nJohn Greene: Good morning.\nBill Carcache: I wanted to -- wanted to follow up on your conviction in more robust loan growth in 2022, if we were to get either in just modest mid-single-digit spending growth next year. Do you think the incremental tailwind from payment rate normalization could be enough to support double-digit loan growth. And just to clarify, on this point, did you -- did you say earlier, John, that you think we could see payment rates get back to normalized, maybe 2019 levels by the end of 2023? Is that a reasonable expectation?\nJohn Greene: So 2023 is the horizon that we're looking at for payment rate to normalize. And when that happens, we expect savings rate to return to normalized levels. So one view is continuing to watch the savings rate. And that should help inform payment rate. That's, frankly, one of the metrics we look at. In terms of robust loan growth in 2022, Let me just put it this way here because we're going to hold off until January on providing explicit details.  But the new account originations has been important for growth. Sales activity has been important for growth. The payment rate, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, has been a headwind, not completely expanding anticipated. We did see it mildly higher than what we had modeled, but we're still on track for delivering the loan growth that we talked about for '21 -- '22. It will be informed by all those factors and shared bill with more -- in more detail in January.\nBill Carcache: Understood. Thanks. If I can follow up about a separate question on BNPL risk. I guess there's a group on one side that thinks that it's largely customers who can't qualify for credit and are just using the BNPL to turn their debit cards into credit cards. And we've heard the CEO of Sezzle, which we know is one of your partners, speak to that point. And then there's this other group that is more concerned about the competitive threat posed by certain BNPL players that do longer term installment lending and the risks that they'll eat into margins and pricing over time. Can you frame for us how you're thinking about the competitive threat? And now that you've had a little bit more time to study what's happening with the different BNPL players.\nJohn Greene: Sure. I'll start with them and while we had more time to study it, I'd say the market is not yet mature and I think market-clearing economics have yet to be established. Part of the challenge is there are many segments within buy-now pay-later, from the people financing a multi-thousand dollar purchase, which by the way, they've done for years in terms of traditional sales finance, versus more spreading out payments on $60 worth of cosmetics. So those segments all have different characteristics, certainly at the lower end there are many customers who are either debit preferring or do not have access to significant amounts of credit. But I think you'll continue to see it evolve. You're starting to see some pressure from merchants who are unwilling to pay, take rates above what they pay in card.\nRoger Hochschild: So right now, we certainly see opportunity on the payment side as I talked about earlier, leveraging our assets. Over time, we think there may be opportunity for us as an issuer, and again, partially leveraging our unique model on our proprietary network. But right now, I would say we're not seeing any noticeable impact on revolving loans and believe that we are well-positioned to respond if it does emerge.\nBill Carcache: Thanks, Roger and John, I appreciate you taking my questions.\nRoger Hochschild: Thanks, Bill.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Please go ahead.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Thanks. Good morning. I want to follow up on some of Ryan 's questions on competition. I guess, Roger, when you think about the competitive landscape on a go-forward basis, if you look at the post-financial crisis period, a lot of that competition was transactor-oriented, like people going up transactor customers. Do you think this time it's going to be a little different given what unfolded last time or do you think that it's going to be the same? I'm just curious as you think about how you're setting up competitively.\nRoger Hochschild: Sanjay, I am lucky enough to be able to look back over multiple cycles of competition and it has varied. Everything from an intense focus across the board on prime revolvers to transactors. I think certainly America Express will stay focused on that spend based model. A lot of banks focus on those transactors because they are very profitable customers. Not so much in card, but in other segments of the business.  The prime revolver space has historically been the most challenging in terms of what it requires from a value proposition and underwriting. For transactors it's really about rolling out our rich rewards program. So we expect to see competition across the spectrum, but what impacts us most will be that in the Prime revolver space.\nSanjay Sakhrani: And you don't see any of that really intensifying relative to what you anticipated, commits pretty consistent?\nRoger Hochschild: Yeah, I would say it's intensified significantly since sort of the low during the pandemic, but is now getting back to I would say, more normalized levels.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Got it. And then, John, just one follow-up on NIM. I know we're not talking about next year's guidance until next quarter, but just broadly speaking, as we sit here today with your NIM, pretty high levels just relative to history. As the growth comes, do you envision that to be a tailwind for the NIM or does that start counteracting some of this because the BT rates increased? I'm just curious how we should think about the progression going forward. Thanks.\nJohn Greene: Thanks, Sanjay. If you go back and look at NIM historically, you'll see that it was subjected to, frankly, higher funding costs from unsecured term debt. What we've tried to do is shore up the liability side of the balance sheets and targeting 70%, 80%, based from deposits and then the rest combination of secured and unsecured security offerings. So that will create stability in terms of the funding cost. In terms of pluses and minuses to the revenue line. What we'll say is some Peaky related impacts to NIM.  You'll see credit if it does normalize, a bit of credit, normalization. in terms of NIM. But you will also see that sustained impact from funding I just talked about. So we're looking at NIM to be higher than what we've experienced historically. And we're going to compare '21 how we ended -- end the year in terms of the balance sheet position and see how that impacts '22. But overall, I would say the funding position has created more stability and a economic benefit too to investors.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Understood. Thank you.\nOperator: We will take the next question from Mihir Bhatia with Bank of America, please go ahead.\nMihir Bhatia: Good morning, and thank you for taking my question. Maybe the stock -- if you could just clarify a little bit on the marketing expense top guidance maybe for the fourth quarter. I understand you don't want to talk about 2022 yet. But just for the fourth quarter, when you talked about marketing expense you have relative to 2019 levels, are you talking on a quarterly basis so you know fourth-quarters? We're looking at 235 - ish million. I understand you may not want to give exact numbers, but should we be thinking on a quarterly basis or Jon a full-year basis? just given the backup in the first 3 quarters of the year, that would be a pretty big increase versus on a quarterly basis. I just want to make sure you clarify that. Thank you.\nJohn Greene: So thanks. When we referenced 2019, we're talking a full year basis. So then that would force folks to do a little bit of math on the third quarter and fourth quarter. We came in lower in the third quarter than we anticipated. Fourth quarter, we expect it will increase from the 210. So to, frankly, remove some ambiguity on this, so it will be somewhere in the range of 220 to, call it, 280. \nMihir Bhatia: Thank you.\nJohn Greene: I hesitate to give that level of specificity, but given the confusion, I just wanted to put it away.\nMihir Bhatia: Sure. And we appreciate that. Maybe just taking a step back on the credit side and just longer-term consumer credit performance. I think underwrite new accounts, can you just talk about what kind of through the cycle loss rate assumption you are making? I guess what I'm really trying to understand is what is the normalized loss rate for your credit card portfolio as you think about longer-term economics?\nJohn Greene: Yeah. So we would confirm we do use a through the cycle -- through the cycle loss rate and so do not use current losses, but that's not something we disclose.\nMihir Bhatia: Okay. Thank you.\nJohn Greene: Thanks.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Aaron Citan Avec (ph) with Citi. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thanks. The pace of spending by your cardholders accelerated a little bit in 3Q relative to 2019. Is that consistent through the quarter or did it show any signs of rising or falling in terms of the cadence, there?\nJohn Greene: We've seen ups and downs in particular, we talked about a bit of a soft thing around travel that occurred in August. And I think that was driven by a lot of what was going on with the pandemic. But we continue to see very robust sales volume, even continuing into October.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay, thanks. And then the comments on the personal loan pricing of uncompetitive pressures there, is that mainly from new entrants in the market where we're seeing a lot of different types of personal loan models coming to market in the past couple of years. Is that something that you would expect to continue as competitive pressure going forward, or is this more of a just marking down relative to where the existing book was?\nRoger Hochschild: A lot of it is coming into from new entrants. Personal loans are probably the easiest to fund outside of a bank and have the easiest servicing requirements. And so that's where a lot of the new entrants will go with new models. We are disciplined both on credit, but as well as pricing. And we will not go below the targeted returns we want to hit. A lot of times that will flush its way through when they either don't get the performance that they want to see or have other challenges. You do get sometimes you are prioritizing growth over returns, but that tends not to last for too long.\nOperator: Will take next questions from Mark DeVries with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nMark De Vries: Yes. Thanks. Just had a question about what you're seeing in the student lending space on when your competitors has noted some headwinds in the quarter. Just how is that shaping up?\nJohn Greene: We feel pretty good about peak season volumes were up roughly seven percent year-over-year. And we believe that we gained share. Although we're still sort of processing. So clearly, we saw one major competitor step back last year, but we're very excited about that market. We underwrite it into a very disciplined way and it's a great way to get a really good product in our brand in front of the next generation of prime cardholders.\nMark De Vries: Okay. Got it. And then just a follow-up question on polls. Some -- and as you know, you've had some pretty strong volumes there. Roger, is there a point at which you start to get some meaningful scale benefits and the earnings contribution from that becomes more meaningful and grows faster than the volumes?\nRoger Hochschild: We would love to increase the percent of our earnings that comes out of the payments segment. I think one of the challenges we also are working pretty hard to increase earnings from our banking segment. So we're not standing still there either. It's -- while we're excited about Pulse, it's also very competitive. We're battling for routing at the merchant level with Visa MasterCard day in, day out, we've seen a lot of growth from expanding from traditional PIN-debit to card-not-present. And so that's been particularly helpful. But we're very focused on growing that business.\nMark De Vries: Okay. Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nMoshe Orenbuch: Great. Thanks. Maybe just to come back to the new account acquisition. Is there, particularly in card, is there a way to talk about either is there are any different channels that you are using or what's the nature of the consumer? Is there any differences in the type of consumer that you're seeing?\nRoger Hochschild: Not really, Moshe. I don't think we've seen anything dramatic since prior to the pandemic. Clearly they continued migration to digital channels. Direct mail becomes a smaller and smaller piece, but that's been a trend for many years now. So we continually are fine-tuning the digital channels. I guess what we've seen is a greater ability to measure the results of top of final spend. As it shifts more digital, when that spend moves from TV to even video, that's online, you can do a better job with tracking and attribution. And so we are repositioning how we spend, and that's one of the areas we're leveraging some of our advanced analytics.\nMoshe Orenbuch: Got you, thank you. As you mentioned, using balanced transfer as part of this. You talked a little bit about, anything you can share with us in terms of whether they are all at 0 or are there some that are at yields above 0 and any kind of update on what you've seen in terms of retention of those balances.\nRoger Hochschild: Sure. Probably one of the bigger trend, there was a real collapse in balanced transferred demand, during the pandemic. Clearly, a lot of issuers were pulling back on credit line increases, but I think consumers were much more focused on paying down there debt versus moving it around. So you saw a softening in demand for personal loans and balance transfers, that's starting to come back. For us, a lot of our acquisition offers are at zero percent. The portfolio offers tends to either be above zero or have a fee that provides a pretty effective yield. And as John pointed out, for most of those, we see a very high return from the balanced transfer itself, given this funding environment, as well as a good percent sticking. And that's something we modeled very carefully.\nMoshe Orenbuch: Great. Thanks so much.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Dominick Gabriele with Oppenheimer, please go ahead.\nDominick Gabriele: Great. Thank you so much for taking my questions. I guess if we just think about the comments around the economic outlook getting for early assumptions around your economic outlook, becoming a slightly worse from the third quarter -- from the second quarter to the third quarter, but then being incrementally positive into '22 credit trends, can you just square those two pieces together?\nRoger Hochschild: Yeah. Happy to, Dominick. When we modeled in the second quarter, frankly, the economists saw a higher level of GDP growth and employment returning to normalized levels sooner. And when we updated those, the GDP had come down, employment returning to normalized levels pushed event. So that was one of multiple inputs. We provide that detail because it's frankly the most transparent that people can take a look at to get a view of how we're thinking about the reserves.  Now, the other items that are important in terms of our thinking here in the third quarter was, first, portfolio performance and it's been super strong. Second, was the ending of many of the government's work programs related to COVID. So most of those ended in August and September. What we'd like to do is see some seasoning of the impacts of those into the fourth quarter and perhaps even in the first quarter next year. If what we expect is that the impact of that seasoning will be very, very mild on the portfolio.  And the magnet -- the broad macros continue to look favorable. There's enough points of reference that would lead us to begin to step the reserves back to day 1. But a lot of things need to happen and we ended up where we were on the third quarter, ran through multiple models, multiple scenarios, and we got comfortable with where we were to make sure the balance sheet was fairly stated. But we do see that the broad macros out into the future are positive. So we'll see how they sustain and make a call in the fourth and in 2022.\nDominick Gabriele: Great, thanks for that. And if you all think about how the hierarchy of products that you have, as well as across the consumer space for normalization on which products could normalize. Perhaps let's just -- I don't know in -- to even maybe 2019 levels NCO rates. Are there certain products you would expect to normalize either faster than other products or any color you can provide along the trajectory of one product versus the other, given what you're seeing in your customer base would be awesome? Thank you so much.\nJohn Greene: Yeah. That's a difficult thing to do in that it will be subject to the economic environment. So we know historically if there is a period of tougher financial situation, the personal loans will be the ones that get the least priority in terms of payment. Credit cards tend to be high. The student loans, given the long duration of those contracts, they don't seem to gyrate as much with the economic output place of that so much of our portfolios co-sign that it provides additional coverage there. So you get to personal loans subject to the economic environment. And then the card, my sense is the card has been prioritized in terms of the payment hierarchy because of what has happened in terms of cash in the digital environment, it's really difficult to shop without a card these days. So I look for stability there.\nDominick Gabriele: Great. Thanks so much. I appreciate it.\nOperator: And our final question will come from Bill Ryan with Seaport Research, please go ahead.\nBill Ryan: Thank you and good morning. A couple of questions. One on the personal loans business. I believe you've been in the business since 2007. Lot of new entrants in the marketplace today, you talked about it. But I remember 2/3 of your book is roughly from the existing Discover Credit card file but the other third historically coming from the other place out-of-market or out of your existing file. As far as the underwriting you're seeing from the new entrants, you talked a little bit about it, but I was wondering if you could take a little bit more granular approach to it, and talk about, are they making compromises relative to what you're willing to do on credit, payment income, yield verification, all the above. And second, just going back to the bonus accruals. A lot of companies are stepping up bonuses as employee retention efforts. Is this something we should kind of view is transitory onetime? Or might this transfer into a little bit higher compensation expense going into next year? Thanks.\nRoger Hochschild: I'll start with the bonus accrual. We haven't made any changes to our bonus program. So to the extent there are changes in bonus are cool, at your reflects for stronger financial performance this year versus last year and -- then how that translates. In terms of personal loans space, it is very hard to get line of sight into the practices of these companies, and there are many of them. We've seen them came and go over multiple cycles.  In general, I would say they tend to have fewer manual or labor-intensive processes. So I'd be surprised if they did the extent of employment verification we do. And again, it might be appropriate if their average ticket is lower. They may have different return profiles. The one thing I would say, the vast majority lend to a much broader spectrum than we do. And so we focus on the prime segment, again, primarily debt consolidation. But it is hard to generalize across the many different new entrants that may have different models.\nBill Ryan: Thank you.\nEric Wasserstrom: Excellent. Well, thank you all for joining us, and if you have any further questions, please reach out to the IR team. We'll be around all day to address them. Thanks again, and have a great day.\nOperator: Okay, and this does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at anytime.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Roger Hochschild",
            "content": "Thank you, Eric. And thanks to our listeners for joining today's call. We had another period of strong financial results in the third quarter with earnings of $1.1 billion after-tax or $3.54 per share. In many respects, these results reflected the unique benefits of our integrated Digital Banking and Payments model, which continues to be a source of significant competitive advantage by supporting our value proposition to consumers and merchants, and differentiating our brand. These advantages enabled our continued investment in account acquisition, technology, and analytics while generating substantial capital. In an environment characterized by new entrants and intensifying competition, we believe the strength of our model position us to accelerate our growth. Underlying our results this quarter were 3 important advancements. The first was our return to year-over-year receivables growth, which is driven by our investment in acquisition and brand marketing, and continued strong sales trends. Total sales were up 27% over 2019 levels with strong momentum across all categories.  Even travel sales increased, and while they dropped a bit in August due to concerns related to the Delta variant, travel has steadily improved since that. We also continued to see attractive opportunities for account acquisition and increased our marketing investments to take advantage of this. While the competitive environment has intensified, new account so are now up 17% over 2019, reflecting the strength of our value proposition. This value proposition remains anchored in our industry-leading onshore customer service model, no annual fees, and useful and transparent rewards.  While some of our peers had to reinvigorate their rewards offerings at substantial cost, our rewards costs were up only 6 basis points year-over-year, and nearly all of this increase was driven by higher consumer spending, as evidenced in our strong discount revenue. Given these dynamics, we will continue investing in new accounts as long as the environment supports profitable opportunities and our robust account growth and our expectations for modest improvement in payment rates supports so our view of stronger receivables growth in 2022.  The second key trend was credit, which remained exceptionally strong. Our disciplined approach to credit management and favorable economic trends contributed to a record low net charge-off rate and continued low delinquencies. The delinquency outlook affirmed our expectations that losses will be below last year's levels for the full year and supported additional reserve releases during the quarter. And the third is the continued expansion of our payments business.  Both saw a meaningful increase in debit volume with 9% growth year-over-year, and a 26% increase over the third quarter of 2019, demonstrating both the impact of the recovery and an increase in debit use through the pandemic. Our Diners business has also started to see some improvement from the global recovery with volume up 12% from the prior year. As the global economy recovers, we will continue to look for opportunities to expand our international reach. In summary, our value proposition continues to be attractive and our Integrated Digital Banking and Payments model supports profitable long-term customer relationships and is highly capital-generated. I continue to feel very good about our prospects for future growth. I'll now ask John to discuss key aspects of our financial results in more detail. Great. Alright. Thanks for the question. The payment rate has been persistently high And what we did see in the month of September was that ticked down mildly. It did increase from July to August, which was frankly a bit of a surprise. But as I look -- as I looked at the data, we're seeing here in terms of revolve, and then the forecasted trends, my expectation is that in the fourth quarter, it will continue to step down.  Some of that has to do with governments support programs ending in September and some of it has to do with the holiday season. And then as we look on the holiday season into 2022, I do expect that it will continue to step towards a normalized rate. But, frankly, I don't think that'll happen until 2023. How do we think about the implications from that? Certainly, the payment rate is a bit of a headwind to growth. But what we've seen is really strong account acquisition and strong sales growth, Morning. Sure, thanks for the question. I think my actual comment was good growth in the face of intense competition, and I think that really sums it up well. The competition in the card business is always intense. We were lucky enough to have a lapse in 2020. And so some show of extraordinarily good cost per account. But it's what we're used to facing. It'll vary based on which issuers are refreshing their cards or have more of a desire than growth for growth than others.  But I think our focus on a clear, differentiated value proposition has resulted in continued strong generation of new accounts. And I'm excited about what I see. In terms of the new entrants, we see that less in the core credit cards space. But I would say very, very aggressive competition around personal loans by in that scenario where we focused on the long-term, remain disciplined in our underwriting and what we're willing to invest in new accounts and are used to seeing competitors come and go. Sure. Great question. There are always, I would say, new payment schemes and methods out there. A lot of them though, tend to rely on existing payments. So you think about when Apple launched their wallet. Even PayPal, the vast majority of their volume is processed to existing payment networks. And debit processing is incredibly complex and quite frankly very low margin, and very efficient as you look at how the 3 major debit networks, as MasterCard and Visa operate.  And right now, given the interchange caps that a lot of banks have, the economics for them are relatively thin. So while we look at what the Fed might be proposing what goes on in other markets, I don't see anything in the near or even medium-term that looks like it has the potential. And quite frankly, you're starting to see an increase in volume here on the debit side. Even a lot of the buy now pay later players are leveraging debit for their payments. No. The risk management of payments is quite complex in terms of both fraud and identity. There are lot of processes and controls that the major networks have in place. There's a robust ecosystem if you think about point-of-sale devices, merchant acquirers. And so, to think that that will change suddenly, I see is a low probability. Yes. Great question, Betsy. Certainly we have a unique set of network assets and can provide connectivity to merchants whether through proxy card numbers or a series of other technologies, and work closely with a number of Fintechs around that. So that's the core of some of what we do with Sezzle. Actually that was the beginning of our relationship with Marqeta many years ago and they are a lot of others that are either in the market now, or but were in discussions with. So I think the pulse on the debit assets we have combined with our signature network or an advantage and one that we look to monetize. So Betsy, it's Roger again. A lot of the enhancements that we're seeing are leveraging the advanced analytics. And so that's really helping both on the underwriting side with swap in swap outs as well as better targeting combined with investments we're making from beginning to end in the Marchex stock. And we think those are already serving as well, but there's also plenty of upside as we continue to focus on that area. So right now, we certainly see opportunity on the payment side as I talked about earlier, leveraging our assets. Over time, we think there may be opportunity for us as an issuer, and again, partially leveraging our unique model on our proprietary network. But right now, I would say we're not seeing any noticeable impact on revolving loans and believe that we are well-positioned to respond if it does emerge. Thanks, Bill. Sanjay, I am lucky enough to be able to look back over multiple cycles of competition and it has varied. Everything from an intense focus across the board on prime revolvers to transactors. I think certainly America Express will stay focused on that spend based model. A lot of banks focus on those transactors because they are very profitable customers. Not so much in card, but in other segments of the business.  The prime revolver space has historically been the most challenging in terms of what it requires from a value proposition and underwriting. For transactors it's really about rolling out our rich rewards program. So we expect to see competition across the spectrum, but what impacts us most will be that in the Prime revolver space. Yeah, I would say it's intensified significantly since sort of the low during the pandemic, but is now getting back to I would say, more normalized levels. A lot of it is coming into from new entrants. Personal loans are probably the easiest to fund outside of a bank and have the easiest servicing requirements. And so that's where a lot of the new entrants will go with new models. We are disciplined both on credit, but as well as pricing. And we will not go below the targeted returns we want to hit. A lot of times that will flush its way through when they either don't get the performance that they want to see or have other challenges. You do get sometimes you are prioritizing growth over returns, but that tends not to last for too long. We would love to increase the percent of our earnings that comes out of the payments segment. I think one of the challenges we also are working pretty hard to increase earnings from our banking segment. So we're not standing still there either.

            "name": "John Greene",
            "content": "Thank you, Roger. And good morning, everyone. Once again, our results this quarter reflect strong execution and that continued economic recovery. Looking at our financial summary results on Page 4, there are 3 key things I want to call out. First, our total revenue net of interest expense is up 8% from their prior year, excluding a $167 million unrealized loss due to market adjustments on our equity investments, including this, revenue is up 2% for the quarter. Second, is a continuation of very strong credit performance. Net charge-offs were down 343 million from the prior year, which supported a $165 million reserve release this quarter. Lastly, we continue investing for growth with increased marketing spend, higher operating expenses in other area were largely related to the economic recovery.  I'll go over the details of our quarterly results in our full year outlook on the following slides. Looking at loan growth on Slide 5. We saw the return to growth this quarter with ending loans up 1% over the prior year, and up 2%, sequentially. Card loans were the primary driver and we're also up 1% year-over-year and 2% over the prior quarter. The year-over-year increase in card receivables was driven by strong sales volume and robust account acquisition. Sales growth continued to accelerate and was up 27% over the third quarter of 2019. Year-to-date new accounts were up 27% from their prior year and up 17% over 2019 levels.  The contribution from these factors was mostly offset by the ongoing high-payment rates as household savings and cash flows remain elevated. The payment rate was approximately 500 basis points over pre -pandemic levels. We anticipate that the payment rate will moderate a bit as most federal COVID support programs have ended and consumer savings rates have started to decrease. That said, we expect payment rates to remain above historical levels through 2022. Looking at our other lending products. Organic student loans increased 4% from the prior year with originations up 7% as most schools have returned to the normal in-person learning model.  Personal loans decreased 4% driven by high payment rates. Our underwriting criteria have returned to pre -pandemic level, and we expect a return to growth in this product in future periods. Moving to slide 6. Net interest margin was 10.8% up 61 basis points from the prior year, and 12 basis points from the prior quarter. Compared to the prior quarter, the increase in net interest margin was primarily driven by lower interest charge-offs and lower funding costs. This was partially offset by higher mix of promotional rate balances. Card loan yield was up one basis point sequentially as lower interest charge-offs were offset by the increased promotional balance mix.  Yields on personal loans declined 15 basis points sequentially, due to lower pricing. The margin continued to benefit from lower funding cost primarily driven by maturities of higher rate  and an increased mix of lower rate savings and money market balances. Average consumer deposits were flat year-over-year, and declined 1% from the prior quarter. The quarter-over-quarter decline was largely driven by consumer CDs. We also saw a slight decline in savings and money market deposits as consumers continue to spend excess levels of liquidity. We also continue to optimize our funding stack.  Late in September, we executed our first ABS issuance since October 2019, consisting of a $1.2 billion security with a 3-year fixed rate coupon up 58 basis points, and a 5-year $600 million security with a fixed coupon of a 103 basis points. These were our lowest ABS coupons ever and show good execution and timing by our treasury team. Looking at revenue on Slide 7, total non-interest income increased 90 million or 20% over the prior year, excluding the unrealized loss on equity investments.  Net discount and interchange revenue was up 61 million or 26%, driven by strong sales volume. This was partially offset by increased rewards costs due to high sales in the 5% category, which was restaurants and PayPal, both this year and last. We continue to benefit from strong sales through our partnership with PayPal, while restaurant sales were up 62% year-over-year as dining activity recovered. Loans fee income was up 21 million or 21% primarily driven by lower late fee charge-offs and higher non-sufficient funds and cash advance fees. Looking at Slide 8, total operating expenses were up $185 million or 18% from the prior year. The details reflect our focus on investing for future growth while managing our operating costs.  Employee compensation increased 12 million driven by a higher bonus accrual in the current year. Excluding bonuses, employee compensation was down 3% from their prior year from lower headcount. Marketing expense increased 70 million, supporting another quarter of strong new account growth. Other expense included a $50 million legal accrual. Professional fees were up $47 million primarily due to higher recovery fees  reopening combined with strong credit and economic conditions have driven an increase in recoveries and their associated fees, year-to-date recoveries were up 20% compared to the prior year. The benefits of these costs is reflected in lower credit losses. Moving to slide 9.  The trend of sustained strong credit performance, continued. Total net charge-offs were a record low at 1.46% down a 154 basis points year-over-year and 66 basis points sequentially. Total net charge-off dollars decreased 343 million from their prior year and were down 131 million quarter-over-quarter. Credit performance was strong across all products as evidenced by the net charge-off rates on card, private student loans, and personal loans. Moving to the allowance for credit losses on slide 10. This quarter, we released a $165 million from the reserves and our reserve rate drop 35 basis points to 7.7%.  The reserve release reflects continued strong credit performance and a largely stable macroeconomic outlook. The impact of these was partially offset by 2% increase in loans from the prior quarter. Our economic dysfunctions include an unemployment rate of approximately 5.5% by year-end, and GDP growth of just over 6%. These assumptions were slightly less positive than those used in the Second Quarter, but still reflect a strong at economic outlook. Looking at Slide 11, our common equity Tier 1 for the period was 15.5%, well above our 10.5% target. We repurchased $815 million of common stock and, as we had previously announced, increased our dividend payable by 14% to $0.50 per share.  These actions reflect our commitment to returning capital to our shareholders. On funding, we continue to make progress towards our goal of having deposits be 70% to 80% of our funding mix. Deposits now make up 68% of total funding, up from 62 in the prior year. Wrapping up on slide 12. Our outlook for 2021 has not changed and reflects continued strong execution against our financial and strategic objectives. In summary, we remain well-positioned for profitable growth from improving loan trends.  Credit performance trends remained favorable, reflecting positive macroeconomic conditions and our approach to underwriting and credit management. Investments for growth have supported the significant increase in new accounts while we've contained operating expenses. Lastly, our Integrated Digital Banking and Payments model is highly capital-generative, allowing us to invest for growth and return capital to shareholders. We look forward to providing our outlook for 2022 on our conference call in January. With that, I will turn the call back to our Operator, Ashley, to open the line for Q&A. which to date has helped offset some of that payment rate impact. So overall, we feel very, very comfortable that 20 -- the balance of '21 and then 22, we'll have a bit of tailwind related to both payment rates declining and then strong, strong execution from the new accounts and sales growth. Yes. So from a marketing standpoint, we spend the money as we see opportunity to drive profitable new accounts. And, frankly, we've had a great quarter and a great year with that. The third quarter spend actually came in mildly lower than what we originally anticipated, and the guidance I had provided on the last call was that we would approximate the 2019 levels of total marketing expense. I think it'll be a little bit under that, largely not because of opportunities, but basically kind of some process oriented stuff in terms of account targeting. So we feel like the money we'll spend in the fourth quarter will certainly generate positive new account growth. It will pick up from third quarter certainly, and provide us a good trajectory for 2022. Thank you. Sure. On the marketing spent, that will be determined -- are determined based on the opportunities we see as, as we look at 22, we do see a continued benign credit environment and frankly a very strong opportunity to drive profitable new account growth. As that opportunity continues to persist, we'll continue to spend marketing dollars. What I would suggest is we concentrate here on 2021 And then in the January call, we'll talk about '22 in terms of the opportunities there.  But I'll leave you with this point that the fourth-quarter trajectory should help inform what we intend to spend in 2022. In terms of balance transfers, we did see a impact from some of the increased balance transfers that we executed in early part of '21 and the third quarter in terms of mild impacts to margin. We will continue to take a look at that space and see what we can generate profitably. It's been a good source of account acquisition for us historically and will continue to remain disciplined and put those prime revolver accounts on the balance transfer. Thank you, Ryan. Betsy, I'll take this one. So there's a lot to that question. Let me just give a view in terms of what we're seeing as we closed out the third quarter. As I mentioned, the payment rate is stepping down and from August to September we expect that to continue. That will help certainly drive loan growth. My sense is today that there is a relationship between the payment rate and sales activity. So the persistently high payment rate, I think, has driven sales activity across the industry.  Now, we benefited, I would say slightly disproportionately in terms of driving incremental sales, partly due to the acquisition point you mentioned. So there's 2 dynamics, but third dynamic is credit normalizing. And my sense is that credit normalization will continue through '22 into '23. So today where I said I'm positive on credit. So those factors in the aggregate and addition to the point you mentioned in terms of account targeting, I think position us pretty well in '22 for positive loan growth, not the specific full come a little bit later in January when we give our view. But we're all positive on that front today. Good morning. So 2023 is the horizon that we're looking at for payment rate to normalize. And when that happens, we expect savings rate to return to normalized levels. So one view is continuing to watch the savings rate. And that should help inform payment rate. That's, frankly, one of the metrics we look at. In terms of robust loan growth in 2022, Let me just put it this way here because we're going to hold off until January on providing explicit details.  But the new account originations has been important for growth. Sales activity has been important for growth. The payment rate, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, has been a headwind, not completely expanding anticipated. We did see it mildly higher than what we had modeled, but we're still on track for delivering the loan growth that we talked about for '21 -- '22. It will be informed by all those factors and shared bill with more -- in more detail in January. Sure. I'll start with them and while we had more time to study it, I'd say the market is not yet mature and I think market-clearing economics have yet to be established. Part of the challenge is there are many segments within buy-now pay-later, from the people financing a multi-thousand dollar purchase, which by the way, they've done for years in terms of traditional sales finance, versus more spreading out payments on $60 worth of cosmetics. So those segments all have different characteristics, certainly at the lower end there are many customers who are either debit preferring or do not have access to significant amounts of credit. But I think you'll continue to see it evolve. You're starting to see some pressure from merchants who are unwilling to pay, take rates above what they pay in card. Thanks, Sanjay. If you go back and look at NIM historically, you'll see that it was subjected to, frankly, higher funding costs from unsecured term debt. What we've tried to do is shore up the liability side of the balance sheets and targeting 70%, 80%, based from deposits and then the rest combination of secured and unsecured security offerings. So that will create stability in terms of the funding cost. In terms of pluses and minuses to the revenue line. What we'll say is some Peaky related impacts to NIM.  You'll see credit if it does normalize, a bit of credit, normalization. in terms of NIM. But you will also see that sustained impact from funding I just talked about. So we're looking at NIM to be higher than what we've experienced historically. And we're going to compare '21 how we ended -- end the year in terms of the balance sheet position and see how that impacts '22. But overall, I would say the funding position has created more stability and a economic benefit too to investors. So thanks. When we referenced 2019, we're talking a full year basis. So then that would force folks to do a little bit of math on the third quarter and fourth quarter. We came in lower in the third quarter than we anticipated. Fourth quarter, we expect it will increase from the 210. So to, frankly, remove some ambiguity on this, so it will be somewhere in the range of 220 to, call it, 280. I hesitate to give that level of specificity, but given the confusion, I just wanted to put it away. Yeah. So we would confirm we do use a through the cycle -- through the cycle loss rate and so do not use current losses, but that's not something we disclose. Thanks. We've seen ups and downs in particular, we talked about a bit of a soft thing around travel that occurred in August. And I think that was driven by a lot of what was going on with the pandemic. But we continue to see very robust sales volume, even continuing into October. We feel pretty good about peak season volumes were up roughly seven percent year-over-year. And we believe that we gained share. Although we're still sort of processing. So clearly, we saw one major competitor step back last year, but we're very excited about that market. We underwrite it into a very disciplined way and it's a great way to get a really good product in our brand in front of the next generation of prime cardholders. Yeah. That's a difficult thing to do in that it will be subject to the economic environment. So we know historically if there is a period of tougher financial situation, the personal loans will be the ones that get the least priority in terms of payment. Credit cards tend to be high. The student loans, given the long duration of those contracts, they don't seem to gyrate as much with the economic output place of that so much of our portfolios co-sign that it provides additional coverage there. So you get to personal loans subject to the economic environment. And then the card, my sense is the card has been prioritized in terms of the payment hierarchy because of what has happened in terms of cash in the digital environment, it's really difficult to shop without a card these days. So I look for stability there."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Second Quarter 2021 Discover Financial Services Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker's remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session.  Thank you.\nEric Wasserstrom: Thank you, Stephanie. And good morning, everyone. Welcome to today's call. I'll begin on slide two of our earnings presentation, which you can find in the financial section of our Investor Relations website, investorrelations.discover.com. Our discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. Please refer to our notices regarding forward-looking statements that appear in our second quarter earnings press release and presentation. Our call today will include remarks from our CEO, Roger Hochschild; and John Greene, our Chief Financial Officer. After we conclude our formal comments, there will be time for a question-and-answer session. During the Q&A session, you will be permitted to ask one question, followed by one follow-up question. After your follow-up question, please return to the queue. Now, it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Roger.\nRoger Hochschild: Thanks, Eric. And thanks to our listeners for joining today's call. We had a very good quarter that highlighted the strength of our digital business model and solid execution on our strategic priorities against the backdrop of continued economic improvement. This quarter was characterized by three important events. First, our card receivables grew sequentially in May and June, causing our period end receivables to be up quarter-over-quarter. This outcome, combined with the strength in consumer spending and our account acquisition, increased our confidence for moderate receivables growth this year and stronger growth in 2022. Second, we benefited from a gain in our Payment Services segment. This gain is an outgrowth of a long commercial relationship and underscores our payments ability to forge innovative and lasting partnerships. Lastly, we achieved a historic low in delinquencies, which resulted from consumer's strong liquidity position, our conservative stance on underwriting, and the proactive measures we took into the downturn to protect our credit quality. This outcome also supported our reserve release this quarter. Turning to the quarter's results. We earned $1.7 billion after tax or $5.55 per share. These results include a $729 million one-time gain. But even excluding this gain, our results were very strong at $3.73 per share. The drivers of the quarter's strong results reflect the combination of our solid execution and supportive macro conditions.\nJohn Greene: Thank you, Roger. And good morning, everyone. I'll begin with our summary financial results on slide four. As Roger noted, our results this quarter highlighted the strength of our digital model, solid execution on our priorities and continued improvement in the macroeconomic environment. Revenue, net of interest expense, increased 34% from the prior year. Excluding one-time items, revenue was up 9%. Net interest income was up 5% as we continue to benefit from lower funding costs and reduced interest charge-offs, reflecting strong credit performance. This was partially offset by a 4% decline in average receivables from the prior year levels. Excluding one-time items, non-interest income increased 29%, driven by the higher - by higher net debt count and interchange revenue due to strong sales volume. The provision for credit losses decreased $2 billion from the prior year, mainly due to a $321 million reserve release in the current quarter compared to a $1.3 billion reserve build in the prior year, an improvement in the economic and ongoing credit strength were the primary drivers of the release. Net charge-offs decreased 41% or $311 million from the prior year.\nOperator:  We'll take our first question from John Pancari with Evercore ISI.\nJohn Pancari: Good morning.\nRoger Hochschild: Good Morning.\nJohn Pancari: Just wonder if you could - good morning. Just wonder if you can give a little more color on the payment rate expectation. I guess just what do you see and that gives you confidence in the moderate decline expected for the back half of this year? And if you could talk about the - you know, how you weigh the risks that the payment rate may not moderate from here? And then secondly, on that, are you seeing any differences in your FICO bands in terms of the payment rate behavior? Thanks.\nJohn Greene: Okay, great. Yeah. I'll take the call. I\u2019ll take the question, John. Thanks for that. So, payment rates are, frankly, at a record high. So if you looked at our trust data, you can see that in June they came in at about 29%, and that's - frankly, that's an all time high, at least as far as back as 2005. So what we're seeing when we look at the portfolio, now the portfolio, the trends are similar, but the overall payment rates a bit lower. What we're seeing is a couple of factors. So, one is a deceleration of the growth in payment rate. And second, we formed our expectation on the second half of the year based on all of the government programs that are out there and most - the most significant ones are expiring or have expired by the end of the third quarter. So we expect that, coupled with the strong economic activity and lower savings rate that we're observing, to result in a moderate decrease in the payment rate certainly in the fourth quarter. In the third quarter, it could be flat to maybe even up a mild bit. But overall, our sense is that we've approached the peak of this and it's going to begin to tail out - tail off.\nRoger Hochschild: And in terms of the mix by FICO band, it's pretty broad. Certainly, the higher FICO SKU transactor. So you'll have a higher payment rate in some of the mid-FICOs you've seen revolvers turn transactor. But again, to John's point, we do expect it gradually to normalize.\nJohn Pancari: Okay. Great. Now that's helpful. And then separately, I appreciate the commentary around the loan growth expectation and you also expect some variability in your margin. So, could you - what does that imply for your net interest income expectations? If you could just elaborate a little bit on that in terms of the second half trajectory there and possibly going into 2022?\nJohn Greene: Yeah. So I'll touch upon it. So, you know, the net interest income will follow loan growth. But as you know, in the fourth quarter, the build on loan balance is skewed towards the last two months of the quarter. So net interest margin is what I'll say the trajectory is changing in a positive direction, given the sequential loan growth we saw from first quarter to second quarter. But again, it's going to be in the single digits, lower single digits, is general expectation.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Thanks. Good morning. I guess, my first question is, I know everyone is sort of waiting for the consumer to relever and there's positive signs, but maybe, Roger, you could just speak to the competitive environment? I mean, obviously, everyone's chasing growth or wanting to grow or maybe you could just speak to how it's out there?\nRoger Hochschild: Yeah. Thanks, Sanjay. You know, as we've discussed in the past, the card business is always competitive. There was a nice little lull last year, that we were able to take advantage of and pick-up even more market share. But I think this is returning to more normal, maybe a little heightened, but more normal level of competition. You're seeing new products out there, increased marketing spend. But as I look at our value proposition, cost per accounts we're achieving and the returns, I feel very, very good about the marketing spend we're putting out there and what we're generating for it.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Okay. Great. My follow-up is on the Sezzle investment. Obviously, they're an up and coming buy now, pay later company. I'm just curious sort of, if you could speak to that specific investment, and how you see that unfolding for yourselves, both in terms of the investment itself, but also strategically inside of buy now, pay later? Thanks.\nRoger Hochschild: Sure. So in terms of our buy now, pay later strategy, there are really two parts. The Sezzle investment is really being driven by the payment side. And that's similar to the investment we made in Marqeta a while back. Our set of network assets are very useful for many fin-techs, in terms of just an easier way to process payments and connect to merchants in a wide variety of forms. So I'd say that's the core of what we're doing with Sezzle. We also believe that potentially, overtime, there may be opportunities on the banking side. So in terms of our providing lending, not necessarily with Sezzle, but in the buy now, pay later space more broadly. And again, leveraging what we can do with unsecured lending and our direct merchant relationships. But I'd say, we haven't announced anything on the lending side of buy now, pay later at this time.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs.\nRyan Nash: Hi. Good morning, guys.\nRoger Hochschild: Good morning, Ryan.\nJohn Greene: Good morning.\nRyan Nash: John or Roger, can you maybe just talk about the expectations for monetizing the Marqeta gain, how much do you expect to reinvest versus used for repurchases? Is it already factored into the buyback? Second, can you maybe just remind us what the lock-up is and your intention for the stake? And maybe just lastly, these increase in expenses that we have right now, marketing and non-marketing investments, how much of these are being driven by the Marqeta again? And should we expect these to be one-time in nature or should we expect them to stay in the run rate? Thanks.\nJohn Greene: Okay. All right, Ryan. Thanks. So the Marqeta gain was something that when we looked at the plan for the year, we didn't, frankly, envision that, that opportunity would turn out quite the way it did. So, certainly a nice outcome. You know, the spend that we're seeing isn't - is dictated based on that size of the Marqeta gain, but more about the broad economic opportunity that we're seeing right now to be able to drive positive growth. So frankly, we'll be spending at this level with or without the Marqueta gain. The kind of the lock-up, those points are disclosed in the S-1, so you can reference that and get real specificity on it. And then finally, in terms of the expenses and are they one-time in nature. So within the presentation itself, we highlighted kind of three items that were significant. So one was the bonus accrual unrelated to Marqeta again and more broadly a reflection of what's happening in the business and the outcomes we're seeing here in terms of generating positive returns. The other item there was the Diners intangible, which we took the opportunity based on what we see as a change in the cash flows in Diners to fully impair that and took a $92 million write-off. And then the third item was a $30 million software write-off. So all those are part of our normal, I'll say, hygiene factors. So the last two items were you know, what I would consider relatively one-off, and I wouldn't include those in the kind of operating cash flows going forward. But as you're trying to get a sense for overall spend in 2021, we talked about accelerating marketing expense. So the way I would think about marketing specifically is that we anticipate it to return to 2019 levels, which would indicate a material acceleration in the second half of the year, which, again, is tied to the fact that we're seeing good origination opportunities to drive growth and long-term profitability.\nRyan Nash: Got it. Thanks for the color. And maybe as my follow-up, so you announced the new $2.4 billion buyback. But just given how high the levels of profitability are, you're still going to be well above the 10.5% level. So can you maybe just help us understand the strategy of getting the capital down over what time frame? Are you managing all into CECL day one? And then maybe attached to that, Roger, you talked about potential lending opportunities and buy now, pay later. We've seen others take, some go at it organically, some go via acquisition. What would you expect to be the strategy for Discover on a go-forward basis? Thanks.\nJohn Greene: All right. So I'll hit the capital point real quick. And then we'll flip it over to Roger to handle it back, second part of that question, the second part of that second question, I should say. So the capital plan was based on a couple of different factors. So one, we want to be prudent in our distributions of capital and make sure that we - organic - that we allocate our capital to organic growth opportunities and then buybacks and dividends and then acquisitions as they appear, so that hasn't changed whatsoever.  The planning in terms of capital overall is that we are committed to add 10.5%. As we look at the impacts of the CECL capital relief transition, that's about 200 basis points. And then in the first quarter of next year towards the end of this year, as we review the outlook for 2022 with our Board, we'll make recommendations with a couple of points in mind. The overall economic opportunity, the SEB and where we are with that, and there's plenty of room there. And then, finally, approaching the 10.5.\nRoger Hochschild: Yeah. And in terms of buy now, pay later, there are many sort of different things we could do. Clearly, going direct with the merchant relationships we have is one option we could work with  overtime. But, we don't have anything specific to share at this time.\nOperator: Your next question is from Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo.\nDon Fandetti: Hi. Good morning  technology spend. I just want to get your thoughts on, where your head is right now, whether you're kind of making enough investments in AI and machine learning and staffing, different financial institutions or different points of the cycle?\nRoger Hochschild: Yeah. It is a major source of investment for us. And I would say that the scarcest asset there is talent, as opposed to technology dollars. And then part of it is just making sure you're investing to monetize the granularity you can pick up with enhanced data and analytics. So looking at the entire martech stack, your personalization abilities, what you can deliver through different channels. So it's a big focus. I think we're probably the only major bank where the Head of Data and Analytics is a direct report to the CEO. And so I think that reflects the importance we see on that. And I feel very good about our level of investment.\nDon Fandetti: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from Bob Napoli with William Blair.\nBob Napoli: Thank you. I appreciate it. Good morning. Question, just a follow-up, I guess, on Roger, your investments in like Marqeta and Sezzle and just the thought. I mean, how are you working with Marqeta, how are these investments improving the product set, if you would, for Discover? And are there more of these types of investments or could they become acquisitions in the future?\nRoger Hochschild: Sure. So, all of these investments start with a commercial relationship. We are not venture capitalists, we have no desire to get into that business. But where we have a commercial relationship with a company where we think there's a lot of potential. And there is a way to invest and perhaps extract additional terms, maybe an exclusive arrangement or other commitment, those of the types of opportunities we pursue and they are largely on the payment side and we may even given some of the opportunities we're seeing, accelerate that, although, again, it's going to be relatively modest. In terms of acquisitions, given the valuations, I'm not sure I necessarily see doing acquisitions and this approach around partnership and investment seems to work well. But we will look at it. John and our payments team have a very strong business development effort, and we'll consider acquisitions where it's a capability that will help us monetize our payments assets.\nBob Napoli: Great. Thank you. A follow-up on spend, your chart on page 16, the acceleration through the quarter relative to 2019, I mean, are you surprised by the level of spend that we're seeing? And how do you think about that relative to the long-term trend? I guess if you take this quarter, you maybe had a 10% compound growth from in 2019, but were you surprised by this and the acceleration through the quarter? And your thoughts on spend growth, as you lap - as you look at 2022 and onward?\nRoger Hochschild: Yeah. I mean, I think compound growth is a very challenging measure because it smooths an unbelievable cycle and I don't think any of us would have expected in 2019. So the year-over-year spend growth numbers are unsustainably high for the economy as a whole. The economy is growing above, I think, what economists would say its real level should be. And so you're seeing that pent-up demand from consumers. We expect it to normalize at a strong level, and we look to continue gaining market share given how we're positioned. But I don't think anyone is expecting retail sales to stay up 30% forever.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Mark DeVries with Barclays.\nMark DeVries: Yeah. Thanks. I had a question about the reserve levels. Could you give us some sense of what you're kind of contemplating both from a delinquency and charge-off perspective in those reserves? I mean, I think trends have obviously been very benign and yet you're still almost 200 basis points above kind of your CECL day one. What do you need to see to see those reserves come down more meaningfully?\nJohn Greene: Yeah. Mark, thanks for the question. So when we approach this quarter, certainly, the economic data was improving. The portfolio is performing extremely well. And the charge-off trajectory, you know, we revised our guidance and now believe it will be below the prior year. So all of those are very, very positive from a reserving standpoint. We did put a bit of caution in the kind of reserve numbers, as a result of the various government programs that are out there. So if you think about the eviction moratoriums, foreclosure moratoriums, various payment deferral programs and then the massive amount of government transfer payments that hit the economy, we felt like that those contributed to driving delinquencies and charge-offs below historical norms for our customer base. So under CECL, we reserve for life of loan. And accordingly, we were waiting for those programs to run their course and the cash flows to kind of feed through the economy and impact our customers. And then be able to make, you know, call it, a deeper change to the reserve levels. So as I said earlier, most of those programs ran their course in the third quarter. We obviously have the child care tax, there's a child tax credit. We don't expect that to be an impact. So in the fourth quarter, we should begin to see more data that would allow us to take a different look at reserves and then into 2022, certainly. Our expectation is that the credit environment is very positive from a growth standpoint and accordingly, we'll make reserves that kind of align with that.\nMark DeVries: Okay, got it. And then, just one more question, do you have any other private investments that look like they could be in a large gain position just based on any kind of subsequent funding rounds and the valuations those are done at?\nJohn Greene: So, we have some investments, yes. We try to get in early and build out the commercial relationship, as Roger alluded to. And we're hopeful that the combination of working with quality companies and developing deeper commercial relationships will help those folks to be profitable and help us drive business in our payments area, while giving us an option value for that investment. So, one would hope that there's more. But at this point, it would be way premature to speculate.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Manu Srivareerat from UBS.\nManu Srivareerat: Good morning, guys.\nRoger Hochschild: Good morning.\nJohn Greene: Good morning.\nManu Srivareerat: Thanks for taking my question. I guess, you talked a lot about the benefits of having a differentiated product with flexible cash rewards. Now as things get back to normal and travel rewards become more relevant for consumers, are you seeing any impact to your utilization levels? Is there any indication that consumers might have a shifting preference for travel and my star rewards over cash rewards?\nJohn Greene: We've been successfully marketing cash award against travel rewards, and every other type of card out there for decades. So I wouldn't get too caught up in sort of the shift away from frequent flyer miles in 2020. I think it points to sort of the stability and structure of our program that we didn't have to make a series of changes. We focus on continuously enhancing it. A lot of people don't focus as much as we do on redemption. So, the ability to redeem at point-of-sale at, Amazon through our partner PayPal. So we are confident that we can compete with the travel rewards programs. A lot of the miles cards really target the super prime transactors, which isn't ours, it's much more a lend-focused model. We've got a very good miles card ourselves that we market. But again, I feel really good that our rewards can compete against anyone out there.\nManu Srivareerat: Okay. Thank you for that. And just as a follow-up, how should we think about the rewards rate, as you think about growing loan balances, for example? Is there anything to that?\nRoger Hochschild: Yeah. So I'll cover this one. So the rewards rate over time has been relatively stable. It's increased somewhere between 1 and 3 bps annually. We expect that the 5% programs and the reward structure will continue that trend, while helping us to sustain a strong level of customer loyalty. So we look at that increase, as a natural evolution of a good investment in our customer relationships.\nManu Srivareerat: Okay. Thank you very much. Thanks for the color. Have a good day, guys.\nRoger Hochschild: Thank you.\nJohn Greene: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Rick Shane with JPMorgan.\nRick Shane: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Mark really covered what I wanted to talk about in terms of reserves. But I'd just like to follow-up on that slightly. The observation was made that your reserve rate is about two points higher than it would have been on day one. Day one was essentially an ideal economic environment, low unemployment, steady growth, et cetera. Should we look at day one as a destination for where the reserve rate will go or more as a channel marker in terms of sort of an ideal operating environment?\nRoger Hochschild: Yeah. Good question. So the short answer is that it depends on the economic outlook and the portfolio performance. I would say, to give a kind of view on the marker, when we look at the reserve rate back in, call it, January 1, we're at just over 6%, we're at just over 8% now. That difference is about $1.7 billion of reserves on the current loan book.  So if we have a level of confidence in the economic environment, portfolio continues to be positive. And the work we've done on analytics drive, I'll say, positive credit performance. There is an expectation in a benign environment that we should march back that way. So I think it's premature to say we'll get there. There is a lot of factors that could change. But I look at that day one as a marker for a solid credit environment and a relatively strong performing credit book.\nRick Shane: Great. Okay. That's very helpful. Thank you, guys.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Bill Carcache with Wolfe Research.\nBill Carcache: Thanks. Good morning, Roger and John.\nRoger Hochschild: Good morning.\nJohn Greene: Hey. Good morning, Bill.\nBill Carcache: Can you guys help square the continued strength in customer acquisition that you expect on one hand with payment rates remaining low for an extended period on the other? You mentioned, I think, John, the end of the pandemic-related federal forbearance programs is somewhere is a catalyst for payment rate normalization. But why do you think payment rates will remain elevated after that support has ended?\nJohn. Greene: Yeah. I'll start it and then maybe Roger will add a couple of points on the back end. So certainly, if you look at, frankly, the projected GDP, that's above normal levels for a strong US economy, and that's as a result of, frankly, all of the activity and the transfer payments I talked about earlier. I think there is a natural, I'll say, transition from where we are today to something that approaches historical norms. The savings rate is still high, but it's falling. And so that's positive. And in terms of overall sales activity versus payment rates, we do expect the sales levels at some point to moderate, partly because of year-over-year comps and partly because of what's happening on economic activity. But with that said, I would expect that payment rate, there's a bit of an inverse relationship. And what we're seeing from a growth standpoint is the sales activity, the new account acquisition, the payment rate is a bit of a headwind, and then, that revolve transactor rate aligning to payment rate. But despite all that, we've been able to grow, from first quarter to second quarter. So, as that payment rate moderates a bit, sales activity, I think, will be a lag to that. And we'll be well-positioned to grow in the fourth quarter and beyond.\nBill Carcache: Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. And if I may follow up on that. As we look out to next year, would you expect that process of - that you've described in the sort of this payment rate and revolve rate normalization? Should that provide an incremental tailwind to loan growth, such that we could actually see your loan growth start to outpace your spending growth?\nJohn Greene: 2022 is still about six months away, five to six months away. So we're working on it right now. I'll tell you this, I'm positive in terms of how the business is positioned. And what we can expect from a topline standpoint, as well as credit and expense. So those factors, I feel very good about, but to get into a level of specificity at this point, it's probably a bit early.\nOperator: Your next question is from Meng Jiao with Deutsche Bank.\nMeng Jiao: Hi, guys. Good morning. And thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to - students loans. As we head into the third quarter, it's probably the first time over a year that probably many college students are on campus. I guess are you doing anything differently in terms of how you're approaching the start of this particular school year? And sort of is it fair to say that marketing to students is going to be a large piece of that accelerating marketing spend that you guys have commented on?\nRoger Hochschild: The third quarter is peak season for student loans, but all the marketing is done before they get to campus. Volume was suppressed last year, because for many of our customers, we encourage them to take federal student loans. And then, use our private student loans to top off. And if their expenses were lower, because they're paying tuition, but not paying housing and food, et cetera, that had an impact on our volume. On the other hand, we did benefit last year from a major competitor pulling out of the marketplace. So I would say we're optimistic with kids going back on campus, but this will be a strong year for originations. And that we will continue to gain market share in the student loan product.\nMeng Jiao: Got you, great. And then secondly, I think you mentioned growing confidence in consumer home  Quarter-to-date, have you seen, I guess, a continued acceleration in that spending? I know we're roughly 22 days into the third quarter. And then secondly, Roger, I think you  are unsustainably high. I'm just curious if you had any further color as to when you expect that to sort of normalize? Thank you.\nJohn Greene: I'll start with that one. I think it will take a while to normalize. There is a good amount of pent-up demand, but also pent-up liquidity in the form of the savings that have built-up, as well as just the open to buy that people have on their cards from sort of month-after-month of pretty high payment rate. So I think that will provide some support. On the other hand, a huge amount of uncertainty in terms of what will happen with the Delta variant and other factors that can drive the economy. So we feel like, we're well positioned, but unclear what the back half of the year will bring. In terms of what we're seeing so far this month, I would say travel continues to be constructive, but overall, not necessarily accelerating, but spend levels staying very strong.\nOperator: Your next question is from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse.\nMoshe Orenbuch: Great. Thanks. I guess getting back to the BNPL. Is your primary kind of revenue or growth kind of opportunity in the Sezzle on the lending side, is that the way we should think about it?\nRoger Hochschild: No. You should think about it on the Payment segment. So transaction processing revenue and sort of - with payment processing and sort of connectivity to the merchant side. And so that's sort of our first entry into buy now, pay later has been more on the Payment services segment, as opposed to our direct banking side.\nMoshe Orenbuch: Got you. One of the things that you've talked about in the past about buy now, pay later is the question of whether it kind of encourages or discourages younger consumers from taking out a credit card. And I think you had said, either on the last call or one of the presentations, that because of lending brand of Discover that you haven't kind of seen that impact. Could you just talk a little bit about how you think about the value, I guess, of the student lending in terms of kind of - and in terms of that marketing of the Discover brand?\nRoger Hochschild: Sure. We are very successful in the student card business. I think the student loans help, but also it has to do with the product, the value proposition and some very good marketing. And we see actually great credit performance from students, because contrary to popular belief, a lot of them are very responsible in how they handle their cards. With student loans, I'd start by saying, we think it's a great business, it's profitable. I would say it is operationally complex, but it also gets our brand out there with parents, as well as students when they're making a series of financial decisions. So you know, there are not that many banks that are in it at scale, not that many too that have sort of the product set that we have to be able to leverage those relationships. So it's a key part of our banking strategy.\nMoshe Orenbuch: Got it. And just a quick follow-up on the reserving point. I guess, I was sort of wondering if your reserves on day one included an expectation of a potential of a recession somewhere in the life of those receivables. Just as you think about it as we kind of enter 2022, would that be a lower probability just given the experience that we've had or is that - think about it?\nJohn Greene: Yeah. So when we did day one, we looked at through the cycle of use. So what essentially that means is, we didn't look at the trough of delinquencies and charge-offs, nor did we look at peak. So to extremely oversimplify it, a bit of averaging with the help of a bunch of data scientists. So that day one is a, call it, a normalized view of the credit environment.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Mihir Bhatia with Bank of America.\nMihir Bhatia: Hi. Thank you for taking my questions and good morning.\nRoger Hochschild: Good morning.\nMihir Bhatia: I wanted to ask - yeah, I wanted to go back to your comment on competitive intensity, and it certainly does feel like cash back cards has increased. I think you alluded to intensity being a little higher than maybe the average historically. So maybe just talk a little bit more about the dimensions of this competition? Is it spilling over beyond just higher direct rewards like the 1.5% or 2% rewards  are you seeing any irrational signing bonuses and productory offers, spend $5,000 in three months, get $100, or anything irrational? Are you seeing anything on the balance transfer side? How is Discover responding to this increased competition? And is there - is the increase in marketing spends in part because of this elevated competition?\nRoger Hochschild: Yeah. So I'll start with the back half. The increase in marketing spend is driven really by the opportunity we see. So it is not by the competition. I do expect the cost per account to be modestly higher than, say, 2019 levels. 2020 was extraordinarily good. But part of that has to do with just booking more new accounts. And the marginal ones tend to be more expensive. I do think some of the rewards products out there will not be sustainable long-term. You've seen 2% cash back offers come and go for a very long time, especially when we eventually get to a higher rate environment. So far, balance transfer demand is still a bit suppressed. So we're not seeing the overly long 24 month 0% offers. You are starting to see some of those high spend 4,000 and get 400 type offers from some of the issuers that I think are most aggressive around growth. But again, nothing that I would say we haven't seen before. It tends to be different people at different times. But this is part of the card business and what we're used to competing against.\nMihir Bhatia: Great. Thank you. And then, just - I just wanted to ask about your debit product. Any update on that? Has that - where are we, has that being rolled out, is there thoughts to expand the marketing or push behind it? Just any update on the debit product. Thank you.\nRoger Hochschild: Yeah. So given the excess deposits we had, we really pulled back on the vast majority of our deposit marketing, including that product. But we're very excited about the differentiation having cash back. So we think we're well positioned against the challenger banks, as well as traditional banks. And so we'll continue to ramp it up, probably more so towards the back half of the year and as we get into 2022.\nMihir Bhatia: Okay. Thank you.\nEric Wasserstrom: Stephanie, I think we have time for one last question.\nOperator: Your last question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.\nBetsy Graseck: Hi. Thanks. So I just had two. One is on the marketing. I just wanted to make sure I understood what you meant by marketing expense anticipated return to 2019 levels. Are you saying that, the back half of '21 will be at a run rate similar to full year 2019? Or the back half of '21 is going to be similar to the quarterly run rate of 2019?\nRoger Hochschild: Yeah. So I think total year '21 to be similar to total year of '19.\nBetsy Graseck: Okay.\nRoger Hochschild: That would require you know,  in the back half.\nBetsy Graseck: Got it. Okay. And then, just separately on credit. I know a huge debate in the group here is around payment rates and how we're anticipating them to traject  over the course of the next year or so. One other question specifically for you is that, if I recall correctly, you've got a homeowner SKU to your box and home prices have clearly accelerated significantly, 15%, 20%, depending on the location. So I know you look at your customers routinely and check how they're doing financially. Are you seeing any signs of your customer base having refi and materially dropped their monthly mortgage payment requirements, which would potentially keep your payment rates elevated for longer or how you think about this refi cycle and what it means for your customers and their financial health and how that translates to payment rate for you? Thanks. \nRoger Hochschild: Yeah. We have - and this cuts across past cycles, we haven't seen a link between sort of a refi boom and card payment rates. And so I don't have any expectation that would happen this time.\nBetsy Graseck: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: I would now like to turn it back over to Eric Wasserstrom for closing remarks.\nEric Wasserstrom: Well, thank you very much for joining us. If you have any additional questions, the IR team is available all day and, of course, whenever. So thanks again. And have a great day.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thanks, Eric. And thanks to our listeners for joining today's call. We had a very good quarter that highlighted the strength of our digital business model and solid execution on our strategic priorities against the backdrop of continued economic improvement. This quarter was characterized by three important events. First, our card receivables grew sequentially in May and June, causing our period end receivables to be up quarter-over-quarter. This outcome, combined with the strength in consumer spending and our account acquisition, increased our confidence for moderate receivables growth this year and stronger growth in 2022. Second, we benefited from a gain in our Payment Services segment. This gain is an outgrowth of a long commercial relationship and underscores our payments ability to forge innovative and lasting partnerships. Lastly, we achieved a historic low in delinquencies, which resulted from consumer's strong liquidity position, our conservative stance on underwriting, and the proactive measures we took into the downturn to protect our credit quality. This outcome also supported our reserve release this quarter. Turning to the quarter's results. We earned $1.7 billion after tax or $5.55 per share. These results include a $729 million one-time gain. But even excluding this gain, our results were very strong at $3.73 per share. The drivers of the quarter's strong results reflect the combination of our solid execution and supportive macro conditions. Good Morning. And in terms of the mix by FICO band, it's pretty broad. Certainly, the higher FICO SKU transactor. So you'll have a higher payment rate in some of the mid-FICOs you've seen revolvers turn transactor. But again, to John's point, we do expect it gradually to normalize. Yeah. Thanks, Sanjay. You know, as we've discussed in the past, the card business is always competitive. There was a nice little lull last year, that we were able to take advantage of and pick-up even more market share. But I think this is returning to more normal, maybe a little heightened, but more normal level of competition. You're seeing new products out there, increased marketing spend. But as I look at our value proposition, cost per accounts we're achieving and the returns, I feel very, very good about the marketing spend we're putting out there and what we're generating for it. Sure. So in terms of our buy now, pay later strategy, there are really two parts. The Sezzle investment is really being driven by the payment side. And that's similar to the investment we made in Marqeta a while back. Our set of network assets are very useful for many fin-techs, in terms of just an easier way to process payments and connect to merchants in a wide variety of forms. So I'd say that's the core of what we're doing with Sezzle. We also believe that potentially, overtime, there may be opportunities on the banking side. So in terms of our providing lending, not necessarily with Sezzle, but in the buy now, pay later space more broadly. And again, leveraging what we can do with unsecured lending and our direct merchant relationships. But I'd say, we haven't announced anything on the lending side of buy now, pay later at this time. Good morning, Ryan. Yeah. And in terms of buy now, pay later, there are many sort of different things we could do. Clearly, going direct with the merchant relationships we have is one option we could work with  overtime. But, we don't have anything specific to share at this time. Yeah. It is a major source of investment for us. And I would say that the scarcest asset there is talent, as opposed to technology dollars. And then part of it is just making sure you're investing to monetize the granularity you can pick up with enhanced data and analytics. So looking at the entire martech stack, your personalization abilities, what you can deliver through different channels. So it's a big focus. I think we're probably the only major bank where the Head of Data and Analytics is a direct report to the CEO. And so I think that reflects the importance we see on that. And I feel very good about our level of investment. Sure. So, all of these investments start with a commercial relationship. We are not venture capitalists, we have no desire to get into that business. But where we have a commercial relationship with a company where we think there's a lot of potential. And there is a way to invest and perhaps extract additional terms, maybe an exclusive arrangement or other commitment, those of the types of opportunities we pursue and they are largely on the payment side and we may even given some of the opportunities we're seeing, accelerate that, although, again, it's going to be relatively modest. In terms of acquisitions, given the valuations, I'm not sure I necessarily see doing acquisitions and this approach around partnership and investment seems to work well. But we will look at it. John and our payments team have a very strong business development effort, and we'll consider acquisitions where it's a capability that will help us monetize our payments assets. Yeah. I mean, I think compound growth is a very challenging measure because it smooths an unbelievable cycle and I don't think any of us would have expected in 2019. So the year-over-year spend growth numbers are unsustainably high for the economy as a whole. The economy is growing above, I think, what economists would say its real level should be. And so you're seeing that pent-up demand from consumers. We expect it to normalize at a strong level, and we look to continue gaining market share given how we're positioned. But I don't think anyone is expecting retail sales to stay up 30% forever. Good morning. Yeah. So I'll cover this one. So the rewards rate over time has been relatively stable. It's increased somewhere between 1 and 3 bps annually. We expect that the 5% programs and the reward structure will continue that trend, while helping us to sustain a strong level of customer loyalty. So we look at that increase, as a natural evolution of a good investment in our customer relationships. Thank you. Yeah. Good question. So the short answer is that it depends on the economic outlook and the portfolio performance. I would say, to give a kind of view on the marker, when we look at the reserve rate back in, call it, January 1, we're at just over 6%, we're at just over 8% now. That difference is about $1.7 billion of reserves on the current loan book.  So if we have a level of confidence in the economic environment, portfolio continues to be positive. And the work we've done on analytics drive, I'll say, positive credit performance. There is an expectation in a benign environment that we should march back that way. So I think it's premature to say we'll get there. There is a lot of factors that could change. But I look at that day one as a marker for a solid credit environment and a relatively strong performing credit book. Good morning. The third quarter is peak season for student loans, but all the marketing is done before they get to campus. Volume was suppressed last year, because for many of our customers, we encourage them to take federal student loans. And then, use our private student loans to top off. And if their expenses were lower, because they're paying tuition, but not paying housing and food, et cetera, that had an impact on our volume. On the other hand, we did benefit last year from a major competitor pulling out of the marketplace.

No. You should think about it on the Payment segment. So transaction processing revenue and sort of - with payment processing and sort of connectivity to the merchant side.

That would require you know,  in the back half. Yeah. We have - and this cuts across past cycles, we haven't seen a link between sort of a refi boom and card payment rates. And so I don't have any expectation that would happen this time."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "John Greene",
            "content": "Thank you, Roger. And good morning, everyone. I'll begin with our summary financial results on slide four. As Roger noted, our results this quarter highlighted the strength of our digital model, solid execution on our priorities and continued improvement in the macroeconomic environment. Revenue, net of interest expense, increased 34% from the prior year. Excluding one-time items, revenue was up 9%. Net interest income was up 5% as we continue to benefit from lower funding costs and reduced interest charge-offs, reflecting strong credit performance. This was partially offset by a 4% decline in average receivables from the prior year levels. Excluding one-time items, non-interest income increased 29%, driven by the higher - by higher net debt count and interchange revenue due to strong sales volume. The provision for credit losses decreased $2 billion from the prior year, mainly due to a $321 million reserve release in the current quarter compared to a $1.3 billion reserve build in the prior year, an improvement in the economic and ongoing credit strength were the primary drivers of the release. Net charge-offs decreased 41% or $311 million from the prior year. Okay, great. Yeah. I'll take the call. I'll take the question, John. Thanks for that. So, payment rates are, frankly, at a record high. So if you looked at our trust data, you can see that in June they came in at about 29%, and that's - frankly, that's an all time high, at least as far as back as 2005. So what we're seeing when we look at the portfolio, now the portfolio, the trends are similar, but the overall payment rates a bit lower. What we're seeing is a couple of factors. So, one is a deceleration of the growth in payment rate. And second, we formed our expectation on the second half of the year based on all of the government programs that are out there and most - the most significant ones are expiring or have expired by the end of the third quarter. So we expect that, coupled with the strong economic activity and lower savings rate that we're observing, to result in a moderate decrease in the payment rate certainly in the fourth quarter. In the third quarter, it could be flat to maybe even up a mild bit. But overall, our sense is that we've approached the peak of this and it's going to begin to tail out - tail off. Yeah. So I'll touch upon it. So, you know, the net interest income will follow loan growth. But as you know, in the fourth quarter, the build on loan balance is skewed towards the last two months of the quarter. So net interest margin is what I'll say the trajectory is changing in a positive direction, given the sequential loan growth we saw from first quarter to second quarter. But again, it's going to be in the single digits, lower single digits, is general expectation. Good morning. Okay. All right, Ryan. Thanks. So the Marqeta gain was something that when we looked at the plan for the year, we didn't, frankly, envision that, that opportunity would turn out quite the way it did. So, certainly a nice outcome. You know, the spend that we're seeing isn't - is dictated based on that size of the Marqeta gain, but more about the broad economic opportunity that we're seeing right now to be able to drive positive growth. So frankly, we'll be spending at this level with or without the Marqueta gain. The kind of the lock-up, those points are disclosed in the S-1, so you can reference that and get real specificity on it. And then finally, in terms of the expenses and are they one-time in nature. So within the presentation itself, we highlighted kind of three items that were significant. So one was the bonus accrual unrelated to Marqeta again and more broadly a reflection of what's happening in the business and the outcomes we're seeing here in terms of generating positive returns. The other item there was the Diners intangible, which we took the opportunity based on what we see as a change in the cash flows in Diners to fully impair that and took a $92 million write-off. And then the third item was a $30 million software write-off. So all those are part of our normal, I'll say, hygiene factors. So the last two items were you know, what I would consider relatively one-off, and I wouldn't include those in the kind of operating cash flows going forward. But as you're trying to get a sense for overall spend in 2021, we talked about accelerating marketing expense. So the way I would think about marketing specifically is that we anticipate it to return to 2019 levels, which would indicate a material acceleration in the second half of the year, which, again, is tied to the fact that we're seeing good origination opportunities to drive growth and long-term profitability. All right. So I'll hit the capital point real quick. And then we'll flip it over to Roger to handle it back, second part of that question, the second part of that second question, I should say. So the capital plan was based on a couple of different factors. So one, we want to be prudent in our distributions of capital and make sure that we - organic - that we allocate our capital to organic growth opportunities and then buybacks and dividends and then acquisitions as they appear, so that hasn't changed whatsoever.  The planning in terms of capital overall is that we are committed to add 10.5%. As we look at the impacts of the CECL capital relief transition, that's about 200 basis points. And then in the first quarter of next year towards the end of this year, as we review the outlook for 2022 with our Board, we'll make recommendations with a couple of points in mind. The overall economic opportunity, the SEB and where we are with that, and there's plenty of room there. And then, finally, approaching the 10.5. Yeah. Mark, thanks for the question. So when we approach this quarter, certainly, the economic data was improving. The portfolio is performing extremely well. And the charge-off trajectory, you know, we revised our guidance and now believe it will be below the prior year. So all of those are very, very positive from a reserving standpoint. We did put a bit of caution in the kind of reserve numbers, as a result of the various government programs that are out there. So if you think about the eviction moratoriums, foreclosure moratoriums, various payment deferral programs and then the massive amount of government transfer payments that hit the economy, we felt like that those contributed to driving delinquencies and charge-offs below historical norms for our customer base. So under CECL, we reserve for life of loan. And accordingly, we were waiting for those programs to run their course and the cash flows to kind of feed through the economy and impact our customers. And then be able to make, you know, call it, a deeper change to the reserve levels. So as I said earlier, most of those programs ran their course in the third quarter. We obviously have the child care tax, there's a child tax credit. We don't expect that to be an impact. So in the fourth quarter, we should begin to see more data that would allow us to take a different look at reserves and then into 2022, certainly. Our expectation is that the credit environment is very positive from a growth standpoint and accordingly, we'll make reserves that kind of align with that. So, we have some investments, yes. We try to get in early and build out the commercial relationship, as Roger alluded to. And we're hopeful that the combination of working with quality companies and developing deeper commercial relationships will help those folks to be profitable and help us drive business in our payments area, while giving us an option value for that investment. So, one would hope that there's more. But at this point, it would be way premature to speculate. Good morning. We've been successfully marketing cash award against travel rewards, and every other type of card out there for decades. So I wouldn't get too caught up in sort of the shift away from frequent flyer miles in 2020. I think it points to sort of the stability and structure of our program that we didn't have to make a series of changes. We focus on continuously enhancing it. A lot of people don't focus as much as we do on redemption. So, the ability to redeem at point-of-sale at, Amazon through our partner PayPal. So we are confident that we can compete with the travel rewards programs. A lot of the miles cards really target the super prime transactors, which isn't ours, it's much more a lend-focused model. We've got a very good miles card ourselves that we market. But again, I feel really good that our rewards can compete against anyone out there. Thank you. Hey. Good morning, Bill. 2022 is still about six months away, five to six months away. So we're working on it right now. I'll tell you this, I'm positive in terms of how the business is positioned. And what we can expect from a topline standpoint, as well as credit and expense. So those factors, I feel very good about, but to get into a level of specificity at this point, it's probably a bit early. I'll start with that one. I think it will take a while to normalize. There is a good amount of pent-up demand, but also pent-up liquidity in the form of the savings that have built-up, as well as just the open to buy that people have on their cards from sort of month-after-month of pretty high payment rate. So I think that will provide some support. On the other hand, a huge amount of uncertainty in terms of what will happen with the Delta variant and other factors that can drive the economy. So we feel like, we're well positioned, but unclear what the back half of the year will bring. In terms of what we're seeing so far this month, I would say travel continues to be constructive, but overall, not necessarily accelerating, but spend levels staying very strong. Yeah. So when we did day one, we looked at through the cycle of use. So what essentially that means is, we didn't look at the trough of delinquencies and charge-offs, nor did we look at peak. So to extremely oversimplify it, a bit of averaging with the help of a bunch of data scientists. So that day one is a, call it, a normalized view of the credit environment."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the First Quarter 2021 Discover Financial Services Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. \nEric Wasserstrom: Thank you, Maria and good morning everyone. Welcome to this morning's call. I'll begin on slide two of our earnings presentation which you can find in the financial section of our Investor Relations website investorrelations.discover.com. Our discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. Please refer to our notices regarding forward-looking statements that appear in today's earnings press release and presentation. Our call will include remarks from our CEO, Roger Hochschild; and John Greene our Chief Financial Officer. After we conclude our formal comments, there will be time for a question-and-answer session.  Now, it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Roger. \nRoger Hochschild: Thanks Eric and thanks to our listeners for joining today's call. Last April, if you told me to the year into the pandemic we'd be reporting excellent credit performance, positive sales trends, and solid earnings growth, I wouldn't have believed it. While the pandemic is far from over and there may be twists and turns ahead, as a nation, we have made tremendous progress toward addressing the health crisis and reopening the economy. This quarter we earned $1.6 billion after-tax or $5.04 per share. I'm very pleased with these results, which reflect our robust business model; strong execution including a disciplined approach to managing credit; improving economic trends; and the impact of federal support for US consumers. Since the end of 2020, our view on economic conditions has improved. The rapid pace of the recovery has lessened our concern of job losses spreading to the white collar workforce and there has also been substantial support for the US consumer through stimulus in January and in March. Our current expectation is that credit losses in 2021 will be flat to down year-over-year. This improved economic view combined with lower loan balances and continued strong credit performance were the primary drivers of $879 million reserve release in the quarter. As discussed in previous quarters, the strong credit performance was accompanied by elevated payment rates that continue to put pressure on loan balances, which were down 7% year-over-year. Payment rates were over 350 basis points higher than last year and at their highest level since the year 2000.\nJohn Greene: Thank you, Roger. Happy Birthday, Wanji. And good morning everyone. I'll begin by addressing our summary financial results on slide 4. As Roger indicated, the results this period reflects many of the same dynamics we've seen over the past few quarters. The influence of stimulus resulted in elevated payment rates, which pressured loan growth. It also contributed to the strong asset quality and our significant reserve release in the quarter. Revenue net of interest expense decreased 3% from the prior year mainly from lower net interest income. This was driven by a 7% decline in average receivables and lower market rates partially offset by a reduction in funding costs as we continued to manage deposit pricing and optimized our funding mix. Non-interest income was 5% lower, primarily due to a $35 million net gain from the sale of an equity investment in the prior year. Consistent with our excellent credit quality, lower loan fee income reflects a decline in late fees, while net discount and interchange revenue was up 12% from the prior year reflecting the increased sales volume. The provision for credit losses was $2 billion lower than the prior year, mainly, due to an $879 million reserve release in the current quarter compared to a $1.1 billion reserve build in the prior year. Our improved economic outlook, lower loan balances and strong credit drove the release. Additionally, net charge-offs decreased 30% or $232 million in the prior year. Operating expenses decreased 7% year-over-year as we remain disciplined on expense management. Other than compensation, all other expenses were down from the prior year led by marketing, which decreased 33% year-over-year. Looking ahead, we intend to accelerate marketing investments over the remainder of the year. We'll go into details on our spending outlook in a few moments. Moving to loan growth on slide 5. Total loans were down 7% from the prior year driven by a 9% decrease in card receivables. The reduction in card receivables was driven by two primary factors; first, the payment rate remained elevated driven by the latest round of stimulus and improved household cash flows; second, promotional balances have continued digit decline reflecting the actions we took at the onset of the pandemic to tighten credit.\nOperator: Thank you.  We'll take our first question from Sanjay Sakhrani of KBW.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Thanks. Good morning. I have a question on loan growth and marketing. Roger you talked about moving standards to pre-pandemic levels. Maybe you could just talk about the opportunities for growth relative to 2019 and how we should think about the marketing budget in relation to that? And then maybe you could just also tie in your confidence level on the loan growth given the stimulus? I mean, it seems like you guys have kept it flat in terms of loan growth expectations. So maybe just elaborate on that. Thanks.\nRoger Hochschild: Sure. Thanks for the question Sanjay. Maybe starting then with the stimulus. Clearly, one of the biggest differences versus 2019 is the payment rate. And that's partly driven by the cash payments to consumers the savings rate, but also the relief they get be it on their federal student loans or other payments they have to make. And so that's a real headwind against loan growth. And as I mentioned on the call, it's actually at the highest level since the year 2000. In terms of marketing, we feel very good about the cost per accounts about the projected returns we'll get on those have widened our credit box back to the pre-pandemic. Although as you recall we have been tightening for a couple of years and I would say continue to remain conservative in our overall credit approach. So, I really think it's a headwind from payment rates that has kept us from being even more enthusiastic about loan growth.\nSanjay Sakhrani: And when we think about the marketing amount in relative to 2019, is there any context you could provide for that? Sorry for the follow-up. \nRoger Hochschild: Yes. I think part of it and John indicated this, I think, we're probably more comfortable giving you some view around where we expect total expenses to be. But also it will depend on what we see in the back half of the year. And so to the extent we see opportunities to deploy more capital against organic growth, we've been clear that's our top priority. And so that's why we'll -- we're continuously revisiting where and how much we should allocate to market.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Nash of Goldman Sachs. \nRyan Nash: Hey, good morning guys.\nRoger Hochschild: Good morning.\nRyan Nash: So, Roger, John, on capital post this quarter's performance, you're at 15% CET1. You talked about reevaluating in the second half of the year. I guess given the outlook for credit potential for further reserve releases, I think it's fair to say you guys are going to be building in capital in the near term. So how should we think about the time frame of getting back to that 10.5% CET1 level? And how does that -- how does CECL day one factor into that? And I guess Roger as a follow-up to that just given all the capital sitting around does it at all change the way you think about acquisitions? And if so what would be the priority? Thanks.\nJohn Greene: Okay. Hey, Ryan, thanks for the question. I'll start it and then I'll turn it over to Roger for the second piece of the question. So, really, really strong performance. And the economy has strengthened beyond our expectations as we said in our prepared remarks. So we came into the year somewhat optimistic, but also cautious given the amount of uncertainty. What we're seeing is kind of a broad-based improvement in the economy, our credit fundamentals have been extremely strong. As a result, we made a decision to -- an appropriate decision to release about $900 million of reserve taking the \u2013 obviously, the CET1 ratio well above our internal target of 10.5%. We're looking to come back to that 10.5% point. We're not going to do it overnight. We know the CECL transition is somewhere between 200 basis points and 250 basis points on CET1, but that still leaves ample room for actions in terms of dividends, buybacks and targeted M&A, when and if appropriate. So specifics around timing getting back to 10.5%, I would broadly say medium term, but we're certainly committed to that target. And we'll do a number of efforts, including revisiting our buyback levels in the second half of this year to get there. And the follow-up might be, what do we expect the buyback levels to be incrementalized to? We're not going to give specifics, but I will give a little bit of history. If you go back to 2017 and 2018, our level of buybacks was about $2 billion. I'm not saying history is going to repeat, it will be subject to a bunch of conversations with our team internally and then obviously Board approval, but we'll continue to evaluate. So, Roger you want to?\nRoger Hochschild: Yeah. And on the M&A front, we try and be disciplined. And so I would say, would not let extra money burn a hole in our pocket. For those of us \u2013 for those of you who've been with us for longer, you'll recall we had significant excess capital post the financial crisis. We're limited by the payout ratios in the CCAR process. But as said, we will return it over time and stay disciplined. So as we think about M&A opportunities on the banking side, not much out there that fits with our digital model. You're seeing acquisitions that are branch mergers cost takeout which doesn't fit. And then on the payment side, while valuations have come in, they're still really high. And so we lean a bit more towards partnerships, potentially smaller minority investments. So again, I think you can expect no change to our disciplined approach around returning capital to our shareholders. \nRyan Nash: Got it. And if I could squeeze in one other? So, on the slightly higher expenses, John, can you maybe just help us. What is the base for that? Is it GAAP or adjusted? And then second, Roger, there's numerous mentions of accelerating investments in data analytics and account growth. Can you maybe just give us a sense for what you would need to see for those \u2013 for you to bring those investments on in terms whether it's in the macro account acquisition? Or what would you expect to drive that? Thanks.\nRoger Hochschild: Great. Real quick. First part of your question, the expense growth relative to cap last year. And then on the investment side, a lot of those are on capabilities, especially in the data and analytics area that just enhance all parts of our operations, whether it's the credit underwriting, the marketing, targeting, personalization, collections et cetera. And so they are given the return profile, part of it is just bandwidth and talent, I would say are more gating factors, but we're really excited about the benefits. And then in terms of putting more dollars to work on the marketing side, it will vary. Competitive activity has a bit of an impact on that, but we will just look at it on the new account side, what we're seeing across different channels and carefully at those marginal opportunities and the returns they generate.\nRyan Nash: Thanks for all the color.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of John Pancari of Evercore ISI.\nJohn Pancari: Good morning.\nRoger Hochschild: Good morning.\nJohn Pancari: Given your commentary on expenses and your plan to invest selectively there on the marketing side, can you perhaps maybe help us think about the efficiency trend longer term? I know, you came in around 38.7% in terms of the ratio this quarter. But did you think about, what is a reasonable long-term expectation as we look out? Thanks.\nJohn Greene: Yes. Happy to cover that. So as we went through the pandemic, we really scrutinized the expense base, and there's been a long history of expense discipline in this company. And through the pandemic we found certain opportunities. So as we think about the balance of this year, next year, and going forward, we're going to continue to focus on controlling corporate costs, so that we can invest savings back into overall growth levers. And we've done that, and we're going to continue to do that. As we think about the efficiency ratio, we'll come in this year somewhere around where we finished last year, I think assuming revenue comes in with the modest growth we talked about in loans. And going forward, I would expect somewhere in the upper 30s would be a reasonable spot. That will indicate that we're driving efficiencies and still investing in the business. Any follow-up now?\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Bill Carcache of Wolfe Research.\nBill Carcache: Roger and John, there's a lot of debate taking place around what's going to happen with rates, whether we get more steepening at the long end and when we'll get lift off of the short end. Is Discover's ability to get to a mid-20% ROTC at all impacted by what happens with rates? Maybe another way to ask it is, can you talk about your confidence level in being able to get to a say mid-25% type ROTC even if the SERP remains in place?\nJohn Greene: Yes. Thanks, Bill. So, specific to rates, so if rates begin to increase, there's indications that a number of different things that are happening in the economy. So, you would expect inflation to be increasing a very, very low level of unemployment, probably near full employment for the economy and a robustness that might rival kind of the pre-pandemic levels on a sustained basis. And so, you have to believe that there are a lot of different things that are going to happen. And as I said, also, we'll take some actions to control inflation. Now, we've seen this over a number of years now that the Fed and overall interest rate environment has been on a sustained basis very, very low. As we look forward to 2021 and 2022, my expectation is rates will remain low, and we'll enjoy the benefits of an economy that's continuing to grow. Beyond that, it gets different -- more difficult to call. In terms of total return levels, it will depend on a number of factors. Rate is just one of those. Credit obviously would be an important item. But certainly, longer term, we think that we're in a position to drive high returns for our shareholders consistent with what we've done historically and our hope is when we come back to that 10.5% target that that will further enhance overall returns.\nBill Carcache: Got it. Thank you. As a follow-up, you've discussed the opportunity in the student lending space among customers who may not have been thinking about refinancing their student debt to lower rate when their loans went to forbearance but as loan start to exit forbearance, is there going to be an opportunity for you guys to see an acceleration there?\nRoger Hochschild: Yes. So, we don't really participate in the student loan refi market. The pricing doesn't really meet our return hurdles. To the extent, there is more activity it can marginally impact the payment rate for student loans. But we feel really good about where we're positioned. And I think last year was very challenging. There's a lot of kids either deferred for a year or had reduced expenses, because they didn't have meals or housing, et cetera. So again, yes, we feel good about what this peak season should bring and our ability to continue gaining share.\nBill Carcache: Thank you for taking my questions.\nRoger Hochschild: Thanks, Bill.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley.\nBetsy Graseck: Hi. Good morning.\nRoger Hochschild: Good morning.\nJohn Greene: Good morning.\nBetsy Graseck: A couple of questions. One you were talking earlier about widening standards in particular in card. And I just wanted to get a sense as to what you're expecting that will drive? Is that both an increase in accounts as well as higher lines extended to your existing accounts? And then, could you give us some color on how you expect to pull in the new clients given the fact that the consumer is in a fantastic spot? Are you pulling from other folks? Or do you feel like this is generating new demand from maybe a younger cohort that's not been borrowing yet? Some color on that would be helpful. \nRoger Hochschild: Sure. So in terms of the credit expansion, it's probably more heavily impacting new accounts, but also encompasses sort of our line increase and other criteria on the portfolio side as well. In terms of where I expect, I would say in all times, we give cards to consumers who are in good shape. But we do have particularly strong appeal to millennials and students. Our secured card is performing well in the marketplace. But then also the traditional prime revolver segment that Discover has always targeted. It's a very competitive business. It always has been. So, it's about differentiation. And there a superior customer experience a great rewards program focus on value those traditional things are what allow us to continue gaining share and booking new accounts. \nBetsy Graseck: It's interesting because your value prop very clear especially versus other card lenders with no fee etcetera. How do you think you're positioned against the Fintechs who also have a light or low or no fee proposition? \nRoger Hochschild: So there aren't that many of the Fintechs that are active yet in the card space. By and large they do loans of different types. And so, we've yet to see a significant, I would say Fintech player in the card space. And most of our competition tends to be the traditional leaders in the marketplace. \nBetsy Graseck: Okay. And if I could squeeze one in for John. You mentioned in answer to the prior question or two ago around the total expense outlook that you're thinking about for the full year 2021. And I think you mentioned that you're expecting 2021 to come in similar to the end of '20? And then from there as we look to '22 and beyond migrate back towards like the high 30s? Could you just give us some color as to the end of '20 expense ratio that you're thinking about? Because there's a couple of different ways you could slice based on one-timers. Is that a run rate that's north of 40% on the efficiency side? Maybe you could help us understand your sizing there? \nJohn Greene: Yes. So we used a GAAP basis on that. And so, the one-timers that were included in an underlying number that actually we didn't publish, but we called out the underlying numbers. It was about $200 million. So the operating efficiency is going to be dependent upon what we see in terms of loan growth payment rate and new account generation which as Roger said, and I'll echo the comments, we're very positive about how we're positioned to drive growth in the -- especially in the second half of the year as the payment rate abates a bit. So what you can expect here and I'm trying to provide as much detail as I can, is that outside of the marketing investments we talked about, some select investments in data and analytics, we're looking to keep all other costs flat. And we're going to manage that envelope as we see opportunities. But we'll be able to use that as a jumping off point to drive further improvements and efficiencies in '22 and beyond. \nBetsy Graseck: Okay. And so the $200 million is what we should x out to get to operating that's on the expense side? \nJohn Greene: Yes. Subject to growth and what we see as opportunities. So there's no absolutes. But \u2013 and as time goes on we'll have more clarity on the opportunity. \nBetsy Graseck: And then if I look pre-pandemic right... \nRoger Hochschild: So Betsy we do have some other questions to get to. \nBetsy Graseck: All right. \nRoger Hochschild: So we'll follow up later. Thanks. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mark DeVries of Barclays. \nMark DeVries: All right. I was hoping you could give us some color on where we should expect the reserve ratio to migrate to? Is it appropriate to think about it going back to kind of the CECL Day one level? And if so, at what pace could we get there? \nJohn Greene: Yes. Thank you. So, we took a meaningful chunk out of the reserve levels, this quarter. Honestly, the credit outlook and our models indicated that there was a range of different outcomes we could have made on that. And what we tried to do was, take a chunk out of the reserves that made sense given, the level of absolute uncertainty in the economy. As we look forward, the absolute reserve level or reserve rate will depend on what we see in the macros, how the portfolio is performing, and what we do in terms of account growth loan balance. But overall, as we think about where the provision levels could be, I would use the Day one CECL rate as a decent proxy. And subject to, how the portfolio is performing it could migrate up or down from there. What we did last year in the first quarter and the second quarter was react to an incredibly, dynamic and changing macro environment. And we prudently put up an incremental $2 billion. So, if the portfolio performs over time we could get back to that CECL Day one and perhaps, a little bit lower with excellent portfolio management. Now timing I'm not going to be specific on.\nMark DeVries: Okay. That's helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Don Fandetti of Well Fargo.\nJohn Greene: Good morning.\nDon Fandetti: Hi. Good morning. Roger, as we went through the pandemic, obviously there's more e-commerce spend. And is there anything that you've learned in terms of like, how you would position the company differently? It seems like big tech and technology are continuing to gain more touch points with customers. Is there anything strategically that you want to lean into or you've learned?\nRoger Hochschild: Great question, I think, it really accelerated a lot of trends that were existing prior to pandemic right? So consumers were already migrating more and more of their shopping online, but that moved even quicker. Their customer interactions were moving more towards digital that accelerated even further. So I think it had us recommitted to the path we were on and looking to accelerate some of the functionality. Certainly there were some specific things around the tap-and-go cards a lot of small dollar transactions migrating from cash to debit that benefited our PULSE volumes. But I would say in general, not so much new trends but, three, four, five year accelerations of trends that were already there and that we have been positioning the company to take advantage of.\nDon Fandetti: Got it. And on the potential investments or partnerships, would those be accretive? Or could they potentially be more technology investments?\nRoger Hochschild: Where we traditionally made them on the payment side is, with partners that either, add capabilities or to cement a relationship that will drive volume over our network. On the technology side, we found, plenty of great partner/vendors out there that you don't need -- people don't need money in the current environment. And so that's why we tend not to do investments in pure technology companies that aren't payments related.\nDon Fandetti: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Rick Shane of JPMorgan.\nRick Shane: As you look forward to loan growth, how much opportunity is there to category-specific rebound, that's more indexed to borrow like travel for example?\nRoger Hochschild: Great question, I think that will be constructive. Some of the categories that were strongest through the downturn though had a pretty good revolve rate. So you think about home improvement that was really doing well. So a lot of it I think will be in the restaurant and travel segment, but I wouldn't necessarily expect a huge boost to revolve rate just given again some of the categories that were strong in the downturn.\nRick Shane: Got it. Okay. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mihir Bhatia of Bank of America.\nMihir Bhatia: Good morning and thank you for taking my question. Just really quickly I wanted to ask about competitive intensity. First, are you seeing any impact on cost of acquisition as customers have come back? I know that had trended very well last year and that's an area you'd be making investments in. And then maybe I'll just ask my -- the related question I had on that. Last year Discover's no annual fee, no cash back card was just really well-suited for the backdrop. As we reopen and maybe travel rewards become more relevant for consumers, are you seeing any impact on your usage? Any early indicators from consumers who would maybe move your card to top of wallet last year and what you're seeing? So just I guess competitive intensity more broadly? Thank you.\nRoger Hochschild: Yeah. So I'll start with the second one. We are not seeing an impact. And we think the lesson learned in the pandemic of the utility of cash awards hopefully will last. And we feel very good about even the newer redemption offers we've added. So the ability to redeem at point-of-sale with PayPal with Amazon, we've just announced the ability to redeem for carbon offsets, which we think will be popular with millennials. So no real change to that. In terms of competitive intensity we talked about it. They're just extraordinarily attractive cost per account last year as there was a significant pullback. I think we're now moving towards more normalized levels of competition. And my guess is we'll see that increase. But our job is to grow the business in face of the competition that's there. And so while I missed the CPAs from last year, we feel good about the returns we'll generate from our marketing even in a more intense environment.\nMihir Bhatia: Understood. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of John Hecht of Jefferies.\nJohn Hecht: Good morning guys. Thanks very much for taking my questions. First question and Roger you addressed some of this with respect to the loan growth, maybe you talked about it being a mix of line utilization and new customers. I'm wondering is there one bigger contribution to that relative to the others? And what's the cadence, is this more of a second half factor, or is this going to be balanced over the course of the year? \nRoger Hochschild: Yeah. So on the cadence I do expect marketing expenses to ramp up over the course of the year. They weren't overly large Q1. But again with the wider credit box we'll get more leverage for the marketing spend, and so we would expect a ramp. But we'll look at that continuously and make adjustments as we see fit. In terms of the impact of the credit changes, it's probably more heavily weighted towards the new account side versus portfolio. But we always look for a blend of those two as we think about growth.\nJohn Hecht: Okay. And then\u2026\nJohn Greene: And then -- sorry, go ahead John. Please go ahead.\nJohn Hecht: John just more of a concept question, we're a year into CECL now and obviously it's had a pretty big impact in how things have turned out from a GAAP perspective. How do you stack the major decision-making factors with respect to your ALL now? Is it the Moody's model? Is it unemployment? Is it just your internal opinion of your performance trends? How have things changed with respect to the way you look at that ALL level?\nJohn Greene: Yeah. Good question. So certainly evolving. So we use Moody's and also two other providers. So the broad macros are very important. The portfolio performance itself is also, obviously, a key input. And we have a team of technical modelers that have run various scenarios regression, sort of, scenarios to help make a determination on what overall life of loan losses could be, which is a key input. Because there's probably 12 to 15 different variables that go into that model that help do the projection. And then the other piece is your loan balance right? And what you have on the balance sheet as of the measurement date in order to set reserves. So, I would say, all of those factors are important. And then finally, one other one is the recovery rate, which actually also does go into the model, so four important factors. And we've taken a measured approach to ensure that our balance sheet is appropriately stated and we're on the conservative end of the judgment calls.\nJohn Hecht: Appreciate the context. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Meng Jiao of Deutsche Bank.\nMeng Jiao: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my call. So, it looks like monthly sales for travel and restaurants and retail seems to have pretty much materially accelerated from February into March and particularly for restaurants. Have you guys seen that carrying over into April as well?\nRoger Hochschild: Yes. Yes. Yes, we have actually incredibly the sales performance the first three weeks of April versus 2019. Overall, were up about 17%. And it's three weeks into the month, so things can change. And then versus last year was certainly dented significantly by the pandemic. We're up 68% on sales, so, really strong there, and the mix between revolvers and transactors. Obviously transactors are up higher than revolvers, but revolvers are up, almost near double digits versus prior year, so all good.\nMeng Jiao: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Moshe Orenbuch of Credit Suisse.\nMoshe Orenbuch: Great. Thanks. Most of my questions actually have been already asked and answered. But maybe if you could just follow up on two quick points. One is, the payment rate, the stubbornly high payment rates and how that will likely decline. I mean, is there -- I guess maybe the question is, how much of that is a function of the actual stimulus dollars versus some of the ongoing impacts that you highlighted, whether it's enhanced unemployment benefits, student loan interest forbearance in terms of thinking about the pace of that decline? And then just very quickly, you talked about the CECL Day 1. Just conceptually, do you think that the life of loan has a higher or lower likelihood on January 1, 2022 of a near-term recession on January 1, 2020? \nRoger Hochschild: So, I'll cover the first part, and I'll let John forecast recessions. In terms of the elevated payment rate, it is a mix, but you are seeing a lot of it come from the governmental support. And so, we do expect it to come down over the course of the year, but remain elevated compared to historic levels. And this is because, households have a lot of savings withdrawn and there are just a lot of other forms of support. So, it's not -- it is a headwind against loan growth. It's really being driven by external factors. So, I would say we're not overly alarmed about it. And again, we would expect it to start drifting downward, as we get further past the really extraordinary levels of government stimulus. And I'll pass it to John for the questions on reserves.\nJohn Greene: Great. So, yes, I think what you're getting at is, what will be our macro assumptions at the end of this year forecasting out to 2022. So today, obviously, there's no perfect answer or perfect insight. I will say this, the pent-up demand for consumers, I believe, is fairly pronounced and will continue to drive spending activity through this year and well into next year. So that, to me, indicates that the macros should be positive through 2022. Beyond 2022, it's really difficult to call at this point.\nMoshe Orenbuch: Okay. Thank you.\nJohn Greene: You\u2019re welcome. Thanks. Thanks for the questions.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Barker of Piper Sandler.\nKevin Barker: Good morning. Could you give us a little bit more detail on some of the investment spend you're making on data analytics and driving account growth? And then also, is there any way to quantify how much incremental spend you're putting into that and returns that are being generated from that, whether it's additional growth or other trends that we can identify to quantify the growth or the investment returns that you're getting?\nJohn Greene: Yes. Great. So I'll hit the second part of that question first. So in terms of returns, we have a rigorous process where we take a look at incremental investments to ensure that they deliver strong cash-on-cash returns. And in terms of ROEs or return thresholds, I won't be specific, but very, very strong double digits on those, in line with what you can expect from the company on a normalized basis in terms of return on capital. In terms of what we're investing in data analytics specifically on -- I'm looking at the attrition from the portfolio, we feel like there's an opportunity to reduce attrition level through some early identification of customers who may not be maximizing the usage of the card. We have data analytics projects going on in collections. I mentioned in our prepared remarks in fraud and fraud analytics. So there's -- frankly there's almost insatiable demand for these sorts of programs. And what we are, we're being very, very selective in terms of making sure that we prioritize the highest returning ones in the current year.\nKevin Barker: Okay. Thank you.\nJohn Greene: You\u2019re welcome.\nRoger Hochschild: And Maria, why don't we make this our last question please? \nOperator: Our final question comes from the line of Dominick Gabriele of Oppenheimer.\nDominick Gabriele: Hey. Thank you so much for taking my question. I just wanted to go back to the expenses. And sorry, I don't mean to beat a dead horse here. If you look at the GAAP operating expenses in the fourth quarter of 2020, they were almost about $1.3 billion. Are we expecting a quarter that could be that high? Or just because there was -- it seemed to be a little -- I got a little confused on one of the comments there. So is that reasonable to think that one of the quarters could be near that $1.3 billion level?\nJohn Greene: Yes. So I'm certainly not in the business of forecasting quarterly. I will tell you this from an expense standpoint. The marketing expense, the balance of the year, we expect will continue to grow into the kind of that envelope we talked about earlier. The quarter-over-quarter comparisons are frankly relatively challenging given what happened in 2020 in terms of our focused approach to look at every single dollar that potentially was going out the door on an expense item. So I would just focus on the broad numbers and the quarterly breakouts, I'll leave it to you to figure out what makes the most sense. We -- here we're looking at 2021 and 2022 and don't specifically try to manage to any particular quarterly number.\nDominick Gabriele: Makes sense. And then, I guess, if you kind of look at what happened this quarter with the, kind of, benefits that you guys have with having not only a lending business, but one that also gains interchange that really helped offset some of the slowdown in loans, I guess. Do you expect that the -- we could see that Discover proprietary network being much higher as far as a growth basis going forward year-over-year versus your loan growth in 2021? Do you expect that divergence to be there for at least a few quarters? Thanks so much, guys. Really appreciate it.\nRoger Hochschild: Sure. So our total network spend is benefiting from growth in some of our third-party payments areas. If you include the debit side PULSE is growing very strongly and so that's helpful. But we also believe that having a proprietary network is an important differentiator and gives us a whole series of capabilities that helps us grow our banking business. So again total volume will depend somewhat on some of the partners and we are a little skewed towards debit for the third parties, but we're going to work for a continued robust volume growth.\nDominick Gabriele: Okay.

            "content": "Thanks Eric and thanks to our listeners for joining today's call. Last April, if you told me to the year into the pandemic we'd be reporting excellent credit performance, positive sales trends, and solid earnings growth, I wouldn't have believed it. While the pandemic is far from over and there may be twists and turns ahead, as a nation, we have made tremendous progress toward addressing the health crisis and reopening the economy. This quarter we earned $1.6 billion after-tax or $5.04 per share. I'm very pleased with these results, which reflect our robust business model; strong execution including a disciplined approach to managing credit; improving economic trends; and the impact of federal support for US consumers. Since the end of 2020, our view on economic conditions has improved. The rapid pace of the recovery has lessened our concern of job losses spreading to the white collar workforce and there has also been substantial support for the US consumer through stimulus in January and in March. Our current expectation is that credit losses in 2021 will be flat to down year-over-year. This improved economic view combined with lower loan balances and continued strong credit performance were the primary drivers of $879 million reserve release in the quarter. As discussed in previous quarters, the strong credit performance was accompanied by elevated payment rates that continue to put pressure on loan balances, which were down 7% year-over-year. Payment rates were over 350 basis points higher than last year and at their highest level since the year 2000. Sure. Thanks for the question Sanjay. Maybe starting then with the stimulus. Clearly, one of the biggest differences versus 2019 is the payment rate. And that's partly driven by the cash payments to consumers the savings rate, but also the relief they get be it on their federal student loans or other payments they have to make. And so that's a real headwind against loan growth. And as I mentioned on the call, it's actually at the highest level since the year 2000. In terms of marketing, we feel very good about the cost per accounts about the projected returns we'll get on those have widened our credit box back to the pre-pandemic. Although as you recall we have been tightening for a couple of years and I would say continue to remain conservative in our overall credit approach. So, I really think it's a headwind from payment rates that has kept us from being even more enthusiastic about loan growth. Yes. I think part of it and John indicated this, I think, we're probably more comfortable giving you some view around where we expect total expenses to be. But also it will depend on what we see in the back half of the year. And so to the extent we see opportunities to deploy more capital against organic growth, we've been clear that's our top priority. And so that's why we'll -- we're continuously revisiting where and how much we should allocate to market. Good morning. Yeah. And on the M&A front, we try and be disciplined. And so I would say, would not let extra money burn a hole in our pocket. For those of us \u2013 for those of you who've been with us for longer, you'll recall we had significant excess capital post the financial crisis. We're limited by the payout ratios in the CCAR process. But as said, we will return it over time and stay disciplined. So as we think about M&A opportunities on the banking side, not much out there that fits with our digital model. You're seeing acquisitions that are branch mergers cost takeout which doesn't fit. And then on the payment side, while valuations have come in, they're still really high. And so we lean a bit more towards partnerships, potentially smaller minority investments. So again, I think you can expect no change to our disciplined approach around returning capital to our shareholders. Great. Real quick. First part of your question, the expense growth relative to cap last year. And then on the investment side, a lot of those are on capabilities, especially in the data and analytics area that just enhance all parts of our operations, whether it's the credit underwriting, the marketing, targeting, personalization, collections et cetera. And so they are given the return profile, part of it is just bandwidth and talent, I would say are more gating factors, but we're really excited about the benefits. And then in terms of putting more dollars to work on the marketing side, it will vary. Competitive activity has a bit of an impact on that, but we will just look at it on the new account side, what we're seeing across different channels and carefully at those marginal opportunities and the returns they generate. Good morning. Yes. So, we don't really participate in the student loan refi market. The pricing doesn't really meet our return hurdles. To the extent, there is more activity it can marginally impact the payment rate for student loans. But we feel really good about where we're positioned. And I think last year was very challenging. There's a lot of kids either deferred for a year or had reduced expenses, because they didn't have meals or housing, et cetera. So again, yes, we feel good about what this peak season should bring and our ability to continue gaining share. Thanks, Bill. Good morning. Sure. So in terms of the credit expansion, it's probably more heavily impacting new accounts, but also encompasses sort of our line increase and other criteria on the portfolio side as well. In terms of where I expect, I would say in all times, we give cards to consumers who are in good shape. But we do have particularly strong appeal to millennials and students. Our secured card is performing well in the marketplace. But then also the traditional prime revolver segment that Discover has always targeted. It's a very competitive business. It always has been. So, it's about differentiation. And there a superior customer experience a great rewards program focus on value those traditional things are what allow us to continue gaining share and booking new accounts. So there aren't that many of the Fintechs that are active yet in the card space. By and large they do loans of different types. And so, we've yet to see a significant, I would say Fintech player in the card space. And most of our competition tends to be the traditional leaders in the marketplace. So Betsy we do have some other questions to get to. So we'll follow up later. Thanks. Great question, I think, it really accelerated a lot of trends that were existing prior to pandemic right? So consumers were already migrating more and more of their shopping online, but that moved even quicker. Their customer interactions were moving more towards digital that accelerated even further. So I think it had us recommitted to the path we were on and looking to accelerate some of the functionality. Certainly there were some specific things around the tap-and-go cards a lot of small dollar transactions migrating from cash to debit that benefited our PULSE volumes. But I would say in general, not so much new trends but, three, four, five year accelerations of trends that were already there and that we have been positioning the company to take advantage of. Where we traditionally made them on the payment side is, with partners that either, add capabilities or to cement a relationship that will drive volume over our network. On the technology side, we found, plenty of great partner/vendors out there that you don't need -- people don't need money in the current environment. And so that's why we tend not to do investments in pure technology companies that aren't payments related. Great question, I think that will be constructive. Some of the categories that were strongest through the downturn though had a pretty good revolve rate. So you think about home improvement that was really doing well. So a lot of it I think will be in the restaurant and travel segment, but I wouldn't necessarily expect a huge boost to revolve rate just given again some of the categories that were strong in the downturn. Yeah. So I'll start with the second one. We are not seeing an impact. And we think the lesson learned in the pandemic of the utility of cash awards hopefully will last. And we feel very good about even the newer redemption offers we've added. So the ability to redeem at point-of-sale with PayPal with Amazon, we've just announced the ability to redeem for carbon offsets, which we think will be popular with millennials. So no real change to that. In terms of competitive intensity we talked about it. They're just extraordinarily attractive cost per account last year as there was a significant pullback. I think we're now moving towards more normalized levels of competition. And my guess is we'll see that increase. But our job is to grow the business in face of the competition that's there. And so while I missed the CPAs from last year, we feel good about the returns we'll generate from our marketing even in a more intense environment. Yeah. So on the cadence I do expect marketing expenses to ramp up over the course of the year. They weren't overly large Q1. But again with the wider credit box we'll get more leverage for the marketing spend, and so we would expect a ramp. But we'll look at that continuously and make adjustments as we see fit. In terms of the impact of the credit changes, it's probably more heavily weighted towards the new account side versus portfolio. But we always look for a blend of those two as we think about growth. Yes. Yes. Yes, we have actually incredibly the sales performance the first three weeks of April versus 2019. Overall, were up about 17%. And it's three weeks into the month, so things can change. And then versus last year was certainly dented significantly by the pandemic. We're up 68% on sales, so, really strong there, and the mix between revolvers and transactors. Obviously transactors are up higher than revolvers, but revolvers are up, almost near double digits versus prior year, so all good. So, I'll cover the first part, and I'll let John forecast recessions. In terms of the elevated payment rate, it is a mix, but you are seeing a lot of it come from the governmental support. And so, we do expect it to come down over the course of the year, but remain elevated compared to historic levels. And this is because, households have a lot of savings withdrawn and there are just a lot of other forms of support. So, it's not -- it is a headwind against loan growth. It's really being driven by external factors. So, I would say we're not overly alarmed about it. And again, we would expect it to start drifting downward, as we get further past the really extraordinary levels of government stimulus. And I'll pass it to John for the questions on reserves. And Maria, why don't we make this our last question please? Sure. So our total network spend is benefiting from growth in some of our third-party payments areas. If you include the debit side PULSE is growing very strongly and so that's helpful. But we also believe that having a proprietary network is an important differentiator and gives us a whole series of capabilities that helps us grow our banking business. So again total volume will depend somewhat on some of the partners and we are a little skewed towards debit for the third parties, but we're going to work for a continued robust volume growth. Thank you, folks."

            "name": "John Greene",
            "content": "Thank you, Roger. Happy Birthday, Wanji. And good morning everyone. I'll begin by addressing our summary financial results on slide 4. As Roger indicated, the results this period reflects many of the same dynamics we've seen over the past few quarters. The influence of stimulus resulted in elevated payment rates, which pressured loan growth. It also contributed to the strong asset quality and our significant reserve release in the quarter. Revenue net of interest expense decreased 3% from the prior year mainly from lower net interest income. This was driven by a 7% decline in average receivables and lower market rates partially offset by a reduction in funding costs as we continued to manage deposit pricing and optimized our funding mix. Non-interest income was 5% lower, primarily due to a $35 million net gain from the sale of an equity investment in the prior year. Consistent with our excellent credit quality, lower loan fee income reflects a decline in late fees, while net discount and interchange revenue was up 12% from the prior year reflecting the increased sales volume. The provision for credit losses was $2 billion lower than the prior year, mainly, due to an $879 million reserve release in the current quarter compared to a $1.1 billion reserve build in the prior year. Our improved economic outlook, lower loan balances and strong credit drove the release. Additionally, net charge-offs decreased 30% or $232 million in the prior year. Operating expenses decreased 7% year-over-year as we remain disciplined on expense management. Other than compensation, all other expenses were down from the prior year led by marketing, which decreased 33% year-over-year. Looking ahead, we intend to accelerate marketing investments over the remainder of the year. We'll go into details on our spending outlook in a few moments. Moving to loan growth on slide 5. Total loans were down 7% from the prior year driven by a 9% decrease in card receivables. The reduction in card receivables was driven by two primary factors; first, the payment rate remained elevated driven by the latest round of stimulus and improved household cash flows; second, promotional balances have continued digit decline reflecting the actions we took at the onset of the pandemic to tighten credit. Okay. Hey, Ryan, thanks for the question. I'll start it and then I'll turn it over to Roger for the second piece of the question. So, really, really strong performance. And the economy has strengthened beyond our expectations as we said in our prepared remarks. So we came into the year somewhat optimistic, but also cautious given the amount of uncertainty. What we're seeing is kind of a broad-based improvement in the economy, our credit fundamentals have been extremely strong. As a result, we made a decision to -- an appropriate decision to release about $900 million of reserve taking the \u2013 obviously, the CET1 ratio well above our internal target of 10.5%. We're looking to come back to that 10.5% point. We're not going to do it overnight. We know the CECL transition is somewhere between 200 basis points and 250 basis points on CET1, but that still leaves ample room for actions in terms of dividends, buybacks and targeted M&A, when and if appropriate. So specifics around timing getting back to 10.5%, I would broadly say medium term, but we're certainly committed to that target. And we'll do a number of efforts, including revisiting our buyback levels in the second half of this year to get there. And the follow-up might be, what do we expect the buyback levels to be incrementalized to? We're not going to give specifics, but I will give a little bit of history. If you go back to 2017 and 2018, our level of buybacks was about $2 billion. I'm not saying history is going to repeat, it will be subject to a bunch of conversations with our team internally and then obviously Board approval, but we'll continue to evaluate. So, Roger you want to? Yes. Happy to cover that. So as we went through the pandemic, we really scrutinized the expense base, and there's been a long history of expense discipline in this company. And through the pandemic we found certain opportunities. So as we think about the balance of this year, next year, and going forward, we're going to continue to focus on controlling corporate costs, so that we can invest savings back into overall growth levers. And we've done that, and we're going to continue to do that. As we think about the efficiency ratio, we'll come in this year somewhere around where we finished last year, I think assuming revenue comes in with the modest growth we talked about in loans. And going forward, I would expect somewhere in the upper 30s would be a reasonable spot. That will indicate that we're driving efficiencies and still investing in the business. Any follow-up now? Yes. Thanks, Bill. So, specific to rates, so if rates begin to increase, there's indications that a number of different things that are happening in the economy. So, you would expect inflation to be increasing a very, very low level of unemployment, probably near full employment for the economy and a robustness that might rival kind of the pre-pandemic levels on a sustained basis. And so, you have to believe that there are a lot of different things that are going to happen. And as I said, also, we'll take some actions to control inflation. Now, we've seen this over a number of years now that the Fed and overall interest rate environment has been on a sustained basis very, very low. As we look forward to 2021 and 2022, my expectation is rates will remain low, and we'll enjoy the benefits of an economy that's continuing to grow. Beyond that, it gets different -- more difficult to call. In terms of total return levels, it will depend on a number of factors. Rate is just one of those. Credit obviously would be an important item. But certainly, longer term, we think that we're in a position to drive high returns for our shareholders consistent with what we've done historically and our hope is when we come back to that 10.5% target that that will further enhance overall returns. Good morning. Yes. So we used a GAAP basis on that. And so, the one-timers that were included in an underlying number that actually we didn't publish, but we called out the underlying numbers. It was about $200 million. So the operating efficiency is going to be dependent upon what we see in terms of loan growth payment rate and new account generation which as Roger said, and I'll echo the comments, we're very positive about how we're positioned to drive growth in the -- especially in the second half of the year as the payment rate abates a bit. So what you can expect here and I'm trying to provide as much detail as I can, is that outside of the marketing investments we talked about, some select investments in data and analytics, we're looking to keep all other costs flat. And we're going to manage that envelope as we see opportunities. But we'll be able to use that as a jumping off point to drive further improvements and efficiencies in '22 and beyond. Yes. Subject to growth and what we see as opportunities. So there's no absolutes. But \u2013 and as time goes on we'll have more clarity on the opportunity. Yes. Thank you. So, we took a meaningful chunk out of the reserve levels, this quarter. Honestly, the credit outlook and our models indicated that there was a range of different outcomes we could have made on that. And what we tried to do was, take a chunk out of the reserves that made sense given, the level of absolute uncertainty in the economy. As we look forward, the absolute reserve level or reserve rate will depend on what we see in the macros, how the portfolio is performing, and what we do in terms of account growth loan balance. But overall, as we think about where the provision levels could be, I would use the Day one CECL rate as a decent proxy. And subject to, how the portfolio is performing it could migrate up or down from there. What we did last year in the first quarter and the second quarter was react to an incredibly, dynamic and changing macro environment. And we prudently put up an incremental $2 billion. So, if the portfolio performs over time we could get back to that CECL Day one and perhaps, a little bit lower with excellent portfolio management. Now timing I'm not going to be specific on. Good morning. And then -- sorry, go ahead John. Please go ahead. Yeah. Good question. So certainly evolving. So we use Moody's and also two other providers. So the broad macros are very important. The portfolio performance itself is also, obviously, a key input. And we have a team of technical modelers that have run various scenarios regression, sort of, scenarios to help make a determination on what overall life of loan losses could be, which is a key input. Because there's probably 12 to 15 different variables that go into that model that help do the projection. And then the other piece is your loan balance right? And what you have on the balance sheet as of the measurement date in order to set reserves. So, I would say, all of those factors are important. And then finally, one other one is the recovery rate, which actually also does go into the model, so four important factors. And we've taken a measured approach to ensure that our balance sheet is appropriately stated and we're on the conservative end of the judgment calls. Great. So, yes, I think what you're getting at is, what will be our macro assumptions at the end of this year forecasting out to 2022. So today, obviously, there's no perfect answer or perfect insight. I will say this, the pent-up demand for consumers, I believe, is fairly pronounced and will continue to drive spending activity through this year and well into next year. So that, to me, indicates that the macros should be positive through 2022. Beyond 2022, it's really difficult to call at this point. You're welcome. Thanks. Thanks for the questions. Yes. Great. So I'll hit the second part of that question first. So in terms of returns, we have a rigorous process where we take a look at incremental investments to ensure that they deliver strong cash-on-cash returns. And in terms of ROEs or return thresholds, I won't be specific, but very, very strong double digits on those, in line with what you can expect from the company on a normalized basis in terms of return on capital. In terms of what we're investing in data analytics specifically on -- I'm looking at the attrition from the portfolio, we feel like there's an opportunity to reduce attrition level through some early identification of customers who may not be maximizing the usage of the card. We have data analytics projects going on in collections. I mentioned in our prepared remarks in fraud and fraud analytics. So there's -- frankly there's almost insatiable demand for these sorts of programs. And what we are, we're being very, very selective in terms of making sure that we prioritize the highest returning ones in the current year. You're welcome. Yes. So I'm certainly not in the business of forecasting quarterly. I will tell you this from an expense standpoint. The marketing expense, the balance of the year, we expect will continue to grow into the kind of that envelope we talked about earlier. The quarter-over-quarter comparisons are frankly relatively challenging given what happened in 2020 in terms of our focused approach to look at every single dollar that potentially was going out the door on an expense item. So I would just focus on the broad numbers and the quarterly breakouts, I'll leave it to you to figure out what makes the most sense. We -- here we're looking at 2021 and 2022 and don't specifically try to manage to any particular quarterly number."

I want to begin by reviewing the highlights and key metrics for the year, and then John will take you through the details of our fourth quarter results and our perspectives on 2023. I'm very pleased to say that 2022 was the second strongest year for earnings in our company's history. We reported net income of $1 billion or $3.77 per share for the fourth quarter and $4.4 billion or $15.50 per share for the full year. This was accomplished against a fluid and unusual macroeconomic and monetary policy backdrop and I want to thank the entire Discover team for their solid execution. This performance gives us significant momentum going into 2023 and beyond. I want to give a few highlights that underscore these strong results. First, we grew new accounts by 23% and loan receivables by 20%. This demonstrates the appeal of our consumer value proposition and advancements in our consumer targeting and acquisition capabilities while maintaining our conservative approach to underwriting and credit management. We're also prudently investing for growth, including an acquisition and brand marketing, the continuing build-out of our data and analytic capabilities and increasing field personnel for both servicing and collections, all while achieving a 39% efficiency ratio. The combination of revenue expansion and disciplined cost management contributed to our 31% return on equity this past year and underscores the highly capital-generative nature of our business model. Over the course of 2022, we repurchased $2.4 billion in common stock and increased our dividend by over 20%, and we expect to sustain attractive levels of capital return to our shareholders into the future. As we look into 2023, we expect a less favorable macroeconomic backdrop. Nevertheless, we intend to maintain an appropriate level of investment in our organization. For example, we have several initiatives that will improve our digital marketing capabilities, and we anticipate the broad market launch for mass market cash-back debit product. And of course, we'll continue to invest in our brand and in account acquisition in a manner consistent with the environment. We're very aware of the climate in which we are operating. And should there be changes in economic conditions, we will adjust. Our model with its focus on prime lending and through-the-cycle underwriting has historically supported resilient returns through the economic cycle. These factors, combined with our earnings power, reserves and capital, underpin our strategy of being the leading consumer digital bank. I'll now turn the call over to John to review our results in more detail.\nJohn Greene: Thank you, Roger, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with our financial summary results on Slide 4. The takeaway of the quarter is largely about strong asset growth and net interest margin expansion, partially offset by growth-based provisioning. Asset growth combined with a NIM rate improvement, increased revenue 7% sequentially and 27% year-over-year. Similar to last quarter, asset growth also drove an increase in our reserves of $313 million. This increase kept our reserve coverage ratio relatively flat at 6.6%. In the prior year, we released $39 million of reserves. So while our reported net income was down 3% year-over-year, adjusting for the reserve change, our net income would have been 23% higher on a year-over-year basis. Let's review the details starting on Slide 5. Net interest income was up $584 million year-over-year or 24%. Our net interest margin expanded, benefiting from the higher prime rate partially offset by higher funding costs and increased promotional balances. NIM ended the quarter at 11.27%, up 46 basis points from the prior year and 22 basis points sequentially. For the full year, NIM was 11.04%, up 28 basis points from the prior year. Receivable growth was driven by card which increased 21% year-over-year, reflecting continued strong sales, new account growth and payment rate moderation. Sales increased 8% in the period, a deceleration from the 15% growth we experienced in the prior quarter and the 20% in the first half of the year. New card accounts grew by 17% from last year's fourth quarter. Similar to the prior quarter, the sales growth decline was mitigated by a decrease in the payment rate, which fell 150 basis points in the quarter. We expect payment rates to continue to decline through 2023, but at a more moderate pace. Turning to our non-card products. Organic student loans increased 4% as a result of peak season originations. Personal loans were up 15%. We continue to stay disciplined in our approach to marketing, underwriting and pricing of this product. Our attractive value proposition has positioned us well in the market that is experiencing strong consumer demand and some improvement in competitive conditions. In terms of funding mix, our customer deposit balances were up 10% year-over-year and 5% sequentially. Deposit pricing continues to be in line with what we expected in a rising rate environment. Recently, we have seen some moderation in the pace of pricing changes. Looking at other revenue on Slide 6. Non-interest income increased $212 million or 47%. This was partially due to a $138 million loss on our equity investments in the prior year quarter, compared to a $6 million loss this quarter. Adjusting for these, our non-interest income was up 14%. This increase was primarily driven by two items. First, loan fee income was up $51 million or 39%, driven by volume. And second, we had higher net discount and interchange revenue, which was up $23 million or 7% reflecting strong sales and a favorable sales mix, partially offset by higher rewards costs. Moving to expenses on Slide 7. Total operating expenses were up $183 million or 14% year-over-year and up 8% from the prior quarter. Compensation costs were up primarily due to increased headcount and wage inflation. Marketing expenses increased $42 million or 15% as we continue to prudently invest for growth in our card in consumer banking products. Premise and equipment expense was elevated this quarter due to a onetime write-off related to the exit of our Phoenix servicing location. Adjusting for this, premise and equipment would have been flat to the prior year quarter. With this recent action, we have resized or exited three of our four major call center locations, and we'll continue to evaluate our footprint going forward. Moving to credit performance on Slide 8. Total net charge-offs were 2.13%, 76 basis points higher than the prior year and up 42 basis points from the prior quarter. In the card portfolio, the net charge-off rate of 2.37% was 87 basis points higher than the prior year and 45 basis points higher sequentially. As expected, portfolio loss rates are normalizing, reflecting seasoning of new account vintages from the past two years, normalization of older vintages and mild deterioration and low credit bands, largely inflation-driven. These trends are within our expected risk tolerances and are consistent with our historical approach to underwriting and credit management. Among our core prime revolver segment, we don't see evidence of broader stress given the robust labor market. I'll cover our 2023 view in a moment. Turning to the discussions of our allowance on Slide 9. This quarter, we increased our allowance by $313 million driven by the increase in receivable balances. Our reserve rate declined slightly to 6.6%. Adjusting for the elevated level of transactor balances in the fourth quarter, our reserve rate would have been near sequentially flat. Under the CECL accounting standard, we are required to contemplate life of loan losses and adjust our reserve levels accordingly. For us, the changes to employment conditions pose the most significant risk to our forecast. For the year-end 2022 reserve, our baseline assumption was unemployment in 2023 between 4.5% and 6.5% and with alternative scenarios above 6%. Looking at Slide 10. Our common equity Tier 1 for the period was 13.3%. Our longer-term target remains at 10.5%. We expect to make progress against this target over the next four to six quarters. Yesterday, we announced a quarterly common dividend of $0.60 per share. And in the fourth quarter of 2022, we repurchased $602 million of common stock. Concluding on Slide 11 with our outlook. Momentum is strong, which should help to generate double-digit revenue growth and positive operating leverage. We expect end-of-period loan growth to be in the low double digits with average loan growth somewhat higher. This is driven by three factors: our prior year growth in new accounts moderation in the payment rate and sales volume trends. Through mid-January, sales are up 13%, but we expect deceleration to the high single digits over the course of the year. We expect net interest margin to be modestly higher than the full year 2022 levels. More specifically, we expect NIM to be above the fourth quarter levels in the first half of the year driven by continued loan re-pricing benefits and decline in the second half. We are looking for total operating expenses to increase less than 10%. Salary and benefit expense will increase due to hiring in the second half of 2022. Additionally, we expect marketing to be above our full year 2022 level. We expect net charge-offs will average between 3.5% and 3.9% for the full year. The low end of the range is more in line with our base case, while the high end is more consistent with a weaker employment scenario. Lastly, we have $2.8 billion of remaining capacity under the $4.2 billion share repurchase program that expires in June of this year. We expect to repurchase around $2.2 billion of shares in the first half of 2023. We'll provide an update on future share repurchase authorizations after we complete our stress testing process and review recommendations with our Board. In summary, receivable growth continued to benefit from new account acquisition, payment rate moderation and positive sales. NIM continues to benefit from prime rate increases with funding costs consistent with expectations and credit is performing in line with our approach through-the-cycle underwriting process and conservative credit management. Our perspectives for 2023 reflect our focus on advancing our strategic priorities generating high returns and capital while remaining disciplined in our credit and expense management. With that, I'll turn the call back over to our operator to open the line for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse.\nMoshe Orenbuch: Great. And John, thanks for kind of outlining the parameters of the range of expected credit loss. But could you talk a little bit about the past kind of from here to getting to the 3.5%? Like what either has to happen that's bad or not happen, that's good. And at what points along that way, would you know whether that 3.5% base case is too high or too low?\nJohn Greene: Yes. Great. Yes. Thanks for the question, Moshe. So the range is some unlocked, right? 3.5% to 3.9% for '23. And -- we certainly have a great deal of visibility through the first six months of the year through a roll rate methodology. Post six months, so in the second half of the year, we use our analytical models which anticipate a number of different possible outcomes but used as historical data that's been tested significantly to make a projection of what we expect to happen. So as we get through the first quarter, we'll be able to see what's happening with our roll rates in terms of is it a roll to one bucket and the roll to two bucket, consistent with our expectations on the base case on the reserve. Beyond that, we'll certainly look at the macro environment and what's happening with unemployment levels and the overall job market. That will give us some perspective. And then an important component of this, and I know there was some questions in terms of the step-up from where we ended '22 to where we're projecting '23. We have fairly significant vintages that are going through the normal seasoning process right now. So for example, our end-of-period card portfolio, so last year 12/31 to this year 12/31 increased by $15.7 billion. And if you think about kind of a maturity cycle of a credit card, typically within the first year to two years, you hit peak losses. So that is some of what we're expecting here, and therefore, the guidance that we've provided. We do expect that in a stable macroeconomic environment, in the second half of the year, we should see this slope of the curve begin to bend down a little bit with perhaps top losses coming through in '24 and then returning down. So overall, what we're seeing here is just a strong portfolio, very significant vintages that came through in '21 and '22 that are seasoning at levels that were -- that are completely within our expectation of total return thresholds. And then, we'll see the overall portfolio normalized. So hopefully, that provides some clarity on both the trajectory as well as what we're seeing in the portfolio.\nMoshe Orenbuch: Perfect. And just as a follow-up, the reserve rate was down. You mentioned that was largely a result of transactor balances. But I guess even with that, it wasn't up. And so when you think about that, kind of how do you -- I mean, how should we think -- it doesn't feel like you're anticipating a deteriorating environment if you're keeping your reserve certainly no worse than flat. And how do we think about that going through '23 as well?\nJohn Greene: Yes, great question. And they're connected, so happy to cover them in the same set. So CECL reflects life of loan losses as we all know, right? And so, what drives that is the portfolio performance and the -- our view of the macroeconomic environment today and going forward. And we haven't had any substantial changes to the macroeconomic environment. And essentially, the portfolio is performing within our expected ranges of outcomes. So, as we look at the fourth quarter receivable balances in the aggregate, and the portfolio performance, a stable macro, we felt most appropriate reserve levels would be fairly consistent with what we did in the third quarter. And essentially, without taking you through a ton of detail that the teams spend weeks and weeks working through, that's essentially how we arrived at the answer.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Maybe just a follow-up question to the credit questions Moshe asked. John, you talked about the seasoning. Is there any way to parse apart the impact of seasoning in your range versus the actual degradation as a result of just the deteriorating delinquencies on a base case? And then you mentioned sort of the slope of the curve decelerates, I think you said in the second half, but I just want to make sure to understand sort of how the seasoning will impact us for the next two years. Does it still weigh in on you in the first half of 2024?\nJohn Greene: Yes. So in terms of the impact of the vintages, I explicitly called out the card vintage in 2022, so the $15.7 billion to give the folks that are listening here, a place to anchor on in terms of thinking about the vintage and then you can run out peak losses for our portfolio in terms of what typically happens after a significant vintage and in a stable macro. So that should help you at least in terms of the thinking in terms of the vintage. As we think about this year, we gave that range of 3.5% to 3.9% on the loan base -- on the average loan base. So you should think about the ultimate kind of range here. It will depend first on the macro. Second, we'll continue to give updates in each of the quarters in terms of what we're seeing. But ultimately, we expect this vintage will mature in 2024. And then, we should see in a stable macro, the curve not only slope pending, but actually inverting slightly.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Okay. Follow-up question on loan growth. Obviously, you mentioned the strong growth driving the seasoning, but you guys are still expecting double-digit growth in the face of maybe a tougher economic backdrop. What gives you the comfort here? Maybe Roger, speaking to the growth in the past, and I know every cycle takes on a different complexion. What are you guys looking at that makes you comfortable to grow here? Because that's a question I get quite a bit from investors.\nRoger Hochschild: Yes. Good question, Sanjay. I think you've seen us operate this business through multiple cycles and the disciplined approach we take both in good times as well as in bad. And frequently, the accounts that you put on during a challenging economic time, perform extraordinarily well, and you can see very good cost per account as competitors pull back. So, we have been pretty clear at that starting in the back half of last year, we started tightening credit standards, and you can expect us to continue to look at that and adjust according to economic conditions, both for new accounts as well as the portfolio. Nevertheless, we're seeing great returns on the marketing investments we're putting out there. And so, that's what gives us the confidence to keep investing in growth.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from John Hecht with Jefferies.\nJohn Hecht: And not to beat the dead horse, but maybe just one more question on the kind of the provisioning and the credit. John, I think you kind of detailed the unemployment assumptions. I think they were kind of in the 4.5% to 6% range with maybe somewhere making the 5% range, kind of the middle of the fairway. Just maybe can you tell us what's the sensitivity for the -- either the charge-offs or the ALL at say unemployment moves to level like 100 basis points higher than that.\nJohn Greene: Yes. So in our kind of primary case here, we assumed a 100 basis points increase in unemployment. Now that that was specific to our charge-off forecast. In terms of kind of reserve levels, we actually used a composite of multiple scenarios. The more heavily weighted scenario reflected a loss rate of 4.5% and then going up all the way to 6%. So, I'm feeling actually like we're down the middle here in terms of appropriateness in terms of overall reserve levels and more specificity in terms of sensitivity. I don't think that would be a service given if we're seeing unemployment kind of creep up in that sort of matter or that sort of quantum that would indicate that the macro environment has changed, and we have to change our view on that, which could change our perspectives on life of loan losses.\nJohn Hecht: Okay. That's helpful. And then you gave annual guidance with NIM, and it sounds like maybe an elevated NIM in the first part of the year coming down second, what are the drivers of that with respect to the yield and the cost of capital?\nJohn Greene: Yes. Yes. So I'm going to run through the primary drivers. So first would be the Fed rate changes in the second half of '22 as well as what we've anticipated either two or three increases in 2023. Second impact is the yield on our investments, which is improving with the increase in the rate environment. And then, the third piece has been some pricing actions we took in the consumer banking products. So, think about the non-card products. So offsetting that would be kind of the cost of funding. So DTC and external funding costs have increased. And then we're also anticipating an impact from credit, all of which the net of those gives us a high level of confidence that certainly, we're going to see peak NIM in the first quarter and then stepping down from there through 2023.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark DeVries with Barclays.\nMark DeVries: I have one more credit question for you. I know you don't generally give out guidance more than one year out, but I think some of the commentary around the charge-off guidance has some implications for 2024. I just wanted to try and clarify I mean if you look at the guidance range, it seems to imply you kind of exit 2023 at a charge-off rate at 4% to 4.5%. I think, John, you indicated 2024 is kind of a peak year? Should we expect -- is it reasonable to assume that that's implying kind of a charge-off rate north of 4% for 2024?\nJohn Greene: Yes. So you were right on your call here. We gave a range for 2023 of 3.5% to 3.9%. I talked about the curve and what we think will happen to the curve and the slope of that. So, Mark, as a matter of prudence, I think that's probably as far as I'm going to go here.\nMark DeVries: Okay. Fair enough. Thanks for that color.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.\nBetsy Graseck: Maybe a slightly different way to address this question is you perhaps could give us some color on where you have seen your fully seasoned vintages peak in terms of net charge-off rates and around what kind of month within the seasoning path that happens in a range of months that would be helpful to understand.\nJohn Greene: Yes. So typically, we'll see it around 18 months. And it varies based on credit quality. So, the highest credit quality. So, I think FICO would typically peak a little later. And then the weaker, I'll say, the weaker credits typically peak a little bit earlier. But on average, I think, about 18 months or so.\nBetsy Graseck: And the level that you've been seeing, it would be helpful to understand how historically, the vintages that you want to write to are trajecting in terms of peak. And maybe if you could comp 2022 vintage in 2021, what you're seeing there would be helpful?\nJohn Greene: Yes. So -- the first part of that answer would be it would depend on the vintage. So if you go back to our 2020 vintage and remember, there's COVID, right, we were locked down. We ceased underwriting kind of the near prime and lower prime and concentrated on upper prime that vintage will season at a peak loss level below what Discover historically has done. If you look at '21, '22, we were essentially back to an underwriting standard consistent with history. And you can use that information to get some level of comfort around what can be expected in '24 on this vintage.\nBetsy Graseck: Okay. Because you're basically saying '22 is a normal -- is exhibiting behavior that is more normal pre-COVID type of vintages?\nJohn Greene: It is. Yes. Yes. The one difference that I think is important for folks to codify in their minds is that we're coming off an abnormally low base, right? So the entire portfolio is normalizing. We've talked about that consistently actually, since the beginning of last year that we thought the portfolio was normalizing. And what you're seeing here in the 2023 guidance is essentially the portfolio normalizing.\nBetsy Graseck: The current reserve ratio level is consistent with this normalization whereby peak losses hit in '24?\nJohn Greene: Yes. Otherwise, my controller would have taken an exception to our reserve process.\nBetsy Graseck: Right. And this is -- I know we're talking about card, but is this the same kind of expectation across the other asset classes as well, student and personnel?\nJohn Greene: Yes. Although what we're seeing in personal loans is, again, loss rates below historical norms. Payment rate is beginning to normalize. And we had talked about the fact that we perhaps overcorrected on that product in terms of underwriting, in terms of the pullback. We pulled back significantly. So I expect some seasoning and normalization there. But again, we're very, very confident about the loss performance of that product. We understand where it is on the payment priorities for folks. So we're going to be mindful of the economy on that. And student loans, yes, that's normalizing. We did have and likely we'll have a little bit of impact when we see the full impact of the student debtors on the government programs having to pay back loans, but it's underwritten to a high standard. 80-plus percent have cosigners. So, we feel very comfortable about that product as well.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Rick Shane of JPMorgan.\nRick Shane: Look, this is an interesting milestone where the reserve rate is 658 basis points. It basically is apples-to-apples seasonality versus CECL day one and up 50 basis points. I'm curious when we think about your economic outlook and how you build a CECL reserve where you compare to CECL day one on a like-for-like basis, would you build the same allowance? Or have you made adjustments and then compare your economic outlooks in each of those points in time, please?\nJohn Greene: Yes. So good question, Rick. So we've referenced CECL day one in the past, but I'd like to remind folks, day one was first time we rolled this new standard out. We were using new models. They've been tested extensively. And the macros were late cycle with higher unemployment levels. So as we look at kind of where we are today or as of the fourth quarter, right, 6.58 in terms of total loss reserve rate. That seems appropriate based on kind of what we're seeing in the macros and how the portfolio is performing. So, do we specifically reference day one only from the standpoint of where it was back on January 1, 2020, to where it is today, but we don't use that as a decision point whatsoever.\nRick Shane: John understood. I'm more curious that if you like were you've described that the models have evolved. And I think that, that's fair, and I think everybody appreciates that. What I'm asking is, on a like-for-like basis, would -- do you think that reserve rates are lower today using the same assumptions as you refine them versus CECL day one?\nJohn Greene: Yes. No, no, they're not lower. We're looking at the portfolio performance. It's performed extraordinarily well. We're seeing a bit of seasoning now, as you would expect in this type of product. And the macros are contemplating a minimum level of increase in unemployment of at least 0.5% and more likely 1%. So what you're seeing here is a CECL reserve for the quarter that reflects those macros.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Bob Napoli with William Blair.\nBob Napoli: Many -- some commentary, Roger, on the competitive environment for rewards. I mean, you've seen very strong growth out of a number of players in the industry, including yourselves. Can you -- are you seeing more competition? Where are you seeing more competition, more people getting more aggressive, if you would?\nRoger Hochschild: Yes. Thanks Bob. It remains, I would say, intensely competitive. But as you've seen from the growth and especially the performance in new accounts, our value proposition is competing well. And again, I want to give credit to some of the advancements on the analytics that let us sort of personalize the marketing messages across different channels. I guess where competition has lightened a bit is in the personal loan space. I think there are a lot of non-bank funded folks there who may have some challenges on the other side of the balance sheet. And obviously, one big player who had been active is pulling out. On the deposit side, I would see there, I think you're starting to see the gap between the direct banks, the branch banks really get wide enough that you're seeing flows to the direct system, right? It's now at 3.3% for a savings rate. It's now a lot more worth your money. So again, really excited about how our products are competing across every segment. And so that's part of why we're optimistic going into 2023.\nBob Napoli: What new products, I mean your cash-back debit is something that you've talked about? What new products are you most excited about?\nRoger Hochschild: You're highlighting probably the big launch for next year, which will be the re-launch of cash-back debit and we hope to be doing some mass-market advertising of that. Beyond that, I really believe we have the right product set. We're seeing great demand, for example, on the home equity side, given how rates have moved and the lack of cash-out refi. So I think part of how we keep our costs as low as they are, is a very simple, lean operating model. So I wouldn't expect anything other than the re-launch of the cash-back debit and we'll put a lot of weight behind that.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from John Pancari with Evercore ISI.\nJohn Pancari: Back to the credit topic, anything about the charge-off guidance that baked into your guidance, that is a surprise at all in terms of what you're observing. I know you talked about the seasoning and the vintages and it sounds like there's nothing there that really surprised you. But I'm wondering, anything about the credit migration within the vintages, within the portfolio in the past dues and/or customer behavior that surprised you that led to the increase in the charge-off guidance that seems to be well above where The Street was expecting?\nJohn Greene: Yes. Thanks, John. Actually, no surprises in the portfolio performance whatsoever, and I want to reiterate that. And that's essentially why the reserve rate is flat, right? So, they are connected. So what that says is that charge-off guidance was essentially contemplated in the reserving of life of loan losses. So, we feel very good about that and there is consistency. I did talk about in my prepared remarks that the lowest end of the credit spectrum that we have in our portfolio. So some near-prime and some folks without FICO scores or those who fell below 660 are certainly feeling the impact from inflation. But internally, we completely anticipated that we had run some analysis on inflation shocks and what it would do to some of the card members, and it's performing essentially where we thought it would come out. So I'm actually quite pleased about that. The other important thing that I want to make sure that the audience here is I think what 2022 did for us is it increased the earnings power of the firm. And there's a lot of focus from these questions on kind of the charge-off and peak good assets consistent with what we've done historically. So loans increased $18 billion. So, there's going to be some seasoning, but overall, the earnings power of the firm has increased as a result of great execution by our teams.\nJohn Pancari: Okay. That's helpful. And then, again, just -- I know this gets to CECL and the whole spirit of it. But given your commentary and that you just indicated reserve flat, so if the macro outlook progresses within your scenarios and the loss migration progresses as you described here into 2024 of this 2022 vintage, and no other surprises elsewhere, then would you expect accordingly that the reserve at 660 would generally remain around that level in that case? Or could there be incremental upside to the reserve, assuming that macro backdrop remains as they're within the scenario bands.\nJohn Greene: Yes. So, there's -- I appreciate the question. A lot of assumptions in there, but as you laid out, I would expect the overall reserve rates to be relatively close to kind of where they are today.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Carcache with Wolfe Research.\nBill Carcache: First, I wanted to ask if you could give us a sense of what kind of delinquency rates you'd expect based on that 3.5% to 3.9% NCO rate outlook?\nJohn Greene: Yes. I mean we don't typically forecast the delinquency rates. You would -- what I suggest you do is take a look at the trust data and the relative difference between the trust data historically and where the total company is coming out, that will give some insights. And then also, the trends in delinquencies typically are pretty consistent, right? You can go point to point to point. And then I've given some views in terms of where we see the slope starting to flatten and then perhaps spend. So, I'd use that information in order to -- if you're interested in calculating overall delinquency rates for firm.\nBill Carcache: Okay. That's helpful. I guess just the spirit of the question was, there isn't anything unique happening with that increase in charge-offs that would lead to a breakdown between the historical relationship that exists between delinquencies and charge-offs. In other words, the sharp increase that you're expecting in delinquencies -- or sorry, in charge-offs, it would be reasonable to expect sort of a commensurate sharp increase in delinquencies as the data start to come through?\nJohn Greene: Yes, there obviously, a relationship there, certainly. Although remember, you should have -- you should take into account the kind of the vintage impact and what I'll say normal seasoning, right? So, there's $18 billion of incremental loans. Some of those are just going to perform extremely well and a small percentage will season, out as we typically see. So, I would consider that in the analysis, but nothing at it. There should be no substantial break.\nBill Carcache: Okay. And my follow-up is, if I may, I might have missed this, but why did an increase in early-stage delinquencies drive higher credit card NCO rates this quarter. Is my initial thought was that early stage delinquencies would have to flow through the various delinquency buckets before charging off? So what was it following how that early stage increase this quarter impacted NCOs? Just a clarification there would be great.\nJohn Greene: Yes. Yes. Well, there's a couple of different components, right? There is -- there's a bankruptcy bucket. There's a non-bankruptcy bucket that just flows through the buckets. And then there's also the recovery element. So if you put those three together, sometimes the bankruptcy bucket is it will pop in a particular quarter, depending on flow of work in the court system and the non-bankruptcy just flows quarter-over-quarter. So, I would certainly look at this quarter, prior quarter and what comes out in the first quarter, and that will be the insights you're looking for.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mihir Bhatia with Bank of America.\nMihir Bhatia: I wanted to just talk a little bit more about credit. So specifically, I think you mentioned a little bit of mild deterioration in credit among the lower bands. Does your guidance contemplate that stress spreading to your prime core revolver portfolio at all as unemployment increases, I guess said differently, what I'm trying to understand is, do you think we go from credit formalization to deterioration for DFS overall? Or is it just normalization with just the vintage seasoning impacts that we've been talking about?\nJohn Greene: Yes. Thank you. It's the latter. It is normalization and seasoning, which we contemplated fully in both our kind of origination strategy, our reserving strategy and obviously in the guidance we're providing.\nRoger Hochschild: Yes. And maybe just to clarify, the lowest income segments which are a pretty small portion of our base are the ones that get additional pressure from inflation, right? By and large, a prime book can adjust. They trade down, they readjust their pattern. So I think John was referring to incremental stress there. But there's no reason to believe that the vast majority of our portfolio will be driven by the traditional drivers of losses, which is charge-offs -- I'm sorry, which is unemployment.\nMihir Bhatia: Got it. And then, I did want to offer maybe a little bit of a big picture question, just longer term. I think -- we appreciate that you have added a lot of business and increase the earnings power because some of these assets will obviously last a long time past the vintage seasoning. But the portfolio has changed a lot and your guidance for the next year and it sounds like potentially even '24 is a little bit above where credit losses have been running. So maybe just remind us, what is the normal loss rate for DFS or for the card portfolio or something like that? Maybe give us a range. Just trying to understand where a typical portfolio settles out? Is it in that 3%, low 3% range where does that settle up?\nJohn Greene: Yes. Thanks, Mihir. So -- we've been asked that question over the years many, many times. And what I typically refer people back to is, if you take a look at the details of the kind of the charge-off history, you can go back through 2008. And see kind of quarter-over-quarter what's happening on the charge-off front, you can discern kind of normalized charge-off rate from that and then make adjustments for economic periods or kind of vintage-based seasoning.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin Barker with Piper Sandler.\nKevin Barker: And in regards to your employment forecast and your base assumptions, you're pretty clear that the low end, the 3.5% assumes the 4.5% to 5% unemployment rate. But can you help us understand or just confirm that the -- is it the 3.9% higher end of the range, implying a 6% unemployment rate or some other scenario out there within your expectations?\nJohn Greene: Yes. So the high end does not weight the 6% entirely. It actually could reflect a scenario with unemployment is actually higher than the 6%, but it would depend on the depth of it and kind of what industry. So, there's multiple scenarios in there. So, the guidance I provided in terms of 4.5% or over 6% is intended to kind of get the kind of the meat of the scenarios that were contemplated and weighted.\nKevin Barker: Okay. And then with your baseline assumption of 4.5% to 5%, is that something that we make our way to throughout the year and then maintain that level or something where you expected to peak there and then startly drift lower?\nJohn Greene: Yes. So it would run through slowly increase through 2023 and how we've thought about it.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo.\nDon Fandetti: Can you dig in a little bit more on the credit card spend growth rate and kind of what you're seeing in terms of any pattern changes. I think the last update through November showed a little bit of a step-down in the growth rate. And can you talk about December and I think maybe you touched on January?\nRoger Hochschild: Yes. I'll start. January is off to a very strong start. So, we're seeing about a 13% year-over-year growth in sales, and again, reflects the new accounts we put on last year, but also, again, for those who aren't employed a robust environment. We have been seeing increases in the day-to-day category commensurate with inflation and so more spending shifting there. And a lot of what you heard from retailers in terms of softness around home improvement, and hard goods, but a lot of that was just, I think, some of the challenging comparisons to really robust levels from before. So, overall, I'd say, stable, but we're certainly encouraged by what we're seeing so far in January.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Arren Cyganovich with Citi.\nArren Cyganovich: On the marketing outlook, you had indicated that you expect to spend more than 2022 levels, which obviously was a very strong acquisition year for you. What's the thought process there in terms of expecting to increase spend after such a strong year?\nJohn Greene: Yes, great question. And you know what, I'm going to hit kind of give an overview on expenses and now I'll specifically talk about kind of marketing and our thinking there. So, we said overall expenses would increase some less than 10%. So, what that contemplates is a double-digit increase in marketing and single digits for the non-marketing spend. And what that reflects is, we continue to see opportunities to acquire profitable new accounts that are consistent with what we do. So that -- in that prime revolver category. We also are intending to spend some money on the launch of the debit checking product. So that will include dollars for new accounts as well as advertising to bring awareness to the product. And then, it's important to also kind of have a view on the marketing in that this is our guidance. If we see the macroeconomic environment change or we don't see ample opportunity to spend this money wisely then we will make calls in terms of the level of spend, and it could be less than what's -- what we've guided to. But overall, we're very, very pleased with kind of our targeting and the effectiveness of the marketing and gave us confidence to continue to increase that.\nArren Cyganovich: And then on the personal loan side, you had indicated that it's -- it's clear that it's performing better than historically. With respect to the guidance, does the personal loan net charge-off rate, is that expected to go as high as credit cards in 2023? Or are you still expecting it to be somewhat better?\nJohn Greene: Yes. I'm going to stick at the top level of the guidance we provided. And then, we give details by product in the supplement. I would use that information and impute kind of the charge-off rate there. But again, product has been performing very, very well, loss rates significantly below kind of what's happening out in the industry. And it's a kind of a -- it's a prime customer set. So that should give a view of kind of at least a way to think about expectations for that product.\nEric Wasserstrom: So, I think we're going to conclude our call there. Any additional questions, please reach out to the IR team, and thanks very much for joining us this morning.\nOperator: Thank you. This does conclude today's call. We thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.",

            "name": "Roger Hochschild",
            "content": "Thanks, Eric, and thanks to our listeners for joining today's call. I want to begin by reviewing the highlights and key metrics for the year, and then John will take you through the details of our fourth quarter results and our perspectives on 2023. I'm very pleased to say that 2022 was the second strongest year for earnings in our company's history. We reported net income of $1 billion or $3.77 per share for the fourth quarter and $4.4 billion or $15.50 per share for the full year. This was accomplished against a fluid and unusual macroeconomic and monetary policy backdrop and I want to thank the entire Discover team for their solid execution. This performance gives us significant momentum going into 2023 and beyond. I want to give a few highlights that underscore these strong results. First, we grew new accounts by 23% and loan receivables by 20%. This demonstrates the appeal of our consumer value proposition and advancements in our consumer targeting and acquisition capabilities while maintaining our conservative approach to underwriting and credit management. We're also prudently investing for growth, including an acquisition and brand marketing, the continuing build-out of our data and analytic capabilities and increasing field personnel for both servicing and collections, all while achieving a 39% efficiency ratio. The combination of revenue expansion and disciplined cost management contributed to our 31% return on equity this past year and underscores the highly capital-generative nature of our business model. Over the course of 2022, we repurchased $2.4 billion in common stock and increased our dividend by over 20%, and we expect to sustain attractive levels of capital return to our shareholders into the future. As we look into 2023, we expect a less favorable macroeconomic backdrop. Nevertheless, we intend to maintain an appropriate level of investment in our organization. For example, we have several initiatives that will improve our digital marketing capabilities, and we anticipate the broad market launch for mass market cash-back debit product. And of course, we'll continue to invest in our brand and in account acquisition in a manner consistent with the environment. We're very aware of the climate in which we are operating. And should there be changes in economic conditions, we will adjust. Our model with its focus on prime lending and through-the-cycle underwriting has historically supported resilient returns through the economic cycle. These factors, combined with our earnings power, reserves and capital, underpin our strategy of being the leading consumer digital bank. I'll now turn the call over to John to review our results in more detail. Yes. Good question, Sanjay. I think you've seen us operate this business through multiple cycles and the disciplined approach we take both in good times as well as in bad. And frequently, the accounts that you put on during a challenging economic time, perform extraordinarily well, and you can see very good cost per account as competitors pull back. So, we have been pretty clear at that starting in the back half of last year, we started tightening credit standards, and you can expect us to continue to look at that and adjust according to economic conditions, both for new accounts as well as the portfolio. Nevertheless, we're seeing great returns on the marketing investments we're putting out there. And so, that's what gives us the confidence to keep investing in growth. Yes. Thanks Bob. It remains, I would say, intensely competitive. But as you've seen from the growth and especially the performance in new accounts, our value proposition is competing well. And again, I want to give credit to some of the advancements on the analytics that let us sort of personalize the marketing messages across different channels. I guess where competition has lightened a bit is in the personal loan space. I think there are a lot of non-bank funded folks there who may have some challenges on the other side of the balance sheet. And obviously, one big player who had been active is pulling out. On the deposit side, I would see there, I think you're starting to see the gap between the direct banks, the branch banks really get wide enough that you're seeing flows to the direct system, right? It's now at 3.3% for a savings rate. It's now a lot more worth your money. So again, really excited about how our products are competing across every segment. And so that's part of why we're optimistic going into 2023. You're highlighting probably the big launch for next year, which will be the re-launch of cash-back debit and we hope to be doing some mass-market advertising of that. Beyond that, I really believe we have the right product set. We're seeing great demand, for example, on the home equity side, given how rates have moved and the lack of cash-out refi. So I think part of how we keep our costs as low as they are, is a very simple, lean operating model. So I wouldn't expect anything other than the re-launch of the cash-back debit and we'll put a lot of weight behind that. Yes. And maybe just to clarify, the lowest income segments which are a pretty small portion of our base are the ones that get additional pressure from inflation, right? By and large, a prime book can adjust. They trade down, they readjust their pattern. So I think John was referring to incremental stress there. But there's no reason to believe that the vast majority of our portfolio will be driven by the traditional drivers of losses, which is charge-offs -- I'm sorry, which is unemployment. Yes. I'll start. January is off to a very strong start. So, we're seeing about a 13% year-over-year growth in sales, and again, reflects the new accounts we put on last year, but also, again, for those who aren't employed a robust environment. We have been seeing increases in the day-to-day category commensurate with inflation and so more spending shifting there. And a lot of what you heard from retailers in terms of softness around home improvement, and hard goods, but a lot of that was just, I think, some of the challenging comparisons to really robust levels from before. So, overall, I'd say, stable, but we're certainly encouraged by what we're seeing so far in January."

            "name": "John Greene",
            "content": "Thank you, Roger, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with our financial summary results on Slide 4. The takeaway of the quarter is largely about strong asset growth and net interest margin expansion, partially offset by growth-based provisioning. Asset growth combined with a NIM rate improvement, increased revenue 7% sequentially and 27% year-over-year. Similar to last quarter, asset growth also drove an increase in our reserves of $313 million. This increase kept our reserve coverage ratio relatively flat at 6.6%. In the prior year, we released $39 million of reserves. So while our reported net income was down 3% year-over-year, adjusting for the reserve change, our net income would have been 23% higher on a year-over-year basis. Let's review the details starting on Slide 5. Net interest income was up $584 million year-over-year or 24%. Our net interest margin expanded, benefiting from the higher prime rate partially offset by higher funding costs and increased promotional balances. NIM ended the quarter at 11.27%, up 46 basis points from the prior year and 22 basis points sequentially. For the full year, NIM was 11.04%, up 28 basis points from the prior year. Receivable growth was driven by card which increased 21% year-over-year, reflecting continued strong sales, new account growth and payment rate moderation. Sales increased 8% in the period, a deceleration from the 15% growth we experienced in the prior quarter and the 20% in the first half of the year. New card accounts grew by 17% from last year's fourth quarter. Similar to the prior quarter, the sales growth decline was mitigated by a decrease in the payment rate, which fell 150 basis points in the quarter. We expect payment rates to continue to decline through 2023, but at a more moderate pace. Turning to our non-card products. Organic student loans increased 4% as a result of peak season originations. Personal loans were up 15%. We continue to stay disciplined in our approach to marketing, underwriting and pricing of this product. Our attractive value proposition has positioned us well in the market that is experiencing strong consumer demand and some improvement in competitive conditions. In terms of funding mix, our customer deposit balances were up 10% year-over-year and 5% sequentially. Deposit pricing continues to be in line with what we expected in a rising rate environment. Recently, we have seen some moderation in the pace of pricing changes. Looking at other revenue on Slide 6. Non-interest income increased $212 million or 47%. This was partially due to a $138 million loss on our equity investments in the prior year quarter, compared to a $6 million loss this quarter. Adjusting for these, our non-interest income was up 14%. This increase was primarily driven by two items. First, loan fee income was up $51 million or 39%, driven by volume. And second, we had higher net discount and interchange revenue, which was up $23 million or 7% reflecting strong sales and a favorable sales mix, partially offset by higher rewards costs. Moving to expenses on Slide 7. Total operating expenses were up $183 million or 14% year-over-year and up 8% from the prior quarter. Compensation costs were up primarily due to increased headcount and wage inflation. Marketing expenses increased $42 million or 15% as we continue to prudently invest for growth in our card in consumer banking products. Premise and equipment expense was elevated this quarter due to a onetime write-off related to the exit of our Phoenix servicing location. Adjusting for this, premise and equipment would have been flat to the prior year quarter. With this recent action, we have resized or exited three of our four major call center locations, and we'll continue to evaluate our footprint going forward. Moving to credit performance on Slide 8. Total net charge-offs were 2.13%, 76 basis points higher than the prior year and up 42 basis points from the prior quarter. In the card portfolio, the net charge-off rate of 2.37% was 87 basis points higher than the prior year and 45 basis points higher sequentially. As expected, portfolio loss rates are normalizing, reflecting seasoning of new account vintages from the past two years, normalization of older vintages and mild deterioration and low credit bands, largely inflation-driven. These trends are within our expected risk tolerances and are consistent with our historical approach to underwriting and credit management. Among our core prime revolver segment, we don't see evidence of broader stress given the robust labor market. I'll cover our 2023 view in a moment. Turning to the discussions of our allowance on Slide 9. This quarter, we increased our allowance by $313 million driven by the increase in receivable balances. Our reserve rate declined slightly to 6.6%. Adjusting for the elevated level of transactor balances in the fourth quarter, our reserve rate would have been near sequentially flat. Under the CECL accounting standard, we are required to contemplate life of loan losses and adjust our reserve levels accordingly. For us, the changes to employment conditions pose the most significant risk to our forecast. For the year-end 2022 reserve, our baseline assumption was unemployment in 2023 between 4.5% and 6.5% and with alternative scenarios above 6%. Looking at Slide 10. Our common equity Tier 1 for the period was 13.3%. Our longer-term target remains at 10.5%. We expect to make progress against this target over the next four to six quarters. Yesterday, we announced a quarterly common dividend of $0.60 per share. And in the fourth quarter of 2022, we repurchased $602 million of common stock. Concluding on Slide 11 with our outlook. Momentum is strong, which should help to generate double-digit revenue growth and positive operating leverage. We expect end-of-period loan growth to be in the low double digits with average loan growth somewhat higher. This is driven by three factors: our prior year growth in new accounts moderation in the payment rate and sales volume trends. Through mid-January, sales are up 13%, but we expect deceleration to the high single digits over the course of the year. We expect net interest margin to be modestly higher than the full year 2022 levels. More specifically, we expect NIM to be above the fourth quarter levels in the first half of the year driven by continued loan re-pricing benefits and decline in the second half. We are looking for total operating expenses to increase less than 10%. Salary and benefit expense will increase due to hiring in the second half of 2022. Additionally, we expect marketing to be above our full year 2022 level. We expect net charge-offs will average between 3.5% and 3.9% for the full year. The low end of the range is more in line with our base case, while the high end is more consistent with a weaker employment scenario. Lastly, we have $2.8 billion of remaining capacity under the $4.2 billion share repurchase program that expires in June of this year. We expect to repurchase around $2.2 billion of shares in the first half of 2023. We'll provide an update on future share repurchase authorizations after we complete our stress testing process and review recommendations with our Board. In summary, receivable growth continued to benefit from new account acquisition, payment rate moderation and positive sales. NIM continues to benefit from prime rate increases with funding costs consistent with expectations and credit is performing in line with our approach through-the-cycle underwriting process and conservative credit management. Our perspectives for 2023 reflect our focus on advancing our strategic priorities generating high returns and capital while remaining disciplined in our credit and expense management. With that, I'll turn the call back over to our operator to open the line for Q&A. Yes. Great. Yes. Thanks for the question, Moshe. So the range is some unlocked, right? 3.5% to 3.9% for '23. And -- we certainly have a great deal of visibility through the first six months of the year through a roll rate methodology. Post six months, so in the second half of the year, we use our analytical models which anticipate a number of different possible outcomes but used as historical data that's been tested significantly to make a projection of what we expect to happen. So as we get through the first quarter, we'll be able to see what's happening with our roll rates in terms of is it a roll to one bucket and the roll to two bucket, consistent with our expectations on the base case on the reserve. Beyond that, we'll certainly look at the macro environment and what's happening with unemployment levels and the overall job market. That will give us some perspective. And then an important component of this, and I know there was some questions in terms of the step-up from where we ended '22 to where we're projecting '23. We have fairly significant vintages that are going through the normal seasoning process right now. So for example, our end-of-period card portfolio, so last year 12/31 to this year 12/31 increased by $15.7 billion. And if you think about kind of a maturity cycle of a credit card, typically within the first year to two years, you hit peak losses. So that is some of what we're expecting here, and therefore, the guidance that we've provided. We do expect that in a stable macroeconomic environment, in the second half of the year, we should see this slope of the curve begin to bend down a little bit with perhaps top losses coming through in '24 and then returning down. So overall, what we're seeing here is just a strong portfolio, very significant vintages that came through in '21 and '22 that are seasoning at levels that were -- that are completely within our expectation of total return thresholds. And then, we'll see the overall portfolio normalized. So hopefully, that provides some clarity on both the trajectory as well as what we're seeing in the portfolio. Yes, great question. And they're connected, so happy to cover them in the same set. So CECL reflects life of loan losses as we all know, right? And so, what drives that is the portfolio performance and the -- our view of the macroeconomic environment today and going forward. And we haven't had any substantial changes to the macroeconomic environment. And essentially, the portfolio is performing within our expected ranges of outcomes. So, as we look at the fourth quarter receivable balances in the aggregate, and the portfolio performance, a stable macro, we felt most appropriate reserve levels would be fairly consistent with what we did in the third quarter. And essentially, without taking you through a ton of detail that the teams spend weeks and weeks working through, that's essentially how we arrived at the answer. Yes. So in terms of the impact of the vintages, I explicitly called out the card vintage in 2022, so the $15.7 billion to give the folks that are listening here, a place to anchor on in terms of thinking about the vintage and then you can run out peak losses for our portfolio in terms of what typically happens after a significant vintage and in a stable macro. So that should help you at least in terms of the thinking in terms of the vintage. As we think about this year, we gave that range of 3.5% to 3.9% on the loan base -- on the average loan base. So you should think about the ultimate kind of range here. It will depend first on the macro. Second, we'll continue to give updates in each of the quarters in terms of what we're seeing. But ultimately, we expect this vintage will mature in 2024. And then, we should see in a stable macro, the curve not only slope pending, but actually inverting slightly. Yes. So in our kind of primary case here, we assumed a 100 basis points increase in unemployment. Now that that was specific to our charge-off forecast. In terms of kind of reserve levels, we actually used a composite of multiple scenarios. The more heavily weighted scenario reflected a loss rate of 4.5% and then going up all the way to 6%. So, I'm feeling actually like we're down the middle here in terms of appropriateness in terms of overall reserve levels and more specificity in terms of sensitivity. I don't think that would be a service given if we're seeing unemployment kind of creep up in that sort of matter or that sort of quantum that would indicate that the macro environment has changed, and we have to change our view on that, which could change our perspectives on life of loan losses. Yes. Yes. So I'm going to run through the primary drivers. So first would be the Fed rate changes in the second half of '22 as well as what we've anticipated either two or three increases in 2023. Second impact is the yield on our investments, which is improving with the increase in the rate environment. And then, the third piece has been some pricing actions we took in the consumer banking products. So, think about the non-card products. So offsetting that would be kind of the cost of funding. So DTC and external funding costs have increased. And then we're also anticipating an impact from credit, all of which the net of those gives us a high level of confidence that certainly, we're going to see peak NIM in the first quarter and then stepping down from there through 2023. Yes. So you were right on your call here. We gave a range for 2023 of 3.5% to 3.9%. I talked about the curve and what we think will happen to the curve and the slope of that. So, Mark, as a matter of prudence, I think that's probably as far as I'm going to go here. Yes. So typically, we'll see it around 18 months. And it varies based on credit quality. So, the highest credit quality. So, I think FICO would typically peak a little later. And then the weaker, I'll say, the weaker credits typically peak a little bit earlier. But on average, I think, about 18 months or so. Yes. So -- the first part of that answer would be it would depend on the vintage. So if you go back to our 2020 vintage and remember, there's COVID, right, we were locked down. We ceased underwriting kind of the near prime and lower prime and concentrated on upper prime that vintage will season at a peak loss level below what Discover historically has done. If you look at '21, '22, we were essentially back to an underwriting standard consistent with history. And you can use that information to get some level of comfort around what can be expected in '24 on this vintage. It is. Yes. Yes. The one difference that I think is important for folks to codify in their minds is that we're coming off an abnormally low base, right? So the entire portfolio is normalizing. We've talked about that consistently actually, since the beginning of last year that we thought the portfolio was normalizing. And what you're seeing here in the 2023 guidance is essentially the portfolio normalizing. Yes. Otherwise, my controller would have taken an exception to our reserve process. Yes. Although what we're seeing in personal loans is, again, loss rates below historical norms. Payment rate is beginning to normalize. And we had talked about the fact that we perhaps overcorrected on that product in terms of underwriting, in terms of the pullback. We pulled back significantly. So I expect some seasoning and normalization there. But again, we're very, very confident about the loss performance of that product. We understand where it is on the payment priorities for folks. So we're going to be mindful of the economy on that. And student loans, yes, that's normalizing. We did have and likely we'll have a little bit of impact when we see the full impact of the student debtors on the government programs having to pay back loans, but it's underwritten to a high standard. 80-plus percent have cosigners. So, we feel very comfortable about that product as well. Yes. So good question, Rick. So we've referenced CECL day one in the past, but I'd like to remind folks, day one was first time we rolled this new standard out. We were using new models. They've been tested extensively. And the macros were late cycle with higher unemployment levels. So as we look at kind of where we are today or as of the fourth quarter, right, 6.58 in terms of total loss reserve rate. That seems appropriate based on kind of what we're seeing in the macros and how the portfolio is performing. So, do we specifically reference day one only from the standpoint of where it was back on January 1, 2020, to where it is today, but we don't use that as a decision point whatsoever. Yes. No, no, they're not lower. We're looking at the portfolio performance. It's performed extraordinarily well. We're seeing a bit of seasoning now, as you would expect in this type of product. And the macros are contemplating a minimum level of increase in unemployment of at least 0.5% and more likely 1%. So what you're seeing here is a CECL reserve for the quarter that reflects those macros. Yes. Thanks, John. Actually, no surprises in the portfolio performance whatsoever, and I want to reiterate that. And that's essentially why the reserve rate is flat, right? So, they are connected. So what that says is that charge-off guidance was essentially contemplated in the reserving of life of loan losses. So, we feel very good about that and there is consistency. I did talk about in my prepared remarks that the lowest end of the credit spectrum that we have in our portfolio. So some near-prime and some folks without FICO scores or those who fell below 660 are certainly feeling the impact from inflation. But internally, we completely anticipated that we had run some analysis on inflation shocks and what it would do to some of the card members, and it's performing essentially where we thought it would come out. So I'm actually quite pleased about that. The other important thing that I want to make sure that the audience here is I think what 2022 did for us is it increased the earnings power of the firm. And there's a lot of focus from these questions on kind of the charge-off and peak good assets consistent with what we've done historically. So loans increased $18 billion. So, there's going to be some seasoning, but overall, the earnings power of the firm has increased as a result of great execution by our teams. Yes. So, there's -- I appreciate the question. A lot of assumptions in there, but as you laid out, I would expect the overall reserve rates to be relatively close to kind of where they are today. Yes. I mean we don't typically forecast the delinquency rates. You would -- what I suggest you do is take a look at the trust data and the relative difference between the trust data historically and where the total company is coming out, that will give some insights. And then also, the trends in delinquencies typically are pretty consistent, right? You can go point to point to point. And then I've given some views in terms of where we see the slope starting to flatten and then perhaps spend. So, I'd use that information in order to -- if you're interested in calculating overall delinquency rates for firm. Yes, there obviously, a relationship there, certainly. Although remember, you should have -- you should take into account the kind of the vintage impact and what I'll say normal seasoning, right? So, there's $18 billion of incremental loans. Some of those are just going to perform extremely well and a small percentage will season, out as we typically see. So, I would consider that in the analysis, but nothing at it. There should be no substantial break. Yes. Yes. Well, there's a couple of different components, right? There is -- there's a bankruptcy bucket. There's a non-bankruptcy bucket that just flows through the buckets. And then there's also the recovery element. So if you put those three together, sometimes the bankruptcy bucket is it will pop in a particular quarter, depending on flow of work in the court system and the non-bankruptcy just flows quarter-over-quarter. So, I would certainly look at this quarter, prior quarter and what comes out in the first quarter, and that will be the insights you're looking for. Yes. Thank you. It's the latter. It is normalization and seasoning, which we contemplated fully in both our kind of origination strategy, our reserving strategy and obviously in the guidance we're providing. Yes. Thanks, Mihir. So -- we've been asked that question over the years many, many times. And what I typically refer people back to is, if you take a look at the details of the kind of the charge-off history, you can go back through 2008. And see kind of quarter-over-quarter what's happening on the charge-off front, you can discern kind of normalized charge-off rate from that and then make adjustments for economic periods or kind of vintage-based seasoning. Yes. So the high end does not weight the 6% entirely. It actually could reflect a scenario with unemployment is actually higher than the 6%, but it would depend on the depth of it and kind of what industry. So, there's multiple scenarios in there. So, the guidance I provided in terms of 4.5% or over 6% is intended to kind of get the kind of the meat of the scenarios that were contemplated and weighted. Yes. So it would run through slowly increase through 2023 and how we've thought about it. Yes, great question. And you know what, I'm going to hit kind of give an overview on expenses and now I'll specifically talk about kind of marketing and our thinking there. So, we said overall expenses would increase some less than 10%. So, what that contemplates is a double-digit increase in marketing and single digits for the non-marketing spend. And what that reflects is, we continue to see opportunities to acquire profitable new accounts that are consistent with what we do. So that -- in that prime revolver category. We also are intending to spend some money on the launch of the debit checking product. So that will include dollars for new accounts as well as advertising to bring awareness to the product. And then, it's important to also kind of have a view on the marketing in that this is our guidance. If we see the macroeconomic environment change or we don't see ample opportunity to spend this money wisely then we will make calls in terms of the level of spend, and it could be less than what's -- what we've guided to. But overall, we're very, very pleased with kind of our targeting and the effectiveness of the marketing and gave us confidence to continue to increase that. Yes. I'm going to stick at the top level of the guidance we provided. And then, we give details by product in the supplement. I would use that information and impute kind of the charge-off rate there. But again, product has been performing very, very well, loss rates significantly below kind of what's happening out in the industry. And it's a kind of a -- it's a prime customer set. So that should give a view of kind of at least a way to think about expectations for that product."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Third Quarter 2022 Discover Financial Services Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Mr. Eric Wasserstrom, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nEric Wasserstrom: Thank you, Katie and good morning everyone. Welcome to today\u2019s call. I\u2019ll begin on Slide 2 of our earnings presentation, which you can find in the financial section of our Investor Relations website, investorrelations.discover.com. Our discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties and that may cause actual results to differ materially. Please refer to our notices regarding forward-looking statements that appear in our third quarter\u2019s earnings release, press release and presentation. Our call today will include remarks from our CEO, Roger Hochschild; and John Greene, our Chief Financial Officer. After we conclude our formal comments, there will be time for a question-and-answer session. During the Q&A session, you will be permitted to ask one question followed by one follow-up question. After your follow-up question, please return to the queue. Now, it\u2019s my pleasure to turn the call over to Roger.\nRoger Hochschild: Thanks, Eric and thanks to our listeners for joining today\u2019s call. I\u2019m very pleased with our results this quarter. Against a fluid macroeconomic backdrop, we generate strong financial performance while continuing to advance our strategic priorities. Let\u2019s start with a summary on Slide 3. For the third quarter, we reported net income of $1 billion after tax or $3.54 per share. Over the past three months, as Fed policy has become more restrictive, it has made fears of a recession more acute. Against this backdrop, the key narratives of the third quarter results are the strength of our balance sheet and the quality of our earnings. Our increase in revenues this year has been largely driven by our strong receivables growth with loans up 17% year-over-year. This growth was driven largely by elevated sales volume and the increased number of new accounts we\u2019ve added since mid-2021. We continue to use a through-the-cycle approach to underwriting, which considers all stages of a credit cycle, including downturns. As part of our conservative credit management, we marginally tightened our new account underwriting criteria this quarter. Given these factors, we consider our growth to be consistent with current macroeconomic conditions. Naturally, discussion of \u2013 session of elicits concerns about credit quality, but the credit performance of our loan portfolio at this stage does not suggest anything other than gradual normalization. Nonetheless, a late-cycle environment requires a particular awareness of changing conditions and underscores the importance of our strong financial condition. We also continue to advance our strategic priorities. As a few examples, in August, we expanded our global presence with the signing of Woori Card of the largest issuers in South Korea. The extension of this relationship as well as the number of new network partnerships we\u2019ve announced this year highlight our focus on expanding our international presence. We continue to demonstrate the value of our network and our growing relationships with fintech partners. As an example, we announced in October that we will facilitate payments for TYDEi\u2019s new healthcare vendor management system, which will digitize and streamline payments in an industry where legacy purchasing is still primarily manual. Finally, this summer, we announced the opening of our new Advanced Analytics Resource Center at our downtown Chicago location. The first cohort of 75 individuals, which we selected from over 1,000 applicants has already started, and we intend to grow the program with an additional cohort in 2023. This follows the grand opening of our customer care center in the South Side neighborhood of Chatham earlier this year and underscores our commitment to bring additional jobs to Chicago while supporting great customer experiences. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to John to review our results in more detail.\nJohn Greene: Thank you, Roger, and good morning, everyone. I\u2019ll start with our financial summary results on Slide 4. There were three important trends in the quarter: strong asset growth, net interest margin expansion and modest credit normalization. The strength in asset growth, combined with a NIM rate improvement increased revenue 8% sequentially and 25% year-over-year. Asset growth resulted in an increase in our reserves under CECL of $304 million, but our reserve coverage ratio declined slightly. So while our reported net income was down 8% year-over-year, adjusting for the reserve change, our net income would have been 28% higher on a year-over-year basis. Let\u2019s review the details starting on Slide 5. Net interest income was up $438 million year-over-year or 18%, driven by higher average receivables and improved net interest margin. We achieved a record high NIM rate of 11.05%, up 25 basis points from the prior year and 11 basis points sequentially. On both a year-over-year and sequential basis, the increase in net interest margin primarily reflects the higher prime rate, partially offset by higher funding costs and increased promotional and balance transfers. Receivable growth was driven by card, which increased 19% year-over-year, reflecting continued strong sales and the contribution from new accounts growth last year and into this year. Sales growth was 15% in the period, a deceleration from the 20% growth we experienced in the first half of the year. As anticipated, the sales decline was partially mitigated by a decrease in the payment rate, which fell 70 basis points in the quarter. Nonetheless, it remains more than 400 basis points over 2019 levels. We expect payment rate to continue to decline through the back half of 2023, which should help support receivable growth. Turning to our non-card products, organic student loans increased 4% as a result of peak season originations. Personal loans were up 11%, the growth reflects our disciplined approach to marketing, underwriting and pricing of this product, which we believe has created an attractive competitive position for us in the market, particularly relative to some non-bank originators. In terms of funding mix, our customer deposit balances were up 4% year-over-year and 2% sequentially. So far, deposit pricing has been in line with what we expected in a rising rate environment. As we mentioned last quarter, our strong asset growth has caused deposits to various proportion of our funding mix, but we continue to target 70% to 80% deposit funding over the medium term. We also issued $2 billion of card ABS fixed notes in the quarter and booked $5 billion of broker deposits. We maintain broad access to a variety of funding sources, enabling us to confidently fund our asset growth. Looking at other revenue on Slide 6. Non-interest income increased $264 million or 71%. This was partially due to a $157 million loss on our equity investments in the prior year quarter compared to a $4 million loss this quarter. Adjusting for these, our non-interest income was up 19%. This was driven by higher net discount and interchange revenue, which was up $47 million or 16%, reflecting strong sales and favorable sales mix, partially offset by higher rewards costs. Similar to last quarter, we estimate that inflation contributed between 200 basis points and 250 basis points of sales growth in the period. The strong sales also drove higher reward expenses. Consistent with the prior quarter, our rewards rate increased 3 basis points year-over-year, driven by substantial growth in new accounts, increasing the cost of our cash back program. Year-to-date, our rewards rate is up 2 basis points, consistent with our expectation of 2 basis points to 4 basis points of annual reward rate inflation. Moving to expenses on Slide 7. Total operating expenses were up $198 million or 17% year-over-year and up 13% from the prior quarter. Compensation costs were up primarily due to increased headcount. Our servicing organization is a key component of our value proposition. We expect to grow this as our accounts and assets expand. This will contribute to an increase in salary and wages through the end of this year and into next year. Marketing expenses increased $66 million or 31% as we continue to invest for growth in our card and consumer banking products. We grew new card accounts by 22% from last year\u2019s third quarter. Professional fees increased $43 million or 22% as a result of investments in technology and increased consulting costs. We also had additional fraud costs in the consumer bank, driven by increased volumes as well as some legal expense elevating our other expense category in the quarter. Moving to credit performance on Slide 8. Total net charge-offs were 1.71% or 25 basis points higher than the prior year, but down 9 basis points from the prior quarter. Total net charge-off dollars were up $114 million from the prior year and only up $10 million sequentially. In the card portfolio, the net charge-off rate of 1.92% was 27 basis points higher than the prior year and 9 basis points lower sequentially. Similar to our commentary from last quarter, we are not seeing evidence of emerging credit stress beyond normal expected normalization. Delinquencies among our lower prime segment have been normalized, but in upper prime delinquencies and charge-offs remain below pre-pandemic levels. This is consistent with our baseline expectation that credit will continue to normalize over the next several quarters\u2019 absence a change in macro conditions. Turning to the discussion of our allowance on Slide 9. This past quarter, we increased our allowance by $304 million due to higher receivable balances. Our reserve rate modestly declined to 6.7%. For us, changes through \u2013 to employment conditions pose the most significant risk to loss levels. As part of our reserving process, we have considered the prospects of higher unemployment among a range of macroeconomic scenarios and is reflected in our reserve balance. Looking at Slide 10. Our common equity Tier 1 for the period was 13.9%. The strong asset growth was a primary driver of the approximate 30 basis point decline from the prior period. Our long-term target remains 10.5%. In terms of capital return, we declared a quarterly common dividend of $0.60 per share and repurchased $212 million of common stock in the period before we decided to temporarily suspend our buyback activity. Concluding on Slide 11. As we look at the last quarter of the year, our prospects for 2022 remain favorable, and we are once again improving elements of our expectations. We are revising our view on loan growth to high teens, continued strong sales, new account acquisitions through the third quarter and some recent improvements in the payment rates support our confidence in the outlook. In terms of NIM, we expect the full year to be mildly above the high end of our expected range with sequential margin improvement in the fourth quarter based on rate hikes that happened in late September. We are revising our expense outlook to be up high single digits versus the prior year, driven by increased marketing and compensation costs. In line with previous communications, we still expect marketing costs to come in above 2019 levels as we\u2019ve discussed. We expect to add headcount, which will elevate salary and wages as well as benefit expense. Excluding these two categories, expenses are expected to increase by low single digits. We now expect net charge-offs to be between 1.8% and 1.9% for the full year, driven by lower-than-expected credit losses through this point in the year. Our temporary pause on share repurchases remains in place, but we hope to resume share repurchases before year-end. In summary, receivable growth accelerated as we continue to benefit from elevated sales, strong new account acquisitions and improvements in the payment rate. NIM continues to benefit from prime rate increases. Funding costs are consistent with expectations and credit performance is slowly normalizing, reflecting our disciplined approach to underwriting and credit management. These results demonstrate the resiliency of our integrated digital banking and payments model. Our earnings power, coupled with our strong balance sheet and capital position, keeps us well positioned for continued profitable growth through a range of economic conditions. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call back to our operator, Katie, to open the line for Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll take our first question from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nRyan Nash: Hey, good morning guys.\nRoger Hochschild: Good morning.\nRyan Nash: So maybe to start on the net interest margin John, you commented that it implies another uptick given the rate hikes that we saw at the end of the quarter. Can you maybe just talk about where we go from here on the margin? I think last quarter; you talked about it potentially peaking out. I\u2019m just curious; do you think you can continue to hold their line around these levels? And maybe what is incorporated within that in terms of deposit betas and the like?\nJohn Greene: Great. Okay. Thanks for the question, Ryan. There\u2019s a lot there. So, let me start with the fundamentals that we\u2019re seeing. So the liability side of the balance sheet is certainly subjected to increases in deposit funding costs as a result of competitive actions and general needs across the market to attract some deposits. With that said, the 11% plus we delivered in the third quarter; we do expect some upside from that as a result of the Fed hikes in September. So certainly, sequentially into the fourth quarter, we\u2019ll see further improvement. Now, beyond the \u2013 excuse me, beyond into the fourth quarter \u2013 we\u2019ll see improvement. Beyond the fourth quarter at this point, we\u2019re going to reserve any commentary. But what I would say is, we don\u2019t expect any specific, I\u2019ll say, seismic changes to net interest margins in 2023 based on the stability of our funding base and turn access to multiple sources of funds.\nRyan Nash: Got it. Thanks for the color. Roger, maybe one for you. You mentioned you guys are marginally tightening on account acquisition. Can you maybe just give additional color regarding some of the changes you\u2019re making to underwriting? And what do you think this might mean for growth over the intermediate term? Thanks.\nRoger Hochschild: Sure. So, I would start by saying, in general, it remains a very good environment. We\u2019re seeing cost per account on the prime side below what we had last year. The value proposition is resonating well. For the new account space at the margin, we tightened some of those segments that will be most volatile in a downturn. So, I think the lower end of prime. And we\u2019re ready to take further action on new accounts or the portfolio side. But again, I\u2019d say overall, a very good environment, and that\u2019s part of why you\u2019re seeing such strong growth.\nRyan Nash: Got it. Appreciate the color.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.\nMoshe Orenbuch: Great. Thanks. I was hoping maybe you could talk for a little bit of a different tack. Maybe talk a little bit about the competitive environment and what you\u2019re seeing from a credit standpoint and from a competitive marketing standpoint, kind of, in your two installment loan businesses, both in the personal loan business and the student loan business and maybe talk about that and the outlook there for a moment?\nRoger Hochschild: Yes. So it is hard Moshe to know what individual competitors are doing. I would say in general, most of them are much broader spectrum lenders than we are. And so my guess is we\u2019d be seeing some stress at the lower ends of their books. For us, a rising rate environment creates a lot of focus on debt consolidation, which is the primary use of our personal loans. So, we\u2019re maintaining a very disciplined credit criteria by seeing strong originations in that segment.\nMoshe Orenbuch: Got it. Thanks. It is interesting. I mean, I think we\u2019ve seen that for others that are at the higher end of the credit spectrum where the stress you\u2019re talking about we do see at the lower end. Follow-up question that I had is, you talked about hoping to restart the buyback by year-end or so, a little bit growth kind of causing a 30 basis point downtick in your capital, but you\u2019re still well above. Just talk about, I guess, the appetite for that given \u2013 and does the kind of macro environment figure into that? Just talk about the appetite for the buyback once that restarts? Thanks.\nJohn Greene: Yes. Sure. Moshe, I\u2019ll take that. So from a overall capital level, we are very well capitalized, right? So, we\u2019re 13% approaching, 14% on the CET1. Our target is 10.5%. The credit book has been very, very stable. It\u2019s normalizing, but overall, very, very stable. So the capital allocation priorities through the firm remain in place. So first is to invest in strong organic growth, second would be a return of capital, and then third, perhaps a bolt-on acquisition, and we\u2019re going to do that will likely be in the Payments segment. So overall, those priorities didn\u2019t change. So the suspension remains in place, but we\u2019re hopeful that it will resume \u2013 buybacks will resume here in the fourth quarter.\nMoshe Orenbuch: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Your line is now open.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Thanks. Good morning. John, I wanted to just walk through the expense guide increase. You mentioned it\u2019s a blend of marketing and comp costs. Could you just parse apart what part is \u2013 how much of each sort of contributed to the increase? And I\u2019m just trying to put the marketing comments to slightly pulling back the credit box. And then as far as like the headcount increases, was that related to the growth? I\u2019m just trying to figure out what changed in terms of the comp cost?\nJohn Greene: Yes. Yes, happy to help with that, Sanjay. So let me provide some context upfront here. So year-to-date total expenses are up 7%. Comp expense is up 5%, and excluding marketing, our expense base year-to-date is up 2%. So actually really, really what I\u2019ll say first half of the year and into this quarter some strong fundamentals. Now, we did have a significant growth in the asset base, which of course, means that there are accounts that we\u2019re going to have to service. And you might have seen a press release that came out that indicated we were hiring about 2,000 servicing agents through the balance of this year and into next year depending on the balance sheet and our customer value proposition and metrics. So overall, the strong growth and the strong acquisition has necessitated investments in our people. We\u2019ll continue to do that. We\u2019ve also made specific investments in information technology, specifically around resources advanced analytics in order to further position us to be able to grow profitably and then also enhance underwriting and customer targeting. So, we believe all those investments make perfect sense for the long term. And what you\u2019re seeing here in the third quarter is a combination of what I\u2019ll say is a tough comp as a result of some turnover last year. And then us coming on with backfilling resources, what I\u2019ll say is salaried resources as well as the investments I talked about in terms of customer service. So hopefully, that provides some context and color to your question.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. And then I know we\u2019re trying to read between the lines in terms of the student loan servicing inquiry or investigation that\u2019s going on. But just to be clear, there is no change to how you guys are thinking about it relative to last quarter. And as far as the expenses are concerned, it seems like things are progressing as you expected it to and it\u2019s just a matter of timing. Is that a correct statement?\nJohn Greene: Yes, that is a correct statement. So no change. Obviously, when we have some news to share, we\u2019re going to share it. The expense guidance we provided and the updates reflect those items I discussed on your previous question and no specific changes related to expenses related to the buybacks as mentioned.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Okay. Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from John Hecht with Jefferies. Your line is now open.\nJohn Hecht: Good morning guys. Actually, most of my questions have been asked, and I was going to ask one about marketing. But maybe since you addressed the spend patterns, maybe can you talk about \u2013 just because it\u2019s a topic that we haven\u2019t really talked about in detail recently your perspective on rewards and the competitive environment around rewards and what that means for the intermediate term?\nRoger Hochschild: Yes. Sure. So a lot of the most intense competition on rewards is in the super prime segment, and we\u2019ve talked over the last year or two, how we think some of the propositions issuers are putting out aren\u2019t necessarily sustainable in the long run. As John mentioned, our rewards costs are moving up exactly as we forecast. We haven\u2019t felt the need to make any structural changes to our program. So as you can see from the growth in the new accounts, our value proposition competes very well in that prime revolver segment. And so while the market is always competitive, we bring a differentiated value proposition that resonates well with consumers.\nJohn Hecht: Okay. And then second question is maybe thinking about like a 2021 cohort, and I know it\u2019s probably early for the 2022 cohort, but what can you tell us in terms of how they\u2019re seasoning utilization rates and kind of delinquency seasoning? Is there \u2013 is it back to what it looked like in 2019? Or is there something different that\u2019s worth pointing out with respect to more recent vintages?\nRoger Hochschild: Yes. I would say more recent vintages are performing exactly in line with our expectations, right? I mean every vintage got distorted during the pandemic. So you saw it cut across the curves. But again, we feel very good about the performance.\nJohn Hecht: Okay. Thank you guys.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from John Pancari with Evercore. Your line is now open.\nJohn Pancari: Good morning.\nRoger Hochschild: Good morning.\nJohn Pancari: On the efficiency ratio came in around 40% for the third quarter. And just given the commentary that you gave around the investments that you\u2019re making and your expense expectations, can you maybe help us think about how that could shape up for the fourth quarter, and more importantly into 2023, how we could think about the trajectory there? Thanks.\nJohn Greene: Yes. John thanks for the question. So, what we said in the past and what we\u2019ve told our Board and what we\u2019re targeting is an efficiency ratio in the high 30s [ph]. And through this year, we\u2019ve done a pretty good job in terms of being able to deliver that. Certainly the really strong growth and the great performance through the first half on expense \u2013 on the expense base. And then the third quarter reflects some investments and despite those investments, still below 40%. We\u2019re going to continue to make investments where we see an opportunity to drive great returns for our shareholders. And as we approach 2023, we are aware that the economic environment is a little tougher. We do feel like we have remaining tailwinds in terms of asset growth and we do have investments we\u2019re going to continue to make. So, I would say for 2023 specifically, we will come out in January to give more specific details. But the overall commitments remain in place, commitment to positive operating leverage and efficiency ratio south of 40% and expense discipline while investing for growth.\nJohn Pancari: Okay. Thank you. That\u2019s helpful. And then on the reserve front, just wanted to get your take on how you see that trajecting here? I know you allowed the reserve to bleed a bit in terms of the ratio this quarter. But now as you\u2019re seeing some of the normalization that you indicated and some of the pressure on delinquencies, how should we think about the reserve as you look here, particularly as you factor in the economic conditions and how you\u2019re looking at the economy, the impact on the economy plays out? Thanks.\nJohn Greene: Yes. Great. Yes, thanks for that question. So a little bit of context there. So, we put on about $5.5 billion to $5.6 billion worth of assets in the quarter. Our reserves increased by $304 million. So, as we look at the portfolio and the macro environment, we\u2019re seeing the portfolio continuing to be very, very stable but normalizing. The macro environment indications of a recession are certainly increasing. Roger mentioned in his comments about some mild \u2013 in his comments about some mild tightening. So in terms of expectation around reserves, we\u2019ll continue to take a look at the macros. We\u2019ll run multiple scenarios and then make sure the balance sheet, the portfolio specifically continues to perform as anticipated and will make appropriate calls for reserves under GAAP. It\u2019s really tough to give any specific guidance on that other than we\u2019re going to be mindful of the macros, continue to watch the portfolio, and that prime revolver targeting we do, tends to add high-level stability. As matter of fact one other point that may be useful not specific to reserves, but rather charge-offs. You have to go all the way back to the second quarter of 2011 to see charge-offs that \u2013 charge-off rates that is north of 4%. So, we\u2019re seeing great stability this year, and we expect it to be stable next year as well.\nJohn Pancari: Got it. Okay, thanks for taking my questions.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nBetsy Graseck: Hi, good morning.\nRoger Hochschild: Good morning.\nBetsy Graseck: I just wanted to see if I could get you to unpack your statement on no seismic changes in 2023. Maybe we could speak a little bit about how you\u2019re thinking \u2013 and I know you just detailed a little bit, but how you\u2019re thinking about how the loan yield should traject. I know in the slide deck, you called out that the loan yield was driven by prime obviously, but with a partial offset from higher promotional mix and the timing of pricing changes. Could you help us understand how that works? How much the promo mix and the timing impacted loan yields and how you\u2019re thinking about that trajecting as we continue to go through a Fed rate hike period here?\nJohn Greene: Okay. Yes. So there\u2019s a lot there. And as you know, it\u2019s fairly complex Betsy, but I\u2019ll do my best to create some transparency here. So \u2013 and let me start with the loan yields. So 80% of our book is floating rate of the asset side. So as the Fed increases, that creates the opportunity to move the contract rate up with the Fed changes. And correspondingly, if the Fed were to come down, the contract rate would come down. So, what we\u2019re seeing there is in a rising rate environment. We still expect 3 basis points to 5 basis points of yield improvement. So net interest margin yield improvement over a 12-month period. So, we saw significant increases in September. It looks like based on the forward curve, there\u2019s another maybe as much as 125 basis points of further Fed action this year, and then next year, depending on the economy, there could be a couple more or there\u2019ll be a pause. I don\u2019t think there will be much in the way of Fed rate reductions until maybe as late as 2024. So what that means is, we\u2019re going to get the benefit from the Fed rate increases into the portfolio. We\u2019re seeing deposit pricing continue to go up. We haven\u2019t been a price leader on that. Certainly, we\u2019ve been a follower to make sure we have a positive value proposition for our customer base. And then the next question would be around betas and what do you think about betas. So, I\u2019m going to try to address that right now. So as there\u2019s greater disparity between our rates from a deposit standpoint and the brick-and-mortar banks. It creates plenty of opportunity for us to market into those customers and they\u2019ll find an attractive value proposition, which should help dampen the impact of further rate increases. So, we do think the combination of the Fed increases, us being able to manage the deposit book, but in a rising rate environment, stability from a credit standpoint, but normalization, which will create a bit of incremental interest reversals impacting net interest margin. And then ultimately, the pricing decisions we\u2019re going to make where we have that flexibility to make sure we\u2019re making good decisions for our customers and for our shareholders. So ultimately, it nets out that we expect relative stability over net interest margin through 2023.\nBetsy Graseck: Okay. Got it. And I appreciate that. Thanks. My follow-up has to do with the buyback discussion that we had earlier. And I know you mentioned that you\u2019re hopeful it can resume in 4Q. Would you expect to put out an 8-K, that indicates that you can now resume buybacks? Or would we hear about buybacks only after you started, there\u2019s no obligation to put a notification into the market that you can resume. Thanks.\nJohn Greene: Correct. There isn\u2019t an obligation, but we would likely put an 8-K out.\nBetsy Graseck: Okay. No obligation, but you would likely do it. Okay. Thanks.\nJohn Greene: Yes.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Robert Napoli with William Blair. Your line is now open.\nRobert Napoli: Yes. Thank you and good morning. So, I just following up on \u2013 it was good to hear to resuming the buybacks. I guess that would suggest that the review is behind you. But would you expect them to get your to go towards your 10.5% target capital ratio? And over what time frame would you like to do that? Or what kind of a buffer do you want above that 10.5%?\nJohn Greene: Yes. Hey Bob, thanks for the question. I just want to be very specific about something you said. And our comments have consistently been here on this call that we hope to resume the buyback in the fourth quarter. So, we say that because we\u2019re hopeful, but there\u2019s ultimately, it will be a decision that the Board helps with. So in terms of the 10.5% target, so we\u2019ve been well north of that for quite some time, there\u2019s \u2013 we have said that we want to step towards that, we intend to step towards that. So certainly, the earnings power that the firm has generated and the buybacks as well as dividends, have impacted our ability to get there. So we\u2019re going to step towards that when throughout 2023 and 2024. What we said previously is, we hope to be around the 10.5% target, sometime in 2024 or 2025.\nRobert Napoli: Thank you. And the follow-up, just on normalization of credit losses. As we think about normalized credit losses there, looking back over history, credit cards, high-3s, I guess, or mid-3s to high-3s personal loans in the 4% range. Is that the way we should think? Is there anything that\u2019s changed? Should we continue to think about normalized credit losses in that kind of an area?\nJohn Greene: Yes. Yes. So, I would put two points out there. First, I would take a look at the historical trends and use that and make certain judgments. The other item here, I\u2019m going to say is a matter of judgment. But certainly, I have a belief that credit cards have increased in the payment priority because folks can access the digital economy without a credit card \u2013 some folks with a debit card, but most specifically around a credit card. So that, I believe, helps prioritize the primary credit card among many other debt obligations that a consumer has. So could that impact the relative charge-off rates versus the historical trend? My belief is yes, but your judgment is, what I\u2019d say you should apply when you\u2019re working through your forward-looking outlooks.\nRobert Napoli: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.\nDon Fandetti: John, personal loan growth was pretty strong this quarter. Just wanted to get your thoughts on the outlook there and growth. And also any updates on your home equity lending initiative?\nJohn Greene: Yes. Yes, thanks for the question, Don. So certainly, nice growth there. On the personal loan front, you go back in a few quarters, and it was flat. And we said it was flat to down. Actually, if you go back three or four quarters as a result of some underwriting decisions we took. We\u2019ve been \u2013 we set strength in the underwriting for that product, and it\u2019s given us greater confidence to be able to market that product, and there\u2019s been a high level of appeal to it. So, we\u2019ll continue to be mindful of the product in the face of a tougher economic condition. But certainly, we feel like it\u2019s a good product and its meeting customer needs, and that\u2019s helped drive the growth. In terms of kind of forward-looking guidance, I\u2019m not going to start to do that at a product level, all it would do is ensure that I was wrong more often. But if I go to the kind of the home equity loan, that\u2019s portfolio is relatively small. So it\u2019s actually not moving the dial at this point from an earnings standpoint. But what we\u2019ve seen is a great level of interest in the second lien product, and we\u2019re also originating a first lien product as well. So both products are performing well and nice appeal.\nDon Fandetti: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Mihir Bhatia with Bank of America. Your line is now open.\nMihir Bhatia: Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. Maybe I just wanted to start with \u2013 if you just take your guidance for NIM and loan growth, and I think that works out about four point effectively works out of fourth quarter NIM of at least 11.2% and $3 billion plus NII. Is that the right way to think about it and frame the exit rate for NIM? And then should NIM, NII just increase from there given loan growth and your comments about NIM stability. Am I thinking of that correctly?\nJohn Greene: Yes. So Mihir, thanks for the question. And I\u2019m certainly appreciate the specificity. What I\u2019ve said about NIM is probably as far as I\u2019m going to go here on this call. We do expect sequential improvement, as I said. Beyond that, it will be tough to give specific details.\nMihir Bhatia: Okay. And then just wanted to ask about losses normalizing. A little previously, you had talked about it being in 2H 2023 is when we get to a more normalized loss rate. But I think there was talk that it could maybe push into even 2024 later. Any update on that? Thank you.\nJohn Greene: Yes. So normalization through 2023 and the macro environment will help us determine whether it pushes 2023 into 2024. But where we\u2019re sitting today, we\u2019re very pleased with the portfolio performance and the only surprise is frankly, the pace of normalization on the upper end is a little slower than we expected, which helped drive the improved guidance that we gave on the charge-off rate.\nMihir Bhatia: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Rick Shane with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\nRick Shane: Thanks everyone for taking my question. Look, your customer base really represents a great sample of the domestic population. I\u2019m curious when you look at spending on a category level basis, if there\u2019s anything that you\u2019re seeing that is a cause for concern, not asking are people spending more of the pump that\u2019s obvious with the inflationary pressures. But are there categories where you\u2019re seeing people use their cards that are signals for something we should be thinking about?\nRoger Hochschild: Yes. Great question. So our base probably does skew a little upwards, so more in the prime, but we\u2019re seeing continued strength in sales in October. So, I\u2019d say, year-over-year in the low teens. Some of the trends you\u2019ve heard about were picking up. So consumer durables softening in terms of year-over-year. But again, our households, by and large, they have the liquidity to absorb inflation. It causes some pain, and we\u2019ll switch categories, we\u2019ll downgrade within a category. But I would say travel is coming off some of the very, very strong growth we saw over the summer. So a little less strength in travel and consumer durables are probably the key trend.\nRick Shane: Got it. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Bill Carcache with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.\nBill Carcache: Thank you. Good morning, Roger and John.\nJohn Greene: Good morning.\nBill Carcache: You mentioned that operating conditions are consistent with late cycle expansion historically. Fed hiking cycles have typically ended in slowing loan growth, but you\u2019re already exceptionally strong loan growth seems to be accelerating, and certainly, the whole industry is enjoying strong growth. Can you share any thoughts around how you\u2019d expect the late cycle expansion to end? And I\u2019ll just layer in my follow-up now. And if you can give any commentary around what level of unemployment is implicit in your reserve rate and what a change in unemployment would mean for the reserve rate, that would be very helpful?\nRoger Hochschild: Yes. So great question. So, I mean, in terms of late cycle, I think back pre-pandemic, we talked about it being late cycle for a couple of years, and then it ended in a way that I think no one expected. And so that\u2019s part of why we tend to use a through-the-cycle loss rate and look to be disciplined in our credit management. So while I would be, it\u2019s not a time probably to be widening credit. We\u2019re seeing a lot of benefits from the investments in advanced analytics, in particular, around the personal loan product and on the card side, where the growth we\u2019re achieving the growth while swapping in and swapping out different populations. And again, with a policy that I think is appropriate for late cycle. And it builds on some of the really strong new account production we had in 2021 and as those accounts mature. So again, we\u2019ll continue to look at it, both in terms of our portfolio actions as well as new account originations across all of our products, but we feel good about the credit approach and just the traction our products are getting in the marketplace. And I\u2019ll pass it to John for part two.\nJohn Greene: Yes. Hey, Bill and in terms of kind of fundamental assumptions for kind of reserve setting. So, as I said earlier, we used a number of different scenarios, which included kind of non-recession scenario as well as the recessionary scenario. The recessionary scenario that we modeled. We certainly didn\u2019t wait as much as the non-recession and also the view in terms of the unemployment rate, there\u2019s pretty wide range right now, right? So some forecasted going north of 6% in a very, what I\u2019ll say, a dark scenario. The more optimistic scenario is 4%. And so we looked at a complete range of scenarios and weighted it more towards stability with increasing unemployment. GDP, not as big a driver, but certainly an indication for the economy. Today, we\u2019re at about 1%, and in 2023 in a recessionary scenario; there would be mild contraction, not deep contraction. So we think, overall, there will be general stability despite a tougher macro.\nBill Carcache: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin Barker with Piper Sandler. Your line is now open.\nKevin Barker: Thank you concerning the comments regarding unemployment rate, maybe some slight tightening on underwriting. That being said, are you seeing any minor shifts in consumer spending or payment patterns that may indicate certain pockets of stress, whether it\u2019s the lower end of prime or other parts or maybe even certain vintages of customers that are on your books?\nRoger Hochschild: Yes. I mean all the vintages are performing well. As John said, I think we\u2019re seeing the normalization occur faster and pretty close to fully normalized for the lower end of prime. While the payment rate has softened a bit and come down by about 70 basis points, it remains 400 basis points higher than 2019 levels. And so I think that speaks to the fact that there\u2019s still very strong employment market out there, people can find jobs, can find extra hours. And so a good amount of liquidity that is supporting the deferred for our segment.\nKevin Barker: Okay. And then I know it\u2019s a fluid situation, but the student debt repayment is supposed to restart here maybe early next year or who knows, given what\u2019s happening with the fighting in the courts, but do you expect any incremental impact to credit with a lot of student debt payments. Obviously, there\u2019s the forgiveness is obviously a credit positive, but is there something that you could see as a potential headwind as student debt repayments restart here potentially in January?\nRoger Hochschild: Not necessarily. We\u2019ve watched it closely. I mean I think we have experienced an elevated payment rate, which has a dampening impact on loan growth as students have put more of their payments towards their private student loans. But we don\u2019t see anything that would have a significant impact on credit.\nKevin Barker: Okay, thank you for taking my questions.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Mark DeVries with Barclays. Your line is now open.\nMark DeVries: Yes. Thanks. How should we think about how you manage expense discipline, if we start to see some revenue and credit weakness if the economy softens here?\nJohn Greene: Yes. I would just simply say that we will take a look at the opportunities we have in front of us, and we\u2019ll make what I hope will be great long-term decisions for our shareholders. And we\u2019re going to be very, very mindful around discretionary spending and around employment decisions. So overall, we hope we\u2019re good stewards of the company.\nMark DeVries: Okay. Got it. And then just given where the rewards cost has trended so far this year in the guidance I think you said it was 2 basis points but guidance is 2% to 4%. Is it right to assume that 4Q is a relatively big quarter for expenses? Maybe you\u2019ve got more of the 5% categories this quarter.\nJohn Greene: Yes. I wouldn\u2019t necessarily assume that what the point of the guidance between two and four is that\u2019s what we had said previously still within the range, and we wanted to keep it within the range. So that 2% to 4% is something that we\u2019ve seen historically, and to an extent, managed to, and we\u2019ll continue to do that. So I wouldn\u2019t lean on any particular information to assume the fourth quarter is going to be extraordinarily high or low.\nMark DeVries: Okay, got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Bill Ryan with Seaport Research Partners. Your line is now open.\nBill Ryan: Thanks. Good morning and a couple of quick questions. Just following up on the personal loans business. Historically, it\u2019s been heavily focused on your credit card base. And I was just wondering if that\u2019s still the case. And you also had, I\u2019d say, very, very strong credit checks in that business, paying off creditors directly. Has anything changed there as well?\nRoger Hochschild: No. So, I would say it\u2019s pretty balanced in terms of cross-hold to the card base versus broad market. Probably the biggest change has been just the continued advancement in analytics and the underwriting approach there but very, very conservative. So a lot of employment verification, et cetera, heavily manual processes just to make sure we get it right because as opposed to the card business where you can manage credit as you go, you get one shot in personal loans. But again, I would say that the performance remains very, very strong there and it\u2019s a lot of it thanks to that disciplined approach.\nBill Ryan: Okay. And just one follow-up on the promotional balances, that\u2019s kind of been brought up on the card book for the last several quarters. Is it still increasing as a percentage of the overall card portfolio? Or is it kind of stabilized and maybe give us some historical perspective of where it stands to recent history? Thanks.\nJohn Greene: Yes. Thanks. It\u2019s stabilized in the third quarter, basically approach stabilization into the second quarter and it\u2019s very close to where it has been historically. \nBill Ryan: Okay, thanks for taking my questions.\nJohn Greene: You\u2019re welcome.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Dominick Gabriele with Oppenheimer. Your line is now open.\nDominick Gabriele: Hey, thanks so much for taking my questions. Throughout the call and throughout other calls, you\u2019ve kind of laid out your playbook and pieces in particular on the credit side for a slowing economy. But maybe, Roger, you can just provide us with a more holistic idea of what discover would change across various pieces of the businesses to protect profitability in a, of tougher economic environment? And then I just have a follow-up. Thank you.\nRoger Hochschild: Yes. I\u2019d start by saying we don\u2019t necessarily optimize on protecting profitability on a quarter-by-quarter basis. We focus on sort of delivering long-term value to the shareholders. And I think as I\u2019ve been in this business a while, people who just totally got marketing in a downturn, miss out on what usually turn out to be some of the most profitable vintages. And so yes, you cut marketing mainly because as you tighten the credit box, there are fewer people to market, too. But I think we try and operate our company almost like we\u2019re always in a recession, always be conserved on credit or was be tied on expenses, there\u2019s more you can do, especially around discretionary items. But that ability to keep momentum through a downturn has really distinguished us in previous cycles, and we would try and do that again.\nDominick Gabriele: Okay. Great. Thank you. And I think it\u2019d be really helpful to understand what your \u2013 both of your views are on the normalization of the personal loan portfolio net charge-offs versus the credit card portfolio. Consensus has such a huge ramp on the personal loan side versus credit cards for 2023 and \u2013 not looking for specific guidance, but is there any reason why there would be such a difference in faster normalization on the personal loan side versus credit card as far as basis point movement as a percentage of loans? Thanks so much guys.\nRoger Hochschild: Yes. I mean we haven\u2019t put out product-by-product guidance. But I would say that given how we underwrite the personal loans, I\u2019m not sure why our portfolio would jump much faster than the card book. In general, we have a higher FICO for the personal loans business. They do tend to be a little more volatile than card in a recession. But I wouldn\u2019t \u2013 that isn\u2019t necessarily behavior I would expect. \nDominick Gabriele: Great. Thanks so much.\nEric Wasserstrom: All right. Well, thank you everyone for joining us. And thank you, Katie. And if there\u2019s any additional follow-ups, please reach out to the IR team. We\u2019ll be here and looking forward to speaking with you. Thanks, and have a great day.\nJohn Greene: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s event. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Roger Hochschild",
            "content": "Thanks, Eric and thanks to our listeners for joining today's call. I'm very pleased with our results this quarter. Against a fluid macroeconomic backdrop, we generate strong financial performance while continuing to advance our strategic priorities. Let's start with a summary on Slide 3. For the third quarter, we reported net income of $1 billion after tax or $3.54 per share. Over the past three months, as Fed policy has become more restrictive, it has made fears of a recession more acute. Against this backdrop, the key narratives of the third quarter results are the strength of our balance sheet and the quality of our earnings. Our increase in revenues this year has been largely driven by our strong receivables growth with loans up 17% year-over-year. This growth was driven largely by elevated sales volume and the increased number of new accounts we've added since mid-2021. We continue to use a through-the-cycle approach to underwriting, which considers all stages of a credit cycle, including downturns. As part of our conservative credit management, we marginally tightened our new account underwriting criteria this quarter. Given these factors, we consider our growth to be consistent with current macroeconomic conditions. Naturally, discussion of \u2013 session of elicits concerns about credit quality, but the credit performance of our loan portfolio at this stage does not suggest anything other than gradual normalization. Nonetheless, a late-cycle environment requires a particular awareness of changing conditions and underscores the importance of our strong financial condition. We also continue to advance our strategic priorities. As a few examples, in August, we expanded our global presence with the signing of Woori Card of the largest issuers in South Korea. The extension of this relationship as well as the number of new network partnerships we've announced this year highlight our focus on expanding our international presence. We continue to demonstrate the value of our network and our growing relationships with fintech partners. As an example, we announced in October that we will facilitate payments for TYDEi's new healthcare vendor management system, which will digitize and streamline payments in an industry where legacy purchasing is still primarily manual. Finally, this summer, we announced the opening of our new Advanced Analytics Resource Center at our downtown Chicago location. The first cohort of 75 individuals, which we selected from over 1,000 applicants has already started, and we intend to grow the program with an additional cohort in 2023. This follows the grand opening of our customer care center in the South Side neighborhood of Chatham earlier this year and underscores our commitment to bring additional jobs to Chicago while supporting great customer experiences. I'll now turn the call over to John to review our results in more detail. Good morning. Sure. So, I would start by saying, in general, it remains a very good environment. We're seeing cost per account on the prime side below what we had last year. The value proposition is resonating well. For the new account space at the margin, we tightened some of those segments that will be most volatile in a downturn. So, I think the lower end of prime. And we're ready to take further action on new accounts or the portfolio side. But again, I'd say overall, a very good environment, and that's part of why you're seeing such strong growth. Yes. So it is hard Moshe to know what individual competitors are doing. I would say in general, most of them are much broader spectrum lenders than we are. And so my guess is we'd be seeing some stress at the lower ends of their books. For us, a rising rate environment creates a lot of focus on debt consolidation, which is the primary use of our personal loans. So, we're maintaining a very disciplined credit criteria by seeing strong originations in that segment. Yes. Sure. So a lot of the most intense competition on rewards is in the super prime segment, and we've talked over the last year or two, how we think some of the propositions issuers are putting out aren't necessarily sustainable in the long run. As John mentioned, our rewards costs are moving up exactly as we forecast. We haven't felt the need to make any structural changes to our program. So as you can see from the growth in the new accounts, our value proposition competes very well in that prime revolver segment. And so while the market is always competitive, we bring a differentiated value proposition that resonates well with consumers. Yes. I would say more recent vintages are performing exactly in line with our expectations, right? I mean every vintage got distorted during the pandemic. So you saw it cut across the curves. But again, we feel very good about the performance. Good morning. Good morning. Yes. Great question. So our base probably does skew a little upwards, so more in the prime, but we're seeing continued strength in sales in October. So, I'd say, year-over-year in the low teens. Some of the trends you've heard about were picking up. So consumer durables softening in terms of year-over-year. But again, our households, by and large, they have the liquidity to absorb inflation. It causes some pain, and we'll switch categories, we'll downgrade within a category. But I would say travel is coming off some of the very, very strong growth we saw over the summer. So a little less strength in travel and consumer durables are probably the key trend. Yes. So great question. So, I mean, in terms of late cycle, I think back pre-pandemic, we talked about it being late cycle for a couple of years, and then it ended in a way that I think no one expected. And so that's part of why we tend to use a through-the-cycle loss rate and look to be disciplined in our credit management. So while I would be, it's not a time probably to be widening credit. We're seeing a lot of benefits from the investments in advanced analytics, in particular, around the personal loan product and on the card side, where the growth we're achieving the growth while swapping in and swapping out different populations.

And I'll pass it to John for part two. Yes. I mean all the vintages are performing well. As John said, I think we're seeing the normalization occur faster and pretty close to fully normalized for the lower end of prime. While the payment rate has softened a bit and come down by about 70 basis points, it remains 400 basis points higher than 2019 levels. And so I think that speaks to the fact that there's still very strong employment market out there, people can find jobs, can find extra hours. And so a good amount of liquidity that is supporting the deferred for our segment. Not necessarily. We've watched it closely. I mean I think we have experienced an elevated payment rate, which has a dampening impact on loan growth as students have put more of their payments towards their private student loans. But we don't see anything that would have a significant impact on credit. No. So, I would say it's pretty balanced in terms of cross-hold to the card base versus broad market.

            "name": "John Greene",
            "content": "Thank you, Roger, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with our financial summary results on Slide 4. There were three important trends in the quarter: strong asset growth, net interest margin expansion and modest credit normalization. The strength in asset growth, combined with a NIM rate improvement increased revenue 8% sequentially and 25% year-over-year. Asset growth resulted in an increase in our reserves under CECL of $304 million, but our reserve coverage ratio declined slightly. So while our reported net income was down 8% year-over-year, adjusting for the reserve change, our net income would have been 28% higher on a year-over-year basis. Let's review the details starting on Slide 5. Net interest income was up $438 million year-over-year or 18%, driven by higher average receivables and improved net interest margin. We achieved a record high NIM rate of 11.05%, up 25 basis points from the prior year and 11 basis points sequentially. On both a year-over-year and sequential basis, the increase in net interest margin primarily reflects the higher prime rate, partially offset by higher funding costs and increased promotional and balance transfers. Receivable growth was driven by card, which increased 19% year-over-year, reflecting continued strong sales and the contribution from new accounts growth last year and into this year. Sales growth was 15% in the period, a deceleration from the 20% growth we experienced in the first half of the year. As anticipated, the sales decline was partially mitigated by a decrease in the payment rate, which fell 70 basis points in the quarter. Nonetheless, it remains more than 400 basis points over 2019 levels. We expect payment rate to continue to decline through the back half of 2023, which should help support receivable growth. Turning to our non-card products, organic student loans increased 4% as a result of peak season originations. Personal loans were up 11%, the growth reflects our disciplined approach to marketing, underwriting and pricing of this product, which we believe has created an attractive competitive position for us in the market, particularly relative to some non-bank originators. In terms of funding mix, our customer deposit balances were up 4% year-over-year and 2% sequentially. So far, deposit pricing has been in line with what we expected in a rising rate environment. As we mentioned last quarter, our strong asset growth has caused deposits to various proportion of our funding mix, but we continue to target 70% to 80% deposit funding over the medium term. We also issued $2 billion of card ABS fixed notes in the quarter and booked $5 billion of broker deposits. We maintain broad access to a variety of funding sources, enabling us to confidently fund our asset growth. Looking at other revenue on Slide 6. Non-interest income increased $264 million or 71%. This was partially due to a $157 million loss on our equity investments in the prior year quarter compared to a $4 million loss this quarter. Adjusting for these, our non-interest income was up 19%. This was driven by higher net discount and interchange revenue, which was up $47 million or 16%, reflecting strong sales and favorable sales mix, partially offset by higher rewards costs. Similar to last quarter, we estimate that inflation contributed between 200 basis points and 250 basis points of sales growth in the period. The strong sales also drove higher reward expenses. Consistent with the prior quarter, our rewards rate increased 3 basis points year-over-year, driven by substantial growth in new accounts, increasing the cost of our cash back program. Year-to-date, our rewards rate is up 2 basis points, consistent with our expectation of 2 basis points to 4 basis points of annual reward rate inflation. Moving to expenses on Slide 7. Total operating expenses were up $198 million or 17% year-over-year and up 13% from the prior quarter. Compensation costs were up primarily due to increased headcount. Our servicing organization is a key component of our value proposition. We expect to grow this as our accounts and assets expand. This will contribute to an increase in salary and wages through the end of this year and into next year. Marketing expenses increased $66 million or 31% as we continue to invest for growth in our card and consumer banking products. We grew new card accounts by 22% from last year's third quarter. Professional fees increased $43 million or 22% as a result of investments in technology and increased consulting costs. We also had additional fraud costs in the consumer bank, driven by increased volumes as well as some legal expense elevating our other expense category in the quarter. Moving to credit performance on Slide 8. Total net charge-offs were 1.71% or 25 basis points higher than the prior year, but down 9 basis points from the prior quarter. Total net charge-off dollars were up $114 million from the prior year and only up $10 million sequentially. In the card portfolio, the net charge-off rate of 1.92% was 27 basis points higher than the prior year and 9 basis points lower sequentially. Similar to our commentary from last quarter, we are not seeing evidence of emerging credit stress beyond normal expected normalization. Delinquencies among our lower prime segment have been normalized, but in upper prime delinquencies and charge-offs remain below pre-pandemic levels. This is consistent with our baseline expectation that credit will continue to normalize over the next several quarters' absence a change in macro conditions. Turning to the discussion of our allowance on Slide 9. This past quarter, we increased our allowance by $304 million due to higher receivable balances. Our reserve rate modestly declined to 6.7%. For us, changes through \u2013 to employment conditions pose the most significant risk to loss levels. As part of our reserving process, we have considered the prospects of higher unemployment among a range of macroeconomic scenarios and is reflected in our reserve balance. Looking at Slide 10. Our common equity Tier 1 for the period was 13.9%. The strong asset growth was a primary driver of the approximate 30 basis point decline from the prior period. Our long-term target remains 10.5%. In terms of capital return, we declared a quarterly common dividend of $0.60 per share and repurchased $212 million of common stock in the period before we decided to temporarily suspend our buyback activity. Concluding on Slide 11. As we look at the last quarter of the year, our prospects for 2022 remain favorable, and we are once again improving elements of our expectations. We are revising our view on loan growth to high teens, continued strong sales, new account acquisitions through the third quarter and some recent improvements in the payment rates support our confidence in the outlook. In terms of NIM, we expect the full year to be mildly above the high end of our expected range with sequential margin improvement in the fourth quarter based on rate hikes that happened in late September. We are revising our expense outlook to be up high single digits versus the prior year, driven by increased marketing and compensation costs. In line with previous communications, we still expect marketing costs to come in above 2019 levels as we've discussed. We expect to add headcount, which will elevate salary and wages as well as benefit expense. Excluding these two categories, expenses are expected to increase by low single digits. We now expect net charge-offs to be between 1.8% and 1.9% for the full year, driven by lower-than-expected credit losses through this point in the year. Our temporary pause on share repurchases remains in place, but we hope to resume share repurchases before year-end. In summary, receivable growth accelerated as we continue to benefit from elevated sales, strong new account acquisitions and improvements in the payment rate. NIM continues to benefit from prime rate increases. Funding costs are consistent with expectations and credit performance is slowly normalizing, reflecting our disciplined approach to underwriting and credit management. These results demonstrate the resiliency of our integrated digital banking and payments model. Our earnings power, coupled with our strong balance sheet and capital position, keeps us well positioned for continued profitable growth through a range of economic conditions. With that, I'll turn the call back to our operator, Katie, to open the line for Q&A. Great. Okay. Thanks for the question, Ryan. There's a lot there. So, let me start with the fundamentals that we're seeing. So the liability side of the balance sheet is certainly subjected to increases in deposit funding costs as a result of competitive actions and general needs across the market to attract some deposits. With that said, the 11% plus we delivered in the third quarter; we do expect some upside from that as a result of the Fed hikes in September. So certainly, sequentially into the fourth quarter, we'll see further improvement. Now, beyond the \u2013 excuse me, beyond into the fourth quarter \u2013 we'll see improvement. Beyond the fourth quarter at this point, we're going to reserve any commentary. But what I would say is, we don't expect any specific, I'll say, seismic changes to net interest margins in 2023 based on the stability of our funding base and turn access to multiple sources of funds. Yes. Sure. Moshe, I'll take that. So from a overall capital level, we are very well capitalized, right? So, we're 13% approaching, 14% on the CET1. Our target is 10.5%. The credit book has been very, very stable. It's normalizing, but overall, very, very stable. So the capital allocation priorities through the firm remain in place. So first is to invest in strong organic growth, second would be a return of capital, and then third, perhaps a bolt-on acquisition, and we're going to do that will likely be in the Payments segment. So overall, those priorities didn't change. So the suspension remains in place, but we're hopeful that it will resume \u2013 buybacks will resume here in the fourth quarter. Yes. Yes, happy to help with that, Sanjay. So let me provide some context upfront here. So year-to-date total expenses are up 7%. Comp expense is up 5%, and excluding marketing, our expense base year-to-date is up 2%. So actually really, really what I'll say first half of the year and into this quarter some strong fundamentals. Now, we did have a significant growth in the asset base, which of course, means that there are accounts that we're going to have to service. And you might have seen a press release that came out that indicated we were hiring about 2,000 servicing agents through the balance of this year and into next year depending on the balance sheet and our customer value proposition and metrics. So overall, the strong growth and the strong acquisition has necessitated investments in our people. We'll continue to do that. We've also made specific investments in information technology, specifically around resources advanced analytics in order to further position us to be able to grow profitably and then also enhance underwriting and customer targeting. So, we believe all those investments make perfect sense for the long term. And what you're seeing here in the third quarter is a combination of what I'll say is a tough comp as a result of some turnover last year. And then us coming on with backfilling resources, what I'll say is salaried resources as well as the investments I talked about in terms of customer service. So hopefully, that provides some context and color to your question. Yes, that is a correct statement. So no change. Obviously, when we have some news to share, we're going to share it. The expense guidance we provided and the updates reflect those items I discussed on your previous question and no specific changes related to expenses related to the buybacks as mentioned. Yes. John thanks for the question. So, what we said in the past and what we've told our Board and what we're targeting is an efficiency ratio in the high 30s [ph]. And through this year, we've done a pretty good job in terms of being able to deliver that. Certainly the really strong growth and the great performance through the first half on expense \u2013 on the expense base. And then the third quarter reflects some investments and despite those investments, still below 40%. We're going to continue to make investments where we see an opportunity to drive great returns for our shareholders. And as we approach 2023, we are aware that the economic environment is a little tougher. We do feel like we have remaining tailwinds in terms of asset growth and we do have investments we're going to continue to make. So, I would say for 2023 specifically, we will come out in January to give more specific details. But the overall commitments remain in place, commitment to positive operating leverage and efficiency ratio south of 40% and expense discipline while investing for growth. Yes. Great. Yes, thanks for that question. So a little bit of context there. So, we put on about $5.5 billion to $5.6 billion worth of assets in the quarter. Our reserves increased by $304 million. So, as we look at the portfolio and the macro environment, we're seeing the portfolio continuing to be very, very stable but normalizing. The macro environment indications of a recession are certainly increasing. Roger mentioned in his comments about some mild \u2013 in his comments about some mild tightening. So in terms of expectation around reserves, we'll continue to take a look at the macros. We'll run multiple scenarios and then make sure the balance sheet, the portfolio specifically continues to perform as anticipated and will make appropriate calls for reserves under GAAP. It's really tough to give any specific guidance on that other than we're going to be mindful of the macros, continue to watch the portfolio, and that prime revolver targeting we do, tends to add high-level stability. As matter of fact one other point that may be useful not specific to reserves, but rather charge-offs. You have to go all the way back to the second quarter of 2011 to see charge-offs that \u2013 charge-off rates that is north of 4%. So, we're seeing great stability this year, and we expect it to be stable next year as well. Okay. Yes. So there's a lot there. And as you know, it's fairly complex Betsy, but I'll do my best to create some transparency here. So \u2013 and let me start with the loan yields. So 80% of our book is floating rate of the asset side. So as the Fed increases, that creates the opportunity to move the contract rate up with the Fed changes. And correspondingly, if the Fed were to come down, the contract rate would come down. So, what we're seeing there is in a rising rate environment. We still expect 3 basis points to 5 basis points of yield improvement. So net interest margin yield improvement over a 12-month period. So, we saw significant increases in September. It looks like based on the forward curve, there's another maybe as much as 125 basis points of further Fed action this year, and then next year, depending on the economy, there could be a couple more or there'll be a pause. I don't think there will be much in the way of Fed rate reductions until maybe as late as 2024. So what that means is, we're going to get the benefit from the Fed rate increases into the portfolio. We're seeing deposit pricing continue to go up. We haven't been a price leader on that. Certainly, we've been a follower to make sure we have a positive value proposition for our customer base. And then the next question would be around betas and what do you think about betas. So, I'm going to try to address that right now. So as there's greater disparity between our rates from a deposit standpoint and the brick-and-mortar banks. It creates plenty of opportunity for us to market into those customers and they'll find an attractive value proposition, which should help dampen the impact of further rate increases. So, we do think the combination of the Fed increases, us being able to manage the deposit book, but in a rising rate environment, stability from a credit standpoint, but normalization, which will create a bit of incremental interest reversals impacting net interest margin. And then ultimately, the pricing decisions we're going to make where we have that flexibility to make sure we're making good decisions for our customers and for our shareholders. So ultimately, it nets out that we expect relative stability over net interest margin through 2023. Correct. There isn't an obligation, but we would likely put an 8-K out. Yes. Yes. Hey Bob, thanks for the question. I just want to be very specific about something you said. And our comments have consistently been here on this call that we hope to resume the buyback in the fourth quarter. So, we say that because we're hopeful, but there's ultimately, it will be a decision that the Board helps with. So in terms of the 10.5% target, so we've been well north of that for quite some time, there's \u2013 we have said that we want to step towards that, we intend to step towards that. So certainly, the earnings power that the firm has generated and the buybacks as well as dividends, have impacted our ability to get there. So we're going to step towards that when throughout 2023 and 2024. What we said previously is, we hope to be around the 10.5% target, sometime in 2024 or 2025. Yes. Yes. So, I would put two points out there. First, I would take a look at the historical trends and use that and make certain judgments. The other item here, I'm going to say is a matter of judgment. But certainly, I have a belief that credit cards have increased in the payment priority because folks can access the digital economy without a credit card \u2013 some folks with a debit card, but most specifically around a credit card. So that, I believe, helps prioritize the primary credit card among many other debt obligations that a consumer has. So could that impact the relative charge-off rates versus the historical trend? My belief is yes, but your judgment is, what I'd say you should apply when you're working through your forward-looking outlooks. Yes. Yes, thanks for the question, Don. So certainly, nice growth there. On the personal loan front, you go back in a few quarters, and it was flat. And we said it was flat to down. Actually, if you go back three or four quarters as a result of some underwriting decisions we took. We've been \u2013 we set strength in the underwriting for that product, and it's given us greater confidence to be able to market that product, and there's been a high level of appeal to it. So, we'll continue to be mindful of the product in the face of a tougher economic condition. But certainly, we feel like it's a good product and its meeting customer needs, and that's helped drive the growth. In terms of kind of forward-looking guidance, I'm not going to start to do that at a product level, all it would do is ensure that I was wrong more often. But if I go to the kind of the home equity loan, that's portfolio is relatively small. So it's actually not moving the dial at this point from an earnings standpoint. But what we've seen is a great level of interest in the second lien product, and we're also originating a first lien product as well. So both products are performing well and nice appeal. Yes. So Mihir, thanks for the question. And I'm certainly appreciate the specificity. What I've said about NIM is probably as far as I'm going to go here on this call. We do expect sequential improvement, as I said. Beyond that, it will be tough to give specific details. Yes. So normalization through 2023 and the macro environment will help us determine whether it pushes 2023 into 2024. But where we're sitting today, we're very pleased with the portfolio performance and the only surprise is frankly, the pace of normalization on the upper end is a little slower than we expected, which helped drive the improved guidance that we gave on the charge-off rate. Good morning. Yes. Hey, Bill and in terms of kind of fundamental assumptions for kind of reserve setting. So, as I said earlier, we used a number of different scenarios, which included kind of non-recession scenario as well as the recessionary scenario. The recessionary scenario that we modeled. We certainly didn't wait as much as the non-recession and also the view in terms of the unemployment rate, there's pretty wide range right now, right? So some forecasted going north of 6% in a very, what I'll say, a dark scenario. The more optimistic scenario is 4%. And so we looked at a complete range of scenarios and weighted it more towards stability with increasing unemployment. GDP, not as big a driver, but certainly an indication for the economy. Today, we're at about 1%, and in 2023 in a recessionary scenario; there would be mild contraction, not deep contraction. So we think, overall, there will be general stability despite a tougher macro. Yes. I would just simply say that we will take a look at the opportunities we have in front of us, and we'll make what I hope will be great long-term decisions for our shareholders. And we're going to be very, very mindful around discretionary spending and around employment decisions. So overall, we hope we're good stewards of the company. Yes. I wouldn't necessarily assume that what the point of the guidance between two and four is that's what we had said previously still within the range, and we wanted to keep it within the range. So that 2% to 4% is something that we've seen historically, and to an extent, managed to, and we'll continue to do that. So I wouldn't lean on any particular information to assume the fourth quarter is going to be extraordinarily high or low. Yes. Thanks. It's stabilized in the third quarter, basically approach stabilization into the second quarter and it's very close to where it has been historically. You're welcome. Thank you."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the second quarter 2022 Discover Financial Services Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session.  Thank you. I would now turn the call over to Mr. Eric Wasserstrom, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nEric Wasserstrom: Thank you, Katie, and welcome, everyone, to this morning's call. I'll begin on slide two of our earnings presentation, which you can find in the financial section of our Investor Relations website, investorrelations.discover.com. Our discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. Please refer to our notices regarding forward-looking statements that appear in our second quarter earnings press release and presentation. Our call today will include remarks from our CEO, Roger Hochschild; and John Greene, our Chief Financial Officer. After we conclude our formal comments, there will be time for a question-and-answer session. During the Q&A session, you'll be permitted to ask one question followed by one follow-up question. After a follow-up question, please return to the queue. Now, it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Roger.\nRoger Hochschild: Thanks Eric and thanks to our listeners for joining today's call. I'm very pleased with our results this quarter. We generated robust revenue growth and strong earnings, while advancing several strategic initiatives. This solid performance reflects the strength of our integrated digital banking and payments model and our focus on managing the business, while investing for growth amidst an increasingly fluid macroeconomic backdrop. Let's turn to the summary on slide three. For the second quarter, we reported net income of $1.1 billion after-tax or $3.96 per share. Our operating metrics in the second quarter remained very strong. Loan growth increased by 13% from the prior year, driven by a combination of higher sales and strong new account growth and our asset quality remains solid across all products, reflecting our focus on prime lending and our approach to underwriting and credit management. We also advanced several strategic priorities in the quarter. In our Payment Services segment, we continue to expand our global acceptance through new partnerships. In June, we announced a network alliance in Italy with BANCOMAT, one of Europe's largest payment networks. This should provide our customers with access to merchants in Italy through BANCOMAT's extensive acquirer relationships. This partnership represents a significant advancement in our acceptance across Western Europe and we remain committed to expanding our international merchant coverage. In our Digital Banking segment, our combination of industry-leading customer service and compelling products continues to differentiate us in the marketplace. We were recently awarded the highest ranking in customer satisfaction by J.D. Power among mobile, credit card apps, and websites. We also achieved J.D. Power's top customer satisfaction and checking accounts for direct retail banks. This recognition underscores our customer service model, which combined with our compelling Cashback rewards and no fee products, create a value proposition that we believe others will struggle to match. For this reason, we're confident that we are well-positioned to generate substantial growth and shareholder value over the long-term. Notwithstanding our strong performance, we continue to closely monitor today's evolving economic environment.  Slide four provides some views on the current macro conditions. Measures of inflation remain persistently high and the Federal Reserve has signaled its intent to address this through restrictive monetary policy. Our business model has somewhat of a natural hedge against inflation as higher expenses are largely offset by the contribution inflation makes to our sales volumes and because our balance sheet is moderately asset sensitive, rate hikes improve our outlook for spread income, despite driving higher funding costs.  Perhaps more significantly, tighter monetary policy may have raised the risk of an economic recession, but behavior and trends from our consumer loan portfolio currently do not suggest that a downturn is imminent. Our credit metrics remain strong and sales are robust even as our customers maintain high payment rates. Similarly, most labor market measures indicate employment conditions remain broadly supportive of consumer financial health and credit performance.  Nonetheless, should there be changes in macroeconomic conditions, we will make the appropriate adjustments. Our through-the-cycle underwriting considers all stages of a credit cycle including downturns. And our history of conservative credit management positions us well for any future periods of economic stress. Our actions during the recent pandemic are a good example of how nimbly we can respond to changing circumstances. We also maintain a strong balance sheet and capital position. Our current level of common equity Tier 1 is 14.2%, well above our internal target and regulatory minimums. And as John will detail, our reserves capture our estimate of losses over the expected life of our loan portfolio.  This brings me to one topic about which we want to make you aware, as we addressed in our press release, we are temporarily suspending our share repurchase program in light of an internal investigation being conducted by a Board appointed independent special committee. This investigation concerns our student loan servicing practices and related compliance matters. And while we cannot comment further at this time, I can say, this matter was contemplated as John reaffirms our expense guidance for the year. In summary, while macroeconomic conditions remain somewhat uncertain, we continue to advance our strategic goals and are benefiting from the combination of strong sales and receivables growth, expanding margin and slowly normalizing credit. These trends give us confidence in our outlook over the forecast horizon, while our reserves and high level of capital position us to withstand a range of macroeconomic environments.  I'll now turn the call over to John to review key aspects of our financial results in more detail.\nJohn Greene: Thank you, Roger, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with our financial summary results on Slide five.  As Roger indicated, we reported net income of $1.1 billion, which was 35% lower year-over-year. However, I'd like to call out two items. The first is that in the second quarter of last year, we had a $729 million unrealized gain on our equity investments compared to a $42 million loss this quarter. Adjusting for these, our earnings would have been $4.07 per share in the current quarter.  Second, the provision for credit losses increased from the prior year due to a $110 million reserve build in the current quarter compared to a $321 million reserve release in the prior year. The current quarter reserve build was primarily driven by higher loan receivables. Excluding the impact of these two items, our profit before tax and reserves would have been up 38% year-over-year. Moving to Slide 6. Net interest income was up $311 million or 14%, driven by higher average receivables and improved net interest margin. NIM was 10.94%, up 26 basis points from the prior year and 9 basis points sequentially. On both a year-over-year and sequential basis, the increase in net interest margin reflects the higher prime rate and favorable funding mix, partially offset by increased promotional balances and higher funding costs. Receivable growth was driven by card, which increased 15% year-over-year from strong sales and robust new account growth last year and into this year. In the quarter, the payment rate increased 40 basis points and remains more than 500 basis points above the pre-pandemic level. We continue to expect that the normalization in payment rate will be modest this year and will continue through the back half of 2023. Organic student loans increased 4%, reflecting solid growth in originations. Personal loans were up 4%, reflecting a return to growth. We view this as a validation of our approach to marketing, underwriting and pricing of this product over the past several quarters, and we believe we are competitively positioned to grow, particularly relative to some non-bank originators. In terms of funding mix, our customer deposit balances were flat year-over-year and up 1% sequentially. Increases in our savings balances offset the run-off in higher-cost CDs. Our strong asset growth may cause deposits to vary as a proportion of our funding mix, but we continue to target 70% to 80% deposit funding over the medium term. Looking at other revenue on Slide 7. Excluding the impacts of equity investments detailed earlier, non-interest income increased $105 million or 19%. This was driven by higher net discount and interchange revenue, which was up $51 million or 15%, reflecting strong sales and favorable sales mix, partially offset by higher rewards. Sales were up 18% year-over-year with growth across most categories. For the first half of the year, our sales growth was 20%. We estimate that inflation contributed between 200 and 300 basis points to this figure. Strong sales also drove higher rewards expense compared to the prior year. Our rewards rate increased 6 basis points year-over-year, reflecting two factors: our standard 5% category aligning with customer needs included gas this quarter. Second, the substantial growth in new accounts over the past year increased the cost of our cash-back match. However, on a sequential basis, the reward rate was up 1 basis point and up 3 basis points through the first half of the year. This is consistent with our expectations of 2 to 4 basis points of annual rewards cost increases. Loan fee income was up $37 million or 35%, primarily driven by an increase in late fee instances. Moving to expenses on Slide 8. Total operating expenses were flat year-over-year and up 8% from the prior quarter. Compensation costs were up slightly year-over-year, primarily due to increased headcount and higher average salaries. Like many organizations, we are seeing salary in wage pressure, which will likely continue through the balance of this year and into next year. Marketing expenses increased $79 million or 45% as we continue to invest for growth in our card and consumer banking products. We grew new card accounts by 39% from last year's second quarter. This speaks to the strength of our brand, the relevance of our value proposition, and the benefits of our investments in targeting analytics. As Roger discussed, we closely track economic and competitive conditions, and we remain disciplined about our through-the-cycle approach to underwriting. This approach contributes to our confidence about investing in brand and acquisition. Moving to credit performance on slide nine. Net charge-offs remain low and were in line with expectations for continued credit normalization. Total net charge-offs were 1.8%, 32 basis points lower than the prior year and up 19 basis points from the prior quarter. Total net charge-off dollars were down $27 million from the prior year and up $61 million sequentially. In the card portfolio, the net charge-off rate increased 17 basis points sequentially or $5 0 million. Looking at our receivables, we are not seeing evidence of emerging credit stress at this point. Our delinquencies are virtually unchanged from the first quarter. And while we expect some increases in delinquencies over the back half, this is consistent with our outlook for steady credit normalization into 2023. Turning to the discussion of our allowance on slide 10. This past quarter, we increased our allowance by $110 million, largely due to higher receivable balances. Our reserve rate continued to decline, however, dropping 31 basis points to 6.8%. As a reminder, our reserves are based on our expectation of life of loan losses. On the macroeconomic view, we believe the balance of risk has shifted to include the potential for an economic slowdown resulting from Fed policy actions. For us, the most significant driver of loss is changes to employment conditions. As Roger mentioned, current labor -- the current labor market conditions remained healthy. And as examples, the number of job openings still exceeds the number of unemployed people and the unemployment rate remains low, but unemployment claims have started to creep up. As part of our reserving process, we consider the prospects of higher unemployment and a range of macroeconomic scenarios. Looking at slide 11. Our common equity Tier 1 for the period was 14.2%, well above our 10.5% target. The strength of our capital position is underscored by the recent CCAR's regulatory stress test. Based on the CCAR's results, our preliminary stress capital buffer should decrease by 110 basis points, which effectively lowers our minimum required CET1 ratio to 7%, the lowest possible ratio. We repurchased $601 million of common stock during the quarter and declared a quarterly common dividend of $0.60 per share. Concluding on slide 12. As we look into the back half of this year, our perspectives for 2022 remains favorable. We are improving some elements of our expectations. We are revising our view on loan growth to low teens, continued strong sales and new account acquisitions through the second quarter support our confidence in this outlook. There is no change to our view on NIM. We continue to see 5 to 15 basis points of upside for the full year relative to the first quarter level of 10.85%. Our expectations for expenses remain at mid-single-digit growth versus last year. We still expect marketing costs to come in above 2019 levels, with non-marketing expenses to increase by low single-digits. We are improving our credit outlook. We now expect net charge-offs to be between 1.9% and 2.1% for the full year and we intend to return to share repurchases at an appropriate time in the future. In summary, loan growth accelerated as we benefited from robust sales and strong account acquisition. Credit performance remained solid, reflecting our disciplined approach to underwriting and credit management. We manage operating expenses while investing in new account acquisition, brand and digital capabilities and our balance sheet and capital position are strong. The results demonstrate the resiliency of our integrated digital banking and payments model, and I'm confident that we are well positioned for continued profitable growth through a range of economic conditions. With that, I'll turn the call back to our operator, Katie, to open the line for Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you.  Thank you. Our first question will come from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.\nMoshe Orenbuch: Great. Thanks and really strong results in terms of accounts and loan growth. And maybe, Roger, could you just talk a little more detail about kind of as you see the competitive environment, you're adding a lot of accounts. I know you've talked about how you kind of originate them with a through-the-cycle approach. But just talk a little bit about both how you see the competitive environment and how you see what's your -- any kind of tweaks you are making because of the current environment? And talk about that in terms of the outlook. Thanks so much.\nRoger Hochschild: Sure, Moshe. Thanks for the question. I would say the competitive environment remains intense with the consumers staying strong. We are seeing strong levels of marketing from most of our prime competitors, but I think our differentiated value proposition is succeeding well in the marketplace across all of our products. From a credit standpoint, I would say we're roughly back to where we were pre-pandemic. But keep in mind, that's sort of a late cycle approach that we had towards the end of 2019. So we think we remain conservative on credit, but the differentiation for the brand and the product are really working well to drive growth even in this competitive environment.\nMoshe Orenbuch: Great. Thanks. And just as a follow-up, again on the student loan side, given that this is the key quarter coming up in terms of originations. Last quarter, you talked a little bit about how you expected to have some advantages versus market funded players. Obviously, there's -- you've got the issue that you've got from a compliance standpoint. You talked about how that could impact you from an origination standpoint and if that does, how long that could last?\nRoger Hochschild: Yes. We are moving forward with our plans for peak season. Again, what has been a wild card over the last couple of years has been sort of overall number of kids going back to school and their demands for funding. So, I think that the market size is always a bit uncertain. But we feel good about how prepared we are as we move into the peak origination months.\nMoshe Orenbuch: Thanks very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Bill Carcache with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.\nBill Carcache: Thank you. Good morning, Roger and John. You guys certainly have historically remain profitable through the cycle with risk-adjusted yields remaining quite strong even in a deep recession like we saw in \u00e2\u0080\u009908. And it makes sense that you're continuing to invest here against the backup that we're in. But could you maybe frame for us, what it would take to curb your appetite for investing for growth? And maybe just, what it would take for you to have a pullback?\nRoger Hochschild: Yes. Thanks for the question. So, there are a whole series of things we carefully monitor in terms of the health of our customers and portfolio, and that goes into our appetite for growth. I would say part of the things we watch most carefully externally are the job market and rising unemployment. And so, we have a finely tuned playbook in terms of how we'll adjust originations? But we continue to originate throughout the cycle. And so even during the financial crisis that you referred to, we kept up a certain level of account production even as we became more conserve in credit. In our underwriting always uses a through-the-cycle approach as we think about the profitability of accounts, we're booking. So those are some of the things we'd look at.\nBill Carcache: Thank you and if I may follow up on that. Maybe could you also frame how you're thinking about the risk that -- the strength that we're seeing in the consumer and labor markets is in and of itself inflationary and could leave the Fed to have to do more and since we know that monetary policy operates with long and variable lags, the increases in unemployment that follow those Fed hikes, tend to be quite lagged. And so those effects could take some time to show up.  Maybe can you just speak to that dynamic, how that feeds, if that feeds in any way into your reserving models. We haven't had a significant inflation cycle in a long time. And so, there are some concerns that current underwriting models may not be picking that up, would love to hear your thoughts on that? Thank you.\nJohn Greene: Yes. Hey Bill, I'll take that one. Good question. We spent plenty of time thinking about it. So, inflation unto itself is not correlated to loan losses based on all the historical data we've looked at. Now certainly, we've seen some changes in consumer behavior. So, we'll keep an eye on it. But typically, it would be unemployment or changes in employment levels overall.  I have a particular view that as we try or the Fed tries to deal with the inflation situation, certainly it's going to be quite a period of time before the job market is directly impacted in a significant way. So, unemployment remains super low, so 3.5%, there's still about 11.3 million job openings right now versus 6 million people looking for jobs. Spending remains robust. And credit is performing very, very well. So, as we look at those factors, we're going to keep an eye and see if there's any material changes on that. But in terms of reserving at this point, that that life of loan approach that we take, looking at broad macros as well as portfolio performance gave us confidence in the reserving levels we chose and the corresponding reduction in the reserve rate. So, we'll keep an eye on it and update it quarterly.\nBill Carcache: That's very helpful. Thank you, Roger, John. appreciate it. .\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Your line is now open.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Thanks. Good morning. I guess my first question is on the share repurchase suspension. Obviously, that decision was probably not something that was taken lightly. Could you just talk about the thought process in making that decision, given all the positive news on your excess capital and stress capital buffers and such. I mean should we infer that the size and scope of damages could be pretty significant?\nRoger Hochschild: Thanks for the question, Sanjay. I think I tried to address that when I said our expense guidance that John reaffirmed includes our views on this matter. So, there are many factors that go into a share repurchase program. It's not just potential financial exposure. So -- and I would say, returning our shareholders' capital in the form of the repurchase has been a big focus for management and the Board and will continue to do. And that's why John said we hope to get back to the repurchase program as soon as we are able.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Okay. And then, I guess, a question for John, just on NIM. Obviously, I think like the Fed's posture has moved towards more rate hikes. I'm just curious your NIM expectation is sort of unchanged. But maybe you could just talk about what went into that and if you're seeing any changes in deposit betas?\nJohn Greene: Yes. Thanks Sanjay. So, the NIM guidance gave a range of benchmarking off the 10.85%, and we said five to 15 basis points range of upside from that. Based on the Fed actions to-date, we're tracking towards the upper end of that guidance range at this point. So, that's a positive. We are seeing deposit costs increase and that's a function of two things. The competitive environment and then also the fact that we had record loan growth in the quarter at 13%. So, the funding mix, as I said in my prepared remarks, that will likely change in the back half of the year. And we're going to continue to focus on that 70%, 80%. So, competitively, we're not going to lead certainly in terms of deposit pricing, but we're going to respond to ensure we remain very competitive and have a proposition -- a strong value proposition for our customers. So, how that translates into betas, it's hard to call right now. But I would say the first part of the year, we had a very, very low beta. I would expect that to normalize as the funding environment migrates.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Rick Shane with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\nRick Shane: Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question. When we look back at some of the changes over the years like the promulgation of the CARD Act, there were impacts that people thought would be cyclical that became secular in terms of loss rates, in terms of yields. I'm wondering when we look at payment rates today, if there's something that you guys might see that suggest that this is more of a secular change than a cyclical change.\nJohn Greene: Yes. Thanks, Rick. So -- yes. It's hard to call it right now. But we do have some preliminary data that shows that the decrease in the use of cash and the touchless transactions you may do at Starbucks or other institutions where folks previously would use cash. A lot of that's gone away. So it's creating a higher level of transactions through our card. Good thing for us from an interchange perspective, but also that cash that folks used to expend, I believe there's some portion of it that is now going to pay down balances which is increasing the payment rate. Now -- how much is that? It's hard to call right now. We're about 500 basis points higher than the pre-pandemic level. If I were to ask to give a range, I would say maybe 100 to 200 basis points of that could be a permanent change. And then the rest has to do with the strength of the portfolio and the strength of the consumers.\nRick Shane: Got it. It's helpful. And I agree with that conclusion. It just feels like on a day-to-day basis, we're all using less cash. And I'm wondering if that's just driving more and more -- creating more and more transactors for you guys.\nJohn Greene: Yes. Thanks for the question. Anything else? .\nRick Shane: That's it. Thank you, guys.\nJohn Greene: Yes.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nRyan Nash: Hey, good morning, John. Good morning, Roger. So John, maybe a question on the allowance. If I look I recognize that, obviously, this is a life of loan count. But when I look at the level of reserve today, you're only modestly below where you were at March of 2020, call it low 7s versus high 6s. So can you maybe just give us a little bit more color in terms of what's assumed in the reserve in terms of scenarios. And if we see a modest downturn just given how healthy your consumers are, like what could that do to both losses in the allowance over time? Thanks.\nJohn Greene: Sure. So as I mentioned in my previous comments, we looked at a number of different scenarios. But I can give you a couple of data points here. In terms of unemployment, it ranged from a low of about 3.3 at the end of 2022 to a peak of 5.8 and then as we look for 2023, 3.5 to just about 5.5. We're seeing a level of GDP growth slowing. We haven't baked in a full recession, but certainly, the GDP does reduce and is near 0 in one of the scenarios we ran. And the employment situation is still as robust, and we certainly considered that as well. So, as we look out into '23, we're going to evaluate what the macro conditions are and the impact on life of loan losses.  But for me, is the portfolio performance really, really strong, job market really, really strong, uncertainty on the broad macros and we conservatively model those. So overall, I feel like we're 100% consistent with how we've reserved in the past. We've taken that through the cycle, underwriting approach that has benefits through into the portfolio, and we've been conservative in our process to ensure that our reserves are fairly stated under GAAP.\nRyan Nash: Got it. And maybe, Roger, maybe a follow-up to Sanjay's question. I guess, given that it doesn't sound like you're expecting much in terms of cost from this investigation, I guess, maybe just talk about -- to spend the buyback? And I know that you're limited in what you could say, but any sense for the timing of how long an investigation like this could take? Thanks.\nRoger Hochschild: Yes. No, I am to your point, limited what I can say. We can't really give you anything to expect in timing other than, you know our views on capital. And so as soon as we can, we hope to restart the buyback.\nRyan Nash: I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll figure that. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Mark DeVries with Barclays. Your line is now open. \nMark DeVries: Yes, thanks. Just one more question on the buyback. When you are able to resume, should we expect the cadence to kind of mirror what you did in the first half of this year, or could you accelerate repurchases?\nJohn Greene: We'll look at that, Mark. Certainly, we have that broad authorization for the Board for over five quarters. It's $4.2 billion to $4.3 billion of repurchases. So, depending on the pause, we'll see what we can do because certainly, we're over regulatory minimums, were certainly over our internal target. And as we've said previously, we're committed to stepping the CET1 ratio down to 10.5%. So, we'll do what we can do.\nMark DeVries: Okay. Great. And then maybe a question for Roger. I mean, just given kind of fintech valuations, is there anything that looks interesting here to deploy that capital inorganically?\nRoger Hochschild: Good question. I think while valuations have pulled back, I'm not sure there are any bargains yet. But for us, we've tended not to focus on partnerships and potential investments as opposed to acquisitions. And a lot of capabilities, given our great technology team, we feel like we can build ourselves. So, we have a good business development effort that what was out there, but I wouldn't necessarily expect something.\nMark DeVries: Okay. Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from John Pancari with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.\nJohn Pancari: Good morning.\nJohn Greene: Good morning.\nRoger Hochschild: Good morning, John.\nJohn Pancari: Just -- sorry, back to the student loan issue. Just -- I know you've given, all, that you can comment on, but there's also -- in the public, we know that there's also a consent order related to this with the CFPB, it looks like in 2020, and I believe it's even tied to a consent order for 2015. Did that impact -- did that influence the suspension? And was there something new that develops that caused the internal investigation?\nRoger Hochschild: I guess the only thing I can say is both the consent order and the investigation are in the area of student loan servicing. But beyond that, there really isn't anything else I can add at this time.\nJohn Pancari: Okay. All right. Thank you. Thanks for helping there. And then separately, just on the -- this is sort of related to it, but we're around the expenses. I know you indicated that the investigation is already contemplated into the expense guide. And I appreciate that color. Does that mean that there were potential expense offsets that would help keep the expense guide unchanged or that getting back to your earlier comment that there is unlikely to be an expense impact?\nJohn Greene: Yes. So John, the way I would think about it is we're continuing to kind of run and manage our business and try to be disciplined in the way we distribute expense dollars and spend expense dollars. Certainly, there's puts and takes in every single expense line. And we've continued to have our foot on the gas in terms of new account acquisition and media, which contributed to the marketing increases. The rest of it is we consider as part of the cost of our operation and we're trying to make it as efficient as we can.\nJohn Pancari: Okay. Thanks for that. If I could just ask one more on the credit side. I know the delinquencies edged up a little bit year-over-year for 2Q. Was -- did you see any pressure including in the lower FICO bands, or any color around the modest increase in delinquencies that you saw?\nJohn Greene: Yes. So what we're seeing is the lower FICO bands normalizing. So -- and you would expect those to normalize more quickly than the higher FICO bands and frankly, we consider that when we do our underwriting. What -- interestingly, what we've seen is early stage delinquencies across the board have corrected in later-stage buckets more quickly than we see it in the past. And some of that could be our -- some of the work we've done in terms of analytics an optimized time to contact and collection strategies and some of it could be just customer performance. So there's really no takeaways from the portfolio other than it continues to perform very, very well and gave us a degree of comfort as we reduce the overall reserve rate.\nJohn Pancari: Okay. Thanks for taking my questions.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nBetsy Graseck: Hi, good morning.\nRoger Hochschild: Good morning, Betsy.\nBetsy Graseck: Just on the investigation, one for me here. You did mention that it is embedded in your full year guide on expenses. And I'm wondering if we should take that to mean that you expect the review will be finalized by the end of this year. Is that a fair conclusion?\nRoger Hochschild: I wouldn't necessarily link those too. I mean, I think what we can say is that, we do not see anything that would change our view that nonmarketing expenses this year would grow in the low single digits. And we did indicate that we would hope to have it concluded, but it's done by an independent committee that reports to the Board.\nBetsy Graseck: Right. And the buyback restarting is a function of the investigation concluding, is that fair rather than like a regular CET1 level?\nRoger Hochschild: Yes. The termination of the buyback has nothing to do with our capital levels. It does not necessarily require the investigation to be fully complete for us to resume there are many complex factors that go into it.\nBetsy Graseck: Okay. So, it's a bit open-ended on our end, thinking about when to put it back in the model. I realize you understand that. So, I suppose it will be a wide range of opinions after this call on that. just on the business, can we talk a little bit about the interchange rate, the gross interchange rate has been really strong in recent quarters. And wondering if there's anything in particular driving that, are there increases in competitors that you're matching or is there something else going on? Thanks.\nJohn Greene: Yes. The overall interchange has largely been a function of the robust sales volume. So, we're up \u00e2\u0080\u0093 our sales were up 20% through the first half of the year, 18% through the \u00e2\u0080\u0093 into the second quarter. So that's driving overall interchange. Now mix does come into play in terms of the interchange rate. And obviously, we don't spend a lot of time discussing that.  But overall, the solid business performance is driving interchange. And then maybe your follow-on might be, rewards. We did see a spike in rewards which to me, wasn't a bad thing whatsoever. What happened was gas was one of the 5% categories in the quarter, everybody knows about the inflation at the pump. So, we had a larger percentage of customers maxing out on that 5% category, which drove the rate up. But overall, the rate \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the rate is \u00e2\u0080\u0093 we expect 2 to 4 basis points of inflation there. So, interchange in the aggregate, super strong interchange rate very, very solid rewards coming in at expectations.\nBetsy Graseck: Got it. Yes. And that was the follow-up. So, appreciate it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Meng Jiao with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.\nMeng Jiao: Hey good morning, guys and thanks for taking my question. John, you mentioned, I think, sales growth was about 18% through the end of second quarter. I wanted to see if that was sort of holding through the first three weeks of the third quarter? And then are you -- are there any specific verticals you called out in terms of sales volume?\nJohn Greene: Yes. So it is holding. So through Monday, it was up 17%. So again, incredibly robust. Those figures actually have surprised me a little bit to the upside, which is nice. We're seeing travel increase. Obviously, we're seeing petroleum increase. And the everyday categories have increased. The one thing that we did see through the first half is home improvement spend actually decrease versus everyday spend. So it's still positive year-over-year, but not increasing at the same rate as everyday spend in other retail.\nMeng Jiao: Okay. Got it. That makes sense. And then, I guess secondly, are you guys sort of seeing any change in consumer behavior in regards to the inflationary environment in terms of sort of any substitution effects or anything that -- any color there would be helpful.\nJohn Greene: Yes. We're seeing a little bit of it. We believe that in terms of gas that there's -- certainly, it's significantly up year-over-year, but call it the volume of transactions indicate a certain level of substitution or decrease in consumption levels. And then across the other categories, nothing discernible at this point, but we do expect in the second half of this year with the high rate of inflation that consumers are going to make some choices and substitutions or decrease in consumptions will likely happen.\nMeng Jiao: All right. Great. Thank you, guys.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Kevin Barker with Piper Sandler. Your line is now open.\nKevin Barker: Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Just one last follow-up on the student loan side. You had -- the charge-offs ticked up, although they're fairly low still on student loans, but it is still higher than what we've seen from a quarterly run rate basis for the last few years. Is there anything related there to the investigation on why the charge-offs may have ticked higher just in this particular quarter, given credit metrics have been extraordinarily good within that portfolio?\nRoger Hochschild: Yes. No, those aren't linked. And actually, I would view it as sort of a one-time move, and we feel very good about the credit in our student loan portfolio.\nKevin Barker: Okay. And then -- in regards to the outlook for NIM, I appreciate everything for this year. But as you look out, further out, just given the yield curve today, do you expect some reversion back to your longer-term NIM down to a low 10% just given deposit costs are likely to remain fairly elevated as we go into next year or maybe even continue to move higher, just given the short end of the curve moving higher combined with maybe a flattening on the long end. Is there anything you're seeing there that would cause NIM to maybe start to soften as we move into the beginning of next year?\nJohn Greene: Yes, good question. So I would say that. So my expectation is that NIM will peak this year. And there are a number of factors impacting it. Certainly, you mentioned deposit costs. That's going to kind of create some impact. We're going to have impacts on credit, which will impact it. But fundamentally, our funding mix has changed, which will, I believe, will drive improved net interest margin versus historical levels.\nKevin Barker: Okay. Thank you, John.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Mihir Bhatia with Bank of America. Your line is now open.\nMihir Bhatia: Good morning and thank you for taking the question. Maybe I'll start with just on the competitive intensity a little bit. You are seeing quite disciplined on revolves and operating costs even as you drive growth. Could you talk a little bit about where your account growth is coming from? And then even I ask is, we've seen a few aggressive offers around cashback introduced in recent months. That's historically been your daily  rig. So, I was curious if you are seeing any kind of impact from some of those offers out in the market?\nRoger Hochschild: Yes. There are different competitors who will do different offers. We tend to try and be more consistent and sustainable. So, we like the double cash back for the first year has worked very well for us. So yes, someone will be $300, $500, you'll see different issuers doing very long-term balanced transfers. We just don't think that's really driving sustainable growth. And a lot of that promotional activity can drive sort of new accounts, but not necessarily long-term relationships. So, we like our long-term focus and approach, and it has served us well in a variety of competitive environments.\nMihir Bhatia: Thank you. Sorry, and I don't mean to beat the dead horse here, but for me, just one question on the buyback suspension. Is that something that regulators require or encourage you to do, while you get your arms around the servicing issues or was the decision to suspend buybacks is solely driven by you internally at DFS and the Board?\nRoger Hochschild: Yes. The decision was made by Discover.\nMihir Bhatia: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Dominick Gabriele with Oppenheimer. Your line is now open.\nDominick Gabriele: Hey great. Thanks so much for taking my question. I just -- I was wondering, how do you monitor want versus needs-based loan growth as the consumer might feel some pressure both on an individual and a portfolio level, how do you monitor that? Is there some internal data that perhaps we don't have access to that help you understand good borrowing behavior versus bad borrowing behavior, outside of delinquency trends? Thanks. And I just have a follow-up.\nRoger Hochschild: Yes. I mean it's a bit of a different answer for the portfolio, but for new accounts. But I would say for our new accounts, virtually all of it is want based, right. We're not accepting anyone who doesn't have significant availability on other credit cards outside of potentially our secured card where some of those people, we represent their first card. So, it really is about want and having a better value proposition than they're seeing with their other cards.\nDominick Gabriele: Okay. Great. Thanks for that. And then I was just curious, how long out does your through-the-cycle loss expectation look out for changes in economic overlays? So does it include today let's say, through the fourth quarter of 2023? Given our analysis, we see that, that's the rough timing where some of these macro domino's might fall into place with possibly higher unemployment related net charge-offs. So how does the weighting work and from a timing perspective of when you think an event may actually begin to occur and affect either your growth algorithm or your loss algorithm, anything you can provide on that would be really great. Thank you.\nRoger Hochschild: Yes. I would say we tend to look out roughly four to five years, but it is not as sensitive in terms of whether it's in 18 months or two years or 2.5 years. If you think about this is a long-term product and the cash flows associated with a credit card. And if you're not careful, you can find yourself whipping around your new account criteria every week based on sort of the latest change in economic forecasts. So while we can react quickly if it's far enough out, you're not going to see sort of continuous adjustment for that. And then for the portfolio, it's much more driven by account level dynamics, we're really looking at the risk of individual accounts.\nDominick Gabriele: Excellent. Thanks so much for overall.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Bob Napoli with William Blair. Your line is now open.\nBob Napoli: Hi, thank you and good morning, everybody. Really solid fundamental results, great to see. Just on the network, leveraging the network partnerships, when you have the Ariba CECL, but just having this global payments network. And just any update you can on your efforts to leverage that network. I know Ariba B2B payments, is there anything else on the table there? I mean, that continues to grow nicely. But just any thoughts there that make the network payments portion of the business, a larger part of the company.\nRoger Hochschild: Yes. Great question. So I did talk about one of our latest network-to-network deals. So we continue to invest and expand acceptance. And some of those deals to also generate volume and more cross-border volume for us. We remain in a wide range of discussions with different fintech players, truly around the world, but we tend not to comment on deals. I would point out too, though, we see a lot of value from the network, not just in the Payment Services segment, but for the differentiation and capabilities it gives our card issuing business, and in particular, the support it provides for rewards on debit, which is a real differentiator in the marketplace.\nBob Napoli: Thank you. My follow-up is, I guess, rewards on debit, it seems like a pretty good opportunity for Discover. Any updated information you can give us on cash back debit and the importance to your business over the next five years or potential benefits from that?\nRoger Hochschild: Yes. I think long term, it will be really exciting and a great benefit for the business and provide another entry point into the franchise versus most of our customers now coming from the credit card. We continue to be deliberate in terms of how we grow that. We want to make sure that we're really solid operationally that we have the right fraud prevention in place. But it's a business we're going to scale for the long term. And again, really excited about some of the early signs we're seeing in terms of cost per account and the usage from some of the customers we're putting on.\nBob Napoli: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.\nDon Fandetti: John, I was wondering on the funding side, if you could talk a little bit about the ABS market. I know you've been a bit more active in some other card issuers. Are you pleased with sort of the post-pandemic from a depth in pricing and leverage perspective and also the same question in terms of brokered CDs?\nJohn Greene: Yes. Yes. Great question. So, I'm going to kind of break it into kind of two categories. So very pleased with the team's execution when we go into the ABS market. I feel like the offerings are solid and the execution has been very, very good. The other side of the coin is, when we were in that low-rate environment, the all-in rates on some of those transactions were unbelievable. We were down at 71 basis points. So, it took me personally a little bit to come to terms with something in the 2s or 3s right now. But that's a function of where we are and relative to what we're driving in terms of top line yield, it's still super-efficient, secured and an important funding source.  The rest of the funding stack continues to be stable. The broker CDs that you mentioned, they're pricing higher than our online deposits and we're trying to get the right balance in terms of, ensure we're competitive, that we're not a market leader in terms of pricing \u00e2\u0080\u0093 deposit pricing decisions, but also not having to kind of lean into more expensive funding sources. But we'll continue to evolve there and make sure we're making good, efficient choices for the franchise.\nDon Fandetti: Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Arren Cyganovich. Your line is now open.\nArren Cyganovich: Thanks. The stronger loan growth that you've seen recently and increasing your guidance for the full year. How much of normalizing of payment rates is included in that versus just the continued momentum that you're having in acquiring new accounts?\nJohn Greene: Yes, Arren, thanks for the question. Very little. So, we modeled out a sustained high payment rate normalization back in through 2023 and frankly it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a payment rate should reduce, that provides some more energy for growth. We haven't anticipated that the drivers of growth have been kind of the strong sales performance, the new accounts that we put on the books in the later part of '20 and into '21 and into this year.  And customers putting our card top of wallet. So we've been really pleased and feel like the balance of kind of risk versus opportunity in terms of additional growth is probably more on the opportunity side at this point.\nArren Cyganovich: Okay. Thanks. And then secondly, the internal investigation, obviously, that's internal. Have you discussed this with the regulators already? Are they involved? I just want to know if there's another leg, so to speak to drop with respect to this? `\nRoger Hochschild: Yes. That's something I can't comment on. I would say though, in terms of internal, just to reinforce it is independent from the Board. But I can't comment on our discussions with regulators.\nArren Cyganovich: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's Q&A. I would now like to turn the program back over to Mr. Wasserstrom for any additional or closing remarks.\nEric Wasserstrom: Well, thank you all for joining us. The IR team is available all day, so please reach us with any additional questions, and have a great day.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's event. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Roger Hochschild",
            "content": "Thanks Eric and thanks to our listeners for joining today's call. I'm very pleased with our results this quarter. We generated robust revenue growth and strong earnings, while advancing several strategic initiatives. This solid performance reflects the strength of our integrated digital banking and payments model and our focus on managing the business, while investing for growth amidst an increasingly fluid macroeconomic backdrop. Let's turn to the summary on slide three. For the second quarter, we reported net income of $1.1 billion after-tax or $3.96 per share. Our operating metrics in the second quarter remained very strong. Loan growth increased by 13% from the prior year, driven by a combination of higher sales and strong new account growth and our asset quality remains solid across all products, reflecting our focus on prime lending and our approach to underwriting and credit management. We also advanced several strategic priorities in the quarter. In our Payment Services segment, we continue to expand our global acceptance through new partnerships. In June, we announced a network alliance in Italy with BANCOMAT, one of Europe's largest payment networks. This should provide our customers with access to merchants in Italy through BANCOMAT's extensive acquirer relationships. This partnership represents a significant advancement in our acceptance across Western Europe and we remain committed to expanding our international merchant coverage. In our Digital Banking segment, our combination of industry-leading customer service and compelling products continues to differentiate us in the marketplace. We were recently awarded the highest ranking in customer satisfaction by J.D. Power among mobile, credit card apps, and websites. We also achieved J.D. Power's top customer satisfaction and checking accounts for direct retail banks. This recognition underscores our customer service model, which combined with our compelling Cashback rewards and no fee products, create a value proposition that we believe others will struggle to match. For this reason, we're confident that we are well-positioned to generate substantial growth and shareholder value over the long-term. Notwithstanding our strong performance, we continue to closely monitor today's evolving economic environment.  Slide four provides some views on the current macro conditions. Measures of inflation remain persistently high and the Federal Reserve has signaled its intent to address this through restrictive monetary policy. Our business model has somewhat of a natural hedge against inflation as higher expenses are largely offset by the contribution inflation makes to our sales volumes and because our balance sheet is moderately asset sensitive, rate hikes improve our outlook for spread income, despite driving higher funding costs.  Perhaps more significantly, tighter monetary policy may have raised the risk of an economic recession, but behavior and trends from our consumer loan portfolio currently do not suggest that a downturn is imminent. Our credit metrics remain strong and sales are robust even as our customers maintain high payment rates. Similarly, most labor market measures indicate employment conditions remain broadly supportive of consumer financial health and credit performance.  Nonetheless, should there be changes in macroeconomic conditions, we will make the appropriate adjustments. Our through-the-cycle underwriting considers all stages of a credit cycle including downturns. And our history of conservative credit management positions us well for any future periods of economic stress. Our actions during the recent pandemic are a good example of how nimbly we can respond to changing circumstances. We also maintain a strong balance sheet and capital position. Our current level of common equity Tier 1 is 14.2%, well above our internal target and regulatory minimums. And as John will detail, our reserves capture our estimate of losses over the expected life of our loan portfolio.  This brings me to one topic about which we want to make you aware, as we addressed in our press release, we are temporarily suspending our share repurchase program in light of an internal investigation being conducted by a Board appointed independent special committee. This investigation concerns our student loan servicing practices and related compliance matters. And while we cannot comment further at this time, I can say, this matter was contemplated as John reaffirms our expense guidance for the year. In summary, while macroeconomic conditions remain somewhat uncertain, we continue to advance our strategic goals and are benefiting from the combination of strong sales and receivables growth, expanding margin and slowly normalizing credit. These trends give us confidence in our outlook over the forecast horizon, while our reserves and high level of capital position us to withstand a range of macroeconomic environments.  I'll now turn the call over to John to review key aspects of our financial results in more detail. Sure, Moshe. Thanks for the question. I would say the competitive environment remains intense with the consumers staying strong. We are seeing strong levels of marketing from most of our prime competitors, but I think our differentiated value proposition is succeeding well in the marketplace across all of our products. From a credit standpoint, I would say we're roughly back to where we were pre-pandemic. But keep in mind, that's sort of a late cycle approach that we had towards the end of 2019. So we think we remain conservative on credit, but the differentiation for the brand and the product are really working well to drive growth even in this competitive environment. Yes. We are moving forward with our plans for peak season. Again, what has been a wild card over the last couple of years has been sort of overall number of kids going back to school and their demands for funding. So, I think that the market size is always a bit uncertain. But we feel good about how prepared we are as we move into the peak origination months. Yes. Thanks for the question. So, there are a whole series of things we carefully monitor in terms of the health of our customers and portfolio, and that goes into our appetite for growth. I would say part of the things we watch most carefully externally are the job market and rising unemployment. And so, we have a finely tuned playbook in terms of how we'll adjust originations? But we continue to originate throughout the cycle. And so even during the financial crisis that you referred to, we kept up a certain level of account production even as we became more conserve in credit. In our underwriting always uses a through-the-cycle approach as we think about the profitability of accounts, we're booking. So those are some of the things we'd look at. Thanks for the question, Sanjay. I think I tried to address that when I said our expense guidance that John reaffirmed includes our views on this matter. So, there are many factors that go into a share repurchase program. It's not just potential financial exposure. So -- and I would say, returning our shareholders' capital in the form of the repurchase has been a big focus for management and the Board and will continue to do. And that's why John said we hope to get back to the repurchase program as soon as we are able. Yes. No, I am to your point, limited what I can say. We can't really give you anything to expect in timing other than, you know our views on capital. And so as soon as we can, we hope to restart the buyback. Good question. I think while valuations have pulled back, I'm not sure there are any bargains yet. But for us, we've tended not to focus on partnerships and potential investments as opposed to acquisitions. And a lot of capabilities, given our great technology team, we feel like we can build ourselves. So, we have a good business development effort that what was out there, but I wouldn't necessarily expect something. Good morning, John. I guess the only thing I can say is both the consent order and the investigation are in the area of student loan servicing. But beyond that, there really isn't anything else I can add at this time. Good morning, Betsy. I wouldn't necessarily link those too.

            "name": "John Greene",
            "content": "Thank you, Roger, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with our financial summary results on Slide five.  As Roger indicated, we reported net income of $1.1 billion, which was 35% lower year-over-year. However, I'd like to call out two items. The first is that in the second quarter of last year, we had a $729 million unrealized gain on our equity investments compared to a $42 million loss this quarter. Adjusting for these, our earnings would have been $4.07 per share in the current quarter.  Second, the provision for credit losses increased from the prior year due to a $110 million reserve build in the current quarter compared to a $321 million reserve release in the prior year. The current quarter reserve build was primarily driven by higher loan receivables. Excluding the impact of these two items, our profit before tax and reserves would have been up 38% year-over-year. Moving to Slide 6. Net interest income was up $311 million or 14%, driven by higher average receivables and improved net interest margin. NIM was 10.94%, up 26 basis points from the prior year and 9 basis points sequentially. On both a year-over-year and sequential basis, the increase in net interest margin reflects the higher prime rate and favorable funding mix, partially offset by increased promotional balances and higher funding costs. Receivable growth was driven by card, which increased 15% year-over-year from strong sales and robust new account growth last year and into this year. In the quarter, the payment rate increased 40 basis points and remains more than 500 basis points above the pre-pandemic level. We continue to expect that the normalization in payment rate will be modest this year and will continue through the back half of 2023. Organic student loans increased 4%, reflecting solid growth in originations. Personal loans were up 4%, reflecting a return to growth. We view this as a validation of our approach to marketing, underwriting and pricing of this product over the past several quarters, and we believe we are competitively positioned to grow, particularly relative to some non-bank originators. In terms of funding mix, our customer deposit balances were flat year-over-year and up 1% sequentially. Increases in our savings balances offset the run-off in higher-cost CDs. Our strong asset growth may cause deposits to vary as a proportion of our funding mix, but we continue to target 70% to 80% deposit funding over the medium term. Looking at other revenue on Slide 7. Excluding the impacts of equity investments detailed earlier, non-interest income increased $105 million or 19%. This was driven by higher net discount and interchange revenue, which was up $51 million or 15%, reflecting strong sales and favorable sales mix, partially offset by higher rewards. Sales were up 18% year-over-year with growth across most categories. For the first half of the year, our sales growth was 20%. We estimate that inflation contributed between 200 and 300 basis points to this figure. Strong sales also drove higher rewards expense compared to the prior year. Our rewards rate increased 6 basis points year-over-year, reflecting two factors: our standard 5% category aligning with customer needs included gas this quarter. Second, the substantial growth in new accounts over the past year increased the cost of our cash-back match. However, on a sequential basis, the reward rate was up 1 basis point and up 3 basis points through the first half of the year. This is consistent with our expectations of 2 to 4 basis points of annual rewards cost increases. Loan fee income was up $37 million or 35%, primarily driven by an increase in late fee instances. Moving to expenses on Slide 8. Total operating expenses were flat year-over-year and up 8% from the prior quarter. Compensation costs were up slightly year-over-year, primarily due to increased headcount and higher average salaries. Like many organizations, we are seeing salary in wage pressure, which will likely continue through the balance of this year and into next year. Marketing expenses increased $79 million or 45% as we continue to invest for growth in our card and consumer banking products. We grew new card accounts by 39% from last year's second quarter. This speaks to the strength of our brand, the relevance of our value proposition, and the benefits of our investments in targeting analytics. As Roger discussed, we closely track economic and competitive conditions, and we remain disciplined about our through-the-cycle approach to underwriting. This approach contributes to our confidence about investing in brand and acquisition. Moving to credit performance on slide nine. Net charge-offs remain low and were in line with expectations for continued credit normalization. Total net charge-offs were 1.8%, 32 basis points lower than the prior year and up 19 basis points from the prior quarter. Total net charge-off dollars were down $27 million from the prior year and up $61 million sequentially. In the card portfolio, the net charge-off rate increased 17 basis points sequentially or $5 0 million. Looking at our receivables, we are not seeing evidence of emerging credit stress at this point. Our delinquencies are virtually unchanged from the first quarter. And while we expect some increases in delinquencies over the back half, this is consistent with our outlook for steady credit normalization into 2023. Turning to the discussion of our allowance on slide 10. This past quarter, we increased our allowance by $110 million, largely due to higher receivable balances. Our reserve rate continued to decline, however, dropping 31 basis points to 6.8%. As a reminder, our reserves are based on our expectation of life of loan losses. On the macroeconomic view, we believe the balance of risk has shifted to include the potential for an economic slowdown resulting from Fed policy actions. For us, the most significant driver of loss is changes to employment conditions. As Roger mentioned, current labor -- the current labor market conditions remained healthy. And as examples, the number of job openings still exceeds the number of unemployed people and the unemployment rate remains low, but unemployment claims have started to creep up. As part of our reserving process, we consider the prospects of higher unemployment and a range of macroeconomic scenarios. Looking at slide 11. Our common equity Tier 1 for the period was 14.2%, well above our 10.5% target. The strength of our capital position is underscored by the recent CCAR's regulatory stress test. Based on the CCAR's results, our preliminary stress capital buffer should decrease by 110 basis points, which effectively lowers our minimum required CET1 ratio to 7%, the lowest possible ratio. We repurchased $601 million of common stock during the quarter and declared a quarterly common dividend of $0.60 per share. Concluding on slide 12. As we look into the back half of this year, our perspectives for 2022 remains favorable. We are improving some elements of our expectations. We are revising our view on loan growth to low teens, continued strong sales and new account acquisitions through the second quarter support our confidence in this outlook. There is no change to our view on NIM. We continue to see 5 to 15 basis points of upside for the full year relative to the first quarter level of 10.85%. Our expectations for expenses remain at mid-single-digit growth versus last year. We still expect marketing costs to come in above 2019 levels, with non-marketing expenses to increase by low single-digits. We are improving our credit outlook. We now expect net charge-offs to be between 1.9% and 2.1% for the full year and we intend to return to share repurchases at an appropriate time in the future. In summary, loan growth accelerated as we benefited from robust sales and strong account acquisition. Credit performance remained solid, reflecting our disciplined approach to underwriting and credit management. We manage operating expenses while investing in new account acquisition, brand and digital capabilities and our balance sheet and capital position are strong. The results demonstrate the resiliency of our integrated digital banking and payments model, and I'm confident that we are well positioned for continued profitable growth through a range of economic conditions. With that, I'll turn the call back to our operator, Katie, to open the line for Q&A. Yes. Hey Bill, I'll take that one. Good question. We spent plenty of time thinking about it. So, inflation unto itself is not correlated to loan losses based on all the historical data we've looked at. Now certainly, we've seen some changes in consumer behavior. So, we'll keep an eye on it. But typically, it would be unemployment or changes in employment levels overall.  I have a particular view that as we try or the Fed tries to deal with the inflation situation, certainly it's going to be quite a period of time before the job market is directly impacted in a significant way. So, unemployment remains super low, so 3.5%, there's still about 11.3 million job openings right now versus 6 million people looking for jobs. Spending remains robust. And credit is performing very, very well. So, as we look at those factors, we're going to keep an eye and see if there's any material changes on that. But in terms of reserving at this point, that that life of loan approach that we take, looking at broad macros as well as portfolio performance gave us confidence in the reserving levels we chose and the corresponding reduction in the reserve rate. So, we'll keep an eye on it and update it quarterly. Yes. Thanks Sanjay. So, the NIM guidance gave a range of benchmarking off the 10.85%, and we said five to 15 basis points range of upside from that. Based on the Fed actions to-date, we're tracking towards the upper end of that guidance range at this point. So, that's a positive. We are seeing deposit costs increase and that's a function of two things. The competitive environment and then also the fact that we had record loan growth in the quarter at 13%. So, the funding mix, as I said in my prepared remarks, that will likely change in the back half of the year. And we're going to continue to focus on that 70%, 80%. So, competitively, we're not going to lead certainly in terms of deposit pricing, but we're going to respond to ensure we remain very competitive and have a proposition -- a strong value proposition for our customers. So, how that translates into betas, it's hard to call right now. But I would say the first part of the year, we had a very, very low beta. I would expect that to normalize as the funding environment migrates. Yes. Thanks, Rick. So -- yes. It's hard to call it right now. But we do have some preliminary data that shows that the decrease in the use of cash and the touchless transactions you may do at Starbucks or other institutions where folks previously would use cash. A lot of that's gone away. So it's creating a higher level of transactions through our card. Good thing for us from an interchange perspective, but also that cash that folks used to expend, I believe there's some portion of it that is now going to pay down balances which is increasing the payment rate. Now -- how much is that? It's hard to call right now. We're about 500 basis points higher than the pre-pandemic level. If I were to ask to give a range, I would say maybe 100 to 200 basis points of that could be a permanent change. And then the rest has to do with the strength of the portfolio and the strength of the consumers. Yes. Thanks for the question. Anything else? . Yes. Sure. So as I mentioned in my previous comments, we looked at a number of different scenarios. But I can give you a couple of data points here. In terms of unemployment, it ranged from a low of about 3.3 at the end of 2022 to a peak of 5.8 and then as we look for 2023, 3.5 to just about 5.5. We're seeing a level of GDP growth slowing. We haven't baked in a full recession, but certainly, the GDP does reduce and is near 0 in one of the scenarios we ran. And the employment situation is still as robust, and we certainly considered that as well. So, as we look out into '23, we're going to evaluate what the macro conditions are and the impact on life of loan losses.  But for me, is the portfolio performance really, really strong, job market really, really strong, uncertainty on the broad macros and we conservatively model those. So overall, I feel like we're 100% consistent with how we've reserved in the past. We've taken that through the cycle, underwriting approach that has benefits through into the portfolio, and we've been conservative in our process to ensure that our reserves are fairly stated under GAAP. We'll look at that, Mark. Certainly, we have that broad authorization for the Board for over five quarters. It's $4.2 billion to $4.3 billion of repurchases. So, depending on the pause, we'll see what we can do because certainly, we're over regulatory minimums, were certainly over our internal target. And as we've said previously, we're committed to stepping the CET1 ratio down to 10.5%. So, we'll do what we can do. Good morning. Yes. So John, the way I would think about it is we're continuing to kind of run and manage our business and try to be disciplined in the way we distribute expense dollars and spend expense dollars. Certainly, there's puts and takes in every single expense line. And we've continued to have our foot on the gas in terms of new account acquisition and media, which contributed to the marketing increases. The rest of it is we consider as part of the cost of our operation and we're trying to make it as efficient as we can. Yes. So what we're seeing is the lower FICO bands normalizing. So -- and you would expect those to normalize more quickly than the higher FICO bands and frankly, we consider that when we do our underwriting. What -- interestingly, what we've seen is early stage delinquencies across the board have corrected in later-stage buckets more quickly than we see it in the past. And some of that could be our -- some of the work we've done in terms of analytics an optimized time to contact and collection strategies and some of it could be just customer performance. So there's really no takeaways from the portfolio other than it continues to perform very, very well and gave us a degree of comfort as we reduce the overall reserve rate. Yes. The overall interchange has largely been a function of the robust sales volume. So, we're up a\u0302\u0080\u0093 our sales were up 20% through the first half of the year, 18% through the a\u0302\u0080\u0093 into the second quarter. So that's driving overall interchange. Now mix does come into play in terms of the interchange rate. And obviously, we don't spend a lot of time discussing that.  But overall, the solid business performance is driving interchange. And then maybe your follow-on might be, rewards. We did see a spike in rewards which to me, wasn't a bad thing whatsoever. What happened was gas was one of the 5% categories in the quarter, everybody knows about the inflation at the pump. So, we had a larger percentage of customers maxing out on that 5% category, which drove the rate up. But overall, the rate a\u0302\u0080\u0093 the rate is a\u0302\u0080\u0093 we expect 2 to 4 basis points of inflation there. So, interchange in the aggregate, super strong interchange rate very, very solid rewards coming in at expectations. Yes. So it is holding. So through Monday, it was up 17%. So again, incredibly robust. Those figures actually have surprised me a little bit to the upside, which is nice. We're seeing travel increase. Obviously, we're seeing petroleum increase. And the everyday categories have increased. The one thing that we did see through the first half is home improvement spend actually decrease versus everyday spend. So it's still positive year-over-year, but not increasing at the same rate as everyday spend in other retail. Yes. We're seeing a little bit of it. We believe that in terms of gas that there's -- certainly, it's significantly up year-over-year, but call it the volume of transactions indicate a certain level of substitution or decrease in consumption levels. And then across the other categories, nothing discernible at this point, but we do expect in the second half of this year with the high rate of inflation that consumers are going to make some choices and substitutions or decrease in consumptions will likely happen. Yes, good question. So I would say that. So my expectation is that NIM will peak this year. And there are a number of factors impacting it. Certainly, you mentioned deposit costs. That's going to kind of create some impact. We're going to have impacts on credit, which will impact it. But fundamentally, our funding mix has changed, which will, I believe, will drive improved net interest margin versus historical levels. Yes. Yes. Great question. So, I'm going to kind of break it into kind of two categories. So very pleased with the team's execution when we go into the ABS market. I feel like the offerings are solid and the execution has been very, very good. The other side of the coin is, when we were in that low-rate environment, the all-in rates on some of those transactions were unbelievable. We were down at 71 basis points. So, it took me personally a little bit to come to terms with something in the 2s or 3s right now. But that's a function of where we are and relative to what we're driving in terms of top line yield, it's still super-efficient, secured and an important funding source.  The rest of the funding stack continues to be stable. The broker CDs that you mentioned, they're pricing higher than our online deposits and we're trying to get the right balance in terms of, ensure we're competitive, that we're not a market leader in terms of pricing a\u0302\u0080\u0093 deposit pricing decisions, but also not having to kind of lean into more expensive funding sources. But we'll continue to evolve there and make sure we're making good, efficient choices for the franchise. Yes, Arren, thanks for the question. Very little. So, we modeled out a sustained high payment rate normalization back in through 2023 and frankly ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s a payment rate should reduce, that provides some more energy for growth. We haven't anticipated that the drivers of growth have been kind of the strong sales performance, the new accounts that we put on the books in the later part of '20 and into '21 and into this year.  And customers putting our card top of wallet. So we've been really pleased and feel like the balance of kind of risk versus opportunity in terms of additional growth is probably more on the opportunity side at this point."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the First Quarter 2022 Discover Financial Services Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. . Thank you. And I will now turn the call over to Mr. Eric Wasserstrom, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nEric Wasserstrom: Thank you, Ashley. And good morning, everyone. Welcome to today\u2019s call. I'll begin on Slide 2 of our earnings presentation, which you can find in the Financials section of our Investor Relations website, investorrelations.discover.com. Our discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. Please refer to our notices regarding forward-looking statements that appear in our fourth quarter earnings press release and presentation. Our call today will include remarks from our CEO, Roger Hochschild; and John Green, our Chief Financial Officer. After we conclude our formal comments, there will be time for a question-and-answer session. During the Q&A session, you will be permitted to ask one question, followed by one follow-up question. After your follow-up question, please return to the queue. Now, it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Roger.\nRoger Hochschild: Thanks, Eric, and thanks to our listeners for joining today's call. In my comments this morning, I'm going to address three topics, our strategic and financial highlights for the first quarter, the expected impact of the current environment on our 2022 results, and some of the exciting advancements we've made around our DE&I and ESG reporting.  Starting on Slide 3, we had another quarter of outstanding results with earnings of $1.2 billion after tax, or $4.22 per share. Our earnings this quarter was the result of consistent execution on our business priorities against the backdrop of complex economic and geopolitical conditions. Consistent with our expectations, our loan growth accelerated to 8% from the prior year, as we benefited from continued strong sales and investments in new account acquisition last year, and into 2022.  Year-over-year card sales were up 23% with improvement in all categories. There's been a lot of discussion about the impact of energy price inflation on consumer spending. We believe that higher prices at the pump were a relatively small contributor to sales volume, adding approximately 200 basis points to our first quarter volume growth. We also continue to lean into account acquisition, and new accounts grew 11% year-over-year with particular strength in the prime cashback segment, reflecting our attractive value proposition.  Credit performance remains strong, with credit losses normalizing in line with our expectations. This is an outgrowth of our consistent focus on prime lending and our strong credit management throughout the pandemic, along with robust labor market conditions. Importantly, we have not seen evidence of credit stress beyond the moderate pace of normalization that we anticipated coming into the year. In fact, as John will address later, we're narrowing our expectations for credit losses to the low end of our prior range.  We continue to effectively manage expenses while making investments for profitable growth, analytic capabilities and product enhancements. As our account growth demonstrates, we're making significant investments in card growth. But we're also focused on innovation in our non-card offerings to further enhance our full suite of digital banking and lending products.  In early April, we launched our cashback debit product. This product is digitally native, including a mobile first customer experience. It provides features like early access to paychecks, as well as items that others will struggle to match including no fees, 1% cashback on debit transactions and our industry leading service. We plan on investing more for the growth of this product with broad market advertising later this year.  Now, let me talk about how we expect the current environment to impact Discover. We provide some views on macro conditions on Slide 4. The most pressing issue is Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Naturally our primary concern is for the resulting humanitarian crisis in the wellbeing of the Ukrainian people as well as for our employees and customers with close ties to this nation.  From the more narrow perspective of our business, we currently have no activities in either country. And we do not anticipate any material impacts on our business from the war. We have indefinitely suspended our efforts to open an office in Russia. And while we have temporarily paused our certification of a Diners Club Bank issuing partner in Ukraine, we plan on moving forward as soon as we can.  The war in Ukraine and the resulting sanctions against Russia have also raised concerns about the risk of recession globally and domestically. We do not see any evidence of this across our consumer lending portfolio. Our credit metrics remain good and there is nothing we're seeing in terms of consumer spending or borrowing behavior that suggests that a broader downturn is imminent.  Another concern has been significant elevation and flattening of the yield curve, given the anticipation by the rates market around aggressive monetary policy from the Federal Reserve to stem high inflation. Because we are modestly assets sensitive, the potential for greater number of Fed rate hikes, has improved our outlook for spread income, which John will discuss momentarily. And while we're not immune from the effects of inflation, our business model has somewhat of a natural hedge, as the pressure that inflation may create on elements of our expense structure are partially offset by the contribution inflation makes to our sales volume.  In summary, while macro conditions are much more fluid than we had thought coming into this year, we're positioned to benefit from the combination of strong sales and receivables growth, expanding margin, and slowly normalizing credit. These trends give us confidence in our outlook over our forecast horizon.  Finally, I want to point out our new ESG related disclosures. In March, we produced our first Diversity Equity and Inclusion Transparency Report, which highlights our commitment to supporting a diverse workforce that reflects our communities and customers. We also recently published our first ESG summary that includes details on our greenhouse gas emissions among other items.  The data in our new reports is encouraging, so we intend to do more to reduce our impact on the environment, and to advance diversity and equity in our organization, and communities.  With that, I'll turn the call over to John to review our financial results in more detail, and provide an update to our expectations for the rest of 2022.\nJohn Greene : Thank you, Roger. And good morning, everyone. Once again, our results this quarter reflect strong execution on our business priorities with accelerating loan growth and solid credit performance.  I'll begin with our financial summary results on Slide 5. There are a few things I'd like to call out here. The first is that our net income is lower year-over-year because of our reserving actions. In the first quarter of last year, we had an $879 million reserve release, while this quarter included $175 million release. Adjusting for reserve changes, our profit before tax and reserves would have been up 19% year-over-year.  Second, our reported total revenue net of interest expense increased $107 million, or 4% from the prior year. However, this included $162 million net loss and equity investments. Excluding this loss, total revenue increased 10%. These points underscore the strength of our core earnings power even in a fluid economic environment.  Let's turn to the details of the quarter. Looking at Slide 6, net interest income was up $149 million or 6% driven by improved net interest margin and higher average receivable. NIM was 10.85%, up 10 basis points from the prior year and four 4 points from the prior quarter. The year-over-year increase in net interest margin reflects lower funding costs and a favorable shift in funding mix partially offset by a higher mix of promotional rate balances. We made further progress on our funding mix with consumer deposits now making up 71% of total funding.  On a sequential basis, the modest increase in NIM was driven by light link improved revolve rate on credit card loans partially offset by increased funding costs. The better revolve rate reflected a 70-basis point decline in the payment rate quarter-over-quarter. This helped boost sequential loan yields by 5 basis points. However, the payment rate remains nearly 500 basis points of pre-pandemic levels. We continue to expect that the normalization in the payment rate will continue through the back half of 2023.  Receivables were higher driven by card, which increased 10% year-over-year from the continued strong sales and robust new account growth last year and into this year. Organic student loans increased 4% reflecting solid originations through the 2021 peak season. Personal loans were down 1% due to a sustained high payment rate.  Looking at other revenue on Slide 7. Excluding the $162 million loss in equity investments, non-interest income increased $120 million, or 26%. This was driven by net discount and interchange revenue, which was up $79 million, or 33%, reflecting strong sales. Sales were up 23% year-over-year with growth across all categories. Inflation drove a modest portion of the growth in the quarter, and we expect that inflation will remain a benefit to sales growth over the short term.  Strong sales also drove higher rewards expense compared to the prior year. However, the rewards rate was down two basis points year-over-year. We still anticipate the full year rewards rate to increase two to four basis points.  Loan fee income was up $33 million, or 31%, primarily driven by an increase in late fee instances.  Moving to expenses on Slide 8. Total operating expenses were up $49 million, or 5% year-over-year. Excluding marketing investments, expenses increased just 1%. Compensation expense was slightly down year-over-year on lower bonus accruals and headcount, which was partially offset by higher average salaries. We expect some degree of salary and wage pressure in 2022, and possibly into 2023 as we take steps to remain competitive. Marketing expense increased $38 million, or 25%.  We continue to invest for growth in our card and consumer banking products, including support of our relaunch cashback debit products. Information processing increased $16 million, or 15% year-over-year versus a low level in the period a year ago. This expense was flat sequentially. Going forward, we will continue to prioritize investments in analytics to support growth, innovation, and generate operating efficiencies.  Moving to Slide 9. Net charge-offs remain low and we\u2019re in-line with our expectation for modest credit normalization. Total net charge offs were 1.61%, 87 basis points lower than the prior year and up 24 basis points from last quarter\u2019s record low. Total net charge-off dollars were down $160 million -- $169 million from the prior year and up $55 million sequentially.  Moving to the allowance for credit losses on Slide 10. This quarter, we released $175 million from reserves and our reserve rate continued to decline dropping 17 basis points to 7.1%. The reserve release primarily reflects the sustained strong credit performance in our portfolio, partially offset by loan growth.  Looking at the macroeconomic environment, the pandemic now has a lesser impact on her outlook. The primary sources of risk have shifted to the impacts of inflation and a potential slowdown from Fed actions. While the risk has shifted, the economic view of the U.S. consumer remains healthy. Looking at slide 11. Our common equity tier 1 for the period was 14.7%, slightly lower than the prior period and still well above our 10.5% target. We repurchased $944 million of common stock during the quarter executing on our remaining authorization. Our board of directors also approved a new $4.2 billion share repurchase program that expires on June 30, 2023 and increased our common stock dividend by 20% to $0.60 per share. This repurchase authorization represents our largest ever over a five quarter horizon. It is evidence of our commitment to returning excess capital to shareholders while sustaining our investments in strong organic growth. Concluding on Slide 12. Our outlook for 2022 remains favorable, and we are improving some elements of our expectations. Starting with loans, spending trends through the first quarter and a modest decline in the payment rates improved our conviction for high-single digit growth. We are revising our view on NIM. We now see 5 to 15 basis points of upside for the full year relative to the first quarter. This view includes five Fed rate hikes at 25 basis points each. Our prior view reflected two rate hikes of the same magnitude. If the Fed increases rates beyond this, it would provide modest upside to net interest margin. Despite inflationary pressures, there's no change to our guidance for operating expense. Marketing is expected to be above 2019 levels with non-marketing expenses up low-single digits. We are improving our credit outlook. We expect losses to be between 2.2% and 2.4% for the full year. While there's still some uncertainty about the back half of this year, our current credit performance and delinquency trends give us confidence in a tighter range. And as previously mentioned, our board recently approved a new share repurchase program and increased our dividend. In summary, loan growth accelerated as we benefited from robust sales and strong account acquisitions last year and into 2022. Credit performance reflected our disciplined approach to underwriting and credit management with moderate normalization as expected. We manage operating expenses while investing in new product, features and functionalities. And our highly capital generative model enable us to increase our dividend and share repurchase authorization while supporting strong organic asset growth. These results demonstrate the resiliency and flexibility of our integrated digital banking and payments model. And I'm confident that we are well positioned for continued profitable growth through a range of economic conditions. With that, I'll turn the call back to our operator to open the line for Q&A.\nOperator:  We'll take our first question from Bill Carcache with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nBill Carcache : Thank you. Good morning, Roger and John. \nRoger Hochschild: Good morning, Bill. \nBill Carcache : Competitive intensity and elevated expense pressures are leading your peers to report negative operating leverage. But you just reported over 500 basis points of positive operating leverage and your results certainly stand out. That degree of positive operating leverage was much stronger than I think anyone was expecting. Can you frame for us whether an efficiency ratio here in the 37% range is sustainable?\nJohn Greene : Hey, Bill. Thanks for the question. So certainly, we were pleased with the execution in the quarter. In terms of the specifics around efficiency ratio, what we've guided to in the past, and we're still holding there is that over the medium term, we would expect an efficiency ratio in the upper 30s.  Now this quarter certainly demonstrated some progress on that front. There's a bit of timing there. We kept our marketing guidance as we indicated before, which would bring that above 2019 levels. So there's a slight skewing towards the back half of the year.  We continue to invest for growth. There will be some upper funnel or broad market advertising as well. We're watching every dollar and making sure we get an appropriate return for our shareholders as we invested whether from an expense standpoint or from a loan lending standpoint.  So I don't want to get over our skis here on that efficiency ratio, strong execution. And we're going to continue to kind of work towards the medium term target.\nBill Carcache : Understood. That's helpful. If I may follow up on capital from the 14.7% CET1 level that you're at today, would you expect capital consumed through loan growth and the $4.2 billion authorization that you announced to be enough to get you down to that 10.5% target over the next five quarters? Or would you still expect to be sort of running above 10.5% at that point?  And how much flexibility do you see in that $4.25 billion, is there some chance we could see you take that higher depending on how things play out?\nJohn Greene : Yeah. So in terms of the CET1 ratio, we're sticking to a 10.5% target. There is about 175 basis points from CECL transition still yet to impact that CET1 ratio. So then that still puts us over 200 basis points above the target I just expressed.  So our thinking is that over the next two, three, perhaps four years depending on investments and the broad economy to close down to the 10.5% target. But in terms of the repurchase authorization, our board just approved it. So it would be way premature to talk about any changes to that.\nBill Carcache : Thank you for taking my questions. \nJohn Greene : Of course. Thanks, Bill.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nSanjay Sakhrani : Thanks, good morning. So Roger, you talked about the fluidity of the macro. And obviously, you've been through a number of these cycles as of you, John. I'm just curious, I know you're not seeing anything right now, but what's the playbook from here? I know you guys are leaning into growth, but if things suddenly change, how are you -- how would you react?\nRoger Hochschild: Yeah. Thanks, Sanjay. So in terms of lean to growth, I would say we're pleased with our growth but it remains balanced. In terms of the investments we're making, I expect our prime cost per account to be down from last year. So we're not in any way overinvesting.  By enlarge, our credit policies are back to where they were pre-pandemic. But as we said at that time, it was late cycle. So we're not exactly letting credit go. So we're still executing on a model of a disciplined growth even as the economic environment, especially the U.S. consumer remains strong.\nSanjay Sakhrani : And I guess maybe just following up on interest rate sensitivity. John, could you just talk about what you're seeing? I know you raised the NIM expectations, but any changes in sort of industry behavior around chasing rates from competitor banks and such? Maybe you could just talk about deposit beta. Thanks.\nJohn Greene : Yeah. Sure, Sanjay. So in terms of competitor behavior. So we have seen the competitor set that we benchmark ourselves against recently through this quarter, this past quarter increased rates and into this quarter. As you observed our behavior in the pandemic, we moved fairly aggressively down. As a matter of fact, we led our competitive set on the interest rate movements downward.  Now that we're in a rising rate environment. My expectation is we're going to be disciplined around that. So the principles are that we want to ensure we have a fair customer proposition. We also seek to kind of manage our interest costs as effectively as we can. So a combination of funding needs and competitive dynamics will dictate how we -- how and when we take deposit pricing actions.\nSanjay Sakhrani : Okay, great. Thank you.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Moshe Orenbuch. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nMoshe Orenbuch : Great. Thanks. I guess I was hoping for -- Roger, if you could talk a little bit about the competitive environment. Obviously, there's been a lot going on from some of your competitors. You talked about an 11% kind of growth in new accounts and your marketing expense was pretty much under control. So can you just talk about what it is that allows you to kind of do that and be comfortable in terms of your account growth going forward?\nRoger Hochschild: Sure. Thanks, Moshe. I think it really comes down to having a balanced and distinctive value proposition. The Discover brand is one of the most trusted brands in financial services. We provide a leading customer experience, both through the phone and digitally, which helps with retention as well as booking new accounts. We spent a long time building our skills around managing cash rewards, not just paying the higher rate but focused on every part of the process. And then continuing to innovate with new features and functionality, and you saw we just launched another one around helping protect your information from people reselling it on the web.  And so that I think, allows us to succeed in just about any environment. I view the card business is always competitive. Occasionally, there's a lull in the depths of a recession. But beyond that, it's our job to execute for our owners and grow. And you're seeing that this quarter, and I'm confident we'll be able to keep it going.\nMoshe Orenbuch : Great. Thanks. Maybe just a follow-up in a completely different direction, and that is you talked about the debit product. Can you just talk a little bit more about how much in resources you're putting behind that, how big it could be? And are there any other areas in which you can kind of leverage the network in the coming year? Thanks.\nRoger Hochschild: Sure. So the network does give us advantages for both our credit card issuing business, but also in terms of being able to support the 1% cashback on debit purchases, which is a real differentiator in the marketplace and builds on the Discover heritage with cashback in a new direction.  So we'll work our way into it. As John mentioned, we'll start broad market advertising for that product later this year. But we intend to sort of scale it gradually and build for the long-term. Overtime, we expect it to be a key part of our business.  And then we see advantages on our core card issuing business. Good example is our ability as we rollout SRC to pre-enroll our customers in a way that will be much more challenging for issuers on a third-party network. And finally, we remain focused on the payment services business. Monetizing our network investments through attracting third-party volume. \nMoshe Orenbuch : Great. Thanks very much. \nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nBetsy Graseck : Hi, good morning. \nRoger Hochschild: Good morning, Bet. \nJohn Greene : Good morning.\nBetsy Graseck : Nice growth in the quarter and a really nice pickup as we moved into end of period here. And I just wanted to get a sense as to how you're thinking about funding that continued strong growth as we move through the year given that you've got fed string the balance sheet and probably some deposits growth slow down. I looked at the liquidity balances, it looks like they're down to pre-pandemic lows, which -- well, during the pandemic, I should say. So I'm just thinking through deposit growth versus liquidity utilization versus wholesale funding, how should we think about how you're planning on ending the loan growth? Thanks.\nJohn Greene : Yeah. Great. Thanks, Betsy. So in terms of loan growth, we're going to take a balanced approach. So we talked about the target of 70% to 80% of our funding needs coming from OSA or deposits from our customer base. There's always the opportunity to go into the market and execute on broker CDs if liquidity needs to dictate that. We also issued an ABS transaction this past quarter at -- in a rising rate environment at pretty compelling rates overall.  So we're going to take that balanced approach. And you will see or we did -- if you haven't seen it, you'll see a little bit more of it. There'll be a little bit more broad market marketing on deposits and then also targeted marketing on deposits. And we're going to try to balance kind of the rate and the marketing in order to get the most effective cost of funds as we can. So that's essentially the strategy in a nutshell.  So we actually just went through a review from the Fed on our liquidity controls, and it's come out very, very strong. So we're pleased with the position of the business and the processes around it.\nBetsy Graseck : Okay. Great. And then just as a follow-up, you indicated, I think earlier, John, that the outlook that you have for NIM includes five rate hikes from the Fed. And maybe you could help us understand as we go to that six, seven, eight, nine rate hike that's expected. How does that -- how does your asset sensitivity change, if at all? Or should we just take what's in the 10-Q and apply that to whatever comes after Fed rate hike five?\nJohn Greene : Yeah. So the math on it would be for a 25 basis point increase somewhere between 3 and 5 bps to NIM on an annual basis. Now there's a bunch of other dynamics that obviously impact that, right? So you touched upon it earlier. So deposit pricing could impact that as well as the revolve rate, payment rate and then the credit impacts coming through net interest margin.  So a lot of dynamics there, and that was why we were conservative in terms of the number of hikes that we baked into this updated guidance. If there are more hikes and we're able to kind of effectively manage our liquidity, credit remains as we expect we would certainly see some upside from that guidance we provided.\nBetsy Graseck : But in the same like 3 to 5 bp range per 25?\nJohn Greene : Yes. \nBetsy Graseck : Okay. All right. Thanks. \nJohn Greene : And that's an annual basis.\nBetsy Graseck : Yeah. I got that. Thanks, John.\nJohn Greene : You got it. \nOperator: And we'll take our next question from John Pancari with Evercore. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nJohn Pancari : Good morning. As a follow-up to, I think it was Sanjay's question earlier just around deposit beta. Could you just tell us, do you -- what is your deposit beta assumption that's baked into your NIM guidance that you just mentioned?\nJohn Greene : Yeah. So thanks, John. So I don't really kind of think about this in terms of the deposit beta. What I do here is think about it in terms of broad principles. So the principles are that we're going to have an attractive proposition for our customers, and then we're going to manage interest costs as low as we can, while still maintaining that proposition I just talked about.  So I gave the point in terms of our actions during the pandemic when we had plenty of liquidity that we were a price leader down. And what I said in this rising rate environment, we expect that we're going to manage that interest costs very, very tightly in order to hopefully drive overall cost low, increase NIM and benefit shareholders.  So I don't want to kind of tag to a specific beta because they tend to be -- the numbers tend to be kind of off a month from now. \nJohn Pancari : Okay. All right. That's helpful. And then separately, just regarding the broader economic backdrop, given the Fed's efforts here to tame inflation and slow the economy and then it looks like this morning, we're getting a probably a disappointing print here on GDP. I'm curious, does your 2022 outlook factor in a slowdown in card spend at all?\nJohn Greene : It does. So actually, it's the 23% for the quarter was higher than we anticipated. We're frankly happy to see that. But there is a modest stepping down through this year. Effectively, it's hard to envision year-over-year kind of sales growth to continue in the upper 20s.\nJohn Pancari : Got it. Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nRyan Nash : Hey, good morning, guys. \nJohn Greene : Good morning.\nRyan Nash : John, maybe to follow up on a couple of the questions that have been asked. I think the focus has been on the liability side of the balance sheet as it pertains to rate sensitivity, but maybe we could talk a little bit about the asset side. I'm just curious, obviously, a lot has changed over the last few years. So maybe can you unpack a little bit for us have we seen significant changes in terms of floating rates relative to the last time rates rose? How much more improvement do you think we could see in revolve rates? And I guess, lastly, are we now back to more sustainable BT level such that we can see the asset yields improving with benchmark rates? I have a follow-up.\nJohn Greene : Okay. Thanks, Ryan. So there's a lot there. So revolve rate actually increased mildly in the quarter as the payment rate decreased by the 70 basis points that I spoke about. And by the way, that payment rate decline was essentially in-line with how we built our original guidance.  So as we think about inflation or other impacts that could drive payment rate lower, we've essentially derisked our guidance for loan growth. So we could see additional upside subject to payment rate and a bunch of other factors. The other pieces there in terms of kind of overall asset growth, what I would do is I would break it down into kind of the three categories or primary products. So card, you saw the double-digit growth there. Student loans at 4%, so we'll have another peak origination season coming in 2022. We hope to be able to execute there and continue to take market share. And personal loans, the growth was down 1%, but originations were up strong double digits. So we had a high payment rate impacting personal loans that we'll expect to moderate over time, given some level of loan growth in that product.  So I guess your question had a number of elements. Hopefully, I'll give you enough detail to be able to lease together the information you're trying to glean. \nRyan Nash : Yep. And maybe as a follow-up on credit. It was good to see you lowering the high-end of the range. And I understand you probably have about six months of visibility, so the fourth quarter is probably still hard to predict. But just looking at some of the credit metrics, delinquencies remained really, really benign, they're only up 20 basis points on the bottom. So can you maybe just talk about what's included now in the credit expectations? And do we have the potential to see credit come in towards the bottom end of the range over the course of the year? Thanks.\nJohn Greene : Yeah. So when we gave this initial guidance, we gave a pretty broad range, and we added around internally whether or not tightened it. And as the quarter unfolded, our conviction around that tighter range and perhaps the lower end group. So as you said, there's three months. The fourth quarter, we don't have perfect visibility in terms of kind of roll rate performance. But our modeling analytics have been actually surprisingly accurate and we have a high expectation there.  So we'll see how the rest of this quarter plays out. And hopefully, we can give updated guidance in a subsequent call.\nRyan Nash : Thanks, John.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Mark DeVries with Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nMark DeVries : Thank you. So your reserve rate is still about 100 basis points above CECL day one. Can you just talk about what assumptions are embedded in that? How we should think about that ratio of recession happens in the near term as some are expecting? I mean it would seem these levels that's almost already in the reserve. And alternatively, where could it go if some of this macro uncertainty clears?\nJohn Greene : Right. Thanks, Mark. So yeah, the reserve rate came in at 7.1% CECL, day one was 6.1%. So some context around CECL day one. So it was an accounting adjustment reflecting new guidance provided by the FASB, right? So we did our best to capture life of loan estimates of what losses would be and embed them in over reserve rate.  Now the macro environment at the time today has certainly changed. Portfolio dynamics have changed. As a matter of fact, the upper end of our kind of credit quality for the balance sheet is stronger than it was CECL day one. But there's still a degree of uncertainty that we are managing through. So as we've said in prior quarters, we're conservative on this. We want to make sure that we're appropriately capturing reserve rates under GAAP.  And if the broad macros are positive and the portfolio performance is positive, we could continue to step down through a combination of growth or reserve releases. And if the recession likelihood continues to increase, the broad macros could warrant either holding or perhaps even increasing. But overall, I think the takeaway here should be, Mark that the portfolio performance is really, really strong. There's no view of any damage to the consumer. There's no view that job losses are going to increase in the -- definitely through this year and likely through the first half of next year. So all those factors are positive from a credit and reserving standpoint.\nMark DeVries : Okay. Got it. And then just a clarifying question on the OpEx guidance. You indicated no change there despite what seemed like kind of growing wage inflation pressures that you've indicated you're not immune to. Should we assume that as that pressure kind of builds in the second half, that what happens as you flex down kind of other non-marketing non-wage expense to maintain some kind of a targeted operating leverage? \nJohn Greene : Yeah. So here's how we think about it. So -- and I've tried to articulate this over the past two and half years. We're going to be really disciplined in terms of how we spend our dollars. And Discover has got a long history of that. We've done some stuff to kind of drive both accountability and visibility of the expense base, which my sense is it has helped.  It's important to note that as we see opportunities, we're going to continue to invest. We also are -- as you paraphrased, we're seeing inflation coming in on salary and wages. We're also seeing it in our third-party spend. So we will effectively manage that in order to be able to deliver to the guidance we provided. And if we see incremental opportunity either for growth or otherwise, we'll invest to -- and we'll create transparency on that in order to drive long-term shareholder returns.\nMark DeVries : Okay. Great. Thank you. \nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Kevin Barker with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nKevin Barker : Thank you. When you consider this rate environment versus the last rate cycle, do you feel that the deposit betas that are going to play out in this cycle are going to mirror what we saw in the last cycle? And is that your base case, when you think about funding costs despite what might be a much more aggressive Fed this time around? \nJohn Greene : Yeah. Last time, I would take out as a proxy, but there's a couple of things that are different, right? So the pace of inflation is a heck of a lot higher here. We're at record levels of inflation.  The other thing that is different is the savings rate coming into this inflationary cycle, much higher. So those two dynamics could create some offsetting impacts. But it will be subject to kind of liquidity and loan growth across the industry and who's got a competitive proposition. And we're very comfortable with our proposition in terms of the customer experience, the kind of the rate. And if you take a look at our rate versus a brick-and-mortar bank, I could find it ironic that anybody keeps any excess cash in those institutions whatsoever.  So we're going to be diligent on it.\nKevin Barker : Okay. And then you mentioned that you're very disciplined on how you spend your dollars. You're pretty consistent on that commentary. Are you seeing anywhere where some of your competition may be a little exuberant in how they're spending in dollars just given the opportunity set in the market today?\nRoger Hochschild: Yeah. I would say, in general, in this business, you get diminishing returns on incremental investments in marketing. And so you have seen cycles in the past where people spend heavily after a while they look at the returns they got and maybe less happy with that. So we feel good about both what we're investing on the rewards side and the guidance we provide there of only 2 to 4 basis point increase. But also that we'll see cost per accounts at an attractive level. You're certainly seeing very heavy levels of investment out there that I would wonder whether or not they're going to be sustainable.\nKevin Barker : Thank you for taking my questions. \nOperator: And we'll go next to Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nDon Fandetti : Yes. Good morning. I know home equity is a small part of your business, but I didn't know if there was maybe a growing opportunity as a lot of the sort of cash out refi activity could potentially slow?  And then secondly, I think you have a partnership on account-to-account payments. I was just curious if you think that will take off a point of sale in the United States?\nRoger Hochschild: Yeah. So in terms of our home equity business, we do think a rising rate environment will be very constructive. Perversely, many households, their greatest asset could be their 3% mortgage. So while we're excited about it, it also isn't that huge.  On the payment side, we're excited about our partnership, but I don't see tremendous disruption coming to a point of sale and existing means of payment point of sale anytime soon. But we're excited to work with a broad range of partners and different fintechs who want to leverage our network capabilities. \nDon Fandetti : Thank you.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Rick Shane with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nRick Shane : Thanks everybody for taking my question this morning. Can you talk a little bit behaviorally about the stratification you're seeing in terms of borrower behavior, both in terms of credit performance and also in terms of spending behavior, discretionary versus non-discretionary ships across the portfolio?\nRoger Hochschild: Sure. Seeing strength across all categories. Revolver sales growth is probably a little higher than transactors growth, but that reflects our lend-focused model. But -- and that sales strength is continuing into April, where through, say, the 24 sales are still up 23% year-over-year. So consumer is good and breadth across all categories. In terms of different segments, from a credit standpoint, you do tend to see normalization occur faster at the lower end segments. But again, we're very pleased, and John mentioned that in his comments that the normalization is very much in-line with our expectations.\nRick Shane : Got it. And Roger, are you seeing any in that lower FICO band, any shift in terms of spending behavior from category to category?\nRoger Hochschild: Not necessarily. There's been a lot of volatility just as pandemic restrictions come and go, certainly, travel growth is up compared to what it was. But I'd really point towards breadth and growth and spend across all categories.\nRick Shane : Great. Thank you very much, guys.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Robert Napoli with William Blair. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nRobert Napoli : Thank you. Good morning. And congratulations. A really good quarter. I mean, Discover has been a model of consistency over the last decade plus, so it's just good to see.  Just on your cashback debit product, just thoughts on the growth of that business, the penetration rate? Any comments on some of the other banking like products in early paycheck, what kind of demand you're seeing for that product? And then economically, how you're going to monetize these banking products overtime?\nRoger Hochschild: Sure. It's still early days. So I probably won't provide much in the way of forecast, but we're very excited about the demand we're seeing. We think the product is positioned well to compete both with some of the newer fintech, neobanks but also with any traditional branch player that's out there. And overtime, the balances build slowly, but a lot of opportunities to cross-sell both other deposit products such as savings accounts and CDs, but also our broad range of card products and provide really a different entry point into the Discover franchise.  So our very much our focus is on building this for the long term. And as we said earlier, you'll start seeing more broad market advertising later this year for that product.\nRobert Napoli : Great. And then just any thoughts, Roger, on the competitive positioning of Discover today versus, say, five years ago, pre-pandemic five years ago, your ability to maintain or gain share while maintaining returns. I mean you've done so very nicely. But just any thoughts on the competitive position today versus, say, five years ago?\nRoger Hochschild: Yeah. I mean, I'd go back to the very kind comments you made at the beginning around 10 years of consistency. Even five years ago, a brand value proposition that's for trust, for a superior customer experience and for innovation on the feature side. Back then, it might have been the ability to freeze your card, now it's some of the things we do for our customers in terms of protecting their information online, but the focus remains the same. A very strong cash rewards program that competes well with anything out there.  You\u2019re pricing a little more intensity in the cash rewards space as some of the changes on miles programs through the pandemic. But we still compete very much the same way, but also still feel as good about our competitive position.\nRobert Napoli : Thank you. Appreciate it. \nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Mihir Bhatia with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nMihir Bhatia : Good morning. And thank you for taking my questions. Obviously really solid results here this quarter. So I guess some congratulations on that. But maybe to -- maybe you could just talk a little bit about Washington. Were you hearing more noise out of from there, both from the CFPB on the late season, which I guess, to a certain extent, kind of plays into your brand, about less fees and being consumer-friendly. But still, obviously, will have an impact for you to the extent I think yesterday, he announced or this week you announced he's talking about reopening the card act and the fees there. But also just on the student loan forgiveness side too, hearing more rumblings on that. So just what's going on with Washington your views on the situation? Thank you.\nRoger Hochschild: Yeah. Sure. So on the fee side, first, I'd say we have good relationships and enjoyed working closely with all of our regulators and by enlarge, are aligned in terms of wanting the consumers to be protected.  As you've seen, it's a pretty small percent of our revenues. We waived the first late fee for our Discover customers anyway. Right now, we're set at the safe harbor to the extent that, that changes we can change accordingly. But don't expect it to have an overly material impact.  Certainly, on the deposit side, the fact that we have no fees on any of our deposit products, positions us very, very well compared to our competitors. And it's a key part of our value proposition. In terms of student loans, we probably have seen some pressure on the payment rate just given the ongoing payment holidays that people have seen on their federal loan. It's important to realize that there's a big difference between the federal loan program and ours just in terms of who they give loans to, the types of educations they fund. As an example, we do nothing in the four-profit sector.  So yeah, we'll wait and see what comes out of Washington, but we don't expect it to be overly disruptive for our own student loan business.\nMihir Bhatia : Got it. Thank you. And then just turning back to credit for a second. Obviously, you're improving the outlook for this year. But -- how much of that is just a function of you gaining increased confidence based on the 1Q outperformance maybe versus any kind of change? I guess really what I'm trying to understand is, is the path to normalization changing? Or is the curve like from here like a little less steep than what you had maybe expected it to be -- like when do we get back to a normalized state? Is it the front half of 2023, the back half of 2023-2024? \nJohn Greene : Yeah. Thanks for the question, Mihir. While we said previously as we expected normalization through 2023. Now it's really hard to kind of predict anything when you get out, out in the kind of 2024 timeframe.  What I would say here is in terms of narrowing the range that was a function largely of increased confidence around our forecast with, frankly, an internal expectation that we're going to come in at the lower end of the range. So we're still giving ourselves some wiggle room here. But if things proceed as we expect them to, we'll be around the lower end of the range.\nMihir Bhatia : Thank you. \nOperator: And we'll take our next question from John Hecht with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nJohn Hecht : Thanks, guys. Most of my questions have been asked. But I guess -- turning to the student lending business. I mean it's important. I know it's small but important overall. But your results have been pretty consistent there, but I'm wondering maybe if you just have any thoughts on the moratorium, its impact on your business. And more importantly, when the moratorium expires, is there any broader effect that you would expect to see on overall credit trends even outside that specific segment?\nRoger Hochschild: Yeah. We've modeled it pretty carefully. We don't expect it to have a significant impact on card or personal loans. And as you think about student loans, it's important to look at how we underwrite those. For our undergrad loans, the vast majority are cosigned by the parent, very strong FICO scores. So we've seen probably a modest benefit on the credit side, but also a modest negative on the payment rate as students have more liquidity to put towards paying off their private student loans.  And again, I'd go back to the federal student loan program in terms of who participates, the amount of debt they have and the nature of the education they finance is dramatically different than our portfolio. \nJohn Hecht : Okay. Make sense. Thanks. \nOperator: And we will take our last question from Meng Jiao with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Your line is open. \nMeng Jiao : Great. Thanks for taking my question. Just a quick question on the personal loan portfolio. I guess are you sort of tightening standards there just given the pristine early stage and loss rates that we've seen there. But I'm also looking at the sequential sort of seven-quarter decline in yield. So just wanted to get your thoughts there? Or is it just sort of primarily the elevated payment rates that's driving that? Thank you.\nJohn Greene : Yeah, it's a couple of factors that are playing out here. So the first piece was when we came in -- prior to coming into the pandemic, we were pretty tight. And then we hit the pandemic and we tightened the personal loan product more stringently than any other product we had. And then we also we doubled down on our underwriting, including 100% verification of all loans. So we were super careful. That had an impact on growth levels. We have since reduced our manual underwriting. So it's back to kind of pre-pandemic underwriting standards. And we also opened up the credit box because what we are seeing is the loans that were in there were pristine. And we're now in a situation where we've got a high returning asset. We're looking at the competitive dynamics. We've made some conscious choice to reduce yield for the benefit of very profitable growth.  And as I said earlier in my comments, the expectation is that the payment rate will subside, and we'll see growth in loan balances in that product. Originations have been positively strong, as I said earlier as well.\nRoger Hochschild: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: We have no further questions. \nRoger Hochschild: Great. Thank you, Ashley. And with that, I think we'll conclude. If you have any additional questions, please feel free to follow up here in Investor Relations. And have a great day.\nOperator: Thank you. And this does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time. ",

            "name": "Roger Hochschild",
            "content": "Thanks, Eric, and thanks to our listeners for joining today's call. In my comments this morning, I'm going to address three topics, our strategic and financial highlights for the first quarter, the expected impact of the current environment on our 2022 results, and some of the exciting advancements we've made around our DE&I and ESG reporting.  Starting on Slide 3, we had another quarter of outstanding results with earnings of $1.2 billion after tax, or $4.22 per share. Our earnings this quarter was the result of consistent execution on our business priorities against the backdrop of complex economic and geopolitical conditions. Consistent with our expectations, our loan growth accelerated to 8% from the prior year, as we benefited from continued strong sales and investments in new account acquisition last year, and into 2022.  Year-over-year card sales were up 23% with improvement in all categories. There's been a lot of discussion about the impact of energy price inflation on consumer spending. We believe that higher prices at the pump were a relatively small contributor to sales volume, adding approximately 200 basis points to our first quarter volume growth. We also continue to lean into account acquisition, and new accounts grew 11% year-over-year with particular strength in the prime cashback segment, reflecting our attractive value proposition.  Credit performance remains strong, with credit losses normalizing in line with our expectations. This is an outgrowth of our consistent focus on prime lending and our strong credit management throughout the pandemic, along with robust labor market conditions. Importantly, we have not seen evidence of credit stress beyond the moderate pace of normalization that we anticipated coming into the year. In fact, as John will address later, we're narrowing our expectations for credit losses to the low end of our prior range.  We continue to effectively manage expenses while making investments for profitable growth, analytic capabilities and product enhancements. As our account growth demonstrates, we're making significant investments in card growth. But we're also focused on innovation in our non-card offerings to further enhance our full suite of digital banking and lending products.  In early April, we launched our cashback debit product. This product is digitally native, including a mobile first customer experience. It provides features like early access to paychecks, as well as items that others will struggle to match including no fees, 1% cashback on debit transactions and our industry leading service. We plan on investing more for the growth of this product with broad market advertising later this year.  Now, let me talk about how we expect the current environment to impact Discover. We provide some views on macro conditions on Slide 4. The most pressing issue is Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Naturally our primary concern is for the resulting humanitarian crisis in the wellbeing of the Ukrainian people as well as for our employees and customers with close ties to this nation.  From the more narrow perspective of our business, we currently have no activities in either country. And we do not anticipate any material impacts on our business from the war. We have indefinitely suspended our efforts to open an office in Russia. And while we have temporarily paused our certification of a Diners Club Bank issuing partner in Ukraine, we plan on moving forward as soon as we can.  The war in Ukraine and the resulting sanctions against Russia have also raised concerns about the risk of recession globally and domestically. We do not see any evidence of this across our consumer lending portfolio. Our credit metrics remain good and there is nothing we're seeing in terms of consumer spending or borrowing behavior that suggests that a broader downturn is imminent.  Another concern has been significant elevation and flattening of the yield curve, given the anticipation by the rates market around aggressive monetary policy from the Federal Reserve to stem high inflation. Because we are modestly assets sensitive, the potential for greater number of Fed rate hikes, has improved our outlook for spread income, which John will discuss momentarily. And while we're not immune from the effects of inflation, our business model has somewhat of a natural hedge, as the pressure that inflation may create on elements of our expense structure are partially offset by the contribution inflation makes to our sales volume.  In summary, while macro conditions are much more fluid than we had thought coming into this year, we're positioned to benefit from the combination of strong sales and receivables growth, expanding margin, and slowly normalizing credit. These trends give us confidence in our outlook over our forecast horizon.  Finally, I want to point out our new ESG related disclosures. In March, we produced our first Diversity Equity and Inclusion Transparency Report, which highlights our commitment to supporting a diverse workforce that reflects our communities and customers. We also recently published our first ESG summary that includes details on our greenhouse gas emissions among other items.  The data in our new reports is encouraging, so we intend to do more to reduce our impact on the environment, and to advance diversity and equity in our organization, and communities.  With that, I'll turn the call over to John to review our financial results in more detail, and provide an update to our expectations for the rest of 2022. Good morning, Bill. Yeah. Thanks, Sanjay. So in terms of lean to growth, I would say we're pleased with our growth but it remains balanced. In terms of the investments we're making, I expect our prime cost per account to be down from last year. So we're not in any way overinvesting.  By enlarge, our credit policies are back to where they were pre-pandemic. But as we said at that time, it was late cycle. So we're not exactly letting credit go. So we're still executing on a model of a disciplined growth even as the economic environment, especially the U.S. consumer remains strong. Sure. Thanks, Moshe. I think it really comes down to having a balanced and distinctive value proposition. The Discover brand is one of the most trusted brands in financial services. We provide a leading customer experience, both through the phone and digitally, which helps with retention as well as booking new accounts. We spent a long time building our skills around managing cash rewards, not just paying the higher rate but focused on every part of the process. And then continuing to innovate with new features and functionality, and you saw we just launched another one around helping protect your information from people reselling it on the web.  And so that I think, allows us to succeed in just about any environment. I view the card business is always competitive. Occasionally, there's a lull in the depths of a recession. But beyond that, it's our job to execute for our owners and grow. And you're seeing that this quarter, and I'm confident we'll be able to keep it going. Sure. So the network does give us advantages for both our credit card issuing business, but also in terms of being able to support the 1% cashback on debit purchases, which is a real differentiator in the marketplace and builds on the Discover heritage with cashback in a new direction.  So we'll work our way into it. As John mentioned, we'll start broad market advertising for that product later this year. But we intend to sort of scale it gradually and build for the long-term. Overtime, we expect it to be a key part of our business.  And then we see advantages on our core card issuing business. Good example is our ability as we rollout SRC to pre-enroll our customers in a way that will be much more challenging for issuers on a third-party network. And finally, we remain focused on the payment services business. Monetizing our network investments through attracting third-party volume. Good morning, Bet. Yeah. I would say, in general, in this business, you get diminishing returns on incremental investments in marketing. And so you have seen cycles in the past where people spend heavily after a while they look at the returns they got and maybe less happy with that. So we feel good about both what we're investing on the rewards side and the guidance we provide there of only 2 to 4 basis point increase. But also that we'll see cost per accounts at an attractive level. You're certainly seeing very heavy levels of investment out there that I would wonder whether or not they're going to be sustainable. Yeah. So in terms of our home equity business, we do think a rising rate environment will be very constructive. Perversely, many households, their greatest asset could be their 3% mortgage. So while we're excited about it, it also isn't that huge.  On the payment side, we're excited about our partnership, but I don't see tremendous disruption coming to a point of sale and existing means of payment point of sale anytime soon. But we're excited to work with a broad range of partners and different fintechs who want to leverage our network capabilities. Sure. Seeing strength across all categories. Revolver sales growth is probably a little higher than transactors growth, but that reflects our lend-focused model. But -- and that sales strength is continuing into April, where through, say, the 24 sales are still up 23% year-over-year. So consumer is good and breadth across all categories. In terms of different segments, from a credit standpoint, you do tend to see normalization occur faster at the lower end segments. But again, we're very pleased, and John mentioned that in his comments that the normalization is very much in-line with our expectations. Not necessarily. There's been a lot of volatility just as pandemic restrictions come and go, certainly, travel growth is up compared to what it was. But I'd really point towards breadth and growth and spend across all categories. Sure. It's still early days. So I probably won't provide much in the way of forecast, but we're very excited about the demand we're seeing. We think the product is positioned well to compete both with some of the newer fintech, neobanks but also with any traditional branch player that's out there. And overtime, the balances build slowly, but a lot of opportunities to cross-sell both other deposit products such as savings accounts and CDs, but also our broad range of card products and provide really a different entry point into the Discover franchise.  So our very much our focus is on building this for the long term. And as we said earlier, you'll start seeing more broad market advertising later this year for that product. Yeah. I mean, I'd go back to the very kind comments you made at the beginning around 10 years of consistency. Even five years ago, a brand value proposition that's for trust, for a superior customer experience and for innovation on the feature side. Back then, it might have been the ability to freeze your card, now it's some of the things we do for our customers in terms of protecting their information online, but the focus remains the same. A very strong cash rewards program that competes well with anything out there.  You're pricing a little more intensity in the cash rewards space as some of the changes on miles programs through the pandemic. But we still compete very much the same way, but also still feel as good about our competitive position. Yeah. Sure. So on the fee side, first, I'd say we have good relationships and enjoyed working closely with all of our regulators and by enlarge, are aligned in terms of wanting the consumers to be protected.  As you've seen, it's a pretty small percent of our revenues. We waived the first late fee for our Discover customers anyway. Right now, we're set at the safe harbor to the extent that, that changes we can change accordingly. But don't expect it to have an overly material impact.  Certainly, on the deposit side, the fact that we have no fees on any of our deposit products, positions us very, very well compared to our competitors. And it's a key part of our value proposition. In terms of student loans, we probably have seen some pressure on the payment rate just given the ongoing payment holidays that people have seen on their federal loan. It's important to realize that there's a big difference between the federal loan program and ours just in terms of who they give loans to, the types of educations they fund. As an example, we do nothing in the four-profit sector.  So yeah, we'll wait and see what comes out of Washington, but we don't expect it to be overly disruptive for our own student loan business. Yeah. We've modeled it pretty carefully. We don't expect it to have a significant impact on card or personal loans. And as you think about student loans, it's important to look at how we underwrite those. For our undergrad loans, the vast majority are cosigned by the parent, very strong FICO scores. So we've seen probably a modest benefit on the credit side, but also a modest negative on the payment rate as students have more liquidity to put towards paying off their private student loans.  And again, I'd go back to the federal student loan program in terms of who participates, the amount of debt they have and the nature of the education they finance is dramatically different than our portfolio. Great. Thank you. Great. Thank you, Ashley. And with that, I think we'll conclude. If you have any additional questions, please feel free to follow up here in Investor Relations. And have a great day."

            "name": "John Greene",
            "content": "Thank you, Roger. And good morning, everyone. Once again, our results this quarter reflect strong execution on our business priorities with accelerating loan growth and solid credit performance.  I'll begin with our financial summary results on Slide 5. There are a few things I'd like to call out here. The first is that our net income is lower year-over-year because of our reserving actions. In the first quarter of last year, we had an $879 million reserve release, while this quarter included $175 million release. Adjusting for reserve changes, our profit before tax and reserves would have been up 19% year-over-year.  Second, our reported total revenue net of interest expense increased $107 million, or 4% from the prior year. However, this included $162 million net loss and equity investments. Excluding this loss, total revenue increased 10%. These points underscore the strength of our core earnings power even in a fluid economic environment.  Let's turn to the details of the quarter. Looking at Slide 6, net interest income was up $149 million or 6% driven by improved net interest margin and higher average receivable. NIM was 10.85%, up 10 basis points from the prior year and four 4 points from the prior quarter. The year-over-year increase in net interest margin reflects lower funding costs and a favorable shift in funding mix partially offset by a higher mix of promotional rate balances. We made further progress on our funding mix with consumer deposits now making up 71% of total funding.  On a sequential basis, the modest increase in NIM was driven by light link improved revolve rate on credit card loans partially offset by increased funding costs. The better revolve rate reflected a 70-basis point decline in the payment rate quarter-over-quarter. This helped boost sequential loan yields by 5 basis points. However, the payment rate remains nearly 500 basis points of pre-pandemic levels. We continue to expect that the normalization in the payment rate will continue through the back half of 2023.  Receivables were higher driven by card, which increased 10% year-over-year from the continued strong sales and robust new account growth last year and into this year. Organic student loans increased 4% reflecting solid originations through the 2021 peak season. Personal loans were down 1% due to a sustained high payment rate.  Looking at other revenue on Slide 7. Excluding the $162 million loss in equity investments, non-interest income increased $120 million, or 26%. This was driven by net discount and interchange revenue, which was up $79 million, or 33%, reflecting strong sales. Sales were up 23% year-over-year with growth across all categories. Inflation drove a modest portion of the growth in the quarter, and we expect that inflation will remain a benefit to sales growth over the short term.  Strong sales also drove higher rewards expense compared to the prior year. However, the rewards rate was down two basis points year-over-year. We still anticipate the full year rewards rate to increase two to four basis points.  Loan fee income was up $33 million, or 31%, primarily driven by an increase in late fee instances.  Moving to expenses on Slide 8. Total operating expenses were up $49 million, or 5% year-over-year. Excluding marketing investments, expenses increased just 1%. Compensation expense was slightly down year-over-year on lower bonus accruals and headcount, which was partially offset by higher average salaries. We expect some degree of salary and wage pressure in 2022, and possibly into 2023 as we take steps to remain competitive. Marketing expense increased $38 million, or 25%.  We continue to invest for growth in our card and consumer banking products, including support of our relaunch cashback debit products. Information processing increased $16 million, or 15% year-over-year versus a low level in the period a year ago. This expense was flat sequentially. Going forward, we will continue to prioritize investments in analytics to support growth, innovation, and generate operating efficiencies.  Moving to Slide 9. Net charge-offs remain low and we're in-line with our expectation for modest credit normalization. Total net charge offs were 1.61%, 87 basis points lower than the prior year and up 24 basis points from last quarter's record low. Total net charge-off dollars were down $160 million -- $169 million from the prior year and up $55 million sequentially.  Moving to the allowance for credit losses on Slide 10. This quarter, we released $175 million from reserves and our reserve rate continued to decline dropping 17 basis points to 7.1%. The reserve release primarily reflects the sustained strong credit performance in our portfolio, partially offset by loan growth.  Looking at the macroeconomic environment, the pandemic now has a lesser impact on her outlook. The primary sources of risk have shifted to the impacts of inflation and a potential slowdown from Fed actions. While the risk has shifted, the economic view of the U.S. consumer remains healthy. Looking at slide 11. Our common equity tier 1 for the period was 14.7%, slightly lower than the prior period and still well above our 10.5% target. We repurchased $944 million of common stock during the quarter executing on our remaining authorization. Our board of directors also approved a new $4.2 billion share repurchase program that expires on June 30, 2023 and increased our common stock dividend by 20% to $0.60 per share. This repurchase authorization represents our largest ever over a five quarter horizon. It is evidence of our commitment to returning excess capital to shareholders while sustaining our investments in strong organic growth. Concluding on Slide 12. Our outlook for 2022 remains favorable, and we are improving some elements of our expectations. Starting with loans, spending trends through the first quarter and a modest decline in the payment rates improved our conviction for high-single digit growth. We are revising our view on NIM. We now see 5 to 15 basis points of upside for the full year relative to the first quarter. This view includes five Fed rate hikes at 25 basis points each. Our prior view reflected two rate hikes of the same magnitude. If the Fed increases rates beyond this, it would provide modest upside to net interest margin. Despite inflationary pressures, there's no change to our guidance for operating expense. Marketing is expected to be above 2019 levels with non-marketing expenses up low-single digits. We are improving our credit outlook. We expect losses to be between 2.2% and 2.4% for the full year. While there's still some uncertainty about the back half of this year, our current credit performance and delinquency trends give us confidence in a tighter range. And as previously mentioned, our board recently approved a new share repurchase program and increased our dividend. In summary, loan growth accelerated as we benefited from robust sales and strong account acquisitions last year and into 2022. Credit performance reflected our disciplined approach to underwriting and credit management with moderate normalization as expected. We manage operating expenses while investing in new product, features and functionalities. And our highly capital generative model enable us to increase our dividend and share repurchase authorization while supporting strong organic asset growth. These results demonstrate the resiliency and flexibility of our integrated digital banking and payments model. And I'm confident that we are well positioned for continued profitable growth through a range of economic conditions. With that, I'll turn the call back to our operator to open the line for Q&A. Hey, Bill. Thanks for the question. So certainly, we were pleased with the execution in the quarter. In terms of the specifics around efficiency ratio, what we've guided to in the past, and we're still holding there is that over the medium term, we would expect an efficiency ratio in the upper 30s.  Now this quarter certainly demonstrated some progress on that front. There's a bit of timing there. We kept our marketing guidance as we indicated before, which would bring that above 2019 levels. So there's a slight skewing towards the back half of the year.  We continue to invest for growth. There will be some upper funnel or broad market advertising as well. We're watching every dollar and making sure we get an appropriate return for our shareholders as we invested whether from an expense standpoint or from a loan lending standpoint.  So I don't want to get over our skis here on that efficiency ratio, strong execution. And we're going to continue to kind of work towards the medium term target. Yeah. So in terms of the CET1 ratio, we're sticking to a 10.5% target. There is about 175 basis points from CECL transition still yet to impact that CET1 ratio. So then that still puts us over 200 basis points above the target I just expressed.  So our thinking is that over the next two, three, perhaps four years depending on investments and the broad economy to close down to the 10.5% target. But in terms of the repurchase authorization, our board just approved it. So it would be way premature to talk about any changes to that. Of course. Thanks, Bill. Yeah. Sure, Sanjay. So in terms of competitor behavior. So we have seen the competitor set that we benchmark ourselves against recently through this quarter, this past quarter increased rates and into this quarter. As you observed our behavior in the pandemic, we moved fairly aggressively down. As a matter of fact, we led our competitive set on the interest rate movements downward.  Now that we're in a rising rate environment. My expectation is we're going to be disciplined around that. So the principles are that we want to ensure we have a fair customer proposition. We also seek to kind of manage our interest costs as effectively as we can. So a combination of funding needs and competitive dynamics will dictate how we -- how and when we take deposit pricing actions. Good morning. Yeah. Great. Thanks, Betsy. So in terms of loan growth, we're going to take a balanced approach. So we talked about the target of 70% to 80% of our funding needs coming from OSA or deposits from our customer base. There's always the opportunity to go into the market and execute on broker CDs if liquidity needs to dictate that. We also issued an ABS transaction this past quarter at -- in a rising rate environment at pretty compelling rates overall.  So we're going to take that balanced approach. And you will see or we did -- if you haven't seen it, you'll see a little bit more of it. There'll be a little bit more broad market marketing on deposits and then also targeted marketing on deposits. And we're going to try to balance kind of the rate and the marketing in order to get the most effective cost of funds as we can. So that's essentially the strategy in a nutshell.  So we actually just went through a review from the Fed on our liquidity controls, and it's come out very, very strong. So we're pleased with the position of the business and the processes around it. Yeah. So the math on it would be for a 25 basis point increase somewhere between 3 and 5 bps to NIM on an annual basis. Now there's a bunch of other dynamics that obviously impact that, right? So you touched upon it earlier. So deposit pricing could impact that as well as the revolve rate, payment rate and then the credit impacts coming through net interest margin.  So a lot of dynamics there, and that was why we were conservative in terms of the number of hikes that we baked into this updated guidance. If there are more hikes and we're able to kind of effectively manage our liquidity, credit remains as we expect we would certainly see some upside from that guidance we provided. Yes. And that's an annual basis. You got it. Yeah. So thanks, John. So I don't really kind of think about this in terms of the deposit beta. What I do here is think about it in terms of broad principles. So the principles are that we're going to have an attractive proposition for our customers, and then we're going to manage interest costs as low as we can, while still maintaining that proposition I just talked about.  So I gave the point in terms of our actions during the pandemic when we had plenty of liquidity that we were a price leader down. And what I said in this rising rate environment, we expect that we're going to manage that interest costs very, very tightly in order to hopefully drive overall cost low, increase NIM and benefit shareholders.  So I don't want to kind of tag to a specific beta because they tend to be -- the numbers tend to be kind of off a month from now. It does. So actually, it's the 23% for the quarter was higher than we anticipated. We're frankly happy to see that. But there is a modest stepping down through this year. Effectively, it's hard to envision year-over-year kind of sales growth to continue in the upper 20s. Good morning. Okay. Thanks, Ryan. So there's a lot there. So revolve rate actually increased mildly in the quarter as the payment rate decreased by the 70 basis points that I spoke about. And by the way, that payment rate decline was essentially in-line with how we built our original guidance.  So as we think about inflation or other impacts that could drive payment rate lower, we've essentially derisked our guidance for loan growth. So we could see additional upside subject to payment rate and a bunch of other factors. The other pieces there in terms of kind of overall asset growth, what I would do is I would break it down into kind of the three categories or primary products. So card, you saw the double-digit growth there. Student loans at 4%, so we'll have another peak origination season coming in 2022. We hope to be able to execute there and continue to take market share. And personal loans, the growth was down 1%, but originations were up strong double digits. So we had a high payment rate impacting personal loans that we'll expect to moderate over time, given some level of loan growth in that product.  So I guess your question had a number of elements. Hopefully, I'll give you enough detail to be able to lease together the information you're trying to glean. Yeah. So when we gave this initial guidance, we gave a pretty broad range, and we added around internally whether or not tightened it. And as the quarter unfolded, our conviction around that tighter range and perhaps the lower end group. So as you said, there's three months. The fourth quarter, we don't have perfect visibility in terms of kind of roll rate performance. But our modeling analytics have been actually surprisingly accurate and we have a high expectation there.  So we'll see how the rest of this quarter plays out. And hopefully, we can give updated guidance in a subsequent call. Right. Thanks, Mark. So yeah, the reserve rate came in at 7.1% CECL, day one was 6.1%. So some context around CECL day one. So it was an accounting adjustment reflecting new guidance provided by the FASB, right? So we did our best to capture life of loan estimates of what losses would be and embed them in over reserve rate.  Now the macro environment at the time today has certainly changed. Portfolio dynamics have changed. As a matter of fact, the upper end of our kind of credit quality for the balance sheet is stronger than it was CECL day one. But there's still a degree of uncertainty that we are managing through. So as we've said in prior quarters, we're conservative on this. We want to make sure that we're appropriately capturing reserve rates under GAAP.  And if the broad macros are positive and the portfolio performance is positive, we could continue to step down through a combination of growth or reserve releases. And if the recession likelihood continues to increase, the broad macros could warrant either holding or perhaps even increasing. But overall, I think the takeaway here should be, Mark that the portfolio performance is really, really strong. There's no view of any damage to the consumer. There's no view that job losses are going to increase in the -- definitely through this year and likely through the first half of next year. So all those factors are positive from a credit and reserving standpoint. Yeah. So here's how we think about it. So -- and I've tried to articulate this over the past two and half years. We're going to be really disciplined in terms of how we spend our dollars. And Discover has got a long history of that. We've done some stuff to kind of drive both accountability and visibility of the expense base, which my sense is it has helped.  It's important to note that as we see opportunities, we're going to continue to invest. We also are -- as you paraphrased, we're seeing inflation coming in on salary and wages. We're also seeing it in our third-party spend. So we will effectively manage that in order to be able to deliver to the guidance we provided. And if we see incremental opportunity either for growth or otherwise, we'll invest to -- and we'll create transparency on that in order to drive long-term shareholder returns. Yeah. Last time, I would take out as a proxy, but there's a couple of things that are different, right? So the pace of inflation is a heck of a lot higher here. We're at record levels of inflation.  The other thing that is different is the savings rate coming into this inflationary cycle, much higher. So those two dynamics could create some offsetting impacts. But it will be subject to kind of liquidity and loan growth across the industry and who's got a competitive proposition. And we're very comfortable with our proposition in terms of the customer experience, the kind of the rate. And if you take a look at our rate versus a brick-and-mortar bank, I could find it ironic that anybody keeps any excess cash in those institutions whatsoever.  So we're going to be diligent on it. Yeah. Thanks for the question, Mihir. While we said previously as we expected normalization through 2023. Now it's really hard to kind of predict anything when you get out, out in the kind of 2024 timeframe.  What I would say here is in terms of narrowing the range that was a function largely of increased confidence around our forecast with, frankly, an internal expectation that we're going to come in at the lower end of the range. So we're still giving ourselves some wiggle room here. But if things proceed as we expect them to, we'll be around the lower end of the range. Yeah, it's a couple of factors that are playing out here. So the first piece was when we came in -- prior to coming into the pandemic, we were pretty tight. And then we hit the pandemic and we tightened the personal loan product more stringently than any other product we had. And then we also we doubled down on our underwriting, including 100% verification of all loans. So we were super careful. That had an impact on growth levels. We have since reduced our manual underwriting. So it's back to kind of pre-pandemic underwriting standards. And we also opened up the credit box because what we are seeing is the loans that were in there were pristine. And we're now in a situation where we've got a high returning asset. We're looking at the competitive dynamics. We've made some conscious choice to reduce yield for the benefit of very profitable growth.  And as I said earlier in my comments, the expectation is that the payment rate will subside, and we'll see growth in loan balances in that product. Originations have been positively strong, as I said earlier as well."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning. My name is Todd, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Fourth Quarter 2023 Discover Financial Services Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Eric Wasserstrom, Senior Vice President of Corporate Strategy and Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nEric Wasserstrom: Thank you, and welcome to this morning's call. I'll begin on Slide 2 of our earnings presentation, which you can find in the Financial section of our Investor Relations website, investorrelations.discover.com. Our discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. Please refer to our notices regarding forward-looking statements that appear in our fourth quarter 2023 earnings press release and presentation. Our call today will include remarks from our Interim CEO, John Owen; and John Greene, our Chief Financial Officer. After we conclude our formal comments, there will be time for a question-and-answer session. During the Q&A session, we request that you ask one question, followed by one follow-up question. After your follow-up question, please return to the queue. Now it's my pleasure to turn the call over to John.\nJohn Owen: Thank you, Eric, and thanks to our listeners for joining today's call. 2023 was a year of significant change for Discover, and we believe the actions we've taken position the company to continue driving strong long-term performance. When I stepped into the Interim CEO role, I had three priorities. My top priority was to advance our culture of compliance. We have made meaningful strides in our corporate governance and risk management capabilities. That said, this is a journey that will take time and continued investments over the coming years to further enhance our compliance and risk management capabilities. My second priority is to continue delivering a great customer experience at every touch point, which we do by providing our customers with award-winning service and products. I'd like to thank our 20,000 employees for delivering a great customer experience to help our customers achieve a brighter financial future. In 2023, we were recognized for the first time as one of Fortune 100 best companies to work for. This award adds to accolade for working parents, women, people with disabilities and members of the LGBTQ+ community, and we're proud to be an inclusive workplace. My third priority is to sustain our strong financial performance. We reported net income of $2.9 billion for full year 2023 and earnings per share of $11.26. This makes 2023 the third best year for EPS performance in our history. In delivering these results, we achieved several important milestones. We exceeded $100 billion in card receivables, grew deposits by 21% year-over-year, successfully launched our cashback debit account on a national scale, and we announced our intent to exit the private student lending business. On December 11, we announced a new leadership and we're excited to have Michael Rhodes joining us for our incoming Chief Executive Officer. Michael is an experienced leader with a deep background in the financial services industry. He has managed all aspects of our Consumer Banking business with deep experience in the credit card space, payments, online and mobile banking and served as Group Head of Innovation and Technology. His appointment marks the conclusion of a rigorous search process, and we look forward to Michael's arrival. When Michael arrives, I will return to my prior role on Discover\u2019s Board of Directors. In conclusion, I'm proud of the progress we made in 2023. Our integrated digital banking model, resilient financial performance and maturing risk management and compliance capabilities position Discover well for 2024 and beyond. With that, I'll now turn the call over to John Greene, who will review our fourth quarter 2023 financial results in more detail and provide some perspective on 2024.\nJohn Greene: Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with our summary financial results on Slide 4. In the quarter, we reported net income of $388 million, down from just over $1 billion in the prior year quarter. There are three broad trends to call out. First, we grew revenue 13%, reflecting 15% loan growth, partially offset by modest NIM compression. Second, provision expense grew by $1 billion. Charge-offs increased, but landed at the low-end of our expected range. Strong loan growth and higher delinquency drove the increase to our reserve balance. Finally, expenses increased 19% year-over-year, reflecting investments in compliance and risk management, a reserve for customer remediation and higher marketing expense to support our national Cashback Debit campaign. We'll get into the details of these topics on the following pages. Turning to Slide 5. Our net interest margin ended the quarter at 10.98%, down 29 basis points from the prior year and up 3 basis points sequentially. The decline from the prior year quarter was driven by higher funding costs and higher interest charge-offs, which were partially offset by higher prime rates and increases in revolving balances. For the full year, net interest margin was 11.07%, up 3 basis points from the prior year. This margin performance reflects the improvement in our funding mix over the past several years and a reduced level of balance transfer and promotional balances as we tightened underwriting. Receivable growth remained robust. Card increased 13% year-over-year due to contributions from the prior year new account growth and a lower payment rate. The payment rate declined about 110 basis points from the sequential quarter and is now 100 basis points above 2019 levels. Overall, new account growth declined 9% as a result of credit actions. Sales were up 3% compared to the prior year quarter. Personal loans were up 23%, driven by continued strength in originations and lower payment rate versus the prior year. Student loans were flat year-over-year as we prepare for a potential sale of this portfolio we will cease accepting applications for new loans on February 1. Our Deposit business delivered outstanding performance in a challenging year. Average deposits were up 21% year-over-year and 4% sequentially. Our direct-to-consumer balances grew $3 billion in the period and $14 billion in the year. Looking at other revenue on Slide 6. Non-interest income increased $74 million or 11%. This was primarily driven by an increase in loan fee income, higher transaction processing revenue from our PULSE business and higher net discount and interchange revenue. Our rewards rate was 137 basis points in the period and 140 basis points for the full year 2023, a decrease of 1 basis point on a full year basis. The decline reflects lower cashback match from slowing new account growth and our active management of our 5% categories. Moving to expenses on Slide 7. Total operating expenses were up $280 million, or 19% year-over-year, and up 22% from the prior quarter. Looking at our major expense categories, compensation cost increased $73 million or 13% from higher headcount. Marketing expenses increased $59 million or 19%. Professional fees were up driven by continued investment in compliance and risk management capabilities, while other expense reflects a reserve for customer remediation. Moving to credit performance on Slide 8. Total net charge-offs were 4.11%, 198 basis points higher than the prior year and up 59 basis points from the prior quarter. In card, as anticipated, delinquency formation is slowing as more recent vintages season. We added a slide detailing some of the drivers of our credit performance in the appendix to the earnings presentation. Turning to the allowance for credit losses on Slide 9. This quarter, we increased our reserves by $618 million, and our reserve rate increased by 17 basis points to just over 7.2%. The increase in reserves was driven by receivable growth and higher near-term loss content from higher delinquencies. Under CECL, reserve levels increase as you approach peak losses. We expect our losses to rise through the midyear and then plateau through the back half with some seasonal variation. In terms of our macroeconomic outlook, our view of unemployment was relatively unchanged, while household net worth projections increased slightly. These changes provided a small benefit to reserves. Looking at Slide 10. Our common equity Tier 1 for the period was 11.3%. The sequential decline of 30 basis points was driven largely by asset growth. We declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.70 per share of common stock. Concluding on Slide 11 with our perspective on 2024. These exclude the impact of a potential student loan portfolio sale. We expect end-of-period loan growth to be relatively flat, while average loan growth will be up modestly year-over-year. We expect full year net interest margin to be 10.5% to 10.8%. We're currently anticipating core rate cuts of 25 basis points in 2024. This is two more rate cuts than in our forecast in December. Each cut reduces NIM by approximately 5 basis points subject to a deposit beta. We expect total operating expenses to increase by a mid-single-digit percent. This contemplates our expectation for compliance-related costs to be approximately $500 million this year. Total expenses may increase as incremental resources or remediation is required. We expect net charge-offs in the range of 4.9% to 5.3%. Finally, regarding capital return. We will participate in this year CCAR's process, and believe the results should help inform our view of capital management for 2024. Importantly, our capital management priorities have not changed and remain centered on supporting organic growth and returning capital to shareholders. To summarize, we continue to generate solid financial results. For 2024, we will continue to advance our compliance and risk management capabilities and invest in actions that drive sustainable, long-term value creation. With that, I'll turn the call back to our operator to open the line for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Rick Shane with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nRick Shane: Good morning everybody and thanks for taking my questions. I'm not a little under the weather today, so I apologize. The loan growth expectations, is that organic loan growth or is that net of the portfolio sale of the student loans?\nJohn Greene: Hi, Rick, John Greene here. That is organic loan growth. So all of the guidance excluded the impact of a potential student loan asset sale.\nRick Shane: Okay. That\u2019s it for me. Thank you guys.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Moshe Orenbuch with TD Cowen.\nMoshe Orenbuch: Great. Thanks. John, maybe just a follow-up on Rick's question. I mean given the strong growth that you're currently seeing in the Personal Loan business, and the fact that you're still adding accounts, albeit at a lower level in the Credit Card business, you did mention kind of lower balance transfers, but is there something else going on? Can you talk about kind of deconstruct that loan growth expectation for us a little bit?\nJohn Greene: Sure, sure. Thanks, Moshe. So the bonus of loan growth sales, new account generation, payment rate trends. And so what we\u2019re anticipating for sales given the slowdown through 2023 in terms of sales, although we did have a pretty strong holiday season, sales will be relatively flat year-over-year. New account generation relative to last year, certainly down, but overall positive new account growth. And payment rate, what we've tried to do here is kind of derisk the forecast. So we assume that 100 basis points of payment rate that's elevated versus 2019 will remain elevated. So those three components reflect end up coming in and reflecting on our projections. Now loan growth could actually come in higher if payment rate continues to decline. But overall, our basis for guidance, loan growth, net interest margin and charge-offs was to give a range and then also be relatively conservative in terms of the expectations on those ranges.\nMoshe Orenbuch: Great. Thanks. And maybe just as a follow-up on the credit side. I mean, you did talk a month ago and then mentioned again today that you expect kind of losses to peak around the middle of the year. How do we think about the performance after that peak? I mean you said kind of flattish. What's driving that? Why isn't that something that improves? And how do we think about reserving in that context? \nJohn Greene: Sure. Yes. So there's a couple of different components that are driving that. So if you go back in time, we had about two years of unusually low charge-offs and delinquencies, so from the pandemic. And that process of normalization, typically will take about the same amount of time, two years. The vintages, 2021 and 2022 are seasoning, and that's why we expect it to plateau. The 2023 vintage actually was relatively large, but too early to call whether it's going to outperform our expectations, but certainly, a highly profitable vintage from our vantage point today. So what you're actually just seeing is a period of normalization. My expectation is that charge-offs will plateau and then and beginning in 2025, I would expect those to step down. Now you will know from this past year and the prior year, what we've tried to do in terms of the guidance is the conservative in terms of the range. And throughout 2023, we tightened the range and actually came in at the low end. So my hope is that we'll be able to do the same thing in 2024.\nMoshe Orenbuch: Great. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. \nRyan Nash: Hi, good morning, everyone. John, maybe to dig a little bit deeper on some of the commentary you gave regarding loan growth. Maybe just focusing on the account growth. The market clearly thinks there's a better chance of a soft landing right now. We're seeing peers who are talking about mid- to high single-digit growth. And I'm just curious on the account growth. Is this more just conservative underwriting? Are you trying to make sure that you make more progress on risk governance and compliance before you increase growth? Maybe just a little bit more color on why you're seeing such a slowdown in terms of the account growth relative to the last few years? \nJohn Greene: Yes. Thanks, Ryan. So our approach in 2023 and then early into 2024 was that we took a look at underwriting and performance of, what I'll say, buckets within our underwriting box. And essentially tightened and we've tightened throughout 2023. What you're seeing here in terms of account growth, at least projections today, is us getting back to 2018 and 2019 levels as we continue to watch the 2022 and 2023 vintage perform. And six months from now, we may end up stepping in a little bit more aggressively. But what we wanted to do certainly was let kind of get further confirmation that the delinquency trends that we have seen in terms of slowing rate of delinquency formation continue to persist and that the charge-offs, the forecasted come in at or better than our expectations. If those two factors are at play, there will be an opportunity to be more aggressive in terms of new account growth. \nRyan Nash: Got it. And maybe as my follow-up, can you maybe help us understand where you stand with the student loan sale? And how would you foresee that impacting the outlook as well as capital return over the next four to six quarters? Thank you.\nJohn Greene: Yes. Thanks, Ryan. So good news. So it is actually progressing to schedule. So as a matter of fact, last evening, we signed a servicing agreement with [Nelnet] to become the servicer of this portfolio. So that was great news. It was a competitive process. And certainly, Nelnet showed that there's a commitment to continue to dedicate resources and service that portfolio at a high level. The next step will be to continue the servicing migration activities. We expect those activities will take around six months. We're conservatively it may take a month or two longer. And then as we're doing that, our adviser will begin to market the portfolio. So our expectations are that it will sell in the second half. And the implications for the business are as follows: So there's $9.5 billion of receivables. That equates to risk-weighted assets of about $10.8 billion. We expect that, that will be -- the exit of that will be -- have a positive impact on net interest margin by somewhere between 10 bps and 20 bps on a full year basis. Charge-off rate could tick up mildly, so under 5 bps. And as of 12/31, we had $858 million of reserves. So with a successful exit, those reserves will drop. And the sale price, the market will determine that, but we expect it to go above par.\nRyan Nash: Thank you for all the color.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question will come from Mihir Bhatia with Bank of America.\nMihir Bhatia: Hi. Thank you for taking my question. We're going to start with loan growth also. And I just want to go back to the building blocks a little bit. I think you essentially said in terms of the building blocks, you're expecting payments rates to be elevated ex \u2013 like flat to stay at the elevated level and sales to be flat. You're also adding accounts. So I'm just like trying to understand I guess, what's the bank account? Like how does loan growth stay flat given the sale, you had 15%. I'm just trying to understand like - that's something we're missing, I feel like, and I'm just trying to understand that.\nJohn Greene: Yes. So let me try to give a little bit of color that hopefully gets folks comfortable with our view of loan growth today. So in 2023, really, really strong loan growth. Much of that was driven both by new account growth, but also a slowing payment rate, that payment rate in our assumptions is holding flat. And as a result, what we expect to see is the 2023 vintage will begin to kind of build in terms of assets, but there's likely going to be some impact from sales. And then also as we cycle through the 2022 vintage, we're not expecting significant new balance builds from that vintage. Now, maybe there will be. But overall, what we've tried to do here is reflect our view of our underwriting box today, not reflect any potential openings of our underwriting box in the later part of 2023. And if we have deliver on loan growth, that will be fantastic. The other element that has come into play here as we pulled back on balance transfers and promotional balances in the second part of 2023. We don't anticipate significantly increasing that level of balance transfer, promotional balances. Now, if we do, that will certainly be accretive to loan growth as well. So, what you're hearing in the guidance is that our expectation is that there's an opportunity to deliver better. But certainly, we've positioned both the guidance and the business to be conservative at least for the next quarter or two.\nMihir Bhatia: Got it. And then I wanted to go back to expenses and the reserve for customer remediation that you mentioned that you took this quarter. Can you just provide some color on that? Like is that related to the merchant mispricing issue? How much was the reserve this quarter? Where does that leave the reserve overall I think you had $365 million in 2Q. Just trying to understand how the estimate for the costs related to that issue changed? I think you also mentioned it could be higher -- expenses would be higher in 2024. If you need to take more reserves there, like -- where are we with that investigation? Just give us an update on that merchant mispricing issue too?\nJohn Greene: Yes. Okay. So, let me start with the reserves. So, -- and the remediation reserve that we put up. So, they're unrelated. So, the merchant tiering reserve we booked $365 million as a liability, that has moved now about $370 million just as we've had some payments and other flows in through the interchange that we had to correct manually for. So, the progress there in terms of discussions with our merchants is positive. We'll -- we don't have enough data points to make a material change to that reserve level yet, but it's progressing, my view, positively through the end of the year and today as we speak. Now, separately, we put up $80 million for a -- as we described it, a customer remediation reserve. Now, some context to that is as part of this compliance journey, we've put in a significant number of resources to help us identify and correct issues. And as we prepare the business to continue to move forward to drive organic growth, we're getting much, much better at identifying issues and we identify an issue what we've done here is if we think there's is appropriate to refund customer payments, we're going to do that. So, we identified a particular issue largely within servicing for our student loan business, although there was a general impact in another business line and we continue to look across our business. But the lion's share of that reserve relates to student loans and essentially what we're doing is trying to position the business and that product for a successful exit.\nMihir Bhatia: Thank you. Thanks for taking my questions. I\u2019ll get back in queue.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Thanks. Good morning. Sorry, multi-part question on the same topic and then a follow-up. Can you update us, John, on the progress made with the regulatory agencies; I think that was sort of alluded to in the previous question. But maybe just the firmness around capital return post CCAR? What exactly happens to the CFPB consent order when the loan servicing is transferred? And then just curious, the loan growth expectations, was that any part driven by any regulatory related matters? Thanks.\nJohn Owen: This is John Owen. I'll take part of that, and John Greene will take the capital part. What I would tell you is over the last 18 months or so, we\u2019ve made significant progress improving our risk management and compliance capabilities. We've increased our investments on risk and compliance in 2022 to 2023 up to about a $500 million level. And as John mentioned earlier, we think expense growth, and that will be in the mid-single digits in line with other guidance we've given. We've made improvements in risk and compliance, but we still have quite a bit of work to do. One thing I'd point out, the FDIC consent order, which we did get and was made public, it does not include the misclassification issue in that scope of work. We're working closely with our regulators on that topic and really don't have anything further to add on that topic at this point in time.\nJohn Greene: Okay. Sanjay, I feel like your question is a five-part question, but what we'll do our best to answer it. So the loan growth aspect that you asked, it is completely unrelated to any regulatory issues, so nothing to connect on that point. In terms of capital return, our commitment to capital return and capital allocation have not changed. So, first to invest in profitable organic growth; and second, to return excess capital to shareholders. So as we kind of progressed through the fourth quarter, we remained on pause with our buybacks. And given we've got a new CEO coming in, we are contending with a number of different compliance and risk management matters. We got the merchant tiering reserve. We don't have any feedback from our regulators on that point. We decided that it would be most appropriate to remain conservative in terms of our guidance related to buybacks. We will go through CCAR, as I said in my prepared remarks, that will form a view of capital under significant stress as it always does. And then we're going to have the exit or hopefully, the exit from the Student Loan business, which will provide free up at least $2 billion worth of capital. So what you're hearing here hopefully is some indications that one, we're committed to returning excess capital to shareholders; two, that there will be excess capital generated and available; and three, we're going to go through a diligent process internally, share it with our Board and then take the Board's direction in terms of buybacks.\nSanjay Sakhrani: The consent order?\nJohn Greene: And...\nSanjay Sakhrani: With the loan servicing, like does that look\u2026\nJohn Greene: Yes, that was part 5A, I think. Yes. So that remains in effect and our chosen provider, Nelnet is fully aware of the consent order requirements in terms of kind of servicing excellence. And they were chosen because they've got a track record in terms of being able to kind of service a portfolio such as this, and they've dedicated both technology and resources to ensure a seamless transition.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Okay. Then my follow-up, just question is -- sorry, to my five-part question. Is the reserve rate, Moshe sort of asked about it a little bit, but how should we think about that reserve rate migrating over the course of the year given that the charge-off rate plateaus. Does the reserve rates start coming down? And where does it come down to in a normal environment? I'm just trying to think about how we model that because that's really important.\nJohn Greene: Yes, yes. Thanks for that. We are hoping that, that question would come out. So the -- let me talk about the reserves for the quarter, and then I'll give you perspective on 2024 and what could potentially happen there. So we grew receivables in the quarter, $5.7 billion. Now some of that was transactor balances that are reserved light. But one thing that we've been consistent on in terms of our communication is that as we approach peak losses, reserve levels increase. And what we've said previously is, typically, we hit the highest reserve rate level one to two quarters before peak losses. So that's the path we're on. Let me provide some details on some assumptions that were used to set the reserve levels this year at year end. And then I'll give a perspective on what we -- what could happen in 2024. So macro is relatively benign. So unemployment levels, we ended the year at 3.7 what we've assumed is an unemployment level of 4.2. So a mild increase, household worth, mild decrease, savings rate, mild increase and GDP to be in 2024 to be about 1.3%. So relatively conservative, but not overly optimistic of assumptions. Now what will come into play in 2024 is obviously the macros, which will continue to be important. The portfolio performance and -- by the way, it is tracking to our expectations with month-over-month delinquency formation declining. The credit quality of the book remains relatively consistent with what we've done historically. So our expectation is that assuming the macros remain consistent and the portfolio performance remains to our expectation that there will be some level of opportunity to reduce the reserve rate in 2024. Now that's subject to a significant amount of governance, and we're going to make sure that we comply with our internal processes and generally accepted accounting principles. So they're my caveats. But there's a lot of things that are different today than day one. So the step down will be aligned with those points I just mentioned.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Okay, great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Bill Carcache with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nBill Carcache: Thank you. Good morning and thanks for taking my questions. John, I wanted to follow-up on your credit commentary, given that it is such an important area of focus for investors. So you've been saying all along that you didn't move down the credit spectrum, but the concern for many investors had been that other card issuers also experienced outsized growth as we emerge from COVID and they had also experienced some normalization headwinds, but they were now starting to see delinquency reformation start to roll over. As Discover's DQ rate formations as recently as prior months data showed that your formations remain on and up until to the right trajectory. So I guess the question is, does the new disclosure on Slide 14 confirm that your delinquency rate formations are indeed now also starting to roll over? And if so, does that really just reinforce your confidence that we could see peak NCOs hit in 2024, all else equal?\nJohn Greene: Yes. And thanks for the question, Bill. So, I just to give you kind of the benefit of some data here. From September through December this year, so the 30-plus delinquencies have declined month-over-month. So in September, we peaked at an increase month-over-month of 26 bps. What we said in the fourth quarter is we expected that to decline. Our October formation increased 20 bps, so relative to decline to the prior month. November, 15 bps, December, 11 bps, and our expectation is that will continue to decline. Where it becomes negative, we're not going to get into that because it will be subject to a number of different things, including kind of our origination path and broad macro. So to get to the essence of your question, we do have a level of confidence regarding kind of what\u2019s happening in the portfolio and the trend. And as we progress in 2024 that will be reflected in hopefully, tightening guidance and then also -- tightening guidance to the lower end and then also, hopefully, reserve rate changes.\nBill Carcache: That's helpful. Thank you. And following up on your expense commentary, I believe you said that expenses may need to increase further potentially. Maybe if you could frame the possibility of their being -- what you would view as another step function higher from here? Or how should we think about the risk of further increase in expenses? And how are we -- how should we think about your sustainable long-term efficiency ratio? I think as we look at historically, Discover has been very, very -- lowest efficiency ratio in the industry. To what extent is that still something that we can expect?\nJohn Greene: Okay. Yes. Thanks, Bill. So our expectation is that the long-term efficiency ratio will be sub-40%. So there's still a view that, that will happen. The reason we put the -- what I'll call is the caveat in the 2024 expense guidance was a number of different institutions when they've been on this compliance and risk management journey have not been able to call what the actual compliance and risk management spend would be. We had that remediation reserve in the fourth quarter. There were some indications that we might have to put something up for that. But we didn't know. There's still some level of unknowns, unknowns. And I wanted to make sure we're clear to the people listening to this call that, there is some level of risk to the expense guidance. Now that said, 5% on our expense base is a significant amount of dollars. We feel like we have nearly a full complement of resources around risk and compliance today, which is good news. Our issues management capabilities significantly improved. Our path to improving overall governance is certainly on the right trajectory. So those factors give me confidence that we're not going to have a huge surprise. But there could be just don't have enough certainty given where we are on our compliance journey. Now, the rest of the cost base, there's a couple of things to keep in mind here. So right -- today, we have nearly 3,000 resources dedicated to risk and compliance management. A significant amount of those resources are dedicated to issues related to student loan servicing, which with a successful exit and transfer, it will give us an opportunity to scrutinize the cost base in a different way. So that's certainly on the list of planned activities for the second quarter, third quarter, and then hopefully, we begin some execution in the fourth quarter. So overall, I feel comfortable with the expense guidance that we've provided. And we're going to do our best to make sure that every dollar we spend is wise and that the shareholders get the benefit from that.\nBill Carcache: Very helpful. Thank you for taking my questions.\nJohn Greene: You're welcome, Bill Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from John Pancari with Evercore ISI.\nJohn Pancari: Good morning. Regarding the new $80 million remediation charge, did all of that remediation relate to the student loan business, specifically, and was that in part tied also to the July 2022 disclosure around the student loan issues that surfaced then? And did any of that $80 million relate to the other business that you point that you mentioned that could have had a tangential impact and what was that business? Thanks.\nJohn Greene: Yes. So the $80 million was related to servicing issues, the lion's share of that, the significant share of that was related to student loans. There was a small amount that we put up related to personal loans upon reviewing that, there may be an opportunity to release that reserve, very small though. The $80 million is not connected to the issues that we discussed in July. So what I tried to do is provide as much context as I could. So we've dedicated number of resources to identifying issues to help on this consumer compliance journey. As with any company, as you dedicated resources, they come up to speed, they are going to get more effective at identifying issues and correcting issues. This is symptomatic of that progress. So we've got folks that are coming through every single bit of our business to make sure we're executing consumer compliance at a high level. An issue was found. Cross-functional team reviewed it, and we made an election that we are going to accrue something at year-end to cover potential remediation payments.\nJohn Pancari: Okay. And just related to that, so this is a newer issue versus what was discussed in July? And is it also newer versus what is in your existing consent order tied to student loans?\nJohn Greene: Yes. So what we disclosed in July was a broad program around risk and compliance management activities. The specifics of the particular issues weren't discussed in any details. And what I've shared with you right now is probably as much information as I'm going to share at this point. So the takeaway should be is that we're progressing on the risk and compliance management activities. We're getting better at identifying issues. When we find an issue, we're going to deal with it. And we found an issue. We've put up a reserve for that issue. And we're going to work through further details on it in order to ensure that consumer compliance is where we want it to be. So with that, I think I'll probably close at this particular item out, if you don't mind.\nJohn Pancari: No, that's fine. Thank you for that. And my last thing is very quick one on the loan growth guidance. You guided to average balances for 2024 were up modestly. Can you help maybe quantify the up modestly. It could give me -- help frame it. Thanks \nJohn Greene: Yes. So 5% to 6% on average.\nJohn Pancari: Okay. Great. Thanks, John.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo.\nDon Fandetti: John, you know, it's good to see the delinquency formation showing some progress. Can you talk about later stage delinquency rates? I mean, they seem like they're still going up on a year-over-year basis or like our cure rates. I'm still trying to get my arms around this like potentially 5% NCO rate. it just seems high for Discover.\nJohn Greene: Yes, the later stage buckets are kind of modestly improving. We're seeing improvements across every bucket. The first bucket is this really the key one, and then as you get into later and later buckets, the ability to cure just becomes more challenging because the situation that consumers and but we are seeing mild improvements there. So that that also is encouraging.\nDon Fandetti: Okay. And the 2023 vintage, can you talk a little bit about what your early read is on that? \nJohn Greene: Yes. The net of it is that it's early. So it's performing profitably, and we're going to continue to keep our eye on it. \nDon Fandetti: Does that mean it's not really trending that well relative to your expectations? Or is it kind of in line? \nJohn Greene: No, no, I didn't say that. It's just -- it's early. So is performing generally in line with expectations.\nDon Fandetti: Okay. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question from Jeff Adelson with Morgan Stanley.\nJeff Adelson: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. John, I just wanted to kind of follow up on the charge-off guide. I know you've mentioned that you're hopeful this -- your comment at the low end. But could you maybe just dive into what would take us to the low versus the high end here? And if this delinquency formation slowing continues throughout the year, is that kind of what's embedded in your expectation at getting at the low end here? \nJohn Greene: Yes. Thank you. Yes. So our baseline is that it's going to come in at the low end. Now I shared the information in terms of the macros that we use for reserves pretty consistent in terms of what we used for our, what I'll say, the second half view of charge-offs. So what could make that worse? Certainly, change to the macros, some servicing issues, which highly unlikely or a miss in terms of forecasting. I'm comfortable with our forecasting team. I'm comfortable with our servicing team and we've got a number of programs, and we've dedicated a lot of dollars in terms of analytics, in terms of call frequency and best time to call, and we've worked on our call scripts to ensure they're compliant but also effective in terms of prioritizing payments. So I feel \u2013 feel good about that. So the range just reflects a level of kind of broad uncertainty that we're going to tighten.\nJeff Adelson: Got it. And just as my follow-up, as we think about the NIM guide this year, I know you mentioned you're embedded in an expectation of four rate cuts. If I think about where NIM exited the year though, it feels like the range of rate cuts using your 5 basis points for every 25, it seems like there's more rate cut that embedded in there. Can you maybe just help us understand the drivers is, there may be a little bit more interest accrual reversal going on? And maybe help us understand what you're assuming in positive betas on the way down? Is it going to be a little bit slower than what we've seen in the last four rate cuts on the way up?\nJohn Greene: Yes. So good question. So let me start off with 2023 and then the fourth quarter of 2023. So as business, my view is great execution in terms of being able to kind of manage net interest margin, so year-over-year, we're up. I think we're an outlier, and that's from that standpoint in financial services. What we saw in the fourth quarter was cost of funding increased as lower rate CDs term out and higher rate CDs would come in. Our OSA rate remains competitive. And the expectation on beta is that it will be in the mid-70s in a declining rate. And I hope that the beta on the declining rate is higher. Also something that's not baked into the elements of the guidance. But certainly, with the exit of student loans or the proposed exit from the student loan business, that's going to throw a lot of liquidity back into the business. That will give us an opportunity to be slightly more aggressive in terms of deposit pricing. That -- again, that will be a second half activity. So the four rate cuts that we put into the baseline assumption, again, two more than what we had forecasted in December. It could be as many as six, which if it is, that will certainly impact deposit betas and deposit pricing and consequentially net interest margin. So the guide here, I think, is appropriate, perhaps a little conservative. And our baseline expectation is that we're going to deliver to the upper end of the \u2013\u2013 the guidance range.\nJeff Adelson: Okay. Thank you for taking my questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Terry Ma with Barclays.\nTerry Ma: Hi, thanks. Good morning. Maybe I just want to touch on the loan growth guide for 2024 a little bit. Aside from the balance transfers and promos, how much control do you actually have on growth because going from 15% loan growth to 0% just seems like a hard pivot to me. So maybe can you just talk a little bit more about that? And then my second question is just what needs to happen before you can actually grow again, and is there a way to think about what that growth rate looks like as we look out towards 2025 and beyond? Thank you.\nJohn Greene: Okay. Thanks Terry. So, I think it's important to take a look at the quarterly trends on loan growth versus the total year because each quarter, what you will see is that the amount of loan growth decreased quarter-over-quarter. And that was partly due to payment rate, partly due to underwriting standards, and partly due to kind of sales activity slowing as well. So, in 2024, we've guided to loan growth to be flat. Again, payment rate is 100 basis points higher than it was in 2019. That could be a positive if it holds where it ended the year, it's not going to impact loan growth. So, I feel like what we've tried to do here is put something on the table that's reasonable that doesn't reflect a level of undue risk taking in a time where consumer behavior is actually changing relatively dynamically. If you think back 2.5 years ago coming out of the pandemic to kind of where it is today and also the impact of inflation that hit certainly all consumers, but certainly in terms of our prime revolver -- consumers, the lower -- third of those consumers were impacted fairly significantly by inflation. So, we do want to kind of watch, as I said previously, watch delinquency formations and our other metrics before we press on the gas on generating high level of new accounts in 2024.\nTerry Ma: Thanks. And is there a way to think about what growth would look like before when you reaccelerate?\nJohn Greene: Yes, I would go back to kind of historical growth rates. The companies typically delivered somewhere between 3% and 8% year-over-year growth. And then we feel like our underwriting and credit and the opportunity to lend profitably at a rate higher than that, we will do that. So what -- an important thing for our investors to remember is we seek to generate high returns over the short, mid and long-term. And that's essentially what this plan is seeking to deliver.\nEric Wasserstrom: So, Todd, I think we have time for one more, please.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. We'll go next to John Hecht with Jefferies.\nJohn Hecht: Morning guys. Thanks for taking my question. I know you've answered a lot on credit, so I apologize for one more. But your 2018 and 2019 charge-off levels were in the low 3% range. And I think we -- we've all kind of said that was a good environment, but a relatively normal environment. You're guiding toward a high -- relatively higher, closer to 5% charge-off rate this year despite low unemployment. I know you kind of called out the 2022 vintage is something to think about there. But maybe can you talk about the attribution of the difference in charge-off rates between that period and now? I think the kind of -- the reason for the question is just to give us a sort of level of understanding of where we are in the credit cycle and give us comfort that things will stabilize, if not improve from here?\nJohn Greene: Yes, happy to, John. So, a few points. So, we're in a significantly different environment today than we were back in 2018 and 2019. So, we're coming off of two years of abnormally low losses, so sub 2%. We had an incredibly high payment rate in -- going back two years ago, that is normalized. What we're seeing is that consumers had significant amount of savings. Those savings levels have been depleted. You had a spending pattern with the consumers across the Board that was reflecting kind of pent-up demand. And as savings rate came down, the consumers needed to adjust their spending patterns. Some did successfully, some not. And then you're also seeing inflation, if you go back 1.5 years or two years ago, inflation significantly outpacing wage growth. And that put certainly the lower quartile of the consumers in a significant amount of stress and that's across all sectors of the economy. So not specifically to our prime revolver segment. And on top of that, you also had in '21 and '22, two very large vintages. And so you put all those together, what naturally is going to happen is you're going to have charge-offs. What I'll say is peak before they normalize back to levels that you're accustomed to seeing from Discover. So my sense is that given real wage growth, our consumers will end up in, frankly, a better spot in '24 and '25 than they were in '22 and '23. And our charge-off forecast and reserves reflect a view that the consumers will manage through this and delinquency formation will continue to slow. So anyway, I hope that -- hopefully, this color is helpful.\nJohn Hecht: That's super helpful. And maybe could you give us a sense of the charge-offs by product or maybe like the -- is the mix going to be consistent with historical mixes just to give us a sense from a modeling perspective?\nJohn Greene: Yes. The only piece of information I'm going to give is in the fourth quarter, we expect student loan charge-offs to be significantly lower because we\u2019re exiting.\nJohn Hecht: Thank you.\nEric Wasserstrom: All right. Well, I think we're going to conclude the call there. Thank you for joining us. I know there was a few of you still in queue, who we didn't get to, but feel free to reach out to the IR team. We'll be around all day and available to answer additional questions. Thanks for joining us, and have a great day.\nOperator: And this does conclude today's Discover Financial Services earnings conference call. You may disconnect your line at this time, and have a wonderful day.",

            "name": "John Greene",
            "content": "Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with our summary financial results on Slide 4. In the quarter, we reported net income of $388 million, down from just over $1 billion in the prior year quarter. There are three broad trends to call out. First, we grew revenue 13%, reflecting 15% loan growth, partially offset by modest NIM compression. Second, provision expense grew by $1 billion. Charge-offs increased, but landed at the low-end of our expected range. Strong loan growth and higher delinquency drove the increase to our reserve balance. Finally, expenses increased 19% year-over-year, reflecting investments in compliance and risk management, a reserve for customer remediation and higher marketing expense to support our national Cashback Debit campaign. We'll get into the details of these topics on the following pages. Turning to Slide 5. Our net interest margin ended the quarter at 10.98%, down 29 basis points from the prior year and up 3 basis points sequentially. The decline from the prior year quarter was driven by higher funding costs and higher interest charge-offs, which were partially offset by higher prime rates and increases in revolving balances. For the full year, net interest margin was 11.07%, up 3 basis points from the prior year. This margin performance reflects the improvement in our funding mix over the past several years and a reduced level of balance transfer and promotional balances as we tightened underwriting. Receivable growth remained robust. Card increased 13% year-over-year due to contributions from the prior year new account growth and a lower payment rate. The payment rate declined about 110 basis points from the sequential quarter and is now 100 basis points above 2019 levels. Overall, new account growth declined 9% as a result of credit actions. Sales were up 3% compared to the prior year quarter. Personal loans were up 23%, driven by continued strength in originations and lower payment rate versus the prior year. Student loans were flat year-over-year as we prepare for a potential sale of this portfolio we will cease accepting applications for new loans on February 1. Our Deposit business delivered outstanding performance in a challenging year. Average deposits were up 21% year-over-year and 4% sequentially. Our direct-to-consumer balances grew $3 billion in the period and $14 billion in the year. Looking at other revenue on Slide 6. Non-interest income increased $74 million or 11%. This was primarily driven by an increase in loan fee income, higher transaction processing revenue from our PULSE business and higher net discount and interchange revenue. Our rewards rate was 137 basis points in the period and 140 basis points for the full year 2023, a decrease of 1 basis point on a full year basis. The decline reflects lower cashback match from slowing new account growth and our active management of our 5% categories. Moving to expenses on Slide 7. Total operating expenses were up $280 million, or 19% year-over-year, and up 22% from the prior quarter. Looking at our major expense categories, compensation cost increased $73 million or 13% from higher headcount. Marketing expenses increased $59 million or 19%. Professional fees were up driven by continued investment in compliance and risk management capabilities, while other expense reflects a reserve for customer remediation. Moving to credit performance on Slide 8. Total net charge-offs were 4.11%, 198 basis points higher than the prior year and up 59 basis points from the prior quarter. In card, as anticipated, delinquency formation is slowing as more recent vintages season. We added a slide detailing some of the drivers of our credit performance in the appendix to the earnings presentation. Turning to the allowance for credit losses on Slide 9. This quarter, we increased our reserves by $618 million, and our reserve rate increased by 17 basis points to just over 7.2%. The increase in reserves was driven by receivable growth and higher near-term loss content from higher delinquencies. Under CECL, reserve levels increase as you approach peak losses. We expect our losses to rise through the midyear and then plateau through the back half with some seasonal variation. In terms of our macroeconomic outlook, our view of unemployment was relatively unchanged, while household net worth projections increased slightly. These changes provided a small benefit to reserves. Looking at Slide 10. Our common equity Tier 1 for the period was 11.3%. The sequential decline of 30 basis points was driven largely by asset growth. We declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.70 per share of common stock. Concluding on Slide 11 with our perspective on 2024. These exclude the impact of a potential student loan portfolio sale. We expect end-of-period loan growth to be relatively flat, while average loan growth will be up modestly year-over-year. We expect full year net interest margin to be 10.5% to 10.8%. We're currently anticipating core rate cuts of 25 basis points in 2024. This is two more rate cuts than in our forecast in December. Each cut reduces NIM by approximately 5 basis points subject to a deposit beta. We expect total operating expenses to increase by a mid-single-digit percent. This contemplates our expectation for compliance-related costs to be approximately $500 million this year. Total expenses may increase as incremental resources or remediation is required. We expect net charge-offs in the range of 4.9% to 5.3%. Finally, regarding capital return. We will participate in this year CCAR's process, and believe the results should help inform our view of capital management for 2024. Importantly, our capital management priorities have not changed and remain centered on supporting organic growth and returning capital to shareholders. To summarize, we continue to generate solid financial results. For 2024, we will continue to advance our compliance and risk management capabilities and invest in actions that drive sustainable, long-term value creation. With that, I'll turn the call back to our operator to open the line for Q&A. Hi, Rick, John Greene here. That is organic loan growth. So all of the guidance excluded the impact of a potential student loan asset sale. Sure, sure. Thanks, Moshe. So the bonus of loan growth sales, new account generation, payment rate trends. And so what we're anticipating for sales given the slowdown through 2023 in terms of sales, although we did have a pretty strong holiday season, sales will be relatively flat year-over-year. New account generation relative to last year, certainly down, but overall positive new account growth. And payment rate, what we've tried to do here is kind of derisk the forecast. So we assume that 100 basis points of payment rate that's elevated versus 2019 will remain elevated. So those three components reflect end up coming in and reflecting on our projections. Now loan growth could actually come in higher if payment rate continues to decline. But overall, our basis for guidance, loan growth, net interest margin and charge-offs was to give a range and then also be relatively conservative in terms of the expectations on those ranges. Sure. Yes. So there's a couple of different components that are driving that. So if you go back in time, we had about two years of unusually low charge-offs and delinquencies, so from the pandemic. And that process of normalization, typically will take about the same amount of time, two years. The vintages, 2021 and 2022 are seasoning, and that's why we expect it to plateau. The 2023 vintage actually was relatively large, but too early to call whether it's going to outperform our expectations, but certainly, a highly profitable vintage from our vantage point today. So what you're actually just seeing is a period of normalization. My expectation is that charge-offs will plateau and then and beginning in 2025, I would expect those to step down. Now you will know from this past year and the prior year, what we've tried to do in terms of the guidance is the conservative in terms of the range. And throughout 2023, we tightened the range and actually came in at the low end. So my hope is that we'll be able to do the same thing in 2024. Yes. Thanks, Ryan. So our approach in 2023 and then early into 2024 was that we took a look at underwriting and performance of, what I'll say, buckets within our underwriting box. And essentially tightened and we've tightened throughout 2023. What you're seeing here in terms of account growth, at least projections today, is us getting back to 2018 and 2019 levels as we continue to watch the 2022 and 2023 vintage perform. And six months from now, we may end up stepping in a little bit more aggressively. But what we wanted to do certainly was let kind of get further confirmation that the delinquency trends that we have seen in terms of slowing rate of delinquency formation continue to persist and that the charge-offs, the forecasted come in at or better than our expectations. If those two factors are at play, there will be an opportunity to be more aggressive in terms of new account growth. Yes. Thanks, Ryan. So good news. So it is actually progressing to schedule. So as a matter of fact, last evening, we signed a servicing agreement with [Nelnet] to become the servicer of this portfolio. So that was great news. It was a competitive process. And certainly, Nelnet showed that there's a commitment to continue to dedicate resources and service that portfolio at a high level. The next step will be to continue the servicing migration activities. We expect those activities will take around six months. We're conservatively it may take a month or two longer. And then as we're doing that, our adviser will begin to market the portfolio. So our expectations are that it will sell in the second half. And the implications for the business are as follows: So there's $9.5 billion of receivables. That equates to risk-weighted assets of about $10.8 billion. We expect that, that will be -- the exit of that will be -- have a positive impact on net interest margin by somewhere between 10 bps and 20 bps on a full year basis. Charge-off rate could tick up mildly, so under 5 bps. And as of 12/31, we had $858 million of reserves. So with a successful exit, those reserves will drop. And the sale price, the market will determine that, but we expect it to go above par. Yes. So let me try to give a little bit of color that hopefully gets folks comfortable with our view of loan growth today. So in 2023, really, really strong loan growth. Much of that was driven both by new account growth, but also a slowing payment rate, that payment rate in our assumptions is holding flat. And as a result, what we expect to see is the 2023 vintage will begin to kind of build in terms of assets, but there's likely going to be some impact from sales. And then also as we cycle through the 2022 vintage, we're not expecting significant new balance builds from that vintage. Now, maybe there will be. But overall, what we've tried to do here is reflect our view of our underwriting box today, not reflect any potential openings of our underwriting box in the later part of 2023. And if we have deliver on loan growth, that will be fantastic. The other element that has come into play here as we pulled back on balance transfers and promotional balances in the second part of 2023. We don't anticipate significantly increasing that level of balance transfer, promotional balances. Now, if we do, that will certainly be accretive to loan growth as well. So, what you're hearing in the guidance is that our expectation is that there's an opportunity to deliver better. But certainly, we've positioned both the guidance and the business to be conservative at least for the next quarter or two. Yes. Okay. So, let me start with the reserves. So, -- and the remediation reserve that we put up. So, they're unrelated. So, the merchant tiering reserve we booked $365 million as a liability, that has moved now about $370 million just as we've had some payments and other flows in through the interchange that we had to correct manually for. So, the progress there in terms of discussions with our merchants is positive. We'll -- we don't have enough data points to make a material change to that reserve level yet, but it's progressing, my view, positively through the end of the year and today as we speak. Now, separately, we put up $80 million for a -- as we described it, a customer remediation reserve. Now, some context to that is as part of this compliance journey, we've put in a significant number of resources to help us identify and correct issues. And as we prepare the business to continue to move forward to drive organic growth, we're getting much, much better at identifying issues and we identify an issue what we've done here is if we think there's is appropriate to refund customer payments, we're going to do that. So, we identified a particular issue largely within servicing for our student loan business, although there was a general impact in another business line and we continue to look across our business. But the lion's share of that reserve relates to student loans and essentially what we're doing is trying to position the business and that product for a successful exit. Okay. Sanjay, I feel like your question is a five-part question, but what we'll do our best to answer it. So the loan growth aspect that you asked, it is completely unrelated to any regulatory issues, so nothing to connect on that point. In terms of capital return, our commitment to capital return and capital allocation have not changed. So, first to invest in profitable organic growth; and second, to return excess capital to shareholders. So as we kind of progressed through the fourth quarter, we remained on pause with our buybacks. And given we've got a new CEO coming in, we are contending with a number of different compliance and risk management matters. We got the merchant tiering reserve. We don't have any feedback from our regulators on that point. We decided that it would be most appropriate to remain conservative in terms of our guidance related to buybacks. We will go through CCAR, as I said in my prepared remarks, that will form a view of capital under significant stress as it always does. And then we're going to have the exit or hopefully, the exit from the Student Loan business, which will provide free up at least $2 billion worth of capital. So what you're hearing here hopefully is some indications that one, we're committed to returning excess capital to shareholders; two, that there will be excess capital generated and available; and three, we're going to go through a diligent process internally, share it with our Board and then take the Board's direction in terms of buybacks. And... Yes, that was part 5A, I think. Yes. So that remains in effect and our chosen provider, Nelnet is fully aware of the consent order requirements in terms of kind of servicing excellence. And they were chosen because they've got a track record in terms of being able to kind of service a portfolio such as this, and they've dedicated both technology and resources to ensure a seamless transition. Yes, yes. Thanks for that. We are hoping that, that question would come out. So the -- let me talk about the reserves for the quarter, and then I'll give you perspective on 2024 and what could potentially happen there. So we grew receivables in the quarter, $5.7 billion. Now some of that was transactor balances that are reserved light. But one thing that we've been consistent on in terms of our communication is that as we approach peak losses, reserve levels increase. And what we've said previously is, typically, we hit the highest reserve rate level one to two quarters before peak losses. So that's the path we're on. Let me provide some details on some assumptions that were used to set the reserve levels this year at year end. And then I'll give a perspective on what we -- what could happen in 2024. So macro is relatively benign. So unemployment levels, we ended the year at 3.7 what we've assumed is an unemployment level of 4.2. So a mild increase, household worth, mild decrease, savings rate, mild increase and GDP to be in 2024 to be about 1.3%. So relatively conservative, but not overly optimistic of assumptions. Now what will come into play in 2024 is obviously the macros, which will continue to be important. The portfolio performance and -- by the way, it is tracking to our expectations with month-over-month delinquency formation declining. The credit quality of the book remains relatively consistent with what we've done historically. So our expectation is that assuming the macros remain consistent and the portfolio performance remains to our expectation that there will be some level of opportunity to reduce the reserve rate in 2024. Now that's subject to a significant amount of governance, and we're going to make sure that we comply with our internal processes and generally accepted accounting principles. So they're my caveats. But there's a lot of things that are different today than day one. So the step down will be aligned with those points I just mentioned. Yes. And thanks for the question, Bill. So, I just to give you kind of the benefit of some data here. From September through December this year, so the 30-plus delinquencies have declined month-over-month. So in September, we peaked at an increase month-over-month of 26 bps. What we said in the fourth quarter is we expected that to decline. Our October formation increased 20 bps, so relative to decline to the prior month. November, 15 bps, December, 11 bps, and our expectation is that will continue to decline. Where it becomes negative, we're not going to get into that because it will be subject to a number of different things, including kind of our origination path and broad macro. So to get to the essence of your question, we do have a level of confidence regarding kind of what's happening in the portfolio and the trend. And as we progress in 2024 that will be reflected in hopefully, tightening guidance and then also -- tightening guidance to the lower end and then also, hopefully, reserve rate changes. Okay. Yes. Thanks, Bill. So our expectation is that the long-term efficiency ratio will be sub-40%. So there's still a view that, that will happen. The reason we put the -- what I'll call is the caveat in the 2024 expense guidance was a number of different institutions when they've been on this compliance and risk management journey have not been able to call what the actual compliance and risk management spend would be. We had that remediation reserve in the fourth quarter. There were some indications that we might have to put something up for that. But we didn't know. There's still some level of unknowns, unknowns. And I wanted to make sure we're clear to the people listening to this call that, there is some level of risk to the expense guidance. Now that said, 5% on our expense base is a significant amount of dollars. We feel like we have nearly a full complement of resources around risk and compliance today, which is good news. Our issues management capabilities significantly improved. Our path to improving overall governance is certainly on the right trajectory. So those factors give me confidence that we're not going to have a huge surprise. But there could be just don't have enough certainty given where we are on our compliance journey. Now, the rest of the cost base, there's a couple of things to keep in mind here. So right -- today, we have nearly 3,000 resources dedicated to risk and compliance management. A significant amount of those resources are dedicated to issues related to student loan servicing, which with a successful exit and transfer, it will give us an opportunity to scrutinize the cost base in a different way. So that's certainly on the list of planned activities for the second quarter, third quarter, and then hopefully, we begin some execution in the fourth quarter. So overall, I feel comfortable with the expense guidance that we've provided. And we're going to do our best to make sure that every dollar we spend is wise and that the shareholders get the benefit from that. You're welcome, Bill Thanks. Yes. So the $80 million was related to servicing issues, the lion's share of that, the significant share of that was related to student loans. There was a small amount that we put up related to personal loans upon reviewing that, there may be an opportunity to release that reserve, very small though. The $80 million is not connected to the issues that we discussed in July. So what I tried to do is provide as much context as I could. So we've dedicated number of resources to identifying issues to help on this consumer compliance journey. As with any company, as you dedicated resources, they come up to speed, they are going to get more effective at identifying issues and correcting issues. This is symptomatic of that progress. So we've got folks that are coming through every single bit of our business to make sure we're executing consumer compliance at a high level. An issue was found. Cross-functional team reviewed it, and we made an election that we are going to accrue something at year-end to cover potential remediation payments. Yes. So what we disclosed in July was a broad program around risk and compliance management activities. The specifics of the particular issues weren't discussed in any details. And what I've shared with you right now is probably as much information as I'm going to share at this point. So the takeaway should be is that we're progressing on the risk and compliance management activities. We're getting better at identifying issues. When we find an issue, we're going to deal with it. And we found an issue. We've put up a reserve for that issue. And we're going to work through further details on it in order to ensure that consumer compliance is where we want it to be. So with that, I think I'll probably close at this particular item out, if you don't mind. Yes. So 5% to 6% on average. Yes, the later stage buckets are kind of modestly improving. We're seeing improvements across every bucket. The first bucket is this really the key one, and then as you get into later and later buckets, the ability to cure just becomes more challenging because the situation that consumers and but we are seeing mild improvements there. So that that also is encouraging. Yes. The net of it is that it's early. So it's performing profitably, and we're going to continue to keep our eye on it. No, no, I didn't say that. It's just -- it's early. So is performing generally in line with expectations. Yes. Thank you. Yes. So our baseline is that it's going to come in at the low end. Now I shared the information in terms of the macros that we use for reserves pretty consistent in terms of what we used for our, what I'll say, the second half view of charge-offs. So what could make that worse? Certainly, change to the macros, some servicing issues, which highly unlikely or a miss in terms of forecasting. I'm comfortable with our forecasting team. I'm comfortable with our servicing team and we've got a number of programs, and we've dedicated a lot of dollars in terms of analytics, in terms of call frequency and best time to call, and we've worked on our call scripts to ensure they're compliant but also effective in terms of prioritizing payments. So I feel \u2013 feel good about that. So the range just reflects a level of kind of broad uncertainty that we're going to tighten. Yes. So good question. So let me start off with 2023 and then the fourth quarter of 2023. So as business, my view is great execution in terms of being able to kind of manage net interest margin, so year-over-year, we're up. I think we're an outlier, and that's from that standpoint in financial services. What we saw in the fourth quarter was cost of funding increased as lower rate CDs term out and higher rate CDs would come in. Our OSA rate remains competitive. And the expectation on beta is that it will be in the mid-70s in a declining rate. And I hope that the beta on the declining rate is higher. Also something that's not baked into the elements of the guidance. But certainly, with the exit of student loans or the proposed exit from the student loan business, that's going to throw a lot of liquidity back into the business. That will give us an opportunity to be slightly more aggressive in terms of deposit pricing. That -- again, that will be a second half activity. So the four rate cuts that we put into the baseline assumption, again, two more than what we had forecasted in December. It could be as many as six, which if it is, that will certainly impact deposit betas and deposit pricing and consequentially net interest margin. So the guide here, I think, is appropriate, perhaps a little conservative. And our baseline expectation is that we're going to deliver to the upper end of the \u2013\u2013 the guidance range. Okay. Thanks Terry. So, I think it's important to take a look at the quarterly trends on loan growth versus the total year because each quarter, what you will see is that the amount of loan growth decreased quarter-over-quarter. And that was partly due to payment rate, partly due to underwriting standards, and partly due to kind of sales activity slowing as well. So, in 2024, we've guided to loan growth to be flat. Again, payment rate is 100 basis points higher than it was in 2019. That could be a positive if it holds where it ended the year, it's not going to impact loan growth. So, I feel like what we've tried to do here is put something on the table that's reasonable that doesn't reflect a level of undue risk taking in a time where consumer behavior is actually changing relatively dynamically. If you think back 2.5 years ago coming out of the pandemic to kind of where it is today and also the impact of inflation that hit certainly all consumers, but certainly in terms of our prime revolver -- consumers, the lower -- third of those consumers were impacted fairly significantly by inflation. So, we do want to kind of watch, as I said previously, watch delinquency formations and our other metrics before we press on the gas on generating high level of new accounts in 2024. Yes, I would go back to kind of historical growth rates. The companies typically delivered somewhere between 3% and 8% year-over-year growth. And then we feel like our underwriting and credit and the opportunity to lend profitably at a rate higher than that, we will do that. So what -- an important thing for our investors to remember is we seek to generate high returns over the short, mid and long-term. And that's essentially what this plan is seeking to deliver. Yes, happy to, John. So, a few points. So, we're in a significantly different environment today than we were back in 2018 and 2019. So, we're coming off of two years of abnormally low losses, so sub 2%. We had an incredibly high payment rate in -- going back two years ago, that is normalized. What we're seeing is that consumers had significant amount of savings. Those savings levels have been depleted. You had a spending pattern with the consumers across the Board that was reflecting kind of pent-up demand. And as savings rate came down, the consumers needed to adjust their spending patterns. Some did successfully, some not. And then you're also seeing inflation, if you go back 1.5 years or two years ago, inflation significantly outpacing wage growth. And that put certainly the lower quartile of the consumers in a significant amount of stress and that's across all sectors of the economy. So not specifically to our prime revolver segment. And on top of that, you also had in '21 and '22, two very large vintages. And so you put all those together, what naturally is going to happen is you're going to have charge-offs. What I'll say is peak before they normalize back to levels that you're accustomed to seeing from Discover. So my sense is that given real wage growth, our consumers will end up in, frankly, a better spot in '24 and '25 than they were in '22 and '23. And our charge-off forecast and reserves reflect a view that the consumers will manage through this and delinquency formation will continue to slow. So anyway, I hope that -- hopefully, this color is helpful. Yes. The only piece of information I'm going to give is in the fourth quarter, we expect student loan charge-offs to be significantly lower because we're exiting."

            "content": "Thank you, Eric, and thanks to our listeners for joining today's call. 2023 was a year of significant change for Discover, and we believe the actions we've taken position the company to continue driving strong long-term performance. When I stepped into the Interim CEO role, I had three priorities. My top priority was to advance our culture of compliance. We have made meaningful strides in our corporate governance and risk management capabilities. That said, this is a journey that will take time and continued investments over the coming years to further enhance our compliance and risk management capabilities. My second priority is to continue delivering a great customer experience at every touch point, which we do by providing our customers with award-winning service and products. I'd like to thank our 20,000 employees for delivering a great customer experience to help our customers achieve a brighter financial future. In 2023, we were recognized for the first time as one of Fortune 100 best companies to work for. This award adds to accolade for working parents, women, people with disabilities and members of the LGBTQ+ community, and we're proud to be an inclusive workplace. My third priority is to sustain our strong financial performance. We reported net income of $2.9 billion for full year 2023 and earnings per share of $11.26. This makes 2023 the third best year for EPS performance in our history. In delivering these results, we achieved several important milestones. We exceeded $100 billion in card receivables, grew deposits by 21% year-over-year, successfully launched our cashback debit account on a national scale, and we announced our intent to exit the private student lending business. On December 11, we announced a new leadership and we're excited to have Michael Rhodes joining us for our incoming Chief Executive Officer. Michael is an experienced leader with a deep background in the financial services industry. He has managed all aspects of our Consumer Banking business with deep experience in the credit card space, payments, online and mobile banking and served as Group Head of Innovation and Technology. His appointment marks the conclusion of a rigorous search process, and we look forward to Michael's arrival. When Michael arrives, I will return to my prior role on Discover's Board of Directors. In conclusion, I'm proud of the progress we made in 2023. Our integrated digital banking model, resilient financial performance and maturing risk management and compliance capabilities position Discover well for 2024 and beyond. With that, I'll now turn the call over to John Greene, who will review our fourth quarter 2023 financial results in more detail and provide some perspective on 2024. This is John Owen. I'll take part of that, and John Greene will take the capital part. What I would tell you is over the last 18 months or so, we've made significant progress improving our risk management and compliance capabilities. We've increased our investments on risk and compliance in 2022 to 2023 up to about a $500 million level. And as John mentioned earlier, we think expense growth, and that will be in the mid-single digits in line with other guidance we've given. We've made improvements in risk and compliance, but we still have quite a bit of work to do. One thing I'd point out, the FDIC consent order, which we did get and was made public, it does not include the misclassification issue in that scope of work. We're working closely with our regulators on that topic and really don't have anything further to add on that topic at this point in time."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Third Quarter 2023 Discover Financial Services Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there'll be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Eric Wasserstrom, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nEric Wasserstrom: Thank you, Chelsea, and welcome to this morning's call. I'll begin on Slide 2 of our earnings presentation, which you can find in the Financials section of our Investor Relations website, investorrelations.discover.com. Our discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. Please refer to our notices regarding forward-looking statements that appear in our third quarter earnings press release and presentation. Our call today will include remarks from our Interim CEO, John Owen, and John Greene, our Chief Financial Officer. After we conclude our formal comments, there will be time for a question-and-answer session. During the Q&A session, you will be permitted to ask one question, followed by one follow-up question. After your follow-up question, please return to the queue. Now, it's my pleasure to turn the call over to John.\nJohn Owen: Thank you, Eric, and thanks to our listeners for joining today's call. As I shared a few months ago, I have three priorities in my role as Interim CEO. First is, continue delivering a great customer experience at every touch point, which we do by providing our customers award-winning service and products. At the heart of this is, a team of more than 20,000 employees connected by common values and a shared mission to help people achieve a brighter financial future. Our second priority is to advance our culture of compliance. We have made significant strides in this area. By now, you've all had the opportunity to review the consent order issued by the FDIC in September. Consistent with the terms of this consent order, we have made meaningful investments in improving our corporate governance and enterprise risk management capabilities, and expect to drive further enhancements across the organization in the coming quarters. We have also started the process of engaging with our merchant partners on the card misclassification issue, remain in active dialog with our regulators on this topic. The resolution of this issue is likely to be complex and we anticipate it will take several quarters fully resolve. Our third priority is to sustain our strong financial performance. In the third quarter, revenue was up 17% year-over-year, driven by strong asset growth. Our credit losses continued to perform in-line with expected ranges. In addition, we were off to a strong start with the launch of our Cashback Debit product. We continue to believe that this product will be an important channel to welcome many new customers into our company. To highlight the Discover experience and support our brand and banking products, we're proud to have just introduced a new national advertising campaign featuring celebrity spokesperson, Jennifer Coolidge. As we continue to advance our priorities, we are focused on preserving and enhancing the elements to make Discover a great place to work. Last month, we're ranked among the 2023 Fortune Best Workplaces in Financial Services & Insurance. This accolade builds upon our recognition as one of Fortune 100's Best Companies to Work For. Before handing the call off to John Greene, I'll briefly comment on the CEO search. The Board is considering several excellent candidates both internal and external, remain confident that we will identify the next outstanding leader for this organization in the coming months. In summary, we continue to target excellence in all parts of our business, driving sustainable, long-term financial performance. I will now hand the call off to John to review our results in more detail.\nJohn Greene: Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with our financial summary results on Slide 4. In this quarter, we reported net income of $683 million, down from just over $1 billion in the prior-year quarter. Provision expense grew by $929 million, reflecting an increase in reserves and charge-offs. Strong loan growth, along with changing macroeconomic and household liquidity conditions drove the increase to our reserve balance. Charge-offs increased due to portfolio seasoning and remain in line with expectations. Revenue grew 17%, deposits grew 23%, and expenses increased 6% year-over-year. Further details are reflected on Slide 5. Net interest income was up $479 million year-over-year, or 17%. Our net interest margin ended the quarter at 10.95%, down 10 basis points from the prior year and down 11 basis points sequentially. This decrease was driven by higher funding costs, which were partially offset by the benefits from higher prime rates. Receivable growth was robust. Card increased 16% year-over-year, reflecting new account growth and a lower payment rate versus the prior year. The payment rate declined about 30 basis points quarter-over-quarter, but remains just under 200 basis points above 2019 levels. Sales volume was relatively flat for the quarter. Personal loans were up 25%, driven by strength in originations over the past year and lower payment rates. We continue to experience strong consumer demand while staying disciplined in our underwriting. Student loans were up 1%. Deposit growth in the quarter was solid with average consumer deposits up 23% year-over-year and 4% sequentially. Our direct-to-consumer balances grew $4 billion. Looking at other revenue on Slide 6. Non-interest income increased $97 million or 16%. This was primarily driven by higher transaction processing revenue from our PULSE business, an increase in loan fee income and strong net discount and interchange revenue. Moving to expenses on Slide 7. Total operating expenses were up $86 million or 6% year-over-year and up 4% from the prior quarter. This increase is driven primarily by investments in our compliance and risk management programs, and is reflected across several of our expense line items. Looking at our major expense categories, compensation costs were up $24 million, or 4%, primarily from increased headcount. The increase in information processing expense was driven by software licensing renewals, professional fees reflect an increase in third-party support as we focus on accelerating our compliance and risk management efforts. Moving to credit performance on Slide 8. Total net charge-offs were 3.52%, 181 basis points higher than the prior year and up 30 basis points from the prior quarter. In card, we continue to see the effects of seasoning of newer accounts, which have higher delinquency rates than older vintages. Losses remained consistent with targeted ranges. These newer vintages support strong long-term profitability. Turning to the allowance for credit losses on Slide 9. This quarter, we increased our reserves by $601 million and our reserve rate increased by 22 basis points to just over 7%. The reserve increase reflects a modest deteriorating macroeconomic outlook, increasing delinquencies and higher loan balances. Our macro assumptions reflect a relatively strong labor market, but also consumer headwinds from declining savings rates and increasing debt burdens. Looking at Slide 10. Our common equity Tier 1 for the period was 11.6%. The sequential decline of 10 basis points was driven largely by our strong organic asset growth. We declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.70 per share of common stock. Concluding on Slide 11 with our outlook. We now expect our loan growth to be in the mid-teens, as declining payment rates are offsetting the impact of slowing sales. There is no change to our NIM expectations to be approximately 11% for the full year. We're maintaining our expectations for operating expenses to be up low double digits. And there is no change to our expected range for net charge-offs to be between 3.4% and 3.6% for the year. In conclusion, our business fundamentals remain strong. We continue to generate solid financial results, while building out our compliance and risk management capabilities and prudently investing in actions that drive sustainable long-term performance. With that, I'll turn the call back to our operator to open the line for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Your line is open.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Thanks. Good morning. I just wanted to get a little bit more on the reserve build. As we look ahead, John Greene, can you just talk about like how we should think about that reserve rate increasing from here? Because, obviously, you made some adjustments, but you've said the credit numbers are performing pretty consistent with your expectations. So, is it a reflection on how you see things unfolding next year? Maybe you can just talk about the relation and how we should think about that reserve coverage on a go-forward basis, assuming the unemployment assumptions don't change much.\nJohn Greene: Yeah. Thanks, Sanjay. Appreciate the question. So, let me back up and just give a little bit of an overview in terms of what happened in the quarter and why we increased the reserve rate. So, as we took a look at the portfolio performance and the loan growth, obviously, we had to make a reserve build for loan growth and that represented about 50% of the $600 million. The other 50% or approximately $300 million reflected our view on the macros. Now, while the unemployment numbers remain relatively in line and strong by historical standards, we are seeing some indications of stress. And if we go back to the pandemic and the learnings there, we found that certainly unemployment remains an important factor in terms of reserves, but there's other factors. And what we've done over the past year is try to build into those other factors into our loss models and reserve models, and we've done that. So, as we took a look at household net worth and savings rate, both have deteriorated. And we're seeing deterioration more specifically in lower FICO bands. So, we use those macro factors in order to capture loss content that we felt was appropriate from a reserving standpoint. So, as we look at reserve levels today and into the future, there's a couple of things that I'll say are just kind of general process items. First, it will be dependent on the macro views and whether they remain stable or deteriorating. Second, certainly, the portfolio performance will be a very, very important factor. And then, third will be the timing and trajectory of loss content. So, as losses become closer in terms of our projection period, their probability adjusted and, therefore, could increase reserve rate. Now, there's a lot of detail that I just provided. So, let me give a view of our expectations. So, first, the portfolio is performing generally well, although we are seeing mildly increased stress at the lower FICO bands to mid-FICO bands. We're also seeing that 2022 vintage performed slightly worse than '21, '23 although highly profitable. So, as we look forward to '24, we'll run our process and adjust the reserve as we deem most appropriate. An important piece will also be the charge-off trajectory. So, what we've said previously is we expect charge-offs to peak sometime around the midpoint of the year to the second half of the year, if -- second half of 2024. So, if we don't see a slowing in delinquency rates between now and first quarter, certainly that could be an indication that we'll have to take incremental provisions. So, a lot there. Hopefully enough for you to be able to digest and move forward with.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Yeah. Thank you. That's clear. And just under the banner of sort of regulatory stuff, question number one, it doesn't seem like there is a whole lot to update in terms of other actions. We obviously got the consent order. And then, I saw in the perspective for 2023, you still have a pause for the capital management fees not any change to that. So, could you just give us a sense of sort of how to think about that unpausing of the share repurchase? I know John Owen mentioned it might take several quarters to resolve the merchant issue. So, just trying to reconcile these -- those comments. Thanks.\nJohn Greene: Sure. Yeah, I'll take that one too, Sanjay. So, let me first start out by saying our capital allocation priorities aren't changed. So, invest in the business and return excess capital to shareholders. That's very clear from our business model, our management team and our Board. The second piece to the answer relates to our continued work on the card tiering issue and other governance issues. So, we're making reasonably good progress on both of those. And what we'll do as part of our 2024 planning process is we'll make a recommendation to the Board regarding our capital actions and, specifically, the buyback. And then, we'll provide an update on our January call associated with our fourth quarter earnings.\nJohn Owen: Let me just add a little bit to John's answer on kind of where we are from a regulatory standpoint. The FDIC consent order that was made public this month related really to findings from end of 2021 looking back. As we said before, we've made significant investments in our risk management compliance capabilities over the last 18 months. From a spending standpoint, we've increased our spending from $225 million in 2022 to about $460 million in 2023. But I would tell you, as we've made good progress resolving many of our issues, but we still have a significant amount of work to do before we're satisfied with where we are. On the card misclassification issue, it's not part of that FDIC consent order, that's a separate matter. And where we are on that? As we've mentioned before, we did have an outside law firm complete an investigation on the card misclassification issue. That work is substantially complete at this point in time. We've shared that result of that with our Board of Directors and also with our regulators. At this point in time, we're awaiting feedback from regulators.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Bill Carcache with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nBill Carcache: Thank you. Good morning. I wanted to follow up on the reserve rate comments. John Greene, you've referenced several macro variables impacting the reserve and you also cited higher delinquencies, which are more idiosyncratic. Some investors are concerned that rising DQs may be a function of more than just seasoning. Maybe could you just help us with what your response would be to the concern that some investors have expressed that outsized reserve build is a sign that Discover may have reached for growth too aggressively during the pandemic and is now facing the consequences, perhaps what could ultimately end-up being greater credit degradation in 2024 and possibly beyond, particularly since we're still in an environment where the unemployment rate is 3.5%?\nJohn Greene: Yeah. Thanks, Bill. So, let me go back a little bit and be real clear about what happened in the second half of '21 and '22 in terms of originations. So, second half of '21, we resumed and we went back to our traditional credit box. In the early part of '22, we continued with that traditional Discover credit box. We did do a test in marginal prime and near prime which we turned on. We saw the results and we turned off in the second quarter or early third quarter of '22. So, about six months of originations, not dramatic volume by any means, but certainly a test, it's a good opportunity to learn to see if we could capture some unprofitable share. What we found was, those accounts weren't meeting our return of volatility threshold. So, they were shut down. The rest of the '22 vintage was within the traditional credit box that Discover had. And '23 remains there, although we're peeling back. I will say this, the '22 vintage was certainly outsized as a result of demand and great execution from our marketing team. The profitability of that still remains very, very strong in the short-term, medium-term and long-term. So, if we're going to do it all over again, at this point, we'd certainly answer definitively, yes, we would continue to originate the loans that we put on the books. But that vintage is significantly larger than other vintages. So, the natural loss content of new originations is somewhere between 12 and 24 months, and we expect that to play out, and as I've said, the delinquencies and charge-offs to peak sometime in 2024. So, I hope that is helpful in terms of giving it a little bit of color in terms of the process we went through, our risk tolerance, and what we expect to see from those vintages.\nBill Carcache: Yes, that's helpful. Thanks, John. And appreciate that. If I could ask a follow-up of John Owen, could you speak to the possibility of potentially, I guess, your overall interest level in potentially pursuing strategic alternatives for any of the other businesses, whether that be student lending or anything else? Or is that more likely to wait -- are you more likely to hold off until the new CEO kind of comes on board, which you mentioned, is probably in the next several months?\nJohn Owen: Yeah. Happy to talk about that. As you know, we really can't speculate or talk about rumors or selling parts of the business. What I can tell you is part of our strategic planning process that we do every year is to evaluate all of our businesses for returns and fit from a strategic standpoint. We do that as an annual process. We are going through that process as we speak. But again, that's something we do as part of our annual planning process.\nBill Carcache: Thank you for taking my questions. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nRyan Nash: Hey, good morning, guys.\nJohn Greene: Good morning, Ryan.\nRyan Nash: So, John, you reiterated the expense guidance for '23, which is obviously a positive, and I'm sure you're going through the budgeting process right now. But I guess based on what you know today regarding the consent order, the work that John Owen that you referenced that you're doing, you've made substantial progress plus overall inflation, any sense for what expense growth is going to look like into 2024? Maybe just talk about some of the moving pieces that you expect to drive the expense base next year?\nJohn Greene: Sure. I'm not going to be real specific on '24. We're still in the process of building out the budget and we're yet to share our recommendation with the Board. But I can give you a general kind of direction of what we're seeing. So, the first point I think is important to point out there is that, we continue to target our efficiency ratio to be below 40%. Now, that's over the medium-term. Obviously, our execution this year with the revenue growth and even with substantial investments in compliance and in other areas of the business shows an efficiency ratio significantly below 40%. But over the mid-term, that's something I think investors can expect. The second piece that's important is that despite a significant amount of investment in risk and compliance resources, we will continue to be disciplined in our allocation of expense dollars. And we're focused on making sure that the expense dollars that we do spend either help us with our compliance and risk management programs overall or generate positive earnings potential for the firm. So, they're the focal point. In terms of some of the things where we continue to look at, we're looking at our facilities footprint. We expect to be able to continue to make some progress on that. Our third-party spend, we're scrutinizing significantly with the help of our procurement and vendor management teams. And we're going to continue to look at resource levels to make sure they're appropriate for the environment and what we're trying to execute on. So, I hope that provides some context, Ryan, on how we're thinking about the expense base in the aggregate. And that will translate into what we hope is a reasonably good set of expense and efficiency numbers into the future.\nRyan Nash: Got it. Thanks for the color. And maybe the follow-up on some of Sanjay and Bill's question. So, when I think about the comments that you and John made regarding the trajectory of the '22 vintage, '23 likely hasn't begun to [season] (ph) yet inflation weighing on consumers. Can you maybe just help us understand more broadly just thinking about how we should see the trajectory of delinquencies, meaning could we actually see the underperformance that we've experienced get worse as we sort of go through this next period of time given that you do have this really big vintage that's coming through? And any commentary on framing how much of this is seasoning -- and how much of the delinquency performance is seasoning of the book versus actual underlying deterioration that you're seeing in the core customer base?\nJohn Greene: Yeah. A lot to parse there, Ryan. Let me start by kind of walking you through what we're seeing in the portfolio. So, we are seeing kind of differences in performance on customers that historically have been transactor versus revolver. So, our revolver base, we're seeing a more significant decrease in sales activity, which makes sense, right, as they try to manage their household budget. We're seeing accounts that transacted in '21, '20 and '22 beginning to revolve more. So, the revolve rate is back to where we were historically. And the '23 vintages, early indications are that it's performing very, very well. 2022 is performing well, but not as well as 2023. So, my expectation is that delinquencies will slow in the first half of 2024. If that doesn't happen, that's an indication that the stress that the consumers are seeing is more significant than what we're observing today.\nRyan Nash: Thanks for the color, John.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from John Hecht with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nJohn Hecht: Hey, guys. Thanks very much. Actually, most of my questions and the fact just even the last question was exactly overlapping. So, maybe I'll just quickly ask, number one is, maybe a quick update on kind of the competitive environment, what kind of zero balance kind of transfer activity you're engaging in and other kind of factors that you would tie to competition as kind of the credit environment maybe migrates a little bit? And then, what are you guys -- on that front, what are you doing with respect to underwriting to account for some of these changes that you're seeing as well?\nJohn Greene: Great. Yeah. I'll take that. So, the environment continues to be competitive from a card origination standpoint. We are seeing less competition in kind of the lower FICO band. So, remember, we're a prime revolver, so we're focused on prime customers, and the lower tier of origination envelope is, frankly, less competitive. So, we're careful as we're looking at that to make sure that those folks seeking credit are worthy of credit and not going to turn into a subsequent charge-off. The upper prime remains very, very competitive. The rewards competition, you can see it by the television ads, has certainly subsided significantly. So, the market is always competitive. The competition varies among various FICO bands. And we're going to continue to compete and generate positive new accounts, but we're also mindful of the credit situation.\nJohn Hecht: Great. Thank you, guys, very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Jeff Adelson with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nJeff Adelson: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. John Greene, just wanted to follow up on the commentary of peak losses. I think you mentioned sometimes in -- sometime in mid to late 2024. I think, last quarter, you talked about maybe this getting pushed into 2025. Is there a risk that maybe the peak kind of plateaus at or around those higher levels? Or do you think, as your 2020 vintage kind of peaks out and starts moderating in size, the losses in delinquency should just naturally drift lower?\nJohn Greene: Yeah. I think it will peak, and then, upon its peak, I think it will stabilize up there for a few quarters, maybe two to three quarters, and then we expect it to come down. That's all subject to kind of the macro environment, obviously. But in terms of what we're seeing today, that's the expectation.\nJeff Adelson: And then, just on the sales volumes, I know they were pretty flattish this quarter. Just wondering, under the hood, what's going on there. Is this representative of maybe more of a slower growth in new accounts? Is maybe your same-store customer still growing at a faster pace year-over-year? And then just maybe thinking through the dynamic of faster network volumes, faster debit volumes, anything going on there that's driving your debit and network volumes to reaccelerate versus your proprietary card volumes to slow?\nJohn Greene: Yeah. So, let me start with sales. So, what we're seeing is a downward trend in sales. So, if you go back to the fourth quarter of '23, we're at about 10% year-over-year growth. First quarter was 8%, 2.5% in the second quarter, and about 1% here in the third quarter and through mid-October, about 1%. Interestingly enough, the dynamics are changing in terms of categories. So, online spend is up around 4% to 5%, every day spend is up about 3%. That's largely inflation driven, we believe. And discretionary is flat to down with the exception of entertainment expense or entertainment-related categories, which is up north of 20%, which is hard for me to understand at this point. But we're trying to dig into the details. In terms of implications for next year, we're going to assume a relatively modest sales growth, maybe slow in the lower single digits. The transactor revolver components of that, I mentioned that already. So, more pullback on the revolver base. The other piece of your question is debit transactions. We've had great execution from our PULSE business. So, we've expanded a number of contractual arrangements and also debit choice routing has actually made a difference in the volumes. So, our PULSE team is executing well and appears to be capturing some share.\nJeff Adelson: Okay, great. Thanks for taking my questions.\nJohn Greene: You're welcome.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Rick Shane with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nRick Shane: Thanks, guys, for taking my questions this morning. Hey, look, you've cited a couple of things that are driving the increase in delinquencies. You've talked about seizing them vintage. You've talked about some exposure to lower FICO scores within the cohorts. At the same time, you guys are starting to apply a lot more machine learning to your portfolio and your process. I'm curious if you are identifying other factors that are contributing to the increase in delinquencies, whether it's age demographic, geography, what might be other factors that are contributing to this in the context of strong labor markets. And then the follow-up to that is, with that information, can you then apply different servicing strategies to enhance that performance?\nJohn Greene: Yeah, you're into the secret sauce of underwriting, Rick. But I'll give you a little bit of overview. So, we spent a lot of time trying to revive -- to update our models. And we looked at, no exaggeration, probably 300 different risk identifiers or risk [leaders] (ph). And what we did find is savings rate is important, household net worth is important, the amount of credit on us, so on the credit report and Discover's balance sheet as well as the amount of credit off are -- continue to be really, really important. And then also, there's some work being done on cash flow underwriting because of some of the off bureau credit that we experienced or the whole market experienced in '21 and '22. So, we're going to continue to look to refine our models and see what we can do to identify accounts that are going to be highly profitable and originate those. In terms of the second part of your question around servicing strategies, there's been a lot of work done on best time to contact, and we've got some machine learning models that are focused on that, as well as best channel to contact, so is it via phone, e-mail, text or other means. All that work is ongoing. And frankly, it will never stop. It will be a continued refinement of the model so that we can collect effectively and originate profitably.\nRick Shane: Got it. Hey, John, it's very interesting, and very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Mihir Bhatia with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.\nMihir Bhatia: Good morning, and thank you for taking my questions. To start, I wanted to actually ask about personal loans. You're continuing to see some very healthy growth there. Can you talk a little bit more about some of the drivers? I think I know you mentioned a little bit of payment rate pullback, but what about from a competition standpoint? What's driving that? And then, just related to that -- the comments you've been making about on the credit card side, I wanted to understand if you're seeing any meaningful deterioration in credit there? Anything on the -- do the vintage comments apply here? Anything like we should be thinking about there? Are you tightening underwriting currently in that personal loan space too? Yeah, thanks.\nJohn Greene: Yeah. Thanks, Mihir. So, our average ticket on a personal loan is significantly larger than many of our competitors. And the predominant share of the volume now is for debt consolidation efforts. And important to recognize that as part of our underwriting process, when there's a debt consolidation customer, somewhere between 70% to 80% of the disbursement goes to the creditors to ensure that the overall cost of debt for that customer is lowered and, therefore, their ability to pay is high. So that's an important distinction. In terms of growth, what we've seen is, high level of demand, but also a reduction in the payment rate. And that reduction in the payment rate is also been responsible for a very significant chunk of the growth that we've seen in the quarter. In terms of kind of the performance there, it is, what I'll say, returning to more historical performance metrics. But, again, highly profitable, and you can see from the report or from the details in terms of delinquency rates, they've remained very, very low relative to historical standards.\nMihir Bhatia: Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. Maybe if I could just turn back a little for a second to the compliance issue question and the timing, et cetera. It sounds like from what you're saying related to the merchant mispricing issue, the outside law firm has completed the investigation. You've discussed results with regulators already. So, I think a lot of what a lot of people are just trying to understand is what needs to happen for the buybacks to resume. I understand it's difficult to put a specific date out there. But is the overall message, it's going to take several quarters for those to review? Maybe just help us understand what needs to happen here for you to get comfortable. And, again, like, I understand you don't want to put a specific timeframe, but is the right message, like, it's going to be several quarters more? Thanks.\nJohn Greene: Yeah. So, no specific timing on the resumption. So, what we want to do is have further dialogue with our merchants to ensure we're progressing the remediation and the negotiation. We also continue to have discussions with our regulatory agencies and we're looking to progress those. And we're also reviewing our capital positions, right? There's a number of pulls on capital this year. Certainly, the phenomenal loan growth that we've seen, we've got the Basel Endgame that's on the horizon. We have the CECL phase-in also impacting capital levels. So, we're going to take a look at the profitability for 2024. Take a look at the progress we're making on the card tiering issue and overall risk and governance items, and make a recommendation to the Board. So my -- I'll say my key summary here is that our capital priorities haven't changed. We're focused on generating positive earnings to be able to invest in the business and return excess capital to shareholders. Our margin rates remain robust. Our return on equity this quarter and for the year remains really, really strong. So, it's a matter of just making sure we've got the right balance between investing and return of capital.\nMihir Bhatia: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Bob Napoli with William Blair. Your line is open.\nBob Napoli: Thank you. Follow-up on return on equity. One of the questions we get, I mean, obviously, Discover has reported very strong ROE for a very long time, with the changes in regulations and potential capital changes. What are your thoughts on Discover being able to generate the types of return on equity that we've seen over the last 15 years or so?\nJohn Greene: Yeah. Certainly, relative to kind of history and then going forward, a couple of important points. So, we have operated with capital well above our operating target for the better part of, I don't know, at least as long as I've been here, four years now. And we are approaching the 10.5% target. I will say that our overall capital position does remain very, very strong, right? So, regulatory minimum is 4.5%, the SCB, 2.5%. So, the required capital, 7%, and we're at 11.6% here on CET1 for the quarter. So, my expectation is we're going to manage the business to continue to generate high returns and deliver a high level of return on equity overall and be able to invest in the business and return excess capital to shareholders. So, as we go out three to five years, it's a bit challenging to predict a regulatory regime and the expectations for institutions such as ours in terms of overall capital levels. But we're well positioned to generate positive capital and return capital.\nBob Napoli: Thank you. I appreciate that. And then, just on -- the overall -- the long-term growth of your business, your core customer, the TAM of your business and the ability for Discover to grow, I mean, I think historically, high-single digit kind of loan growth and spending growth. What are your thoughts? Is the ability to grow at those types of rates what we should continue to expect? And how does the Cashback Debit product maybe affect that growth?\nJohn Greene: Yeah. I mean, certainly, our expectation is to continue to grow, at least in line with kind of the historical norms. The Cashback Debit product, we actually think has a lot of power behind it. So, the features of the product itself are super, right? So, 1% cash back on debit transactions. We have a positive kind of business impact from our ability to capture interchange on those transactions, so that's positive. And then, it's a whole new customer outlet for us. So, executed well, it'll bring in a new cohort of customers that we can then underwrite and cross-sell to and further help the customer experience in terms of meeting additional banking needs and turn that checking product into a credit card relationship or perhaps a personal loan down the road. So, we're super excited about it.\nBob Napoli: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Kevin Barker with Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\nKevin Barker: I just wanted to follow up on some of the spending on tech in particular in the info processing line. Could you provide a little more detail on some of the projects that you have in place? And whether you expect those to be ongoing or are there additional projects that you anticipate, particularly around tech investment and other investments that you're making within the franchise? Thank you.\nJohn Greene: Yeah. So, we're a digital institution. So, the first piece is we're going to continue to invest in tech and advanced analytics to kind of help the customer experience and then also help us to generate positive returns. Some of the specific projects that we're working on, so we've got a number of advanced analytics programs around collections and around originations in order to be able to service the customers well and then target the right sort of customers. We also did a bunch of work last year and into this year in terms of improving the closure rate of leads from a lead into a funded customer, whether it was a savings or credit customer. This year, we're investing heavily in our risk and compliance systems, so certainly there's tech spend going on there. We also have tech spend related to our on-prem servers and moving to a hybrid and cloud environment, that's certainly a significant spend. And then also, given the risk and compliance issues that we've seen historically, we're spending a lot of time taking a look at how our core systems work, the data that goes in and the data that comes out and what we do with the data, and looking to kind of reduce the amount of manual touches to that data. So, all of that is part of the reason or the reasons why we're seeing kind of information processing and tech spend overall increase this year.\nJohn Owen: Two other areas I would call out. Around our fraud detection, we continue to invest heavily in our fraud detection. That's an ongoing battle every quarter, but we've made significant investments in fraud and continue to push on that area. The second thing, around our digital capabilities as a digital bank. We've got a very easy to use system, easy application process, very easy for customers to open up their Cashback Debit. And so, we spend a lot of time and effort in customer flows and customer engagement and how we onboard customers in a more seamless manner.\nKevin Barker: Thank you for all that detail. And just to follow-up on your investment on enhancing recovery rates, have you seen any particular shift in the recovery rates you have today or where they're trending relative to past cycles?\nJohn Greene: No specific changes to recovery rates. We are seeing more customers seek credit assistance and negotiate settlements. There seems to be a cottage industry developing around that. And that's back in this -- I think it was the month of July, we saw a chunk of charge-offs come through as a result of settlements from these institutions. But overall recovery rates remain strong. The pool of charge-offs to be able to capture recoveries from, obviously, is increasing as the charge-offs increase. So that's actually part of our -- how we take a look at overall credit and reserving.\nKevin Barker: Thank you, John.\nJohn Greene: You're welcome.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Erika Najarian with UBS. Your line is open.\nNick Holowko: Hi, good morning. This is Nick Holowko on for Erika. Thanks for taking our questions. Most of them have been answered, but just wanted to follow up with one question on loan growth. So, obviously, card growth remains really robust and you raised your guidance to mid-teens for the year. And I'm just wondering, given the comments on the stress in the lower and mid FICO scores, and then the delinquency trends, and then your comments that the revolve rate has really normalized, I'm wondering if you can help us with which parts of the FICO band in your portfolio are driving the loan growth, and whether you're seeing any outsized contribution from those on the lower end?\nJohn Greene: Yeah. What we're seeing is kind of loan build driven by two factors. So, it's somewhere between 30% and 40% of the build is -- or the loan growth is from new accounts, and then the remainder is coming from payment rate normalization. So, we're seeing kind of portfolio customers increasing their balances. So -- and that normalization of payment rate is pretty consistent on the upper bands to the -- call it, to the midpoint to the top two-thirds of the portfolio. The bottom third, the payment rate normalized last year, and we're seeing that at pretty close to historical levels, maybe a mild deterioration from that.\nNick Holowko: Got it. Thank you for taking my question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Dominick Gabriele with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.\nDominick Gabriele: Hey, thanks so much. Something sort of related to that, so we just think about the year-over-year spending growth, roughly 1%, I guess, what was the year-over-year growth in the number of cards or new accounts? And also, what was the -- and just added to that, what is the benefit that Discover saw to spending in the quarter related to gas on the growth? And then, I just have a follow-up. Thanks.\nJohn Greene: Yeah. So, we grew, and I -- we made public comments on this. In 2022, we grew accounts about 20% overall. This year, as we've taken a look at the kind of credit performance, we're on pace to kind of originate about the same number of overall accounts. So, the growth in terms of new accounts will be relatively flat, but the new account generation will be pretty consistent year-over-year. That could change if we [pare] (ph) back credit here in the fourth quarter and into next year. In terms of gas, that was interesting. So, gas was up 1% in the quarter. It was also 5% category. So, when you adjust for kind of the deflationary impact, the usage there was -- or at least through our card was up over 10%.\nDominick Gabriele: Okay, great. And then, obviously, you have a lot of student loans. You're one of the major players. We have the moratorium ending. I know that that doesn't affect you directly perhaps in your own loans, because they're private loans, but what are you seeing in the data that you're watching of how this might be affecting either payment rates or demand for private loans or refinancings? Anything you can provide as far as how this affects the consumer that you're seeing in your data, only in 19 days or whatever, but anything you can provide would be really helpful. Thank you.\nJohn Greene: Yeah. So, we're not seeing anything in our data yet whatsoever. We did actually, a couple quarters ago, quantify what we thought the impact could be to our portfolio in terms of charge-offs. And as it turns out, based on the executive order direction in terms of kind of the repayment structure that the Biden administration is putting in place and making kind of payments levels associated or tied to income levels, we expect the impact on our portfolio to be de minimis. Now, we'll see how it all plays out legislatively, but we're not expecting a significant impact certainly this year, and we'll evaluate to see what happens and take a look at our data to make a determination if it is going to have an adverse impact on our charge-offs. But today, nothing.\nDominick Gabriele: Got it. Thank you.\nJohn Greene: You're welcome, Dominick.\nOperator: This concludes the Q&A portion of the call. And I'd now like to turn the floor back over to Eric Wasserstrom for any additional or closing remarks.\nEric Wasserstrom: Well, thank you very much for joining us this morning. If you have any additional questions, please reach out to the IR team and looking forward to hear from you. Thanks very much. Take care.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's program, and we appreciate your participation. You may disconnect at any time.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "John Greene",
            "content": "Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with our financial summary results on Slide 4. In this quarter, we reported net income of $683 million, down from just over $1 billion in the prior-year quarter. Provision expense grew by $929 million, reflecting an increase in reserves and charge-offs. Strong loan growth, along with changing macroeconomic and household liquidity conditions drove the increase to our reserve balance. Charge-offs increased due to portfolio seasoning and remain in line with expectations. Revenue grew 17%, deposits grew 23%, and expenses increased 6% year-over-year. Further details are reflected on Slide 5. Net interest income was up $479 million year-over-year, or 17%. Our net interest margin ended the quarter at 10.95%, down 10 basis points from the prior year and down 11 basis points sequentially. This decrease was driven by higher funding costs, which were partially offset by the benefits from higher prime rates. Receivable growth was robust. Card increased 16% year-over-year, reflecting new account growth and a lower payment rate versus the prior year. The payment rate declined about 30 basis points quarter-over-quarter, but remains just under 200 basis points above 2019 levels. Sales volume was relatively flat for the quarter. Personal loans were up 25%, driven by strength in originations over the past year and lower payment rates. We continue to experience strong consumer demand while staying disciplined in our underwriting. Student loans were up 1%. Deposit growth in the quarter was solid with average consumer deposits up 23% year-over-year and 4% sequentially. Our direct-to-consumer balances grew $4 billion. Looking at other revenue on Slide 6. Non-interest income increased $97 million or 16%. This was primarily driven by higher transaction processing revenue from our PULSE business, an increase in loan fee income and strong net discount and interchange revenue. Moving to expenses on Slide 7. Total operating expenses were up $86 million or 6% year-over-year and up 4% from the prior quarter. This increase is driven primarily by investments in our compliance and risk management programs, and is reflected across several of our expense line items. Looking at our major expense categories, compensation costs were up $24 million, or 4%, primarily from increased headcount. The increase in information processing expense was driven by software licensing renewals, professional fees reflect an increase in third-party support as we focus on accelerating our compliance and risk management efforts. Moving to credit performance on Slide 8. Total net charge-offs were 3.52%, 181 basis points higher than the prior year and up 30 basis points from the prior quarter. In card, we continue to see the effects of seasoning of newer accounts, which have higher delinquency rates than older vintages. Losses remained consistent with targeted ranges. These newer vintages support strong long-term profitability. Turning to the allowance for credit losses on Slide 9. This quarter, we increased our reserves by $601 million and our reserve rate increased by 22 basis points to just over 7%. The reserve increase reflects a modest deteriorating macroeconomic outlook, increasing delinquencies and higher loan balances. Our macro assumptions reflect a relatively strong labor market, but also consumer headwinds from declining savings rates and increasing debt burdens. Looking at Slide 10. Our common equity Tier 1 for the period was 11.6%. The sequential decline of 10 basis points was driven largely by our strong organic asset growth. We declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.70 per share of common stock. Concluding on Slide 11 with our outlook. We now expect our loan growth to be in the mid-teens, as declining payment rates are offsetting the impact of slowing sales. There is no change to our NIM expectations to be approximately 11% for the full year. We're maintaining our expectations for operating expenses to be up low double digits. And there is no change to our expected range for net charge-offs to be between 3.4% and 3.6% for the year. In conclusion, our business fundamentals remain strong. We continue to generate solid financial results, while building out our compliance and risk management capabilities and prudently investing in actions that drive sustainable long-term performance. With that, I'll turn the call back to our operator to open the line for Q&A. Yeah. Thanks, Sanjay. Appreciate the question. So, let me back up and just give a little bit of an overview in terms of what happened in the quarter and why we increased the reserve rate. So, as we took a look at the portfolio performance and the loan growth, obviously, we had to make a reserve build for loan growth and that represented about 50% of the $600 million. The other 50% or approximately $300 million reflected our view on the macros. Now, while the unemployment numbers remain relatively in line and strong by historical standards, we are seeing some indications of stress. And if we go back to the pandemic and the learnings there, we found that certainly unemployment remains an important factor in terms of reserves, but there's other factors. And what we've done over the past year is try to build into those other factors into our loss models and reserve models, and we've done that. So, as we took a look at household net worth and savings rate, both have deteriorated. And we're seeing deterioration more specifically in lower FICO bands. So, we use those macro factors in order to capture loss content that we felt was appropriate from a reserving standpoint. So, as we look at reserve levels today and into the future, there's a couple of things that I'll say are just kind of general process items. First, it will be dependent on the macro views and whether they remain stable or deteriorating. Second, certainly, the portfolio performance will be a very, very important factor. And then, third will be the timing and trajectory of loss content. So, as losses become closer in terms of our projection period, their probability adjusted and, therefore, could increase reserve rate. Now, there's a lot of detail that I just provided. So, let me give a view of our expectations. So, first, the portfolio is performing generally well, although we are seeing mildly increased stress at the lower FICO bands to mid-FICO bands. We're also seeing that 2022 vintage performed slightly worse than '21, '23 although highly profitable. So, as we look forward to '24, we'll run our process and adjust the reserve as we deem most appropriate. An important piece will also be the charge-off trajectory. So, what we've said previously is we expect charge-offs to peak sometime around the midpoint of the year to the second half of the year, if -- second half of 2024. So, if we don't see a slowing in delinquency rates between now and first quarter, certainly that could be an indication that we'll have to take incremental provisions. So, a lot there. Hopefully enough for you to be able to digest and move forward with. Sure. Yeah, I'll take that one too, Sanjay. So, let me first start out by saying our capital allocation priorities aren't changed. So, invest in the business and return excess capital to shareholders. That's very clear from our business model, our management team and our Board. The second piece to the answer relates to our continued work on the card tiering issue and other governance issues. So, we're making reasonably good progress on both of those. And what we'll do as part of our 2024 planning process is we'll make a recommendation to the Board regarding our capital actions and, specifically, the buyback. And then, we'll provide an update on our January call associated with our fourth quarter earnings. Yeah. Thanks, Bill. So, let me go back a little bit and be real clear about what happened in the second half of '21 and '22 in terms of originations. So, second half of '21, we resumed and we went back to our traditional credit box. In the early part of '22, we continued with that traditional Discover credit box. We did do a test in marginal prime and near prime which we turned on. We saw the results and we turned off in the second quarter or early third quarter of '22. So, about six months of originations, not dramatic volume by any means, but certainly a test, it's a good opportunity to learn to see if we could capture some unprofitable share. What we found was, those accounts weren't meeting our return of volatility threshold. So, they were shut down. The rest of the '22 vintage was within the traditional credit box that Discover had. And '23 remains there, although we're peeling back. I will say this, the '22 vintage was certainly outsized as a result of demand and great execution from our marketing team. The profitability of that still remains very, very strong in the short-term, medium-term and long-term. So, if we're going to do it all over again, at this point, we'd certainly answer definitively, yes, we would continue to originate the loans that we put on the books. But that vintage is significantly larger than other vintages. So, the natural loss content of new originations is somewhere between 12 and 24 months, and we expect that to play out, and as I've said, the delinquencies and charge-offs to peak sometime in 2024. So, I hope that is helpful in terms of giving it a little bit of color in terms of the process we went through, our risk tolerance, and what we expect to see from those vintages. Good morning, Ryan. Sure. I'm not going to be real specific on '24. We're still in the process of building out the budget and we're yet to share our recommendation with the Board. But I can give you a general kind of direction of what we're seeing. So, the first point I think is important to point out there is that, we continue to target our efficiency ratio to be below 40%. Now, that's over the medium-term. Obviously, our execution this year with the revenue growth and even with substantial investments in compliance and in other areas of the business shows an efficiency ratio significantly below 40%. But over the mid-term, that's something I think investors can expect. The second piece that's important is that despite a significant amount of investment in risk and compliance resources, we will continue to be disciplined in our allocation of expense dollars. And we're focused on making sure that the expense dollars that we do spend either help us with our compliance and risk management programs overall or generate positive earnings potential for the firm. So, they're the focal point. In terms of some of the things where we continue to look at, we're looking at our facilities footprint. We expect to be able to continue to make some progress on that. Our third-party spend, we're scrutinizing significantly with the help of our procurement and vendor management teams. And we're going to continue to look at resource levels to make sure they're appropriate for the environment and what we're trying to execute on. So, I hope that provides some context, Ryan, on how we're thinking about the expense base in the aggregate. And that will translate into what we hope is a reasonably good set of expense and efficiency numbers into the future. Yeah. A lot to parse there, Ryan. Let me start by kind of walking you through what we're seeing in the portfolio. So, we are seeing kind of differences in performance on customers that historically have been transactor versus revolver. So, our revolver base, we're seeing a more significant decrease in sales activity, which makes sense, right, as they try to manage their household budget. We're seeing accounts that transacted in '21, '20 and '22 beginning to revolve more. So, the revolve rate is back to where we were historically. And the '23 vintages, early indications are that it's performing very, very well. 2022 is performing well, but not as well as 2023. So, my expectation is that delinquencies will slow in the first half of 2024. If that doesn't happen, that's an indication that the stress that the consumers are seeing is more significant than what we're observing today. Great. Yeah. I'll take that. So, the environment continues to be competitive from a card origination standpoint. We are seeing less competition in kind of the lower FICO band. So, remember, we're a prime revolver, so we're focused on prime customers, and the lower tier of origination envelope is, frankly, less competitive. So, we're careful as we're looking at that to make sure that those folks seeking credit are worthy of credit and not going to turn into a subsequent charge-off. The upper prime remains very, very competitive. The rewards competition, you can see it by the television ads, has certainly subsided significantly. So, the market is always competitive. The competition varies among various FICO bands. And we're going to continue to compete and generate positive new accounts, but we're also mindful of the credit situation. Yeah. I think it will peak, and then, upon its peak, I think it will stabilize up there for a few quarters, maybe two to three quarters, and then we expect it to come down. That's all subject to kind of the macro environment, obviously. But in terms of what we're seeing today, that's the expectation. Yeah. So, let me start with sales. So, what we're seeing is a downward trend in sales. So, if you go back to the fourth quarter of '23, we're at about 10% year-over-year growth. First quarter was 8%, 2.5% in the second quarter, and about 1% here in the third quarter and through mid-October, about 1%. Interestingly enough, the dynamics are changing in terms of categories. So, online spend is up around 4% to 5%, every day spend is up about 3%. That's largely inflation driven, we believe. And discretionary is flat to down with the exception of entertainment expense or entertainment-related categories, which is up north of 20%, which is hard for me to understand at this point. But we're trying to dig into the details. In terms of implications for next year, we're going to assume a relatively modest sales growth, maybe slow in the lower single digits. The transactor revolver components of that, I mentioned that already. So, more pullback on the revolver base. The other piece of your question is debit transactions. We've had great execution from our PULSE business. So, we've expanded a number of contractual arrangements and also debit choice routing has actually made a difference in the volumes. So, our PULSE team is executing well and appears to be capturing some share. You're welcome. Yeah, you're into the secret sauce of underwriting, Rick. But I'll give you a little bit of overview. So, we spent a lot of time trying to revive -- to update our models. And we looked at, no exaggeration, probably 300 different risk identifiers or risk [leaders] (ph). And what we did find is savings rate is important, household net worth is important, the amount of credit on us, so on the credit report and Discover's balance sheet as well as the amount of credit off are -- continue to be really, really important. And then also, there's some work being done on cash flow underwriting because of some of the off bureau credit that we experienced or the whole market experienced in '21 and '22. So, we're going to continue to look to refine our models and see what we can do to identify accounts that are going to be highly profitable and originate those. In terms of the second part of your question around servicing strategies, there's been a lot of work done on best time to contact, and we've got some machine learning models that are focused on that, as well as best channel to contact, so is it via phone, e-mail, text or other means. All that work is ongoing. And frankly, it will never stop. It will be a continued refinement of the model so that we can collect effectively and originate profitably. Yeah. Thanks, Mihir. So, our average ticket on a personal loan is significantly larger than many of our competitors. And the predominant share of the volume now is for debt consolidation efforts. And important to recognize that as part of our underwriting process, when there's a debt consolidation customer, somewhere between 70% to 80% of the disbursement goes to the creditors to ensure that the overall cost of debt for that customer is lowered and, therefore, their ability to pay is high. So that's an important distinction. In terms of growth, what we've seen is, high level of demand, but also a reduction in the payment rate. And that reduction in the payment rate is also been responsible for a very significant chunk of the growth that we've seen in the quarter. In terms of kind of the performance there, it is, what I'll say, returning to more historical performance metrics. But, again, highly profitable, and you can see from the report or from the details in terms of delinquency rates, they've remained very, very low relative to historical standards. Yeah. So, no specific timing on the resumption. So, what we want to do is have further dialogue with our merchants to ensure we're progressing the remediation and the negotiation. We also continue to have discussions with our regulatory agencies and we're looking to progress those. And we're also reviewing our capital positions, right? There's a number of pulls on capital this year. Certainly, the phenomenal loan growth that we've seen, we've got the Basel Endgame that's on the horizon. We have the CECL phase-in also impacting capital levels. So, we're going to take a look at the profitability for 2024. Take a look at the progress we're making on the card tiering issue and overall risk and governance items, and make a recommendation to the Board. So my -- I'll say my key summary here is that our capital priorities haven't changed. We're focused on generating positive earnings to be able to invest in the business and return excess capital to shareholders. Our margin rates remain robust. Our return on equity this quarter and for the year remains really, really strong. So, it's a matter of just making sure we've got the right balance between investing and return of capital. Yeah. Certainly, relative to kind of history and then going forward, a couple of important points. So, we have operated with capital well above our operating target for the better part of, I don't know, at least as long as I've been here, four years now. And we are approaching the 10.5% target. I will say that our overall capital position does remain very, very strong, right? So, regulatory minimum is 4.5%, the SCB, 2.5%. So, the required capital, 7%, and we're at 11.6% here on CET1 for the quarter. So, my expectation is we're going to manage the business to continue to generate high returns and deliver a high level of return on equity overall and be able to invest in the business and return excess capital to shareholders. So, as we go out three to five years, it's a bit challenging to predict a regulatory regime and the expectations for institutions such as ours in terms of overall capital levels. But we're well positioned to generate positive capital and return capital. Yeah. I mean, certainly, our expectation is to continue to grow, at least in line with kind of the historical norms. The Cashback Debit product, we actually think has a lot of power behind it. So, the features of the product itself are super, right? So, 1% cash back on debit transactions. We have a positive kind of business impact from our ability to capture interchange on those transactions, so that's positive. And then, it's a whole new customer outlet for us. So, executed well, it'll bring in a new cohort of customers that we can then underwrite and cross-sell to and further help the customer experience in terms of meeting additional banking needs and turn that checking product into a credit card relationship or perhaps a personal loan down the road. So, we're super excited about it. Yeah. So, we're a digital institution. So, the first piece is we're going to continue to invest in tech and advanced analytics to kind of help the customer experience and then also help us to generate positive returns. Some of the specific projects that we're working on, so we've got a number of advanced analytics programs around collections and around originations in order to be able to service the customers well and then target the right sort of customers. We also did a bunch of work last year and into this year in terms of improving the closure rate of leads from a lead into a funded customer, whether it was a savings or credit customer. This year, we're investing heavily in our risk and compliance systems, so certainly there's tech spend going on there. We also have tech spend related to our on-prem servers and moving to a hybrid and cloud environment, that's certainly a significant spend. And then also, given the risk and compliance issues that we've seen historically, we're spending a lot of time taking a look at how our core systems work, the data that goes in and the data that comes out and what we do with the data, and looking to kind of reduce the amount of manual touches to that data. So, all of that is part of the reason or the reasons why we're seeing kind of information processing and tech spend overall increase this year. No specific changes to recovery rates. We are seeing more customers seek credit assistance and negotiate settlements. There seems to be a cottage industry developing around that. And that's back in this -- I think it was the month of July, we saw a chunk of charge-offs come through as a result of settlements from these institutions. But overall recovery rates remain strong. The pool of charge-offs to be able to capture recoveries from, obviously, is increasing as the charge-offs increase. So that's actually part of our -- how we take a look at overall credit and reserving. You're welcome. Yeah. What we're seeing is kind of loan build driven by two factors. So, it's somewhere between 30% and 40% of the build is -- or the loan growth is from new accounts, and then the remainder is coming from payment rate normalization. So, we're seeing kind of portfolio customers increasing their balances. So -- and that normalization of payment rate is pretty consistent on the upper bands to the -- call it, to the midpoint to the top two-thirds of the portfolio. The bottom third, the payment rate normalized last year, and we're seeing that at pretty close to historical levels, maybe a mild deterioration from that. Yeah. So, we grew, and I -- we made public comments on this. In 2022, we grew accounts about 20% overall. This year, as we've taken a look at the kind of credit performance, we're on pace to kind of originate about the same number of overall accounts. So, the growth in terms of new accounts will be relatively flat, but the new account generation will be pretty consistent year-over-year. That could change if we [pare] (ph) back credit here in the fourth quarter and into next year. In terms of gas, that was interesting. So, gas was up 1% in the quarter. It was also 5% category. So, when you adjust for kind of the deflationary impact, the usage there was -- or at least through our card was up over 10%. Yeah. So, we're not seeing anything in our data yet whatsoever. We did actually, a couple quarters ago, quantify what we thought the impact could be to our portfolio in terms of charge-offs. And as it turns out, based on the executive order direction in terms of kind of the repayment structure that the Biden administration is putting in place and making kind of payments levels associated or tied to income levels, we expect the impact on our portfolio to be de minimis. Now, we'll see how it all plays out legislatively, but we're not expecting a significant impact certainly this year, and we'll evaluate to see what happens and take a look at our data to make a determination if it is going to have an adverse impact on our charge-offs. But today, nothing. You're welcome, Dominick."

            "name": "John Owen",
            "content": "Thank you, Eric, and thanks to our listeners for joining today's call. As I shared a few months ago, I have three priorities in my role as Interim CEO. First is, continue delivering a great customer experience at every touch point, which we do by providing our customers award-winning service and products. At the heart of this is, a team of more than 20,000 employees connected by common values and a shared mission to help people achieve a brighter financial future. Our second priority is to advance our culture of compliance. We have made significant strides in this area. By now, you've all had the opportunity to review the consent order issued by the FDIC in September. Consistent with the terms of this consent order, we have made meaningful investments in improving our corporate governance and enterprise risk management capabilities, and expect to drive further enhancements across the organization in the coming quarters. We have also started the process of engaging with our merchant partners on the card misclassification issue, remain in active dialog with our regulators on this topic. The resolution of this issue is likely to be complex and we anticipate it will take several quarters fully resolve. Our third priority is to sustain our strong financial performance. In the third quarter, revenue was up 17% year-over-year, driven by strong asset growth. Our credit losses continued to perform in-line with expected ranges. In addition, we were off to a strong start with the launch of our Cashback Debit product. We continue to believe that this product will be an important channel to welcome many new customers into our company. To highlight the Discover experience and support our brand and banking products, we're proud to have just introduced a new national advertising campaign featuring celebrity spokesperson, Jennifer Coolidge. As we continue to advance our priorities, we are focused on preserving and enhancing the elements to make Discover a great place to work. Last month, we're ranked among the 2023 Fortune Best Workplaces in Financial Services & Insurance. This accolade builds upon our recognition as one of Fortune 100's Best Companies to Work For. Before handing the call off to John Greene, I'll briefly comment on the CEO search. The Board is considering several excellent candidates both internal and external, remain confident that we will identify the next outstanding leader for this organization in the coming months. In summary, we continue to target excellence in all parts of our business, driving sustainable, long-term financial performance. I will now hand the call off to John to review our results in more detail. Let me just add a little bit to John's answer on kind of where we are from a regulatory standpoint. The FDIC consent order that was made public this month related really to findings from end of 2021 looking back. As we said before, we've made significant investments in our risk management compliance capabilities over the last 18 months. From a spending standpoint, we've increased our spending from $225 million in 2022 to about $460 million in 2023. But I would tell you, as we've made good progress resolving many of our issues, but we still have a significant amount of work to do before we're satisfied with where we are. On the card misclassification issue, it's not part of that FDIC consent order, that's a separate matter. And where we are on that? As we've mentioned before, we did have an outside law firm complete an investigation on the card misclassification issue. That work is substantially complete at this point in time. We've shared that result of that with our Board of Directors and also with our regulators. At this point in time, we're awaiting feedback from regulators. Yeah. Happy to talk about that. As you know, we really can't speculate or talk about rumors or selling parts of the business. What I can tell you is part of our strategic planning process that we do every year is to evaluate all of our businesses for returns and fit from a strategic standpoint. We do that as an annual process. We are going through that process as we speak. But again, that's something we do as part of our annual planning process. Two other areas I would call out. Around our fraud detection, we continue to invest heavily in our fraud detection. That's an ongoing battle every quarter, but we've made significant investments in fraud and continue to push on that area. The second thing, around our digital capabilities as a digital bank. We've got a very easy to use system, easy application process, very easy for customers to open up their Cashback Debit. And so, we spend a lot of time and effort in customer flows and customer engagement and how we onboard customers in a more seamless manner."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Second Quarter 2023 Discover Financial Services Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there'll be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Eric Wasserstrom, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nEric Wasserstrom: Thanks, Todd. And good morning, everyone. Welcome to this morning's call. I'll begin on Slide 2 of our earnings presentation, which you can find in financial section of our Investor Relations website investorrelations.discover.com. Our discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. Please refer to our notices regarding forward-looking statements that appear in our second quarter earnings release and presentation. On our call today, we'll include remarks from our CEO, Roger Hochschild and, John Green, our Chief Financial Officer. After we conclude our formal comments, there will be time for a Q&A session. During the Q&A session, we ask that you pose one question followed by one follow-up question. After your follow-up question, please return to the queue. Now, it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Roger.\nRoger Hochschild: Thank you, Eric, and thanks to our listeners for joining today's call. I'll begin by reviewing some of our highlights for the quarter and then discuss the regulatory matter that we've disclosed in our press release. John will then take you through the details of our second quarter results and our updated perspectives on 2023. Last night, we reported second quarter net income of $901 million or $3.54 per share. The quarter was characterized by strong asset and deposit growth, while credit is performing right in line with our expectations. Importantly, we advanced several operational priorities this quarter. One key milestone occurred in May when we relaunched our cash back debit product. We're excited by the positive early results we're seeing so far. In the first few weeks, we opened over 30,000 new accounts and plan to begin national marketing in support of this product in the fall. The relaunch advances our goal of becoming the leading direct bank and over time we expect cash back debit will be a significant entry point into the Discover franchise. We also continue to expand the Discover Global Network. This quarter, we announced five new partnerships in the Asia Pacific region and added a new partnership with Guavapay in the UK. These strategic partnerships underscore our commitment to building out our international acceptance. And lastly, we continue to invest in our human capital. We're honored to have been recognized as the 2023 Best Places to Work for People with Disabilities. This builds upon our recent recognitions as one of Fortune's 100 Best Companies to Work For, Best Workplaces for Parents, and Best Workplaces for Women. As you may have read in our press release last night, beginning around mid-2007, we incorrectly classified certain card accounts into our highest merchant and merchant acquirer pricing tier. We are taking actions correct this card product misclassification going forward and are preparing a program to compensate affected merchants and acquirers. While the financial impacts of this misclassification are not material, it underscored deficiencies in our corporate governance and risk management. We're in discussions with our regulators regarding these matters. We have received a proposed consent order from the FDIC in connection with consumer compliance, which does not cover the misclassification topic. We believe additional supervisory actions could occur. I want to emphasize that we take our business practices and compliance very seriously. We've made significant progress and investment in this area and look forward to working with our Board and our regulators to achieve further advancement. Now I'll hand it over to John to review our results and updated outlook in more detail.\nJohn Greene: Thank you, Roger, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to open by addressing the financial implications of the card misclassification. We have established a liability on our balance sheet of $365 million to accrue for estimated compensation owed to merchant and acquirers. In establishing the liability, we adjusted retained earnings by $255 million net of tax. $11 million was taken this quarter and is reflected in discount and interchange revenue. The first half 2023 impact was $22 million. With that, I'll transition to our financial summary results on Slide 4. From this, you can see that the financial performance of the business remains solid. In the quarter, we reported net income of $901 million, which was 18% lower year-over-year. Our results reflect strong revenue growth partially offset by a provision increase driven by receivable growth and higher expenses. The trends for the quarter were robust loan growth, a low efficiency ratio even as we invested in compliance management and technology, and strong capital and liquidity positions. Further details are reflected on Slide 5. Net interest income was up $567 million year-over-year or 22%. Our net interest margin ended the quarter at 11.06%, up 12 basis points from the prior year and down 28 basis points sequentially. The benefits from higher prime rates were offset by higher funding costs and increased promotional balances. Receivable growth was robust. Card increased 19% year-over-year, reflecting a lower payment rate versus the prior year and modest sales growth. The card payment rate remains stable quarter-over-quarter and about 200 basis points over 2019 levels. Sales volume grew 3% in the quarter. Through mid-July, growth continued to slow and was up about 1%. Turning to our non-card products. Personal loans were up 27% driven by strength in originations over the past year. We continue to experience strong consumer demand while staying disciplined in our underwriting. Deposit growth in the quarter was solid, with average consumer deposits up 20% year-over-year and 4% sequentially. Our direct-to-consumer balances grew $2 billion and consumer deposits made up 66% of our total funding mix. We continue to target 70-plus-percent of funding from deposits. Looking at other revenue on Slide 6. Non-interest income increased $98 million or 16%. This was partially due to a $42 million loss on our equity investments in the prior year quarter compared to a $1 million gain this quarter. Adjusting for these, our non-interest income was up 9%, primarily driven by loan fee income. Moving to expenses on Slide 7. Total operating expenses were up $181 million or 15% year-over-year and up 2% from the prior quarter, primarily driven by our investments in our compliance management systems. These investments impacted several of our expense line items. Looking at our major expense categories, compensation costs were up $73 million or 14%, primarily due to increased headcount. Marketing expense increased $14 million or 6% as we prudently invested for growth, particularly in our deposits and personal loan products. Our commitment to disciplined cost management has not changed and we continue to target an efficiency ratio in the high 30s. Moving to credit performance on Slide 8. Total net charge-offs were 3.22%, 142 basis points higher than the prior year and up 50 basis points from the prior quarter. Consistent with our expectation, we are seeing credit normalization across all of our lending products. Looking ahead in card, we continue to expect the seasoning of new accounts vintages and normalization of older vintages to result in higher losses through the back half of this year and into 2024. Turning to the allowance for credit losses on Slide 9. This quarter, we increased our reserve by $373 million, driven by our double-digit loan growth. Our reserve rate remained flat at 6.8%. Our outlook on the macro economy has improved modestly. We continue to monitor economic conditions and will make adjustments to our expectations as needed. Looking at slide 10, our capital position remains robust. Our common equity Tier 1 for the period was 11.7%, well ahead of regulatory requirements. The cumulative impact of the correction to the financial statements related to the card misclassification reduced our CET1 ratio by approximately 20 basis points. In the quarter, we repurchased 6.8 million shares of common stock and declared a quarterly common dividend of $0.70 per share. As Roger indicated, we are reviewing our compliance, risk management and corporate governance and are in discussions with our regulators on these topics. While this is ongoing, we have decided to pause share repurchases. Concluding on Slide 11 with our outlook. There has been no change to our loan growth expectations to be in the low to mid-teens. We are updating our NIM expectations to be around 11% for the full year, reflecting a combination of slightly lower asset yields driven by promotional mix and higher funding costs. We are raising our guidance for operating expenses to be up low double digits. As previously indicated, we are seeing upward pressure on expenses from the build-out of our compliance management systems. And we are lowering our expected range of net charge-offs to 3.4% to 3.6% based on our current delinquencies and roll rates. To wrap up, our business model continues to generate solid financial results and our capital, funding and liquidity positions remain strong. We continue to invest in actions that drive sustainable long-term performance, enable us to achieve excellence in all parts of our business. With that, I'll turn the call back to our operator, Todd, to open the line for Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, we will open the floor for questions. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Rick Shane of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nRick Shane: Thanks guys for taking my questions this morning. Look, I'd love to understand a little bit the link between what you identified in terms of the miscalculation and then how that precipitated the sort of inquiry into governance and consumer tracking?\nRoger Hochschild: Sure. So the FDIC matter is not linked to the misclassification. And so the misclassification is a separate issue. The FDIC matter is broadly around our compliance management system. It doesn't mean that the misclassification may not result in further regulatory action, but I don't want to speculate on that.\nRick Shane: Got it. And is the expectation, when we've seen these in the past that they result in things like memorandum of understanding and can do things like either constrain growth limit, repurchases and capital actions, how do you see this playing out? And most importantly, I think what everybody really wants to know is what is a reasonable timeframe to get some further clarity here?\nRoger Hochschild: Yeah, it's -- I don't want to speculate on the timeframe of regulatory actions. I would say to your point though, they can take many forms. And so we're working through the draft with our regulators and we'll make more information available and the consent order will itself be public once that's completed.\nRick Shane: Got it. Okay. I realized there's -- you have to be pretty circumspect about what you say here. So, thank you.\nRoger Hochschild: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.\nJeff Adelson: Yeah, hi, thanks. This is Jeff Adelson on for Betsy. Just appreciate all the sensitivity around this and understand you're pausing the buyback. I guess, this is -- this is some similar to what we saw last year in terms of regulatory issue and getting ahead of the buyback or freezing the buyback. Just wondering maybe if there's a way to speak to how these two issues kind of compare to the last year student loan servicing issue, maybe in terms of scoping complexity?\nRoger Hochschild: Yeah. I'll cover that piece and then maybe John can talk a bit about the buyback. So I would say the consent order in student loan servicing was a compliance matter. And so I think there's a link between that and the broader focus on our compliance management system. With that, maybe I'll let John talk a bit about the buyback.\nJohn Greene: Great. And -- thanks Roger. And as it relates to the buyback, we had robust conversations internally whether or not to pause the buyback. And what management recommended to the Board was that we pause the buyback as we work through the details of these compliance and risk management issues and are in conversations with our regulators. I want to reiterate the following though. Our capital allocation priorities remain consistent. So first invest in the business and growth and certainly through this year and into next year into compliance and risk management. And second, the priority will be to return excess capital to shareholders. So no change in terms of the two primary capital allocation priorities. I also want to focus your attention onto the strong capital generation that the business delivered in the quarter and has delivered historically. So we're hoping that we kind of work through these issues in an expedited fashion, but timing, I can't be specific on. So with that, the buyback will provide us much clarity on the timing of resumption when we have information on that.\nJeff Adelson: Okay. Thank you. And just maybe shifting gears a bit here. Just wanted to see if we could get an update on what you're seeing in the consumer in your book today. Could you maybe also give us an update on the spend trajectory you've been seeing so far in July? I know you've talked about the growth rate slowing down to 3% in recent months. Wondering if we're seeing something similar from here?\nRoger Hochschild: Yeah. So it has slowed down further so far in July, so probably closer to 1%. Not necessarily as bad as it sounds in terms of the health of the consumer because you've got some very challenging comps compared to last year's growth as well as the very, very high level of new accounts we put on last year. And I think overall in terms of payment side, delinquencies and losses as John said are sort of normalizing right on the path we thought they were. And here I think that the strength of the job market is very constructive for our sort of prime consumer base.\nJeff Adelson: Got it. Thanks for taking my questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs.\nRyan Nash: Hey, good morning guys.\nRoger Hochschild: Good morning.\nRyan Nash: Roger, again, I know that we're probably limiting what we could say here on the compliance side, but I guess just a broader question. Can you maybe just help us understand, what are the areas that you feel that the company has underinvested in? And maybe just give us a framework for what you guys are doing in internally to fix these. I understand that John had talked about raising costs, but you -- can you give us a little bit more color in terms of what the investments you're making and what you think the timeline is to get these done?\nRoger Hochschild: Sure. John can maybe provide more color on the timeline. I would say it's a multi-year, but it's also something that we have been investing in over the last couple of years. So as you think about your compliance management system, it's everything from risk identification, sort of process mapping, building controls or change management processes, the resources you have around risk management in the first line, the resources you have in the second line in terms of the compliance function, testing, the internal audit, your governance processes. And so we are determined to be as strong on the compliance side and it's excellent there as we are around customer experience, data and analytic, every other aspect of our business model. So this is our top priority and the investment is both on the technology side, outside consultants, but also in terms of headcount here at Discover. John?\nJohn Greene: And then, Ryan, on the trajectory, and so I made this comment publicly about 1.5 months ago. 2019 to 2023, we increased our spend in compliance and I'll say some gentle items to ensure compliance works as we wish it to work. I indicated it was about an increase of $250 million as we relooked at it. We were going to accelerate that spend to probably $300 million increase from 2019 and a $200 million increase \u201822 to \u201923. Now the implications for that on \u201924, where we sit today, we expect once we achieve that level in \u201823 to be relatively consistent into \u201924. And then as we kind of shape this piece of our business into something that we desire, our regulators desire and our shareholders deserve, we expect that expense burn to reduce.\nRyan Nash: Really appreciate all that color. And then maybe just on credit, I think Roger might have talked about the normalization of the front book as well as expectations for the back book to continue to normalize. But you took the credit loss range down a bit. So can you maybe just talk about one where you're seeing the improved performance in, John? As you look out, maybe just talk about your confidence in the curve on losses bending as we approach sort of the midpoint of next year? Thanks.\nJohn Greene: Yeah, great. So yeah, the tightening in the range was reflective of a couple of things. So first, as time moves on, we get more and more comfort with our forecasting on it. And to date, our forecasting has been right on top of actuals, our actuals have been right on top of the forecasting. So that gave us comfort. Second is, as time goes on, we can move from the analytical model to a more kind of traditional roll rate model that gives us a greater level of comfort around the charge-off and delinquency rates 30 day -- 30 days out to 180 days out. So that gave us comfort to tighten that range. And then on top of that, certainly the jobs -- jobs data and the forecast around employment gave us additional comfort. In terms of what we're seeing with the portfolio, exactly what I said in the prepared comments. So the newer vintages seasoning to expectation and older vintages basically normalizing to kind of 2019 levels. In terms of the shape of the curve, what we expect charge-offs to do in the back half of this year is the acceleration in terms of the rates of charge-off to begin to slow. And currently, we're expecting, kind of, charge-offs to peak in the second half of \u201824. It may push a little bit into \u201925, but right now we're seeing it in the second half of \u201824 and then reach the level, which likely will stabilize that for two to three quarters after.\nRyan Nash: Great. Thanks for all the color.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from John Hecht with Jefferies.\nJohn Hecht: Morning, guys. And thanks for taking my questions. First one is that we talked about you giving us some sort of good trajectory of the normalization of the credit trends, which I guess occurs later this year, early into next year. I'm wondering given kind of the comps and stabilization of inflation and so forth, when do you expect to see normalization of loan growth and your guys opinions, what is the -- what is kind of the normalized level of loan growth?\nJohn Greene: Yeah. So certainly real robust loan growth in the first half of this year and the last quarter of 2022. We expect the rate of increase to slow certainly in the third and fourth quarter and also against really, really strong comps from 2022. And traditionally what this business has delivered is loan growth somewhere between 2 times and 4 times GDP growth. Now, we don't know what GDP is going to look like right now into \u201824, but I would say this. We did cut the edges on the lower credit quality, which is -- will impact new account growth in card for the balance of this year. We're seeing, as Roger indicated, and I mentioned in my comments, sales growth to slow and probably stabilize in the single digits. So that will also impact loan growth for the balance of this year and into next year. So the stabilized number is a multiple of GDP typically unless there's some change to the macros that indicates it's a good investment to either open up credit or appropriate to tighten credit.\nJohn Hecht: Yeah. That's a helpful framework to think about. And then with respect to the expense guide, I think you talked about some investment in compliance and some investment in technology and so forth. I'm wondering is there -- is there, maybe talk about the competitive climate at this point relative to the past few years. Is there any spending required from a competitive perspective or do you have any -- can you characterize the overall competitive environment as well?\nRoger Hochschild: I think we continue to see good results from the way we put to work on the marketing front in terms of our cost per account. Obviously, we've talked about the relaunch of cash back debit. We'll put some money against that, including the mass market campaign in the fall, but have been excited with what we're seeing in terms of the cost per funded account there. So while -- yeah the competitive environment is always intense across all of our businesses, we feel good about how our value proposition is competing out there across all of our consumer products.\nJohn Hecht: All right, guys. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo.\nDon Fandetti: Hi. John, I was wondering if you could talk on the merchant miscalculation. Was that found internally or was that brought to you by a regulator or third party?\nJohn Greene: It was found internally.\nDon Fandetti: Okay, great. And then on NIM, it sounded like the trajectory was pretty good in general. And now it's going to be around 11%. Is there more promotional than you thought or more deposit competition, can you talk a bit about that?\nJohn Greene: Yeah. The -- it's a little bit of both actually. So we ended \u201822 at 11.04%. We said that we would be -- initial guidance up modestly. And then in the first quarter call, we said NIM has likely peaked and then it would begin to move downward and what I'll say normalize, likely to a higher level than it has been historically. So in the quarter, the reason that we tweak that guidance was we are -- we are investing in promotional balances. So attracting new customers or building balances with existing customers. Now, the returns on those offers are fantastic. The impact on NIM in the short term and the promotional period, it's minor. But given our activity there, it took a few points of net interest margin out. And we thought that was an important impact to communicate. Second, in terms of deposit competition, we had said that we thought that the beta would come in somewhere around 60% to 70%. What we've seen in late in the first quarter and into this quarter was our competitive set being more aggressive in terms of price increases. And as I've communicated in the past, we don't seek to be a price leader here. We try to compete on our brand, our customer offering, our digital assets that are first class in order to attract deposit customers. And we've been very successful as you can tell by the numbers there. But part of the proposition is also price. So what we're seeing now is betas likely to be north of 70% which is impacting net interest margin to the extent I just talked about in the guidance point. So those two factors are playing most substantially on the revised outlook.\nDon Fandetti: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Thanks. Good morning. I have a follow-up on a couple of points made on the consent order. Maybe the first one, just on the share repurchase pause. Is that action taken in terms of prudence or out of an abundance of caution? Or do you think that there could be a material impact to your capital position? And I guess secondly, just on, John, you talked about the pressures on expenses into 2024. I guess, like, are there -- is there a leverage on other expense lines to sort of moderate the overall implications for the year?\nJohn Greene: Yeah. Thanks, Sanjay. So the decision on the share repurchase was out of prudence. We have done a number of tests internally, stressing a number of factors, so that for example, the CCAR process we go through includes extreme stress. We dusted that off and ran some simulations. And the output of that was that both capital and liquidity, even in an extreme situation, remain well above regulatory requirements. So we feel comfortable about our capital and liquidity. The issue on the share repurchase was again out of prudence given what we have going on in the organization and we wanted to make sure that our actions are consistent with the right message in terms of being conservative and dealing with the first level of priority. In terms of\u2026\nSanjay Sakhrani: Okay.\nJohn Greene: In terms of expense leverage, we continue to look at all of the lines and all of the investments we make in our expense base and the incident management situation we're dealing with in terms of resources to get that under control. That's a significant investment. Some resources supplement technology, people and consultants, certainly an investment. On the indirect side, we continue to leverage our procurement organization and ensure that, first, we concentrate on demand management and then, second, on making sure there's a fair value exchange. So that's the plan right now and will be the plan through the balance of this year.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Okay. I guess follow-up just for Roger. I know you've gotten this question in the past and I'm just thinking about the higher teasers and such. I mean what makes you comfortable growing sort of mid-teens, high teens above the really strong lapping of very strong growth a year ago? I mean, I'm just thinking about just the complexion of the accounts you're bringing in that makes you very comfortable here because it's obviously having some implications on the NIM.\nRoger Hochschild: Yeah. Good question, Sanjay. You have seen that growth start to slow a bit. And I think it isn't necessarily that far out of line with what you're seen from our other, I'd say sophisticated prime focused competitors. It is really strong demand for the product. And as we've been clear, we have been tightening, not loosening credit, and are watching the accounts we book very carefully. And so we're always ready to make adjustments whether it's in the card product, the personal loan or elsewhere. But again, we feel good and are closely monitoring the performance. Within the credit, we're making adjustments continuously both on the portfolio side and the new account side. But these are very strong new accounts we're bringing in. And I think part of it is the differentiated value proposition that Discover offers continues to resonate well with our target customer.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Kevin Barker with Piper Sandler.\nKevin Barker: Great. Thanks for taking my questions. I just wanted to follow-up on the expenses in particular. You said you continue to target efficiency ratio in the high 30s. Could there be a time where you may have to make additional investments, particularly around compliance that would have you go above the high 30s efficiency ratio for a short period of time before returning back to it, just given the near-term impacts of both additional marketing spend on debit account and the compliance issues? Thank you.\nJohn Greene: Sure. So as we sit here today, we feel comfortable with what we shared in terms of low double digit expense growth this year. We've taken a preliminary look at next year. We'll share -- we'll share that at appropriate time after -- after we kind of review and get our plan approved by our Board. But I'm feeling like it's very, very achievable. And that's why we -- we enunciated that target or that goal. But I would say this. As we see opportunities to grow profitably and not -- no contradiction to Roger's point earlier about the demand for our products, but we'll continue to take a look and invest for the medium term and longer term. And we're going to do that on the growth side. We're focused right now on the compliance side and we'll dial each of the expense levers in order to ensure we achieve results that our shareholders want, that our Board expects and that the management team expects.\nKevin Barker: Are there any particular areas where you see the most opportunity to create efficiencies, whether it's marketing or headcount or anything out there that you see that can allow you to continue to hit your goals?\nJohn Greene: Yeah. So we're investing in advanced analytics that we're driving efficiencies in our rewards cost. We continue to look at third-party spend and have achieved great results in terms of year-over-year reduction in unit cost. The situation this year is that we've invested heavily in resources, people. So we're up -- we're about up about 3,000 people this year. So when you bring on additional people, both in collections and customer service as well as salary personnel, there's other costs that go along with it. So as we manage through this situation, I continue to believe there will be opportunities to drive efficiencies by combining like activities, taking a look at how resources are deployed to organizational structures and over time optimizing that. But right now, with the situation we're in, we've decided that the first priority is get the right resources in to focus on the issues we've talked about. And then we're going to be able to drive efficiencies in the future.\nKevin Barker: Okay. Thank you for taking my questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Mihir Bhatia with Bank of America.\nMihir Bhatia: Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my question. Wanted to start maybe just on the business and the application quality of new applicants that you're seeing. I think you mentioned in response to John's question tightening underwriting. I guess, firstly, was that a new action you took in the second quarter? And then just related to that tightening of underwriting and application quality, I was wondering just if you -- I know you've talked in the past about monitoring -- actively monitoring the health of the consumer and the portfolio. Was there -- is there something you're seeing that is flashing red or caution that's making you tighter underwriting further here or just trying to understand who is the demand environment who is applying for a new loan currently, what's driving some of the underwriting changes?\nRoger Hochschild: Yeah. Good question. So the tightening was not in the second quarter and was not in response to something we're seeing. And actually in terms of applicant quality, whether it's for home equity, personal loans, student loan or in card, where we're seeing very stable characteristics in terms of average FICO, in terms of the custom scores we use. So it was a series of changes we made, I would say, in prior quarters. But a lot of stability in terms of the quality of applicant over the course of this quarter.\nMihir Bhatia: Got it. And then maybe switching gears to the debit product that was relaunched. Can you talk just longer term strategically, what is the, I guess, the thinking behind that product, what is the goal, is the idea there, this is -- the opportunity to deepen relationships with customers and lower and how will that benefit you? Will it be through better NIM because if they're offering rewards, you can -- you don't necessarily need to offer as higher interest rates? Like, just talk a little bit more strategically about why the product makes sense to invest in for Discover and how you expect the growth trajectory of that product to go over the next few quarters here?\nRoger Hochschild: Yeah, great question. So, our aspiration is to be the leading digital bank. And so when you think about a digital bank, you think about the core DDA or debit product. And because we have a proprietary network, we can offer rewards in debit in a way no other large bank can. And it builds on our heritage around cashback and as the inventor of credit card rewards. So it's not just to cross-sell to our card customers. We think that this can pretty quickly become a significant entry point into the franchise for new customers. And then over time, much as we've done on the card side, if you can provide a superior value proposition and customer experience, they will want to buy other products from you whether that's a savings account and savings accounts where you also have the checking account and to have a lower beta or the card product. So again, a very important initiative for us, I think over time, will help continue transforming Discover. And we're excited for the potential and you'll see significant marketing against it this fall.\nMihir Bhatia: Got it. And then just my last question. Just coming back to the compliance issue, look, I appreciate it's difficult provide too many details right now. But maybe just on the timing, give us some frame of reference, like, given that this is -- it sounds like the FDIC consent order also is related to compliance issues. You have the student loan issue. Now you have this issue. Does that entail a much longer review period or do you think this can go pretty quickly here like a quarter or two to go through? Again, I'm not saying when you resume buyback but at least like when you expect the review to be complete, what are you trying to -- how quickly are you trying to complete the review internally? And then I understand maybe the buyback discussion probably involves regulators and could be -- it's a little bit harder to cite. But at least the review maybe you can tell us, what your target is for like when you're trying to complete the review?\nRoger Hochschild: Yeah. And to frame the compliance issue, I would not over-focus on the regulatory portion. This is something where we as a team know we are not where we want to be and it is our top priority. So it is aligned with the views of the regulators, but our focus is taking many forms, from simplifying our architecture, automating manual processes, streamlining and standardizing business processes, bring on some great new talent as John talked about into the firm. And we know that the result will not just be better compliance but a better customer experience and more efficient organization. So the regulatory piece is important, but I would say what most -- is most important is the commitment from me, the team, the Board on achieving excellence in this area. That will be a multi-year initiative. But again, I think critically important to the future of the company and one that we as a team are very excited about. I would also separate that from the buyback. But again, it will be a journey on the compliance side, but one that we are 100% committed to.\nMihir Bhatia: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Erika Najarian with UBS.\nNick Holowko: Hi. This is Nick Holowko on for Erika. Thanks for taking my question. Just one more around the consent order and compliance issues. As you think about the operational complexity of the businesses you operate in and as you go through your view looking into these issues, do you feel like there may be an opportunity to take a closer look at some of the businesses you operate in, whether that might be student loans or anywhere else? Thank you.\nRoger Hochschild: Yeah. I'll talk maybe more broadly about operational complexity and then John can talk about the businesses. I think there's a great opportunity to simplify, whether it's -- we may have a similar process that is done differently. And again, we have a much more, I would say, homogeneous set of business is than just about any other bank or size. So we think there are significant opportunities to simplify, and again, those won't just help from a compliance standpoint over time once the investments are made, it will also help on the efficiency side.\nJohn Greene: Yeah. And then regarding our businesses and products, we think about this in line with our capital allocation priorities, our connections to our customer base and what we can manage and manage well. So we didn't start today. Historically, we've looked at all our products, our returns and as we look at those, we've made decisions to invest in order to drive growth or achieve compliance excellence. So we're going to continue to look at that. And if something's below our return targets, then we'll fix it and invest or we'll look at other alternatives. But certainly, the focus today is to take our existing products, make sure they're good offering that we can deliver those in a compliant way and drive a good return for our shareholders.\nNick Holowko: Got it. Thank you for taking my question.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Bob Napoli with William Blair.\nBob Napoli: Thank you, and good morning. And I -- just from a big picture perspective with the competitive environment, the compliance environment, Roger, as you look at your business, what is your confidence that Discover can deliver the types of returns that it has that investors have come used to over the last 10 to 20 years? Is there -- are you confident in delivering those returns with the higher compliance bar or the competitive set?\nRoger Hochschild: Yeah. I'd start by saying yes, right? This is an investment we need to make. It is the top priority for the company, but one that I think we will be able to do to fix. And again, over time, we'll see benefits not just in compliance, but in a better customer experience as well as more efficient. If you step way back, I've never been more excited about Discover's business model and how it compares. I think you're seeing the strength of our deposit franchise at a time when many banks are being tested, we have the scale and resources to compete with anyone. We're making the investments to be at the leading edge around data and analytics, are winning awards for our customer experience on not only just the card side, but also our deposit products. We have the re-launch of cash back debit. So in terms of the business model, and the returns we can give to our owners, in my 25 years at Discover, I've never been more excited. To get to all of that though, we need to get to where you need to be on the compliance standpoint. That's a critical part of operating a bank, a financial services organization. We are not where we need to be and we are going to get there.\nBob Napoli: Thank you. And a follow-up, just on compliance, having followed Discover for a very long time, coming out of the great financial crisis, there was a lot big investment in compliance across the industry including -- at Discover. Has it become more difficult? I mean, I know there's been a number -- quite a few consent orders put out by regulators, but has it become -- maybe give us some color on what you're investing in compliance today. I don't know, if it's people or percentage of expenses versus historically, and how has it become a lot more difficult?\nRoger Hochschild: Yeah. It certainly is a challenging environment, but I'm not going to blame that, right? As I look back, I do believe we under invested and that's something I take accountability for, but we are very focused on it now. And as John, I think, highlighted, that investment takes many forms. Right? From bringing in some highly talented folks within the compliance area, building out our monitoring and controls, investments on the technology side to standardize, simplify, automate manual processes, as you think about it, compliance, a lot of the folks, it's risk management, right? And traditionally, we've been very strong around credit risk management, around liquidity risk management, but have not necessarily made the investments we needed, especially as the complexity of our business increased. As we got into more new products, I think there was a gap there in terms of our capabilities and that's what we're focused on now.\nBob Napoli: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Arren Cyganovich with Citi.\nArren Cyganovich: Thanks. On the net charge-off peak that you highlighted for -- into second half of \u201824 and possibly into \u201925, is that an expectation that it would go north of kind of your normal underwriting charge-off rate?\nJohn Greene: Thanks, Arren. No, I mean, we gave charge-off range. Now there's a numerator and denominator impact on that calculation, of course. But our underwriting is focused on prime revolver. Prime revolver behavior in our targeted segments looks very, very consistent to where it's been historically. And our return expectations remain high and we've been able to deliver on that. So in terms of is it going to be north and where it was historically, we have seasoning of those new vintages. But our credit box has been relatively consistent, our analytics to kind of target customers and understand kind of risk factors, I feel like has improved over the four years I've been here and certainly a longer journey than that. So the trajectory to me looks very, very comfortable in terms of continuing to be able to deliver high returns and generate capital.\nArren Cyganovich: Okay. Thanks. And then just to clarify on the expense commentary, it sounds like you're not planning to pull back on marketing opportunities as your compliance costs are rising. And then if you could just clarify the numbers that you gave earlier, are those annual numbers? I think you said like $50 million up to $250 million and then $350 million and then down to $200 million. I'm just a little confused on the -- on the trajectories there.\nJohn Greene: Trajectory of the compliance management cost? Was that your question, Arren\u2026\nArren Cyganovich: Yeah.\nJohn Greene: \u2026or overall? Yeah. So I'll start with marketing and I'll focus on the client second. We haven't made a decision to pull back on marketing. We still see opportunity to generate positive returns from the customers that we're targeting in that prime revolver segment. And we're also putting money towards helping people understand our deposit products and hopefully find that we're compelling there. We also have the campaign on the cash back debit program slated for the second half of the year. So the marketing dollars, how we thought about them at the beginning of the year remains consistent with where we are today. And frankly, I think it would have been short-sighted to pull back in order to manage to a particular number given the high returns we're able to generate there. In terms of the compliance cost, what I was referencing was 2019 to where we are in 2023. And so about a month ago in a public forum, I said that that increase from \u201819 to \u201823 was about $250 million. As we've looked at the work in front of us, we are dedicating an incremental, call it, $20 million to $30 million, maybe as much as $50 million over and above that here. So it could be the delta from \u201819, not $250 million, but maybe as much as $300 million, year-over-year, so \u201922 to \u201923, we're up about $200 million in total compliance and related cost. Does that provide clarity?\nArren Cyganovich: Yes. Yes, I got it. I got it now. Thank you.\nJohn Greene: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Dominick Gabriele with Oppenheimer.\nDominick Gabriele: Hey, great. Good morning, everybody. So When I look at your loan growth guidance, you talk about low to mid-teens. And to me, that means 14% basically. And so if you think about 14% or that range that you're discussing, it would indicate the second half loan growth would be roughly 7% and given the trajectory of loan growth in general, it would end spending being at 2.5% this quarter moving to 1% in the most recent month. It would suggest the fourth quarter's loan growth would be probably low single digits or something along those lines to make that guidance range. And so I was just curious if that's the right math that you are thinking about or roughly? If we could talk about that, that'd be great.\nJohn Greene: Yeah. I learned a long time ago not to give quarterly guidance because I found that I was not as accurate as I would have liked and other people would have liked. So the range of, kind of, the double digit growth that we talked about, you can take a look at the portfolio. We made some comments on what was driving it. So new accounts and certainly new account growth \u201822 to \u201823 has slowed. Sales, while still very robust at an absolute level, have slowed into July. We're doing targeted promotional activities to drive high generating, high returning accounts. And the comp in the fourth quarter of \u201822 versus prior quarters is certainly a tougher comp. So your math is certainly your math and I don't want to get into any more specifics than what I just did.\nDominick Gabriele: No problem. Thanks a lot. And then, there are some signs that the national unemployment rate could start to move higher if you look at some of the state data. If you saw a seasoning and the unemployment rate rising at the same time, could it have a more additive effect for ultimately higher net charge-offs than otherwise to book without the seasoning effect? And maybe just to relate to that, your loan fee income has been quite robust in its growth and it beat our expectations by quite a lot this quarter. Is that kind of an indication of the seasoning effects that are going on with the late fees in that bucket?\nJohn Greene: Yeah. So --\nDominick Gabriele: Thanks so much.\nJohn Greene: Yeah. Arren, the answer to both questions is yes. So the loan fee income, typically late fees and NSF fees. And in terms of employment levels, if unemployment was to increase, that would certainly impact net charge offs. But I would say this. In the cohort of folks that we typically target, there -- what we've seen is if they are impacted by a job situation, their time of recovery is pretty quick. So by recovery, I mean, finding a new role. So the fact that this cohort of prime revolvers isn't in the upper tier of income levels allows them to have a greater opportunity to find jobs of equal pay -- equal or more pay in the current environment. So the employment -- early indications of employment or some challenges in some states, we don't see any sign of that translating into a credit situation for us.\nDominick Gabriele: Okay, great. I'm going to sneak one more in here. Is there -- Discover spending growth is typically matched its loan growth trajectory over time given the stability of your business model. If we don't see a normalization of -- and meaningful fashion of payment rates, is there any reason that the spending growth and loan growth trajectories would be uncorrelated as they have been in the past?\nJohn Greene: Yeah. So we'll look at -- we'll look at kind of opportunities to drive loan growth. And part of that is the sales data or the spending data from consumers and reflect that in our next set of guidance that we provide. But specifically in correlation, in this form, I'm not going to get into.\nDominick Gabriele: Okay. Thanks so much. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Bill Ryan with Seaport Research Partners.\nBill Ryan: Hi, good morning and thanks for working me in here at the end. Question on the personal loans business. Last quarter, you talked about that there was some marginal tightening that you did, but you had fairly robust loan growth this quarter. Could you talk about the market opportunity that you're seeing there? And also the mix of new versus existing customers, I believe the historical mix was about 50-50, just curious if that's still the case?\nRoger Hochschild: Yeah. So in terms of overall competition, I'd say there's been a little bit of a pullback on the supply side from, I would say, markets and others as they pulled out. But there are a good number of competitors. A lot of them are much more broader spectrum than us in terms of how far down they go. I think what you're seeing is really strong consumer demand as rates have gone up and our product is primarily used for debt consolidation, people are looking to consolidate and pay down their credit cards. And so we're seeing very strong demand that is giving us ability to tighten credit and even at the margin, raise our prices and still see strong demand. So it's a product where underwriting and credit is everything. The mix is largely new, but a good amount are cross-sold to our existing cardholder base. So its customers where we also have experience with them.\nBill Ryan: Okay. Thank you.\nEric Wasserstrom: So I think we are going to conclude our call there. Thanks very much for joining us. If you have any follow-ups, please reach out to the IR team and we wish you a very good day. Thanks very much.\nOperator: This does conclude today's Second Quarter 2023 Discover Financial Services Earnings Conference Call. You may disconnect your line at this time, and have a wonderful day.",

            "name": "Roger Hochschild",
            "content": "Thank you, Eric, and thanks to our listeners for joining today's call. I'll begin by reviewing some of our highlights for the quarter and then discuss the regulatory matter that we've disclosed in our press release. John will then take you through the details of our second quarter results and our updated perspectives on 2023. Last night, we reported second quarter net income of $901 million or $3.54 per share. The quarter was characterized by strong asset and deposit growth, while credit is performing right in line with our expectations. Importantly, we advanced several operational priorities this quarter. One key milestone occurred in May when we relaunched our cash back debit product. We're excited by the positive early results we're seeing so far. In the first few weeks, we opened over 30,000 new accounts and plan to begin national marketing in support of this product in the fall. The relaunch advances our goal of becoming the leading direct bank and over time we expect cash back debit will be a significant entry point into the Discover franchise. We also continue to expand the Discover Global Network. This quarter, we announced five new partnerships in the Asia Pacific region and added a new partnership with Guavapay in the UK. These strategic partnerships underscore our commitment to building out our international acceptance. And lastly, we continue to invest in our human capital. We're honored to have been recognized as the 2023 Best Places to Work for People with Disabilities. This builds upon our recent recognitions as one of Fortune's 100 Best Companies to Work For, Best Workplaces for Parents, and Best Workplaces for Women. As you may have read in our press release last night, beginning around mid-2007, we incorrectly classified certain card accounts into our highest merchant and merchant acquirer pricing tier. We are taking actions correct this card product misclassification going forward and are preparing a program to compensate affected merchants and acquirers. While the financial impacts of this misclassification are not material, it underscored deficiencies in our corporate governance and risk management. We're in discussions with our regulators regarding these matters. We have received a proposed consent order from the FDIC in connection with consumer compliance, which does not cover the misclassification topic. We believe additional supervisory actions could occur. I want to emphasize that we take our business practices and compliance very seriously. We've made significant progress and investment in this area and look forward to working with our Board and our regulators to achieve further advancement. Now I'll hand it over to John to review our results and updated outlook in more detail. Sure. So the FDIC matter is not linked to the misclassification. And so the misclassification is a separate issue. The FDIC matter is broadly around our compliance management system. It doesn't mean that the misclassification may not result in further regulatory action, but I don't want to speculate on that. Yeah, it's -- I don't want to speculate on the timeframe of regulatory actions. I would say to your point though, they can take many forms. And so we're working through the draft with our regulators and we'll make more information available and the consent order will itself be public once that's completed. Thanks. Yeah. I'll cover that piece and then maybe John can talk a bit about the buyback. So I would say the consent order in student loan servicing was a compliance matter. And so I think there's a link between that and the broader focus on our compliance management system. With that, maybe I'll let John talk a bit about the buyback. Yeah. So it has slowed down further so far in July, so probably closer to 1%. Not necessarily as bad as it sounds in terms of the health of the consumer because you've got some very challenging comps compared to last year's growth as well as the very, very high level of new accounts we put on last year. And I think overall in terms of payment side, delinquencies and losses as John said are sort of normalizing right on the path we thought they were. And here I think that the strength of the job market is very constructive for our sort of prime consumer base. Good morning. Sure. John can maybe provide more color on the timeline. I would say it's a multi-year, but it's also something that we have been investing in over the last couple of years. So as you think about your compliance management system, it's everything from risk identification, sort of process mapping, building controls or change management processes, the resources you have around risk management in the first line, the resources you have in the second line in terms of the compliance function, testing, the internal audit, your governance processes. And so we are determined to be as strong on the compliance side and it's excellent there as we are around customer experience, data and analytic, every other aspect of our business model. So this is our top priority and the investment is both on the technology side, outside consultants, but also in terms of headcount here at Discover. John? I think we continue to see good results from the way we put to work on the marketing front in terms of our cost per account. Obviously, we've talked about the relaunch of cash back debit. We'll put some money against that, including the mass market campaign in the fall, but have been excited with what we're seeing in terms of the cost per funded account there. So while -- yeah the competitive environment is always intense across all of our businesses, we feel good about how our value proposition is competing out there across all of our consumer products. Yeah. Good question, Sanjay. You have seen that growth start to slow a bit. And I think it isn't necessarily that far out of line with what you're seen from our other, I'd say sophisticated prime focused competitors. It is really strong demand for the product. And as we've been clear, we have been tightening, not loosening credit, and are watching the accounts we book very carefully. And so we're always ready to make adjustments whether it's in the card product, the personal loan or elsewhere. But again, we feel good and are closely monitoring the performance. Within the credit, we're making adjustments continuously both on the portfolio side and the new account side. But these are very strong new accounts we're bringing in. And I think part of it is the differentiated value proposition that Discover offers continues to resonate well with our target customer. Yeah. Good question. So the tightening was not in the second quarter and was not in response to something we're seeing. And actually in terms of applicant quality, whether it's for home equity, personal loans, student loan or in card, where we're seeing very stable characteristics in terms of average FICO, in terms of the custom scores we use. So it was a series of changes we made, I would say, in prior quarters. But a lot of stability in terms of the quality of applicant over the course of this quarter. Yeah, great question. So, our aspiration is to be the leading digital bank. And so when you think about a digital bank, you think about the core DDA or debit product. And because we have a proprietary network, we can offer rewards in debit in a way no other large bank can. And it builds on our heritage around cashback and as the inventor of credit card rewards. So it's not just to cross-sell to our card customers. We think that this can pretty quickly become a significant entry point into the franchise for new customers. And then over time, much as we've done on the card side, if you can provide a superior value proposition and customer experience, they will want to buy other products from you whether that's a savings account and savings accounts where you also have the checking account and to have a lower beta or the card product. So again, a very important initiative for us, I think over time, will help continue transforming Discover. And we're excited for the potential and you'll see significant marketing against it this fall. Yeah. And to frame the compliance issue, I would not over-focus on the regulatory portion. This is something where we as a team know we are not where we want to be and it is our top priority. So it is aligned with the views of the regulators, but our focus is taking many forms, from simplifying our architecture, automating manual processes, streamlining and standardizing business processes, bring on some great new talent as John talked about into the firm.

I would also separate that from the buyback. But again, it will be a journey on the compliance side, but one that we are 100% committed to. Yeah. I'll talk maybe more broadly about operational complexity and then John can talk about the businesses. I think there's a great opportunity to simplify, whether it's -- we may have a similar process that is done differently. And again, we have a much more, I would say, homogeneous set of business is than just about any other bank or size. So we think there are significant opportunities to simplify, and again, those won't just help from a compliance standpoint over time once the investments are made, it will also help on the efficiency side. Yeah. I'd start by saying yes, right? This is an investment we need to make. It is the top priority for the company, but one that I think we will be able to do to fix. And again, over time, we'll see benefits not just in compliance, but in a better customer experience as well as more efficient. If you step way back, I've never been more excited about Discover's business model and how it compares. I think you're seeing the strength of our deposit franchise at a time when many banks are being tested, we have the scale and resources to compete with anyone. We're making the investments to be at the leading edge around data and analytics, are winning awards for our customer experience on not only just the card side, but also our deposit products. We have the re-launch of cash back debit. So in terms of the business model, and the returns we can give to our owners, in my 25 years at Discover, I've never been more excited. To get to all of that though, we need to get to where you need to be on the compliance standpoint. That's a critical part of operating a bank, a financial services organization. We are not where we need to be and we are going to get there. Yeah. It certainly is a challenging environment, but I'm not going to blame that, right? As I look back, I do believe we under invested and that's something I take accountability for, but we are very focused on it now. And as John, I think, highlighted, that investment takes many forms. Right? From bringing in some highly talented folks within the compliance area, building out our monitoring and controls, investments on the technology side to standardize, simplify, automate manual processes, as you think about it, compliance, a lot of the folks, it's risk management, right? And traditionally, we've been very strong around credit risk management, around liquidity risk management, but have not necessarily made the investments we needed, especially as the complexity of our business increased. As we got into more new products, I think there was a gap there in terms of our capabilities and that's what we're focused on now. Yeah. So in terms of overall competition, I'd say there's been a little bit of a pullback on the supply side from, I would say, markets and others as they pulled out. But there are a good number of competitors. A lot of them are much more broader spectrum than us in terms of how far down they go. I think what you're seeing is really strong consumer demand as rates have gone up and our product is primarily used for debt consolidation, people are looking to consolidate and pay down their credit cards. And so we're seeing very strong demand that is giving us ability to tighten credit and even at the margin, raise our prices and still see strong demand. So it's a product where underwriting and credit is everything. The mix is largely new, but a good amount are cross-sold to our existing cardholder base. So its customers where we also have experience with them."

            "name": "John Greene",
            "content": "Thank you, Roger, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to open by addressing the financial implications of the card misclassification. We have established a liability on our balance sheet of $365 million to accrue for estimated compensation owed to merchant and acquirers. In establishing the liability, we adjusted retained earnings by $255 million net of tax. $11 million was taken this quarter and is reflected in discount and interchange revenue. The first half 2023 impact was $22 million. With that, I'll transition to our financial summary results on Slide 4. From this, you can see that the financial performance of the business remains solid. In the quarter, we reported net income of $901 million, which was 18% lower year-over-year. Our results reflect strong revenue growth partially offset by a provision increase driven by receivable growth and higher expenses. The trends for the quarter were robust loan growth, a low efficiency ratio even as we invested in compliance management and technology, and strong capital and liquidity positions. Further details are reflected on Slide 5. Net interest income was up $567 million year-over-year or 22%. Our net interest margin ended the quarter at 11.06%, up 12 basis points from the prior year and down 28 basis points sequentially. The benefits from higher prime rates were offset by higher funding costs and increased promotional balances. Receivable growth was robust. Card increased 19% year-over-year, reflecting a lower payment rate versus the prior year and modest sales growth. The card payment rate remains stable quarter-over-quarter and about 200 basis points over 2019 levels. Sales volume grew 3% in the quarter. Through mid-July, growth continued to slow and was up about 1%. Turning to our non-card products. Personal loans were up 27% driven by strength in originations over the past year. We continue to experience strong consumer demand while staying disciplined in our underwriting. Deposit growth in the quarter was solid, with average consumer deposits up 20% year-over-year and 4% sequentially. Our direct-to-consumer balances grew $2 billion and consumer deposits made up 66% of our total funding mix. We continue to target 70-plus-percent of funding from deposits. Looking at other revenue on Slide 6. Non-interest income increased $98 million or 16%. This was partially due to a $42 million loss on our equity investments in the prior year quarter compared to a $1 million gain this quarter. Adjusting for these, our non-interest income was up 9%, primarily driven by loan fee income. Moving to expenses on Slide 7. Total operating expenses were up $181 million or 15% year-over-year and up 2% from the prior quarter, primarily driven by our investments in our compliance management systems. These investments impacted several of our expense line items. Looking at our major expense categories, compensation costs were up $73 million or 14%, primarily due to increased headcount. Marketing expense increased $14 million or 6% as we prudently invested for growth, particularly in our deposits and personal loan products. Our commitment to disciplined cost management has not changed and we continue to target an efficiency ratio in the high 30s. Moving to credit performance on Slide 8. Total net charge-offs were 3.22%, 142 basis points higher than the prior year and up 50 basis points from the prior quarter. Consistent with our expectation, we are seeing credit normalization across all of our lending products. Looking ahead in card, we continue to expect the seasoning of new accounts vintages and normalization of older vintages to result in higher losses through the back half of this year and into 2024. Turning to the allowance for credit losses on Slide 9. This quarter, we increased our reserve by $373 million, driven by our double-digit loan growth. Our reserve rate remained flat at 6.8%. Our outlook on the macro economy has improved modestly. We continue to monitor economic conditions and will make adjustments to our expectations as needed. Looking at slide 10, our capital position remains robust. Our common equity Tier 1 for the period was 11.7%, well ahead of regulatory requirements. The cumulative impact of the correction to the financial statements related to the card misclassification reduced our CET1 ratio by approximately 20 basis points. In the quarter, we repurchased 6.8 million shares of common stock and declared a quarterly common dividend of $0.70 per share. As Roger indicated, we are reviewing our compliance, risk management and corporate governance and are in discussions with our regulators on these topics. While this is ongoing, we have decided to pause share repurchases. Concluding on Slide 11 with our outlook. There has been no change to our loan growth expectations to be in the low to mid-teens. We are updating our NIM expectations to be around 11% for the full year, reflecting a combination of slightly lower asset yields driven by promotional mix and higher funding costs. We are raising our guidance for operating expenses to be up low double digits. As previously indicated, we are seeing upward pressure on expenses from the build-out of our compliance management systems. And we are lowering our expected range of net charge-offs to 3.4% to 3.6% based on our current delinquencies and roll rates. To wrap up, our business model continues to generate solid financial results and our capital, funding and liquidity positions remain strong. We continue to invest in actions that drive sustainable long-term performance, enable us to achieve excellence in all parts of our business. With that, I'll turn the call back to our operator, Todd, to open the line for Q&A. Great. And -- thanks Roger. And as it relates to the buyback, we had robust conversations internally whether or not to pause the buyback. And what management recommended to the Board was that we pause the buyback as we work through the details of these compliance and risk management issues and are in conversations with our regulators. I want to reiterate the following though. Our capital allocation priorities remain consistent. So first invest in the business and growth and certainly through this year and into next year into compliance and risk management. And second, the priority will be to return excess capital to shareholders. So no change in terms of the two primary capital allocation priorities. I also want to focus your attention onto the strong capital generation that the business delivered in the quarter and has delivered historically. So we're hoping that we kind of work through these issues in an expedited fashion, but timing, I can't be specific on. So with that, the buyback will provide us much clarity on the timing of resumption when we have information on that. And then, Ryan, on the trajectory, and so I made this comment publicly about 1.5 months ago. 2019 to 2023, we increased our spend in compliance and I'll say some gentle items to ensure compliance works as we wish it to work. I indicated it was about an increase of $250 million as we relooked at it. We were going to accelerate that spend to probably $300 million increase from 2019 and a $200 million increase \u201822 to '23. Now the implications for that on '24, where we sit today, we expect once we achieve that level in \u201823 to be relatively consistent into '24. And then as we kind of shape this piece of our business into something that we desire, our regulators desire and our shareholders deserve, we expect that expense burn to reduce. Yeah, great. So yeah, the tightening in the range was reflective of a couple of things. So first, as time moves on, we get more and more comfort with our forecasting on it. And to date, our forecasting has been right on top of actuals, our actuals have been right on top of the forecasting. So that gave us comfort. Second is, as time goes on, we can move from the analytical model to a more kind of traditional roll rate model that gives us a greater level of comfort around the charge-off and delinquency rates 30 day -- 30 days out to 180 days out. So that gave us comfort to tighten that range. And then on top of that, certainly the jobs -- jobs data and the forecast around employment gave us additional comfort. In terms of what we're seeing with the portfolio, exactly what I said in the prepared comments. So the newer vintages seasoning to expectation and older vintages basically normalizing to kind of 2019 levels. In terms of the shape of the curve, what we expect charge-offs to do in the back half of this year is the acceleration in terms of the rates of charge-off to begin to slow. And currently, we're expecting, kind of, charge-offs to peak in the second half of \u201824. It may push a little bit into '25, but right now we're seeing it in the second half of \u201824 and then reach the level, which likely will stabilize that for two to three quarters after. Yeah. So certainly real robust loan growth in the first half of this year and the last quarter of 2022. We expect the rate of increase to slow certainly in the third and fourth quarter and also against really, really strong comps from 2022. And traditionally what this business has delivered is loan growth somewhere between 2 times and 4 times GDP growth. Now, we don't know what GDP is going to look like right now into \u201824, but I would say this. We did cut the edges on the lower credit quality, which is -- will impact new account growth in card for the balance of this year. We're seeing, as Roger indicated, and I mentioned in my comments, sales growth to slow and probably stabilize in the single digits. So that will also impact loan growth for the balance of this year and into next year. So the stabilized number is a multiple of GDP typically unless there's some change to the macros that indicates it's a good investment to either open up credit or appropriate to tighten credit. It was found internally. Yeah. The -- it's a little bit of both actually. So we ended \u201822 at 11.04%. We said that we would be -- initial guidance up modestly. And then in the first quarter call, we said NIM has likely peaked and then it would begin to move downward and what I'll say normalize, likely to a higher level than it has been historically. So in the quarter, the reason that we tweak that guidance was we are -- we are investing in promotional balances. So attracting new customers or building balances with existing customers. Now, the returns on those offers are fantastic. The impact on NIM in the short term and the promotional period, it's minor. But given our activity there, it took a few points of net interest margin out. And we thought that was an important impact to communicate. Second, in terms of deposit competition, we had said that we thought that the beta would come in somewhere around 60% to 70%. What we've seen in late in the first quarter and into this quarter was our competitive set being more aggressive in terms of price increases. And as I've communicated in the past, we don't seek to be a price leader here. We try to compete on our brand, our customer offering, our digital assets that are first class in order to attract deposit customers. And we've been very successful as you can tell by the numbers there. But part of the proposition is also price. So what we're seeing now is betas likely to be north of 70% which is impacting net interest margin to the extent I just talked about in the guidance point. So those two factors are playing most substantially on the revised outlook. Yeah. Thanks, Sanjay. So the decision on the share repurchase was out of prudence. We have done a number of tests internally, stressing a number of factors, so that for example, the CCAR process we go through includes extreme stress. We dusted that off and ran some simulations. And the output of that was that both capital and liquidity, even in an extreme situation, remain well above regulatory requirements. So we feel comfortable about our capital and liquidity. The issue on the share repurchase was again out of prudence given what we have going on in the organization and we wanted to make sure that our actions are consistent with the right message in terms of being conservative and dealing with the first level of priority. In terms of... In terms of expense leverage, we continue to look at all of the lines and all of the investments we make in our expense base and the incident management situation we're dealing with in terms of resources to get that under control. That's a significant investment. Some resources supplement technology, people and consultants, certainly an investment. On the indirect side, we continue to leverage our procurement organization and ensure that, first, we concentrate on demand management and then, second, on making sure there's a fair value exchange. So that's the plan right now and will be the plan through the balance of this year. Sure. So as we sit here today, we feel comfortable with what we shared in terms of low double digit expense growth this year. We've taken a preliminary look at next year. We'll share -- we'll share that at appropriate time after -- after we kind of review and get our plan approved by our Board. But I'm feeling like it's very, very achievable. And that's why we -- we enunciated that target or that goal. But I would say this. As we see opportunities to grow profitably and not -- no contradiction to Roger's point earlier about the demand for our products, but we'll continue to take a look and invest for the medium term and longer term. And we're going to do that on the growth side. We're focused right now on the compliance side and we'll dial each of the expense levers in order to ensure we achieve results that our shareholders want, that our Board expects and that the management team expects. Yeah. So we're investing in advanced analytics that we're driving efficiencies in our rewards cost. We continue to look at third-party spend and have achieved great results in terms of year-over-year reduction in unit cost. The situation this year is that we've invested heavily in resources, people. So we're up -- we're about up about 3,000 people this year. So when you bring on additional people, both in collections and customer service as well as salary personnel, there's other costs that go along with it. So as we manage through this situation, I continue to believe there will be opportunities to drive efficiencies by combining like activities, taking a look at how resources are deployed to organizational structures and over time optimizing that. But right now, with the situation we're in, we've decided that the first priority is get the right resources in to focus on the issues we've talked about. And then we're going to be able to drive efficiencies in the future. Yeah. And then regarding our businesses and products, we think about this in line with our capital allocation priorities, our connections to our customer base and what we can manage and manage well. So we didn't start today. Historically, we've looked at all our products, our returns and as we look at those, we've made decisions to invest in order to drive growth or achieve compliance excellence. So we're going to continue to look at that. And if something's below our return targets, then we'll fix it and invest or we'll look at other alternatives. But certainly, the focus today is to take our existing products, make sure they're good offering that we can deliver those in a compliant way and drive a good return for our shareholders. Thanks, Arren. No, I mean, we gave charge-off range. Now there's a numerator and denominator impact on that calculation, of course. But our underwriting is focused on prime revolver. Prime revolver behavior in our targeted segments looks very, very consistent to where it's been historically. And our return expectations remain high and we've been able to deliver on that. So in terms of is it going to be north and where it was historically, we have seasoning of those new vintages. But our credit box has been relatively consistent, our analytics to kind of target customers and understand kind of risk factors, I feel like has improved over the four years I've been here and certainly a longer journey than that. So the trajectory to me looks very, very comfortable in terms of continuing to be able to deliver high returns and generate capital. Trajectory of the compliance management cost? Was that your question, Arren... ...or overall? Yeah. So I'll start with marketing and I'll focus on the client second. We haven't made a decision to pull back on marketing. We still see opportunity to generate positive returns from the customers that we're targeting in that prime revolver segment. And we're also putting money towards helping people understand our deposit products and hopefully find that we're compelling there. We also have the campaign on the cash back debit program slated for the second half of the year. So the marketing dollars, how we thought about them at the beginning of the year remains consistent with where we are today. And frankly, I think it would have been short-sighted to pull back in order to manage to a particular number given the high returns we're able to generate there. In terms of the compliance cost, what I was referencing was 2019 to where we are in 2023. And so about a month ago in a public forum, I said that that increase from \u201819 to \u201823 was about $250 million. As we've looked at the work in front of us, we are dedicating an incremental, call it, $20 million to $30 million, maybe as much as $50 million over and above that here. So it could be the delta from \u201819, not $250 million, but maybe as much as $300 million, year-over-year, so '22 to '23, we're up about $200 million in total compliance and related cost. Does that provide clarity? Great. Thank you. Yeah. I learned a long time ago not to give quarterly guidance because I found that I was not as accurate as I would have liked and other people would have liked. So the range of, kind of, the double digit growth that we talked about, you can take a look at the portfolio. We made some comments on what was driving it. So new accounts and certainly new account growth \u201822 to \u201823 has slowed. Sales, while still very robust at an absolute level, have slowed into July. We're doing targeted promotional activities to drive high generating, high returning accounts. And the comp in the fourth quarter of \u201822 versus prior quarters is certainly a tougher comp. So your math is certainly your math and I don't want to get into any more specifics than what I just did. Yeah. So -- Yeah. Arren, the answer to both questions is yes. So the loan fee income, typically late fees and NSF fees. And in terms of employment levels, if unemployment was to increase, that would certainly impact net charge offs. But I would say this. In the cohort of folks that we typically target, there -- what we've seen is if they are impacted by a job situation, their time of recovery is pretty quick. So by recovery, I mean, finding a new role. So the fact that this cohort of prime revolvers isn't in the upper tier of income levels allows them to have a greater opportunity to find jobs of equal pay -- equal or more pay in the current environment. So the employment -- early indications of employment or some challenges in some states, we don't see any sign of that translating into a credit situation for us. Yeah. So we'll look at -- we'll look at kind of opportunities to drive loan growth. And part of that is the sales data or the spending data from consumers and reflect that in our next set of guidance that we provide. But specifically in correlation, in this form, I'm not going to get into."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the First Quarter 2023 Discover Financial Services Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Eric Wasserstrom, Head of Investor Relations. Sir, please go ahead.\nEric Wasserstrom: Thank you, Chelsea, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to this morning's call. I'll begin on slide two of our earnings presentation, which you can find in the financial section of our Investor Relations website, investorrelations.discover.com. Our discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. Please refer to our notices regarding forward-looking statements that appear in our first quarter earnings press release and presentation. Our call today will include remarks from our CEO, Roger Hochschild; and John Greene, our Chief Financial Officer. After we conclude our formal comments, there will be time for a question-and-answer session. During the Q&A session, you\u2019ll be permitted to ask one question followed by one follow-up question. After your follow-up questions, please return to the queue. Now, it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Roger.\nRoger Hochschild: Thanks, Eric, and thanks to our listeners for joining today's call. I'll begin by commenting on some of the recent events in the banking industry, review our highlights for the quarter, and then John will take you through the details of our first quarter results and our updated perspectives on 2023. This past quarter include the failure of two large banks, an event that catalyzed more widespread stress in some segments of the banking system and raised questions about the funding models and embedded portfolio losses of multiple banks. In contrast, our strong results underscore how our model, with its diversified funding, trusted brand, focus on prime consumer lending and conservative risk management positions us to succeed through a range of operating conditions. I want to call out a few results in particular that highlight our performance in this challenging environment. We reported first quarter net income of $1 billion or $3.58 per share. We had an all-time record quarter in terms of consumer deposit inflows, leveraging our award-winning digital experience and our leading customer service, and we're improving key elements of our guidance. As we look to the remainder of 2023, we may adjust our outlook as conditions evolve. We believe there is the potential for more stringent regulation. We believe we're well positioned for more rigorous regulatory capital and liquidity requirements given our strong internal standards, and we also continue to focus on enhancing our compliance management systems. This past quarter also included an important milestone with respect to our investment in human capital. We're honored to have been recognized as one of Fortune's 100 Best Companies to Work for in 2023. This is the first time we've earned this distinction and it builds upon recognition we received last year, ranking us among the best workplaces for parents and Fortune's best workplaces for women. In conclusion, we believe our earnings power, balance sheet strength, investments in people and advancements and capabilities support our strategy of becoming the leading consumer digital bank. I'll now turn the call over to John to review our results in more detail.\nJohn Greene: Thank you, Roger, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with our financial summary results on slide four. Our performance this quarter was characterized by strong revenue growth, continued credit normalization, a slight change to our outlook on the macroeconomic environment, resulting in a reserve increase, and a year-over-year increase in expenses. Let's review the details starting on slide five. Net interest income was up $653 million year-over-year or 26%. Our net interest margin continued to expand, benefiting from higher prime rates, partially offset by higher funding costs and increased promotional balances. NIM ended the quarter at 11.34%, up 49 basis points from the prior year and seven basis points sequentially. Receivable growth was driven by card, which increased 22% year-over-year, reflecting stable sales growth, modest new account growth, and payment rate moderation. Sales increased 9% in the period, slightly higher than the 8% growth we experienced in the prior quarter and down from the 16% growth we experienced in 2022. Sales growth so far in April is a modest 2.5% but this is coming off a very high comp of 22% in April of last year. New card account growth decelerated, reflecting the tightening of underwriting standards over the past several months, but grew by 3% from the prior year. The impact of slowing sales growth on receivable expansion was offset by decreases in payment rates. The card payment rate decreased 80 basis points in the quarter and is currently slightly over 200 basis points above the pre-pandemic level. Turning to our non-card products. Personal loans were up 21%, driven by higher originations over the past year and lower payment rates. We continue to experience strong consumer demand, while staying disciplined in our underwriting of this product. Organic student loan receivables grew by 3%, largely driven by a reduction in the payment rate. In terms of funding mix, consumer deposit balances were up 17% year-over-year and 7% sequentially. As Roger highlighted, we achieved record quarterly deposit growth. Deposits now make up 66% of our total funding mix with over 90% insured and we continue to target 70% to 80% deposit funding over the medium term. Outside of deposits, our funding channels remain open and at attractive costs. As an example, in early April, we issued $1.25 billion of card ABS fixed rate notes. This offering was upsized and our spread was nine basis points tighter than our November securitization. Additionally, we recently received a ratings upgrade by Moody's for our bank subsidiary and our banking holding company. Moody's cited a number of reasons to support this upgrade, including our prudent underwriting, conservative risk management, and resiliency in an economic downturn. Looking at other revenue on slide six. Non-interest income increased $198 million or 47%. This was partially due to a $162 million loss on our equity investments in the prior year quarter compared to an $18 million loss this quarter. Adjusting for these, our non-interest income was up 9%, primarily driven by the loan fee income and higher net discount and interchange revenue. Moving to expenses on slide seven. Total operating expenses were up $253 million, or 22% year-over-year and down 7% from the prior quarter. Compensation costs were up primarily due to increased headcount and wage inflation. Marketing expenses increased $49 million, or 26% as we continue to prudently invest for growth in our card and consumer banking products. Professional fees increased $55 million, or 31%, driven by investments in technology and increases and consulting activities that support our consumer compliance initiatives. Even with these increases, our efficiency ratio was 37%, and we generated about 700 basis points of operating leverage in the period. Moving to credit performance on Slide 8. Total net charge-offs were 2.72%, 111 basis points higher than the prior year and up 59 basis points from the prior quarter. In the card portfolio, the net charge-off rate of 3.1% was 126 basis points higher than the prior year and 73 basis points higher sequentially. Consistent with our commentary back in January, we expect the seasoning of new account vintages from the past two years and normalization of older vintages to a more typical loss rate. These trends remain consistent with our expectations. Turning to the discussion of our allowance on Slide 9. This quarter, we increased our allowance by $385 million, and our reserve rate increased by 25 basis points to 6.8%. This increase in reserve rate was driven by two factors. About 10 basis points reflects the runoff of seasonal transactor balances that we typically experienced in the fourth quarter. The remaining portion was largely driven by deterioration in our expectations of the macroeconomic environment. We increased our expectations for the 2023 year-end employment rate to the midpoint of our 4.5% to 5% range. This change reflects the potential for a reduction in lending impacting economic growth. We will continue to monitor the macroeconomic conditions and make adjustments to our expectations. Looking at Slide 10. Our common equity Tier 1 for the period was 12.3%, and we repurchased $1.2 billion of common stock during the quarter. The net unrealized loss on our AFS securities portfolio at the end of the quarter was $45 million. The impact on our regulatory capital, if our OCI opt-out were not allowed would have been about 20 basis points. Our capital position remains robust and well ahead of regulatory requirements. We continue to prioritize investment in strong organic growth and returning excess capital to shareholders. Included in our press release was the announcement that our Board of Directors approved a new $2.7 billion share repurchase program for the five quarters ending June 2024 and increased our common stock dividend by 17% to $0.70 per share. Including on Slide 11 with our outlook. Following the strong first quarter performance, we are raising our expectations for loan growth this year to be low to mid-teens. There is no change to our NIM forecast. We are maintaining our guidance for operating expenses to be less than 10%. However, we do see risk of upward pressure on this from collection and customer service expense related to growth in our lending and deposit accounts and professional service support and continued investment in technology. We are targeting our expected range of net charge-offs to 3.5% to 3.8% based on our current delinquencies and roll rates. This represents a reduction to the top end of the range by 10 basis points. Finally, as mentioned, our Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase authorization. We have returned substantial excess capital over the past two years, and we anticipate moving towards a more standard cadence of share buybacks over the second half of this year. To conclude, our first quarter results have given us significant momentum into this year, and we're well positioned to deliver on our financial objectives. With that, I'll turn the call back to our operator to open the line for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Your line is open.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Thank you. Good morning. John, quick question on the reserve commentary you had. Just to be clear, I know you guys had a weighting of scenarios. And it sounds like the low end went from 4.5% to 4.75%. When we average that out, between all the scenarios, does that take you above the 5% unemployment rate assumption, or how should we think about that? And also just in terms of the narrowing of the range of the charge-offs this quarter, was that more because the unemployment rate hasn't necessarily panned out the way you expected it to, meaning it's coming in better?\nJohn Greene: Yes. Thanks, Sanjay. Yes, I'll start with the reserve portion of the question and then swing over to the charge-off aspect. So as we mentioned, we ran a number of different scenarios. So we looked at unemployment ranges from 3.5% to north of 6%. We centered around a range between 4.5% and 5% for 2023 and then a slight improvement in 2024. And that was essentially the driver of the increase in the reserve rate outside of the 10 basis points I talked about in my prepared remarks related to kind of transactors running off as they typically do in the first quarter. So hopefully, that clarifies your question or clarify any questions you have on reserves. Related to charge-offs, so there's a couple of factors there. The first and what I would say is the most important is that the portfolio is performing almost exactly as we expected it to in terms of charge-off, roll rates and delinquencies. So we're generally pleased with that. As each month and quarter goes by, we have better line of sight to what we expect the total year to be. Our internal kind of roll rate models basically can take a very, very good look at six months forward, and then we move to more advanced models for anything beyond that. So as the first quarter passed through great line of sight through September. And then beyond September, we've relied on our analytical models. So that's essentially the reason why we're able to tighten the charge-off guidance from the upper end. And each quarter, we'll give an update on that certainly.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nMoshe Orenbuch: Great. Thanks. I guess, first, you talked about kind of slowing of new account growth. Could you kind of, Roger, perhaps drill down a little more into that the drivers, I guess, in terms of what you're seeing either in the competitive environment or in the consumer kind of credit environment?\nRoger Hochschild: Yeah. So I'll start the credit -- the competitive environment remains robust, right? Most of our key competitors in the card business are the larger money center banks, well capitalized, a lot of deposits. So card's tends to always be competitive. I think what you're seeing are the results of some of the changes we've made in credit policy. We've talked about tightening at the margin. And then also some very tough comps over the growth we saw last year. So we feel really good about the new accounts we're booking, but also believe our credit policy is appropriate for the current environment.\nMoshe Orenbuch: Got it. And maybe can you talk, John, maybe talk a little bit more about the expense comment that you made, how much of that would be tied to revenue growth if expenses were higher.\nJohn Greene: Yeah. So as I said in the prepared remarks, we we've maintained a less than 10% guidance, although we're seeing a little bit of pressure on those lines I mentioned. So in terms of marketing, what we said in January was that we expected marketing to be up double digits. We still expect that to be the case despite the reduction in the rate of growth of new accounts, we are still seeing good opportunities to generate positive account growth with an appropriate risk tolerance. The other portion of that marketing spend will be to roll out the -- the cash back debit program, which we anticipate to be rolled out late in the second quarter, maybe early in the third quarter. So we're going to put some substantial dollars behind that to generate some activity, both new account generation as well as awareness of the product and the product features that we think will help build -- continue to build our strong deposit franchise.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Bob Napoli with William Blair. Your line is open.\nBob Napoli: Yeah. Thank you, and good morning. The slowdown in spend growth that you called out in the month of April. I was wondering if you could give -- I know it's tough comps versus a year ago. But just any color on what you're seeing on that front? And then any change in your view of the health of the consumer?\nRoger Hochschild: Yeah. So I would say that, the slowdown is pretty broad-based. And is really a continuation of the trend. If you look at the quarter itself, overall sales growth was a little over 9%. But March, it had dropped to 4%. So broad-based across all categories, I think some of it is just a reduction in the pressures from inflation. But also you've got some tough comps in terms of last April, sales were up 22% year-over-year. For us, the most important thing for the consumers, the strength of the job market, and that remains pretty robust. So while we are tightening credit and continuing along that, overall, the consumer is still holding up pretty well.\nBob Napoli: Thank you. Then just any more color on the Cashback Debit product and what do you believe that will, I guess, do for you strategically? Just any thoughts on -- I know you guys have been doing a lot of work on it over the years, and it seems like you're ready to really roll with it.\nRoger Hochschild: Yeah. No, that -- it's a product we're really excited about. Offering 1% cash back on debit transactions is virtually unique. It's something that no big bank can match. We take advantage of having a proprietary payments network. And one of the outcomes from the pandemic is consumers even for their primary checking or debit account are a lot more comfortable dealing with the direct bank. So this is going to be a critical initiative, not just for this year, but for many years to come. And part of our transition to being way more than credit cards, first loans, student loans, home equity, but being the true leading digital bank.\nBob Napoli: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Rick Shane with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nRick Shane: Thanks everybody for taking my questions this morning. Roger, when you look at the credit outlook and you updated the NCO guidance, I'm curious about some of the puts and takes you see in terms of the internals of numbers, whether it's roll rates, utilization, payment rates. What do you see out there that is the most constructive and what's your -- what's the factor that gives you the most pause?\nRoger Hochschild: Yeah. It varies for new accounts versus what we look for in our portfolio. For the portfolio side, yeah, it's hard to pick an individual factor given the complexity of the models we use. But certainly, overall levels of indebtedness, their behavior in terms of payments, the amount of payment, we even look at when a payment comes in during the month. So given that we're still focused on growth, I would say, in general, the consumers are doing well, but we have continued to tighten. And it's something we look at every account, every day across all of our different products.\nRick Shane: Got it. And is there one metric you might point to that kind of your -- when you get your daily reports, you scan to right away to -- because it's a concern for you?\nRoger Hochschild: Yeah. So you may find it hard to believe, but there are very few numbers I look at on a daily basis. I'm lucky to have an amazing team. And so I can look at it a little less frequently. But you can't point to a single number. We have a composite behavioral score that I see on a lot of our internal risk reporting. But again, there are literally countless variables in some of our most complex machine learning models that are evaluating portfolio credit.\nRick Shane: Got it. Okay. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nJeff Adelson: Yes. Hi. This is Jeff Adelson on for Betsy. Good morning. John, I just wanted to follow up on the comment about the potential for a reduction in lending impacting economic growth. I know that was more of a macro overlay comment, but just wanted to understand maybe where you think Discover is going to fit into that potential tightening regime? I know you're already doing some tightening, slowing account growth on your side, but just wondering, do you see yourself at some point this year taking a more meaningful cut, maybe what would cause you to revisit the loan growth that you're seeing today?\nJohn Greene: Yes, thanks for the question, Jeff. So as we look at loan growth for 2023, we feel very, very positive, and that's why we moved the loan growth range up a bit. So in terms of the overall lending environment and what would trigger additional cuts, it would be meaningful changes to the unemployment outlook, meaningful changes in the number of job openings and then further signs of stress within the consumers. So that would -- within the portfolio itself, it would be payment rates, timing of payments. We take a look at flow rates from one bucket to another. So those would all be certainly signs as well as kind of the broader indications of delinquency and the rate of charge-off on a vintage basis. But as we look at things right now, employment, I believe, will continue to be strong, right? So we have strong growth in the health care sector, manufacturing sector, defense, oil and gas, and onshoring of supply chain continues. So my sense is that we're not going to have any seismic changes to unemployment despite the fed tightening action. So that means that we'll look at -- continue to look at things around the margins and make good calls to ensure that the accounts we're putting on are profitable. And the accounts that are in the portfolio that we have early warning triggers, so that our customer service and collection folks can reach out to ensure that collections and cash flows remain strong.\nJeff Adelson: Thank you. And one follow-up I just want to have on expenses and technology investment. There's been a lot of focus out there on AI and some advances in that technology. I know Discover has been pretty nimble and investing on its own in that space. But just wondering, is there anything -- \nJohn Greene: Hello. Jeff or operator? Is the line open?\nOperator: Yes. His line is still open. \nJohn Greene: Okay.\nEric Wasserstrom: Jeff, I think we missed the last a little bit of your question, but I think it was essentially about the use of AI. So.\nJohn Greene: Yes. So why don't I -- I'll take that briefly. And Jeff or Betsy, we can follow up separately in the afternoon, if you like. So in terms of investing in technology. So there's three -- there's, I'll call it, three or four different strengths. The first is to ensure we have leading-edge capabilities, which would include machine learning, AI. Second is ensure that our core systems are robust and resilient. And third, around the network, making sure that our network continues to have leading edge or at a minimum market global capabilities. So, those are the tiers and we continue to invest in those aspects as well as technology to support our overall compliance management system as we talked about in the prepared remarks. So, overall, it's an area of investment. We're a digital institution. We need to continue to invest in technology to ensure that we keep capabilities, advancing.\nJeff Adelson: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Dominick Gabriele with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.\nDominick Gabriele: Hey, thanks so much and good morning. I would imagine that Discover, given the prudence of the way you run your franchise has really strong KYC. And I think some of the fintech players are actually having some difficulty there. And so I'd love to hear you talk about your checklist for opening an account. And is there a difference for KYC when you issue a debit card versus extending credit with the credit card? And I just have a follow-up. Thanks so much guys.\nRoger Hochschild: Yes. Great question. So, AML BSA, KYC is one element of compliance. There are many others that we focus on. First thing I'd say is our task might be a little easier just given that we don't handle much cash, not having branches. We don't have huge private net worth operations, much outside the US. But it is a key area of focus, there's a pretty big overlap between what we're required to do from a KYC standpoint and actually what we do ourselves to tackle fraud. A huge amount of the new fraud attacks do come via identity theft. And while there are sort of nuanced differences by product, very, very similar in terms of what we do when someone is opening a new credit card account versus opening a checking or a debit account.\nDominick Gabriele: Okay. Thanks. Thank you very much. And I guess, kind of a double question here. But is -- how closely aligned is your CECL unemployment rate and thus, reserve outlook correlated with your net charge-off guidance. Is there a possibility that, I mean, you had mentioned before that you don't expect unemployment rate to rise very much? Is there a chance that there could be actually a disconnect between the CECL reserve and company NCO outlooks? Thanks so much.\nJohn Greene: Yes, thanks Dominick. So, yes, we have a process that we take great pains to make sure there's no disconnects between our outlook on kind of charge-offs over, call it, a three-quarter or four-quarter period and the CECL reserves, which is life of loan losses, which would include charge-offs through the life of the relationship. And the modeling systems that we use are essentially the same. Same tools, same people kind of managing those and a bunch of work to ensure that the organization. So each of the functions, credit and risk management systems and finance and accounting are on the same page in terms of what we're trying to accomplish here. So there's no chance to disconnect here at Discover. I will say that the difference in terms of the tightening of our charge-off outlook in terms of updated guidance and what happened in the reserve has a couple of factors that are at play there. The first is, we're talking about a three-quarter period of forecasting on the charge-offs. And we gave a fairly wide range, which we intend to tighten as each quarter passes. On the reserves, we take a number of different factors, including the macro environment portfolio. And then there's certainly a level of management judgment that we use to ensure that we have an appropriate reserve under financial accounting standards. So that's essentially a quick sketch of the process that we use.\nDominick Gabriele: Excellent. Thanks so much for taking my questions. Have a good day.\nJohn Greene: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Mihir Bhatia with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi. This is Nate Rich [ph] on for Mihir Bhatia. Quick question for me. Are you seeing any changes to the credit quality for new applicants? I understand that you're tightening credit and underwriting. But just curious to see how those consumers are asking for loans now versus a year or two ago?\nRoger Hochschild: Yes. I mean it's a tricky question to answer, because it varies by channel. Obviously, we did quite a lot of pre-approved marketing. So we kind of set the criteria who applies and even within our non-pre-approved channels, we tend to be targeted. So I haven't seen, I would guess, a huge difference in terms of applicant profile, but our new account profile has tended to improve as we've tightened credit.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. And then as a quick follow-up, can you just talk about the performance? Like how are card loan business from like 2020 or 2022 performing versus the loans pre-pandemic?\nRoger Hochschild: Yes. I think in general, John mentioned, all of the vintages are performing as expected. And so total losses are still normalizing in line with what we forecast. So I would say continued strong performance across the board. And we haven't seen huge differences in behavior by vintage.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Mark DeVries with Barclays. Your line is open.\nMark DeVries: [indiscernible] \nRoger Hochschild: Hey, Mark, I think your line is open. Hey, Chelsea, we'll come back to Mark offline.\nOperator: Okay. Yes, sir. And as at this moment, there are no further questions in the queue. So I would like to turn it back over to management for any additional or closing remarks.\nEric Wasserstrom: Great. Well, if there are any additional questions, please reach out to us here at the IR team. And thanks very much. Have a great day.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude today's conference, and we appreciate your participation. You may disconnect at any time.",

            "name": "Roger Hochschild",
            "content": "Thanks, Eric, and thanks to our listeners for joining today's call. I'll begin by commenting on some of the recent events in the banking industry, review our highlights for the quarter, and then John will take you through the details of our first quarter results and our updated perspectives on 2023. This past quarter include the failure of two large banks, an event that catalyzed more widespread stress in some segments of the banking system and raised questions about the funding models and embedded portfolio losses of multiple banks. In contrast, our strong results underscore how our model, with its diversified funding, trusted brand, focus on prime consumer lending and conservative risk management positions us to succeed through a range of operating conditions. I want to call out a few results in particular that highlight our performance in this challenging environment. We reported first quarter net income of $1 billion or $3.58 per share. We had an all-time record quarter in terms of consumer deposit inflows, leveraging our award-winning digital experience and our leading customer service, and we're improving key elements of our guidance. As we look to the remainder of 2023, we may adjust our outlook as conditions evolve. We believe there is the potential for more stringent regulation. We believe we're well positioned for more rigorous regulatory capital and liquidity requirements given our strong internal standards, and we also continue to focus on enhancing our compliance management systems. This past quarter also included an important milestone with respect to our investment in human capital. We're honored to have been recognized as one of Fortune's 100 Best Companies to Work for in 2023. This is the first time we've earned this distinction and it builds upon recognition we received last year, ranking us among the best workplaces for parents and Fortune's best workplaces for women. In conclusion, we believe our earnings power, balance sheet strength, investments in people and advancements and capabilities support our strategy of becoming the leading consumer digital bank. I'll now turn the call over to John to review our results in more detail. Yeah. So I'll start the credit -- the competitive environment remains robust, right? Most of our key competitors in the card business are the larger money center banks, well capitalized, a lot of deposits. So card's tends to always be competitive. I think what you're seeing are the results of some of the changes we've made in credit policy. We've talked about tightening at the margin.

            "name": "John Greene",
            "content": "Thank you, Roger, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with our financial summary results on slide four. Our performance this quarter was characterized by strong revenue growth, continued credit normalization, a slight change to our outlook on the macroeconomic environment, resulting in a reserve increase, and a year-over-year increase in expenses. Let's review the details starting on slide five. Net interest income was up $653 million year-over-year or 26%. Our net interest margin continued to expand, benefiting from higher prime rates, partially offset by higher funding costs and increased promotional balances. NIM ended the quarter at 11.34%, up 49 basis points from the prior year and seven basis points sequentially. Receivable growth was driven by card, which increased 22% year-over-year, reflecting stable sales growth, modest new account growth, and payment rate moderation. Sales increased 9% in the period, slightly higher than the 8% growth we experienced in the prior quarter and down from the 16% growth we experienced in 2022. Sales growth so far in April is a modest 2.5% but this is coming off a very high comp of 22% in April of last year. New card account growth decelerated, reflecting the tightening of underwriting standards over the past several months, but grew by 3% from the prior year. The impact of slowing sales growth on receivable expansion was offset by decreases in payment rates. The card payment rate decreased 80 basis points in the quarter and is currently slightly over 200 basis points above the pre-pandemic level. Turning to our non-card products. Personal loans were up 21%, driven by higher originations over the past year and lower payment rates. We continue to experience strong consumer demand, while staying disciplined in our underwriting of this product. Organic student loan receivables grew by 3%, largely driven by a reduction in the payment rate. In terms of funding mix, consumer deposit balances were up 17% year-over-year and 7% sequentially. As Roger highlighted, we achieved record quarterly deposit growth. Deposits now make up 66% of our total funding mix with over 90% insured and we continue to target 70% to 80% deposit funding over the medium term. Outside of deposits, our funding channels remain open and at attractive costs. As an example, in early April, we issued $1.25 billion of card ABS fixed rate notes. This offering was upsized and our spread was nine basis points tighter than our November securitization. Additionally, we recently received a ratings upgrade by Moody's for our bank subsidiary and our banking holding company. Moody's cited a number of reasons to support this upgrade, including our prudent underwriting, conservative risk management, and resiliency in an economic downturn. Looking at other revenue on slide six. Non-interest income increased $198 million or 47%. This was partially due to a $162 million loss on our equity investments in the prior year quarter compared to an $18 million loss this quarter. Adjusting for these, our non-interest income was up 9%, primarily driven by the loan fee income and higher net discount and interchange revenue. Moving to expenses on slide seven. Total operating expenses were up $253 million, or 22% year-over-year and down 7% from the prior quarter. Compensation costs were up primarily due to increased headcount and wage inflation. Marketing expenses increased $49 million, or 26% as we continue to prudently invest for growth in our card and consumer banking products. Professional fees increased $55 million, or 31%, driven by investments in technology and increases and consulting activities that support our consumer compliance initiatives. Even with these increases, our efficiency ratio was 37%, and we generated about 700 basis points of operating leverage in the period. Moving to credit performance on Slide 8. Total net charge-offs were 2.72%, 111 basis points higher than the prior year and up 59 basis points from the prior quarter. In the card portfolio, the net charge-off rate of 3.1% was 126 basis points higher than the prior year and 73 basis points higher sequentially. Consistent with our commentary back in January, we expect the seasoning of new account vintages from the past two years and normalization of older vintages to a more typical loss rate. These trends remain consistent with our expectations. Turning to the discussion of our allowance on Slide 9. This quarter, we increased our allowance by $385 million, and our reserve rate increased by 25 basis points to 6.8%. This increase in reserve rate was driven by two factors. About 10 basis points reflects the runoff of seasonal transactor balances that we typically experienced in the fourth quarter. The remaining portion was largely driven by deterioration in our expectations of the macroeconomic environment. We increased our expectations for the 2023 year-end employment rate to the midpoint of our 4.5% to 5% range. This change reflects the potential for a reduction in lending impacting economic growth. We will continue to monitor the macroeconomic conditions and make adjustments to our expectations. Looking at Slide 10. Our common equity Tier 1 for the period was 12.3%, and we repurchased $1.2 billion of common stock during the quarter. The net unrealized loss on our AFS securities portfolio at the end of the quarter was $45 million. The impact on our regulatory capital, if our OCI opt-out were not allowed would have been about 20 basis points. Our capital position remains robust and well ahead of regulatory requirements. We continue to prioritize investment in strong organic growth and returning excess capital to shareholders. Included in our press release was the announcement that our Board of Directors approved a new $2.7 billion share repurchase program for the five quarters ending June 2024 and increased our common stock dividend by 17% to $0.70 per share. Including on Slide 11 with our outlook. Following the strong first quarter performance, we are raising our expectations for loan growth this year to be low to mid-teens. There is no change to our NIM forecast. We are maintaining our guidance for operating expenses to be less than 10%. However, we do see risk of upward pressure on this from collection and customer service expense related to growth in our lending and deposit accounts and professional service support and continued investment in technology. We are targeting our expected range of net charge-offs to 3.5% to 3.8% based on our current delinquencies and roll rates. This represents a reduction to the top end of the range by 10 basis points. Finally, as mentioned, our Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase authorization. We have returned substantial excess capital over the past two years, and we anticipate moving towards a more standard cadence of share buybacks over the second half of this year. To conclude, our first quarter results have given us significant momentum into this year, and we're well positioned to deliver on our financial objectives. With that, I'll turn the call back to our operator to open the line for Q&A. Yes. Thanks, Sanjay. Yes, I'll start with the reserve portion of the question and then swing over to the charge-off aspect. So as we mentioned, we ran a number of different scenarios. So we looked at unemployment ranges from 3.5% to north of 6%. We centered around a range between 4.5% and 5% for 2023 and then a slight improvement in 2024. And that was essentially the driver of the increase in the reserve rate outside of the 10 basis points I talked about in my prepared remarks related to kind of transactors running off as they typically do in the first quarter. So hopefully, that clarifies your question or clarify any questions you have on reserves. Related to charge-offs, so there's a couple of factors there. The first and what I would say is the most important is that the portfolio is performing almost exactly as we expected it to in terms of charge-off, roll rates and delinquencies. So we're generally pleased with that. As each month and quarter goes by, we have better line of sight to what we expect the total year to be. Our internal kind of roll rate models basically can take a very, very good look at six months forward, and then we move to more advanced models for anything beyond that. So as the first quarter passed through great line of sight through September. And then beyond September, we've relied on our analytical models. So that's essentially the reason why we're able to tighten the charge-off guidance from the upper end. And each quarter, we'll give an update on that certainly. Yeah. So as I said in the prepared remarks, we we've maintained a less than 10% guidance, although we're seeing a little bit of pressure on those lines I mentioned. So in terms of marketing, what we said in January was that we expected marketing to be up double digits. We still expect that to be the case despite the reduction in the rate of growth of new accounts, we are still seeing good opportunities to generate positive account growth with an appropriate risk tolerance. The other portion of that marketing spend will be to roll out the -- the cash back debit program, which we anticipate to be rolled out late in the second quarter, maybe early in the third quarter. So we're going to put some substantial dollars behind that to generate some activity, both new account generation as well as awareness of the product and the product features that we think will help build -- continue to build our strong deposit franchise. Yes, thanks for the question, Jeff. So as we look at loan growth for 2023, we feel very, very positive, and that's why we moved the loan growth range up a bit. So in terms of the overall lending environment and what would trigger additional cuts, it would be meaningful changes to the unemployment outlook, meaningful changes in the number of job openings and then further signs of stress within the consumers. So that would -- within the portfolio itself, it would be payment rates, timing of payments. We take a look at flow rates from one bucket to another. So those would all be certainly signs as well as kind of the broader indications of delinquency and the rate of charge-off on a vintage basis. But as we look at things right now, employment, I believe, will continue to be strong, right? So we have strong growth in the health care sector, manufacturing sector, defense, oil and gas, and onshoring of supply chain continues. So my sense is that we're not going to have any seismic changes to unemployment despite the fed tightening action. So that means that we'll look at -- continue to look at things around the margins and make good calls to ensure that the accounts we're putting on are profitable. And the accounts that are in the portfolio that we have early warning triggers, so that our customer service and collection folks can reach out to ensure that collections and cash flows remain strong. Hello. Jeff or operator? Is the line open? Okay. Yes. So why don't I -- I'll take that briefly. And Jeff or Betsy, we can follow up separately in the afternoon, if you like. So in terms of investing in technology. So there's three -- there's, I'll call it, three or four different strengths. The first is to ensure we have leading-edge capabilities, which would include machine learning, AI. Second is ensure that our core systems are robust and resilient. And third, around the network, making sure that our network continues to have leading edge or at a minimum market global capabilities. So, those are the tiers and we continue to invest in those aspects as well as technology to support our overall compliance management system as we talked about in the prepared remarks. So, overall, it's an area of investment. We're a digital institution. We need to continue to invest in technology to ensure that we keep capabilities, advancing. Yes, thanks Dominick. So, yes, we have a process that we take great pains to make sure there's no disconnects between our outlook on kind of charge-offs over, call it, a three-quarter or four-quarter period and the CECL reserves, which is life of loan losses, which would include charge-offs through the life of the relationship. And the modeling systems that we use are essentially the same. Same tools, same people kind of managing those and a bunch of work to ensure that the organization. So each of the functions, credit and risk management systems and finance and accounting are on the same page in terms of what we're trying to accomplish here. So there's no chance to disconnect here at Discover. I will say that the difference in terms of the tightening of our charge-off outlook in terms of updated guidance and what happened in the reserve has a couple of factors that are at play there. The first is, we're talking about a three-quarter period of forecasting on the charge-offs. And we gave a fairly wide range, which we intend to tighten as each quarter passes. On the reserves, we take a number of different factors, including the macro environment portfolio. And then there's certainly a level of management judgment that we use to ensure that we have an appropriate reserve under financial accounting standards. So that's essentially a quick sketch of the process that we use. Thank you."

By way of introduction, I'm Erin Stieber, Senior Vice President of Financial Planning and Analysis and Investor Relations. Eric Wasserstrom has decided to pursue an opportunity outside the company. We appreciate his contributions to the Investor Relations and Corporate Strategy programs over the past four years and wish him well. I'm excited for this new opportunity and look forward to getting to know all of you over the coming months. I'll begin by referencing Slides 2 and 3 of our earnings presentation, which you can find in the Financials section of our Investor Relations website, investorrelations.discover.com. Our discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. Please refer to our notices regarding forward-looking statements that appear in our third quarter 2024 earnings press release and presentation, as well as the risk factors detailed in our annual report and other filings with the SEC. Our call today will include remarks from our Interim CEO, Michael Shepherd, and John Greene, our Chief Financial Officer. There will be no question-and-answer session following today's remarks; however, the Investor Relations team will be available for any inquiries. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Michael.\nMichael Shepherd: Thank you, Erin. Good morning, and welcome to today's call. Discover's financial performance remained strong in the third quarter, and we continue to advance our critical strategic priorities of driving business results, strengthening risk management and compliance, and planning for the merger with Capital One. We've made significant progress on the execution of the sale of the private student loan portfolio, successfully completing the first of four closings. Additionally, earlier this month, we completed the sale of the second tranche. As we near the end of our student loan disposition journey, we look forward to realizing the benefits of a more focused business model. John will review the details of the sale a bit later in the call. Our risk management and compliance capabilities continue to advance. We are seeing improved results from new programs, which focus on reducing risk and preventing customer harm. Our organization is driven by our commitment to customers, communities and employees. And as part of our culture, we reinforce ethical decision making and customer service through strengthened governance and controls. Discover ranked #2 in customer satisfaction among U.S. credit card issuers by J.D. Power for the fifth consecutive year. We are glad to report that this marks an 18-year run of being ranked either first or second. We recently reached two important milestones in our community-based facilities strategy. First, we celebrated the grand opening of our Whitehall, Ohio customer care and community center, marking a significant investment in the region. Second, we achieved 1,000 active jobs in the Chatham neighborhood of Chicago, fulfilling our three-year commitment. We are proud to create valuable jobs and offer free access to state-of-the-art facilities in the communities where we operate. Our employees are a key reason for our success and our award-winning customer service. We are very pleased that employee engagement remains high, attrition is relatively low, and we continue to be recognized as a great place to work. Discover was ranked #16 by Fortune for Best Large Workplaces in Financial Services and Insurance, and was also recognized as a 2024 Best Place to Work for People with Disabilities. Shifting attention to our pending merger, Capital One continues to lead merger-related activities, with applications currently under regulatory review. Integration planning is advancing well. With that, I'll now ask John Greene to review our third quarter 2024 financial results.\nJohn Greene: Thank you, Michael, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with our summary financial results on Slide 5. In the quarter, we reported net income of $965 million, which was up 41% from the prior year. Financial performance was strong, driven by: revenue growth from modestly higher loan balances; net interest margin expansion; we recognized a gain from the first closing of the private student loan portfolio sale; and credit is performing in line with expectations with net charge-offs plateauing. Let's review the details beginning on Slide 6. Our net interest margin ended the quarter at 11.38%, up 43 basis points from the prior year and up 21 basis points sequentially. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, margin expansion was primarily driven by a lower card promotional balance mix. Card receivables increased 3% year-over-year due to a lower payment rate, partially offset by a decrease in sales volume. The payment rate declined around 100 basis points from last year, was stable versus the prior quarter and is approximately 70 basis points above pre-pandemic levels. Discover card sales were down 3% compared to the prior year. Sales were impacted by cautious consumer behavior and credit tightening actions, which began in 2022. We expect these dynamics to persist for the remainder of the year. Personal loans were up 9% from the prior year. We continue to see strong demand from consumers seeking debt consolidation. The average FICO for new personal loan accounts is above 750. Student loans were down 19% year-over-year as a result of the first student loan asset sale. We recognized a gain of $70 million in the quarter. As Michael mentioned, shortly after the quarter ended, we completed the sale of the second tranche. Approximately 55% of the portfolio has been sold to date. We expect to sell the remaining portions of the portfolio by mid-November. Average consumer deposits were up 11% year-over-year and 1% sequentially. We are managing deposit balances to meet our liquidity needs and we have benefited from the student loan sale. We anticipate a through-the-cycle beta of around 70%. Looking at other revenue on Slide 7. Non-interest income increased $76 million or 11%. Other income increased due to the gain from the loan sale. Loan fee revenue was up $20 million, driven by higher instances. Our rewards rate was 144 basis points in the period, an increase of 2 basis points versus the prior-year quarter and up 12 basis points sequentially. The increases were driven by changes in the promotional categories. During the third quarter of 2024, consumers enjoyed higher rewards with Grocery and Walmart spend earning 5%. Moving to expenses on Slide 8. Total operating expenses were up $238 million or 16% year-over-year. Looking at our major expense categories, compensation costs increased $128 million or 22%, primarily due to higher wage rates and employee retention awards. Information processing increased as a result of technology investment and accelerated student loan software depreciation. And professional fees were up $42 million or 15%, driven by higher recovery fees and merger and integration cost. We recognized $43 million of merger and integration planning cost in the quarter, $65 million year-to-date, and anticipate about $125 million for the full year 2024, spread across multiple expense categories. We expect total risk management and compliance expense of approximately $550 million in 2024, excluding card misclassification costs. Moving to credit performance on Slide 9. Total net charge-offs were 4.86%, 134 basis points higher than the prior year and up 3 basis points from the prior quarter. Adjusting for the impact of reclassifying private student loans to held-for-sale, the total net charge-off rate would have declined 20 basis points. In card, net charge-offs declined 27 basis points from the prior quarter, outperforming seasonality. 30-plus-day delinquency formation increased in line with seasonal trends. The 2023 card vintage continues to perform in line with the 2022 vintage and remains highly profitable. An early look at the 2024 vintage suggests improvements compared to 2022 and 2023. Personal loan net charge-offs and delinquencies ticked up modestly, but are well within historical norms and vintages are meeting profitability targets. We continue to see a stable yet cautious consumer. The labor markets remain strong and wages are growing. However, households are contending with inflation and the impacts on everyday living expenses. Spend per card member is returning to a more normal level. Slower, stable spending indicates that households have adjusted spending patterns to manage their budgets, which is beneficial from a credit standpoint. Turning to the allowance for credit losses on Slide 10. Our credit reserve balance increased $31 million from the prior quarter as a result of loan growth. The reserve rate was 7.18%, down 4 basis points from the prior quarter, driven by our credit performance and modest improvements in the forecast for household net worth and debt service burden. Our economic outlook assumes year-end 2024 unemployment of 4.4%, with peak unemployment at 4.6%, and GDP in the 1% to 3% range. Looking at Slide 11, our common equity tier 1 ratio for the period was 12.7%, up 80 basis points, supported by core earnings and the student loan sale. We declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.70 per share of common stock. Before we discuss our revised view of 2024, I would like to provide a brief regulatory update. As part of its review of the joint proxy statement and prospectus, the staff of the SEC has indicated that they disagree with certain aspects of Discover's accounting approach for the card misclassification matter. We are working diligently to resolve their comments, which largely focus on the allocation of previously incurred card misclassification charges between revenue and expense. We do not anticipate resolution of this matter to have an impact to cumulative historical earnings, capital or our counterparty restitution plan liability. Concluding on Slide 12, we have revised our 2024 outlook to reflect our latest view. We are updating our loan growth expectations to down low- to mid-single-digits. This change is driven by a higher-than-anticipated payment rate and slightly lower card sales. Excluding the student loan sale, loans are estimated to grow low-single-digits. We are tightening our net interest margin range to 11.2% to 11.4%. Our operating expense guidance is unchanged. We are tightening our range of net charge-offs to 4.9% to 5%, reflecting our improved credit performance. Our capital management expectations have not changed. In summary, we continue to deliver strong financial results, prudently manage our business, and prepare for our merger with Capital One. This concludes our remarks. I'll turn the call back over to the operator.\nOperator: Thank you. Today's call has ended. The Discover Investor Relations team will be available for your questions. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect.\nQ - :",

Good morning, and welcome to our guests who have joined today's call. Discover's second quarter operating performance was very good, and we advanced several strategic priorities. Let me highlight a few of these accomplishments. On July 17, we entered into an agreement to sell our private student loan portfolio to affiliates and limited partners of Carlyle and KKR. Firstmark, a division of Nelnet will assume responsibility for servicing the portfolio upon sale. This agreement represents an important milestone in our journey to simplify our operations and business mix. The completion of the sale also has financial implications, which John Greene will detail in a few moments. As we continue to resolve past issues and strengthen our risk management and compliance posture, we have entered into a settlement agreement to resolve the merchant class actions associated with the card misclassification litigation, subject to court approval. The decision to settle was based upon our internal reviews, extensive dialogue with key constituencies, including merchants and regulators and our pending merger with Capital One. The settlement agreement would resolve claims by parties affected by the card misclassification, including merchants, acquirers and intermediaries. Our current remediation reserve is sufficient to cover the expenses under the terms of the settlement agreement. Our results also benefited from a litigation settlement in our Payment Services segment, where Discover was the plaintiff. We are happy to have this matter resolved and are satisfied with the favorable financial outcome. Finally, turning to our pending merger with Capital One. Capital One continues to lead the integration planning process, and the teams are working well together on integration planning and regulatory applications. Upcoming merger-related milestones include a virtual public hearing hosted by the Federal Reserve and the OCC, the completion of the written comment period, an in-person public hearing with the Delaware State Bank Commissioner and the filing of the definitive merger proxy. We expect shareholder votes to occur this fall. We are encouraged by how the merger planning and application processes are progressing and continue to believe that the strategic rationale, operating scale and economics of the combined company are compelling. With that, I'll now ask John Greene to review our second quarter 2024 financial results.\nJohn Greene: Thank you, Michael, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with our summary financial results on Slide 5. In the quarter, we reported net income of $1.5 billion, which was up 70% from the prior year quarter. Our fundamental performance in the period was driven by revenue expansion from loan growth, higher net interest margin and non-interest revenue growth. Credit continues to perform in line with expectations, supporting our view that losses are near peak and will plateau during the second half of 2024. There are several unusual items which impacted the quarter. These included a $869 million student loan reserve release, a gain of $26 million from the sale of our Lake Park facility. And largely offsetting one another were the favorable litigation settlement and a charge for expected regulatory penalties related to the card misclassification matter. Excluding unusual items, we would have reported net income of approximately $915 million and EPS of about $3.63 per share. Let's review the details beginning on Slide 6. Our net interest margin ended the quarter at 11.17%, up 11 basis points from the prior year and up 14 basis points sequentially. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, margin expansion was primarily driven by a lower card promotional balance mix. As anticipated, receivable growth continues to normalize from its early 2023 peak. Card receivables increased 7% year-over-year due to a lower payment rate and a smaller contribution from new accounts. The payment rate declined about 130 basis points compared to last year and is now about 90 basis points above 2019 levels. Discover card sales were down 3% compared to the prior year, spending at restaurants, which is a large category for sales volume declined sequentially as a result of being included in the 5% promotion during the first quarter. Accounting for the influence of promotional categories, sales trends are relatively stable. We continue to see a cautious consumer, evidenced by less card member spend with lower income households being most affected. Personal loans were up 13% from the prior year period. In response to market conditions, we prudently tightened underwriting over the past year, which has served to modestly reduced originations. Student loans were down 1% year-over-year. As Michael mentioned, we have entered into an agreement to sell our student loan portfolio. We expect the transaction to be completed in four tranches by the end of 2024. The purchase price has added a premium to the principal balance and is based on a formula that varies depending on the closing timing, interest rates and other factors. In association with this development, student loans are now accounted for as held for sale. The two most notable impacts to the financial statements are that we will no longer maintain a credit reserve for student loans and future student loan net charge-offs will be recognized through operating expense rather than credit losses. Average consumer deposits were up 15% year-over-year and 1% sequentially. Deposit balances are being managed in relation to our liquidity needs, which will benefit from the student loan sale. Our disciplined approach to deposit pricing has led to a modest reduction in average deposit rates in the second quarter, consistent with our practice of leading the industry on pricing in down parts of the cycle. Looking at other revenue on Slide 7. Non-interest income increased $313 million or 45%. Discount and interchange revenue was up $67 million as a result of lower rewards cost. Our rewards rate was 132 basis points in the period, a decrease of 10 basis points versus the prior year quarter. The decline reflects lower cash back match. Other income increased due to unusual items, including the litigation settlement and the facility sale. On an adjusted basis, non-interest revenue grew 14%. Moving to expenses on Slide 8. Total operating expenses were up $325 million or 23% year-over-year. The most significant driver of this increase was a charge for expected regulatory penalties related to the card misclassification issue. It is important to note that actual penalties imposed are subject to further discussions and may be more or less than this amount. Adjusting for this charge, our expenses would have increased by 9% year-over-year. Looking at our major expense categories. Compensation costs increased $70 million or 12%, primarily due to an increase in business technology resources. Professional fees were up $80 million or 37%, driven by higher recovery fees and investments in compliance and risk management. Our expectation for compliance and risk management expenses for the full year remains in the $500 million range with an upside bias. This figure excludes cards misclassification related costs. Moving to credit performance on Slide 9. Total net charge-offs were 4.83%, 161 basis points higher than the prior year and down 9 basis points from the prior quarter. In card, delinquency formation improvement continued. The 30-plus day delinquency rate was down 14 basis points versus the prior quarter. From a vintage perspective, our 2023 card vintage continues to perform in line with our 2022 vintage. As we look into the second half of the year, we expect there could be some variability in monthly card losses from both seasonality and various credit management actions we've taken. This has not changed our broader outlook for losses to generally peak and plateau this year. Turning to the allowance for credit losses on Slide 10. Our credit reserve balances declined $777 million from the prior quarter, reflecting the student loan reserve release, partially offset by a $92 million reserve build primarily to support loan growth. Our reserve rate was just over 7.2%, largely unchanged after adjusting for student loans. Looking at Slide 11. Our common equity Tier 1 for the period was 11.9%, up 100 basis points, bolstered by core earnings generation and the reserve release. We declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.70 per share of common stock. Concluding on Slide 12. We have revised our 2024 outlook and having included the impacts of the pending student loan sale. We are updating our loan growth expectations to be down low single digits, reflecting the roughly $10 billion asset sale. Absent this, year-over-year loan growth would be consistent with our prior view. We are increasing our net interest margin range to 11.1% to 11.4%. This change was driven by two factors. We now anticipate higher card yields reflecting a lower promotional balance mix and the student loan sale, which increases NIM by about 10 basis points. Our operating expense guidance is unchanged, notwithstanding the inclusion of the student loan net charge-offs in this line item. Our base case for net charge-offs remains at the low end of the 4.9% to 5.2% range. This includes the 10-basis points impact from student loans. And finally, our capital management expectations have not changed. To summarize, we continue to generate solid financial results, remain steadfast in our efforts to resolve compliance matters and look forward to consummating our planned merger. This concludes our remarks. I'll turn the call back over to the operator.\nOperator:",

Excluding unusual items, we would have reported net income of approximately $915 million and EPS of about $3.63 per share. Let's review the details beginning on Slide 6. Our net interest margin ended the quarter at 11.17%, up 11 basis points from the prior year and up 14 basis points sequentially. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, margin expansion was primarily driven by a lower card promotional balance mix. As anticipated, receivable growth continues to normalize from its early 2023 peak. Card receivables increased 7% year-over-year due to a lower payment rate and a smaller contribution from new accounts. The payment rate declined about 130 basis points compared to last year and is now about 90 basis points above 2019 levels. Discover card sales were down 3% compared to the prior year, spending at restaurants, which is a large category for sales volume declined sequentially as a result of being included in the 5% promotion during the first quarter. Accounting for the influence of promotional categories, sales trends are relatively stable. We continue to see a cautious consumer, evidenced by less card member spend with lower income households being most affected. Personal loans were up 13% from the prior year period. In response to market conditions, we prudently tightened underwriting over the past year, which has served to modestly reduced originations. Student loans were down 1% year-over-year. As Michael mentioned, we have entered into an agreement to sell our student loan portfolio. We expect the transaction to be completed in four tranches by the end of 2024. The purchase price has added a premium to the principal balance and is based on a formula that varies depending on the closing timing, interest rates and other factors. In association with this development, student loans are now accounted for as held for sale. The two most notable impacts to the financial statements are that we will no longer maintain a credit reserve for student loans and future student loan net charge-offs will be recognized through operating expense rather than credit losses. Average consumer deposits were up 15% year-over-year and 1% sequentially. Deposit balances are being managed in relation to our liquidity needs, which will benefit from the student loan sale. Our disciplined approach to deposit pricing has led to a modest reduction in average deposit rates in the second quarter, consistent with our practice of leading the industry on pricing in down parts of the cycle. Looking at other revenue on Slide 7. Non-interest income increased $313 million or 45%. Discount and interchange revenue was up $67 million as a result of lower rewards cost. Our rewards rate was 132 basis points in the period, a decrease of 10 basis points versus the prior year quarter. The decline reflects lower cash back match. Other income increased due to unusual items, including the litigation settlement and the facility sale. On an adjusted basis, non-interest revenue grew 14%. Moving to expenses on Slide 8. Total operating expenses were up $325 million or 23% year-over-year. The most significant driver of this increase was a charge for expected regulatory penalties related to the card misclassification issue. It is important to note that actual penalties imposed are subject to further discussions and may be more or less than this amount. Adjusting for this charge, our expenses would have increased by 9% year-over-year. Looking at our major expense categories. Compensation costs increased $70 million or 12%, primarily due to an increase in business technology resources. Professional fees were up $80 million or 37%, driven by higher recovery fees and investments in compliance and risk management. Our expectation for compliance and risk management expenses for the full year remains in the $500 million range with an upside bias. This figure excludes cards misclassification related costs. Moving to credit performance on Slide 9. Total net charge-offs were 4.83%, 161 basis points higher than the prior year and down 9 basis points from the prior quarter. In card, delinquency formation improvement continued. The 30-plus day delinquency rate was down 14 basis points versus the prior quarter. From a vintage perspective, our 2023 card vintage continues to perform in line with our 2022 vintage. As we look into the second half of the year, we expect there could be some variability in monthly card losses from both seasonality and various credit management actions we've taken. This has not changed our broader outlook for losses to generally peak and plateau this year. Turning to the allowance for credit losses on Slide 10. Our credit reserve balances declined $777 million from the prior quarter, reflecting the student loan reserve release, partially offset by a $92 million reserve build primarily to support loan growth. Our reserve rate was just over 7.2%, largely unchanged after adjusting for student loans. Looking at Slide 11. Our common equity Tier 1 for the period was 11.9%, up 100 basis points, bolstered by core earnings generation and the reserve release. We declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.70 per share of common stock. Concluding on Slide 12. We have revised our 2024 outlook and having included the impacts of the pending student loan sale. We are updating our loan growth expectations to be down low single digits, reflecting the roughly $10 billion asset sale. Absent this, year-over-year loan growth would be consistent with our prior view. We are increasing our net interest margin range to 11.1% to 11.4%. This change was driven by two factors. We now anticipate higher card yields reflecting a lower promotional balance mix and the student loan sale, which increases NIM by about 10 basis points. Our operating expense guidance is unchanged, notwithstanding the inclusion of the student loan net charge-offs in this line item. Our base case for net charge-offs remains at the low end of the 4.9% to 5.2% range. This includes the 10-basis points impact from student loans. And finally, our capital management expectations have not changed. To summarize, we continue to generate solid financial results, remain steadfast in our efforts to resolve compliance matters and look forward to consummating our planned merger. This concludes our remarks. I'll turn the call back over to the operator."

            "content": "Thank you, Eric. Good morning, and welcome to our guests who have joined today's call. Discover's second quarter operating performance was very good, and we advanced several strategic priorities. Let me highlight a few of these accomplishments. On July 17, we entered into an agreement to sell our private student loan portfolio to affiliates and limited partners of Carlyle and KKR. Firstmark, a division of Nelnet will assume responsibility for servicing the portfolio upon sale. This agreement represents an important milestone in our journey to simplify our operations and business mix. The completion of the sale also has financial implications, which John Greene will detail in a few moments. As we continue to resolve past issues and strengthen our risk management and compliance posture, we have entered into a settlement agreement to resolve the merchant class actions associated with the card misclassification litigation, subject to court approval. The decision to settle was based upon our internal reviews, extensive dialogue with key constituencies, including merchants and regulators and our pending merger with Capital One. The settlement agreement would resolve claims by parties affected by the card misclassification, including merchants, acquirers and intermediaries. Our current remediation reserve is sufficient to cover the expenses under the terms of the settlement agreement. Our results also benefited from a litigation settlement in our Payment Services segment, where Discover was the plaintiff. We are happy to have this matter resolved and are satisfied with the favorable financial outcome. Finally, turning to our pending merger with Capital One. Capital One continues to lead the integration planning process, and the teams are working well together on integration planning and regulatory applications. Upcoming merger-related milestones include a virtual public hearing hosted by the Federal Reserve and the OCC, the completion of the written comment period, an in-person public hearing with the Delaware State Bank Commissioner and the filing of the definitive merger proxy. We expect shareholder votes to occur this fall. We are encouraged by how the merger planning and application processes are progressing and continue to believe that the strategic rationale, operating scale and economics of the combined company are compelling. With that, I'll now ask John Greene to review our second quarter 2024 financial results."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the First Quarter 2024 Discover Financial Services Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note, there will be no question-and-answer period after this morning's prepared remarks. After the call ends, questions should be directed to the Discover Investor Relations team. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Mr. Eric Wasserstrom, Senior Vice President of Corporate Strategy and Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nEric Wasserstrom: Thank you, and welcome to this morning's call. I'll begin by referencing Slides 2 and 3 of our earnings presentation, which you can find in the Financial section of our Investor Relations website investorrelations.discover.com. Our discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. Please refer to our notices regarding forward-looking statements that appear in our first quarter 2024 earnings press release and presentation as well as the risk factors detailed in our annual report and other filings with the SEC. Our call today will include remarks from our Interim CEO, Michael Shepherd; and John Greene, our Chief Financial Officer. There will be no question-and-answer session following today's remarks. However, the Investor Relations team will be available for any inquiries. It's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Michael.\nMichael Shepherd: Thank you, Eric, and good morning, everyone. Thank you all for joining today's call. I'd like to begin the call with a few words of introduction. I joined Discover's Board in August of 2023 after a career in the public and private sectors, more than 30 years of which were in the financial services industry. Among other roles, I served as Senior Deputy Controller of the Currency earlier in my career. Most relevant to my current position, I was Chairman and CEO of BancWest Corporation and Bank of the West. As Chairman of Bank of the West, I helped oversee its acquisition and integration into the Bank of Montreal in 2023. I hope my experience will help me serve our shareholders customers and employees as an effective leader during this important period. John Greene will discuss the results of the first quarter in greater detail, but let me highlight a few aspects of our financial performance. Discover's operating performance remained solid with increased revenues in the period, driven by good loan growth, largely reflecting payment rate normalization and a resilient net interest margin. We are seeing receivables expansion while remaining prudent in our underwriting and disciplined in customer acquisition. Credit continues to perform in line with our expectations and delinquency formation has stabilized as we had anticipated. Importantly, we continue to strengthen our risk management and compliance programs where we are investing in meaningful resources. In the first quarter, following continuing internal reviews, and after extensive discussions with several constituencies, including merchants and regulators, Discover decided to significantly increase our liability for the card misclassification issue. We believe that taking this action will advance the resolution of these issues. There's been a lot of change at Discover over the last few months and I thought it might be helpful to emphasize our framework for decision-making. Our goals are to maximize shareholder value by executing on our risk management and compliance priorities, sustaining our commitment to outstanding customer service and seeing that the company remains well positioned to drive long-term value creation. As the interim CEO of Discover, I'm committed to these objectives, which will improve our company and allow us to make the strongest contribution to the combined Capital One. The Capital One team is leading the integration planning process and we look forward to partnering with our colleagues in support of our shared objectives. The process has achieved the first important milestone, the submission of the merger applications to the Federal Reserve and the OCC. We continue to believe that the strategic rationale, operating scale and economics of the combined company are compelling. The merger will advance the company's shared mission to help our customers meet their financial goals support our commitments to our communities and make the combined company a well-positioned bank and a competitive payments network of the future. Finally, I'd like to thank Michael Rhodes for his leadership through an important phase. His new position allows him to fulfill his career goal of leading a public company and my colleagues and I wish him well. With that, I'll now ask John Greene to review our first quarter 2024 financial results.\nJohn Greene: Thank you, Michael, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with our summary financial results on Slide 5. In the quarter, we reported net income of $308 million, which was down 68% from the prior year quarter. Impacting our operating results was a $799 million increase to our reserve for remediation related to the card misclassification issue. The decision to increase the reserve was based upon, among other factors, the company's experience to date with remediation efforts, regulatory dialogue and our pending merger with Capital One. As Michael indicated, we believe this action is aligned with our compliance and risk management objectives and will significantly help advance the resolution of this issue. Our core financial performance remains strong. Key highlights for the quarter include double-digit revenue expansion from loan growth, a resilient net interest margin strong consumer deposit growth and credit performance consistent with our view that losses will peak and plateau in mid to late 2024. Excluding the card misclassification remediation reserve increase, we would have reported net income of approximately $915 million, EPS of about $3.50 per share and an efficiency ratio under 36%. These figures indicate a strong start to 2024. Let us review the details beginning on Slide 6. Our net interest margin ended the quarter at 11.03%, down 31 basis points from the prior year and up 5 basis points sequentially. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, expanding loan yields from a lower card promotional balance mix and payment rate moderation were partially offset by higher net funding costs. Receivable growth is slowing from its peak in the first quarter of 2023, but continues to be strong. Card receivables increased 11% year-over-year due to a lower payment rate and contribution from prior year new account growth. The payment rate declined about 20 basis points from the sequential quarter and is now about 70 basis points above 2019 levels. Discover card sales were down 1% compared to the prior year quarter. Sales slowed across categories with the largest decline occurring in the everyday category, which includes supermarkets, gas and wholesale clubs. While we continue to add new accounts, in general, we are seeing card members spend less, particularly among lower-income households which are most impacted by the cumulative effects of inflation. Based on trends in the period, we expect sales to be flat to slightly negative this year. Personal loans were up 21%, driven by continued strength in originations and lower payment rates versus the prior year. We are seeing strong uptake on our offering as higher interest rates in card can make debt consolidation more appealing for Summit consumers. Approximately 50% of our first quarter originations and personal loans were utilized for debt consolidation with disbursements primarily made directly to creditors. Student loans were flat year-over-year. As previously announced, we stopped accepting applications for new student loans on February 1. We formally launched the sales process in mid-March and several thousand potential buyers have provided an initial indication of interest. We continue to anticipate strong demand and still target a closing date late in the third quarter or fourth quarter. Average deposits were up 18% year-over-year and 4% sequentially. Our direct-to-consumer balances grew $3 billion in the period. We have started to decrease pricing on our deposit products ahead of any potential moves in reference rates. This is consistent with our practice of leading the industry on pricing in the down part of the cycle and this action contributed to our strong NIM performance in the quarter. Looking at other revenue on Slide 7. Noninterest income increased $113 million or 19%. This was primarily driven by higher net discount and interchange revenue, an increase in loan fee income and higher transaction processing revenue from our PULSE business. PULSE continued to grow at a healthy clip as debit volume increased by $13.8 billion or 21% year-over-year. Our rewards rate was 139 basis points in the period, a decrease of 2 basis points versus the prior year quarter. The decline reflects lower cash back match from slowing new account growth and the active management of our 5% categories. Prior to reviewing expenses, I would like to briefly comment on the CFPB late fee proposal. We continue to closely monitor the legal process around the proposal. If the rule were to be implemented, on an annualized basis, we estimate a pretax reduction of around $600 million or approximately 4% of revenues. Moving to expenses on Slide 8. Total operating expenses were up $926 million or 67% year-over-year. As mentioned, the predominant driver of this growth was the increase to our remediation reserve. Absent this, our expenses would have increased 9% year-over-year. Looking at our major expense categories. Compensation costs increased $46 million or 7% due to an increase in business technology resources and severance related to organizational changes including the wind down of our student loan business. Professional fees were up $60 million or 26%, driven by continued investments in compliance and risk management initiatives higher recovery fees and merger-related expenses. Information processing increased due to technology investments. Our expectation for compliance and risk management expenses for the year excluding remediation-related costs, remains in the $500 million range with an upside bias. Moving to credit performance on Slide 9. Total net charge-offs were 4.92%, 220 basis points higher than the prior year and up 81 basis points from the prior quarter. In Card, as we anticipated, delinquency formation is improving as more recent vintages season. The 30-plus day delinquency rate was down 4 basis points versus the prior quarter. From a vintage perspective, our 2023 card vintage is performing relatively in line with our 2022 vintage. Both vintages remain profitable and above our return thresholds. This performance has been contemplated in our full year net charge-off guidance. We executed some incremental tightening during the first quarter, which will influence our new account growth for the year. Personal loan net charge-offs were 4.02%, 208 basis points higher than the prior year and up 63 basis points from the prior quarter. We expect losses in this product to trend higher in the near term before plateauing beginning late this year or into 2025. Turning to the allowance for credit losses on Slide 10. Our credit reserve balances declined $25 million from the prior quarter, and our reserve rate increased by 9 basis points to 7.32%. The reserve rate increase was primarily driven by the reduction of seasonal transactor balances in the quarter. Given our expectation for total company losses to peak and plateau in mid- to late 2024 and we believe the credit reserve rate is likely at or near peak levels, assuming a stable macroeconomic environment and no significant unexpected changes in portfolio performance. Looking at Slide 11. Our common equity Tier 1 for the period was 10.9%, down 40 basis points sequentially. The impacts from the increase in expenses in the CECL phase-in were offset by lower receivables and core earnings generation. We declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.70 per share of common stock. Concluding on Slide 12. We have made the following updates to our 2024 outlook. We are increasing our loan growth expectations to up low single digits. This primarily reflects our expectation of further decline in the payment rates, offsetting our view of flat to slightly negative sales growth this year and a modest contribution from new accounts. We are increasing our net interest margin range to 10.7% to 11%. This change was driven by 2 factors: first, the forward curve now reflects an expectation of 2 rate cuts this year versus our prior forecast of 4 cuts. And second, we have been proactive in lowering our deposit rates. Our cumulative deposit beta is now about 70%, and we think there will be further opportunities to manage our deposit costs over the course of this year. We still expect our core operating expenses to be up mid-single digits, excluding card misclassification related costs and merger expenses. Our core operating expense trends are in line with our expectations and we believe the actions we took in the first quarter have substantially de-risked the probability of further increases to the remediation reserve. We are tightening our net charge-off range to 4.9% to 5.2%, based largely on current delinquency trends. Our base case remains at the lower end of the range. Finally, given the merger agreement, we have suspended share repurchases through closing and agreed not to increase the dividend. To summarize, we continue to generate solid results and our financial performance underscores our steady stewardship of the organization as we move towards resolving compliance items and consummating our planned merger. This concludes our remarks. I'll turn the call back over to our operator.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's call. The Discover Investor Relations team will be available for questions. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect.\nEnd of Q&A:",

I joined Discover's Board in August of 2023 after a career in the public and private sectors, more than 30 years of which were in the financial services industry. Among other roles, I served as Senior Deputy Controller of the Currency earlier in my career. Most relevant to my current position, I was Chairman and CEO of BancWest Corporation and Bank of the West. As Chairman of Bank of the West, I helped oversee its acquisition and integration into the Bank of Montreal in 2023. I hope my experience will help me serve our shareholders customers and employees as an effective leader during this important period.

Importantly, we continue to strengthen our risk management and compliance programs where we are investing in meaningful resources.

Our goals are to maximize shareholder value by executing on our risk management and compliance priorities, sustaining our commitment to outstanding customer service and seeing that the company remains well positioned to drive long-term value creation. As the interim CEO of Discover, I'm committed to these objectives, which will improve our company and allow us to make the strongest contribution to the combined Capital One. The Capital One team is leading the integration planning process and we look forward to partnering with our colleagues in support of our shared objectives. The process has achieved the first important milestone, the submission of the merger applications to the Federal Reserve and the OCC. We continue to believe that the strategic rationale, operating scale and economics of the combined company are compelling. The merger will advance the company's shared mission to help our customers meet their financial goals support our commitments to our communities and make the combined company a well-positioned bank and a competitive payments network of the future.
