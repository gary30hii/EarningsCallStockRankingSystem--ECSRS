A discussion of some of the risks and uncertainties relating to our business is contained in our filings with the SEC and we refer you to these public filings. During this call we will discuss non-GAAP measures in talking about the company's performance and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are provided in our earnings press release and slides. This call is being broadcast live on the Pure Storage Investor Relations website and is being recorded for playback purposes. An archive of the webcast will be available on the IR website for at least 45 days and is the property of Pure Storage. With that I'll turn the call over to our CEO, Charlie Giancarlo.\nCharlie Giancarlo: Thank you Matt and good afternoon everyone. Thank you for joining us on today's earnings call. I am pleased with our Q4 performance resulting in record revenue and the largest bookings quarter in Pure's history. I'll share highlights from the year explain why Pure is best positioned to help enterprises navigate their digital transformation and share our excitement for the future. Kevan joining us for his first Pure earnings call will follow with a review of our financials and an outlook for next year.  At Accelerate last September we announced Pure strategy for our second decade. Our portfolio of products running our unified Purity software and all managed by our Pure one Cloud can now serve the majority of data workloads for our customers. Mission-critical production test dev analytics disaster recovery and backup and recovery in all environments on-premise in-cloud and hybrid. The Purity software platform brings performance simplicity and cloud era API automation to storage at any scale. We call this strategy the Modern Data Experience and we are succeeding by helping our customers transform their storage operations to a modern shared as a service model. I will share more on how Pure's technology is at the center of our customers' strategic initiatives.  Before I share our results and because it is on the minds of both our customers and investors I would like to spend a moment on the coronavirus outbreak. We sympathize with all of those directly affected by the virus and we commend everyone working so tirelessly to address it. We have taken active measures to ensure the safety of our employees and those of our supply chain partners. Based on what we know today we do not anticipate a significant impact to this quarter's supply and operations although the situation remains quite fluid. Pure has in place a multi-continent supply chain strategy to source components and assemble our products and we continue to monitor the developing situation diligently. Now to our results. I will share color from the full year and later Kevan will provide highlights from Q4. Fiscal '20 finished strong with total revenue of $1.64 billion growing 21% year-on-year while navigating through an unparalleled industry pricing decline. In Q4 we started to see a return to a more normalized pricing environment. Pure's continued differentiation is evidenced by our 70.5% non-GAAP full year gross margin. Non-GAAP operating profit was $56 million demonstrating yet another full year of profitability. We exited the year with over 1700 new customers bringing our total customer account to more than 7500 which now includes 44% of the Fortune 500.  Pure is delivering the Modern Data Experience through our portfolio solutions and services built around four key tenants: fast matters; cloud everywhere; simple is smart; and the subscription to innovation. These tenants drive our engineering innovation and resonate with customers because it aligns with their requirements for a cloud-like API-driven operations and performance across their infrastructure. It enables them to deliver a storage-as-a-service experience to meet the needs of their developers DevOps teams and modern applications. Pure's technology portfolio and continued pace of innovation are paying off with transformative products and solutions that delight our customers.  Pure enables customers to transform their storage operations from bespoke manually managed silos to a modern shared-as-a-service model delivering choice and flexibility in how storage is consumed and managed. A key hallmark in Pure strategy is our subscription services with Cloud Block Store Pure as-a-Service and our Evergreen business model. Cloud Block Store on AWS released in Q2 of last year is helping customers implement migration test dev and disaster recovery use cases for mission-critical applications. And Cloud Block Store is now in beta for Microsoft Azure. Pure also joined Google Cloud's Anthos Ready Storage Initiative for multi-cloud deployments earlier this month. We achieved the largest ever bookings of Pure as-a-Service in Q4 including wins at three major international banks. Pure as-a-Service allows customers to unify their storage procurement strategy to a consistent cloud model whether deployed on-premise in-cloud or in a hybrid environment so that they can focus on what matters driving business transformation. Pure provides a true hybrid utility model offering flexible storage consumption as a genuine hands-free opex service. Turning to our portfolio. Pure suite of products has never been more comprehensive. Today we announced the seventh generation of FlashArray further raising the bar on the product that continuously redefines modern storage. This new FlashArray//X delivers 25% higher performance for mission-critical applications with a fully end-to-end NVMe architecture across all models and supports advanced storage class memory. And like every generation of FlashArray the new FlashArray//X is available through our nondisruptive Evergreen subscription upgrade for existing customers. FlashArray//C introduced in Q3 of last year is the first and only all-flash product in the industry to bring flash performance to Tier two application economics. We are seeing phenomenal adoption of FlashArray//C and in its first two quarters has already become Pure's fastest growth product ever. Pure FlashBlade product has redefined what's possible with big fast data as customers look to create an all-flash data hub to consolidate their file and object data to power next generation analytics AI and container infrastructure. A particular area of strength is the massive growth of log analytics as customers use FlashBlade to solve cybersecurity fraud detection and IoT use cases in partnership with Splunk Elastic and Vertica. And rapid restore continues to be a popular use case for FlashBlade made better in Q4 with the introduction of FlashBlade safe mode a unique anti ransomware solution that has already helped several metropolitan area cities protect and recover from potential ransomware attacks.  Lastly we had our annual sales kickoff meeting in San Francisco just two weeks ago and the excitement from our team was extraordinary. On our decade anniversary last fall we announced our strategy to transform the current box-based enterprise storage environment to an integrated multi-cloud experience. In FY '21 and beyond we're committed to deliver on our Modern Data Experience and Pure as-a-Service strategies to accelerate our customers' digital transformation journeys. And with that I'll turn it over to Kevan.\nKevan Krysler: Thank you Charlie. We were pleased with our solid broad-based performance across all key financial metrics this quarter. Total revenue during Q4 was $492 million growing 17% year-over-year. Product revenue was $377 million growing 11% year-over-year and subscription services revenue was $116 million growing 41% year-over-year which includes revenues from our Evergreen subscriptions Pure as-a-Service and Cloud Block Store. Total revenue in the United States in Q4 was $345 million growing at 15% year-over-year and total international revenue in Q4 was $147 million growing 21% year-over-year. Non-GAAP gross margins in the quarter for product and subscription services continue to be strong and differentiates us in the market. Total non-GAAP gross margin in Q4 was 72.1% increasing 4.5 basis points year-over-year. Non-GAAP product gross margin in Q4 was 73.3% increasing 5.5 basis points year-over-year. And non-GAAP subscription services margin in Q4 was 68.1% increasing 1.3 basis points year-over-year. Total non-GAAP operating profit during Q4 was $61 million increasing $30 million year-over-year. Non-GAAP net income during Q4 was $64 million and non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.23 per share. Non-GAAP net income in Q4 at the prior year was $37 million and non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.14 per share. Weighted average shares used for the non-GAAP earnings per share calculation was $277 million in Q4 and $264 million in Q4 of the prior year. Operating cash flow for fiscal 2020 was $190 million and was $165 million in fiscal 2019. Operating cash flow in Q4 was $70 million and was $81 million in Q4 of the prior year. Free cash flow for fiscal 2020 was $102 million and $64 million in fiscal 2019. Free cash flow was $56 million in Q4 and was $51 million in Q4 of the prior year. Total cash and cash investments at the end of the year was $1.3 billion compared to $1.2 billion at the end of the prior year. Total deferred revenue at the end of the year was $697 million increasing from $536 million at the end of the prior year. During Q4 we repurchased shares in the open market totaling $15 million and have approximately $135 million remaining in our share repurchase authorization. Total headcount at the end of the year was approximately 3400 employees and was approximately 2900 employees at the end of the prior year.  As Charlie mentioned in his prepared remarks we are actively monitoring the coronavirus developments. And although we are not seeing specific impacts on the business currently the situation is fluid and unpredictable. Potential adverse effects to our business have not been incorporated into our annual guide or our Q1 guide. With the strong performance and growth outlook of our multiple subscription service offerings we expect that our bookings growth will begin to outpace revenue growth next year. Revenue derived from our subscription service offerings is recognized over time and is recurring. As such we leave a useful metric to evaluate and provide more transparency to the growth of our business next year is the annual growth rate of total bookings which we expect to be approximately 20%. We will update our annual guidance including total bookings growth for the full year at the beginning of each fiscal year. We are focused on growing our highly differentiated Evergreen Pure as-a-Service and Cloud Block Store subscription services. Given that these subscription offerings provide recurring revenue total revenue next year is expected to be approximately $1.9 billion growing 16% year-over-year. Non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be approximately 69.5% and non-GAAP operating income is expected to be approximately $60 million for the fiscal year. Moving to our Q1 guidance. Total revenue for Q1 is expected to be approximately $365 million growing 12% year-over-year.  As you might recall last year's Q1 revenue benefited from a shipping issue during Q4 2019. When normalizing for this shipping issue our guided Q1 revenue growth rate would be four basis points higher. Non-GAAP gross margins in Q1 are expected to be approximately 69.5% and non-GAAP operating loss in Q1 is expected to be approximately $40 million. I am very excited to have joined the team at Pure Storage and the opportunity ahead. We see strong momentum in our portfolio including our innovative subscription service offerings. That will continue to position us well in the market and with our customers. With that we will now open the call for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Aaron Rakers from Wells Fargo.\nAaron Rakers : Yeah, thanks, guys for taking a question. If you can I think you mentioned during the prepared remarks that you're starting to see a more normalized pricing environment in Flash. Can you can you just help us understand how we should think about that dynamic to the model? And then just curious of what you saw pricing wise this last quarter on a quarter-over-quarter basis? And what underpins your assumption for the current quarter guidance?\nCharlie Giancarlo: Right. Well as you know from prior quarters we had a early in the early parts of the year just saw breathtaking price declines in the market that were created through by a free fall of NAND pricing earlier in the year. Now NAND prices do fall every year which is generally good for us because it creates elasticity in the market. It allows us to go after more magnetic storage which we're very excited about. But when it drops very suddenly then elasticity doesn't have time to catch up. We saw in Q4 is what we are used to seeing generally year in and year out in normal years. And we know that the commodity prices are have been have stabilized for some time are projected to go up next year. And so that presages to us a normal pricing environment and one in which we can hopefully regain even better growth initiative and certainly allow us to continue to grow ahead of the industry.\nKevan Krysler: And Aaron this is Kevan. When you think about specifically for the annual guide and Q1 guide in this concept of a normalized pricing environment that really contemplates both a volume expansion as well as what we would consider normalized declines in ASPs. And again that's what we've seen outside of the dynamic that we saw this past year.\nAaron Rakers : Okay. And then just as a quick follow-up and maybe somewhat tied to that. You guys continue to report a really remarkably strong gross margin for the business both product and overall. How do you guys think about using maybe gross margin more actively to go after more velocity in the business? Is that something that as we look at this next forward fiscal year given the guidance that you guys are starting to invoke a little bit more activity on that front? Or what's embedded in the gross margin outlook going forward?\nCharlie Giancarlo: As you know we can use gross margin in two ways: one is to fund the business; and the other of course is to fund pricing declines compared to competitors. Our view is that and we look at this literally every week. And our belief is that in fact it's the software value that we provide that is having our customers paying 10% to 20% premium for our product versus our competition. And we don't really believe that we ever lose a deal based on price. I mean we do lose deals. And when we do the price it might be lower than ours but generally it's for other reasons. And so at the minute we feel like we could win we would certainly trade-off price for more wins but we don't believe that that's what we're seeing right now. We continue to believe that expansion of the sales force more feet on the street calling on more customers on more opportunities is the right way to use our margin.\nAaron Rakers : Thank you.\nCharlie Giancarlo: Thanks, Aaron Next question.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Alex Kurtz from KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nAlex Kurtz : Thanks guys for for taking the question. You know, Charlie the last couple of quarters with the pricing environment I remember having a discussion with you about when the market stabilize that there would be some revenue upside as you kind of see the NAND price environment improve right because at some level it's a little bit of a pass-through impacting both negatively and positively. So as you look at the full year guide is that contemplated at all as far as capturing some revenue upside from this?\nCharlie Giancarlo: We definitely are looking at this year as a much more normal pricing environment. And that allows us to forecast a 20% growth year compared to a flat industry. We're certainly not we're looking at a roughly a flat macro year-to-year. So we're not projecting upside or downside on in the overall industry overall. We believe that in an overall environment in which pricing holds that we're going to have well above competitive performance in terms of growth.\nKevan Krysler: And let me just add on to that if I could Alex and Charlie. Look we're in terms of our business growth next year as Charlie said we're running at 20% and that's why we provided that bookings metric for the Alex for this year in terms of how we're looking at it. And a couple of dynamics that I would just highlight. One is again the subscription services that we're seeing in terms of momentum which really is creating this dynamic of a lag between bookings and revenue that we'll see next year. But we also want to be prudent given the current environment as we're clearly seeing some headwinds on the macro side and want to make sure we're contemplating that. Now that would exclude coronavirus. But outside of that we're still seeing some headwinds.\nAlex Kurtz : Just one question quickly for you Kevan. Given your time at Vmware a company that could obviously distribute software at scale globally. What do you think about as far as bringing best practices from that platform to Pure? And kind of where do you see opportunities to expand Evergreen and Cloud Block Store? What's your initial thoughts so far?\nKevan Krysler: Yes. Yes let me I'll share some initial thoughts in terms of my view but I would also probably comment from an observation standpoint that the company is doing a really nice job. In fact best practice in terms of software development the amount of investment we have in our R&D group on software. And clearly that's what's already differentiating this company from its competitors. And so from there we'll look at different models to expand on and that's why we're really focusing on our subscription services including Pure as-a-Service and Cloud Block Store.\nCharlie Giancarlo: Yes. And Alex you actually know this well. 95% of our developers are software developers. So we're a software company that in started out by shrink wrapping it in iron and now more significantly we have products such as Cloud Block Store which is 100% of our Purity software operating directly on top of AWS and now in beta on Azure. And it's a unique and unified software offering operating across all of our products and multi-cloud multi-platform. And pretty soon both with respect to FlashArray multi-tier and multi-protocol. So we think this is a real big differentiator. Most of our competitors have multiple products to deal with different workloads and environments. We're going to be able to satisfy it with one software base all managed by a single management system in Pure one So we think that it's such a pleasure to have Kevan on board to help us because of course it does mean transitions in the way that we look at recognizing revenue at managing subscription business managing software business. So it's great to have a skill set on board.\nKevan Krysler: Thanks, Alex. Next question, please.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Rod Hall from Goldman Sachs.\nBala Reddy: This is Bala Reddy on for Rod. If I look at the full year fiscal year '21 revenue guidance of $1.9 billion the implied revenue growth is 16% year-over-year. However if I compare this $1.9 billion guidance to the original fiscal '20 year-on-year guidance that you guys gave in year back the hypothetical implied growth rate is only 7%. You mentioned fastest subscription business but outside of that just wondering if anything has changed fundamentally in the all-flash array market for the past year? Is there an element of conservativeness in the guide as well? I have a follow up.\nCharlie Giancarlo: Well I can't speak to the 7%. I don't understand that calculation. I mean it is we in our prepared remarks identified the revenue growth is 16% but we do believe that increasing amounts of our bookings as subscription revenue is going to of course cause bookings to increase at a faster rate overall than revenue and that's what we meant to start to identify for our investors.\nBala Reddy: All right. I have a question on operating expense as well. So the implied opex guidance if my math is right it looks like it's growing at roughly the same rate as revenues around about like 15% 16%. Can you give some color on why you're not seeing the benefits of operating leverage as the revenue scale increases?\nKevan Krysler: Yes. I think the first thing I would highlight is that we're expecting our growth of operating expenses to actually be less than our revenue growth which would be different than what we saw this year. So good improvement on that front. The other thing I'd highlight is when we look at our investment plan for next year we're contemplating a 20% growth rate. So again that's why we provided a new metric for you in terms of bookings. And as we're growing the subscription revenue business obviously you'd see a lag in revenue due to the recurring revenue we're generating on our subscription business. And that's putting some pressure on our operating profit. But even with this dynamic like I said our revenue growth will be outpacing our investment growth. And look we're just committed to continuing to invest in growth. Our philosophy of driving more operating leverage into the business over the long-term remains unchanged.\nCharlie Giancarlo: Thanks, Bala. Next question, please.\nBala Reddy: Thanks,\nOperator: Your next question comes from Katy Huberty from Morgan Stanley.\nKaty Huberty: Thank you. Good afternoon. 500 new customers signed in the quarter is I think a record. Can you just talk about the initiatives behind driving a stronger level of new customers and therefore bookings? And then I have a follow-up.\nCharlie Giancarlo: Absolutely Katy. We took on an initiative early in the year to really improve our overall ability to build on lead generation and building a good pipeline. And that included really focusing on new customers especially of course enterprise customers. And we're very pleased that to finish so strong in the year. And we believe that this is something that's going to continue to work for us. I'm especially pleased with the growth that we saw in enterprise customers a lot of them quite new and therefore opening up new potential for the future.\nKaty Huberty: And any color around the contribution from FlashArray//C in terms of percentage of bookings or the number of new customers that that product brought to you in the quarter?\nCharlie Giancarlo: We as you know Katy I really hesitate to give out individual numbers on individual products especially new products because they can be quite lumpy. But two quarters of growing revenues with FlashArray//C as I mentioned fastest new product fastest growth of any new product in the company's history. I think one reason for that is it is a FlashArray. It's just a FlashArray with QLC rather than regular. So it's a full it's not a I wouldn't consider it for example a version 1.0 product. It's a version 7.0 product with a new price performance range built into it. And so we would expect it to get out of the box early and good but it's probably it's performing even better than we might have hoped. First quarter I knew it was going to be good because obviously we have been there have been pent-up demand if we have been preselling it for a couple of quarters before that. But to see the second quarter outpaced the first was really largely based on in quarter demand gen. It was really nice.\nKaty Huberty: That's great to hear. And just lastly Kevan you said that you don't expect any supply or operational impact from coronavirus? Do you have much of a revenue base in China? And have you seen any demand either in that market or in APJ more broadly?\nKevan Krysler: Yes. So we do have some business in APJ. It's a lower percentage than what we see across the world. But as we mentioned we're not seeing any demand issues at this point in time relating to coronavirus.\nCharlie Giancarlo: Right. And Kate just FYI as you know we have very little revenue that comes out of China. We're not really invested in China in that way. And China is a relatively small part of our supply chain.\nKaty Huberty: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Karl Ackerman from Cowen.\nKarl Ackerman: Good afternoon, everyone. I was curious how much of the slowdown in revenue over the last few quarters do you think is attributed to what seems to be a shift in the purchasing decisions of how on-prem customers procure storage such as greater input across software storage and a few departments before making the final decision? And I guess does that partially explain maybe the elevated level of opex investment you plan for this year? So just if you could comment on that? And then as my follow-up just given what appears to be somewhat of an uncertain spending environment. How are you thinking about ways to extract cost beyond just maybe more efficient sales cohorts such as customer acquisition costs and/or other indirect channel costs?\nCharlie Giancarlo: So in terms of the changing nature of decision-making in the enterprise that's certainly the case. I feel that we've actually that's an area where we've actually had some fairly good results we believe because we're very focused around workloads and use cases and we're able to go into the different departments not always the storage admin. And be able to describe our products in terms of how we can make it easier with less activity around infrastructure management for those organizations to get the output of the applications that they're looking for. So I think that's actually worked for us. I wouldn't say that that's increased our cost of sales at all. If anything I think it's made us a bit more effective in being able to penetrate accounts that let's say we're strongly held before by our competition. On the I'm sorry just...\nKevan Krysler: Operational efficiencies.\nCharlie Giancarlo: Yes operational efficiencies. Yes we have a big push this year to really expand the efficiency and effectiveness of our channels. Part of that was due to the fact that as a smaller vendor before the channels really relied on us to do most of the selling as we're getting bigger and more a greater percentage of their portfolio is based on Pure they are training more of their staff do more of the selling. But another part of this is that we were deficient in our systems and in our materials to enable to better enable our channel partners to be more independent. And there's this big initiative starting last year but ongoing this year and we I think we'll see some more fruit coming out of that this year.\nKevan Krysler: Yes. And Karl this is Kevan. Even when you're contemplating the lag in revenue which is putting some pressure on operating profits this year. When you take a look at our operating expense as a percentage of revenue that's coming down slightly and we're looking to get some operational efficiencies especially within sales and marketing. In the non quota-carrying head environment. And so we expect to see some improvements there despite what we're trying to do from an investment standpoint and R&D as well as continue our investments with our quota-carrying heads.\nCharlie Giancarlo: Thanks, Karl. Next question, please.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Jason Ader from William Blair.\nJason Ader: Yeah, thanks, guys. I jumped on the call late so apologies if this was already asked. I thought I was on the VMware call with Kevan here. So but I wanted to just understand a little bit better about the leverage. So originally talked about 6% to 11% for fiscal '21. Obviously the revenue growth has been pretty solid and you're clearly taking a lot of market share. But what was the explanation you gave for the limited leverage this year because my math says it's about 3% operating margin implied for fiscal '21?\nKevan Krysler: Yes your math is in line there Jason. And we address that and how we are looking at that for next year is first of all when we think about our business growth trajectory it's about a 20% growth rate. And that's why we provided a new metric for bookings to give you a sense on how fast we think the business will grow next year. And so as a result of the fact that that growth is being driven by increased subscription services we're seeing a lag in revenue due to the recurring nature of the revenue being recognized. But even with that dynamic of our revenue growth it's revenue growth that's outpacing our investment growth even with that dynamic. But look at the end of the day we're still committed to investing for growth. And our overall philosophy of driving more operating leverage which again we'll see in sales and marketing next year over the long-term remains unchanged.\nJason Ader: Okay. So just to be clear this is just a function of more of the business being ratable. And as a result you're going to you're basically getting less revenue upfront and therefore you can't get the leverage as quickly? Is that...\nKevan Krysler: Yes you're thinking about that right. That's right Jason.\nJason Ader: Yep. All right. Thank you.\nKevan Krysler: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Simon Leopold from Raymond James.\nSimon Leopold: Great, thank you for taking the question. I wanted to try to maybe get a bridge on what happens in the gross margins in fiscal '21 so the next quarter as well as the year? In that you had two quarters with product gross margins that look like they're they've been 73. And so our net's been better than expected. And so I'm trying to discern how much of the forecast is regarding input pricing competitiveness product mix if there's some kind of bridge that you could help kind of connect the dots between where you've been and where you're going on gross margin?\nKevan Krysler: Yes sure Simon. And this is Kevan and I'll take it at first. And again like you've mentioned our gross margins have been terrific. And I really do believe this is a differentiator for us in the market. Now a couple of things specific to this year that I think is different than how we're looking at it for next year. But we did see some benefit in our gross margin this year. From the extraordinary pricing dynamic that we experienced. And again as Charlie mentioned we think that pricing dynamic is going to normalize similar to what we saw in Q4 and throughout next year. So obviously we wouldn't get the benefit in gross margin next year from that pricing dynamic. The other element I would highlight is that we did see last year more of a mix shift toward our larger systems which also had a higher margin profile for us. And we will we're actually estimating that that mix shift will remain relatively consistent as we look at next year. So those two benefits if you will will normalize going into next year and that's why you see a little bit of a drop in gross margin.\nSimon Leopold: Great. And I wanted to follow-up in terms of the demand side of the coronavirus in that it's obviously a very fluid situation and I get certainly the aspects around your supply chain. I'm a little bit surprised that you're not seeing anything from a demand perspective. In that it sounds like we're seeing large enterprises for example you may have customers that are airlines and hotels that may be rethinking their businesses. And so I respect the fact you've done your due diligence and you surveyed your sales channel. I just sort of feel a bit puzzle that you're not picking up slowing from your customer base is any way you can help us get a better understanding of why you'd see that resilience or your immunity from the virus?\nCharlie Giancarlo: Absolutely Simon. So we're just going to speak very you may very well be correct but let me just speak factually. We're not yet seeing it in any of our Q1 business. And I think it's far too early to start predicting Q2 and beyond given the uncertainty of the virus whether it's contained or not contained how much of the quarantines may affect customers' orders and so forth. So you may very well be correct. I hope you're not but the fact of the matter is we're not yet seeing any effect on our Q1 business or on the Q1 forecast. Obviously that could change in two weeks but we are where we are right now in the quarter.\nSimon Leopold: Thanks for taking my question.\nMattDanziger: You bet. Next question, please.\nOperator: Your next question comes from George Iwanyc from Oppenheimer.\nGeorge Iwanyc: So Charlie just following up on that are there any regions where there are any indications that things are changing. Are deal sales cycle is basically the same as they were last quarter?\nCharlie Giancarlo: It's very early in the quarter to be honest with you. So I'm not even sure that we would see it unless it were a dramatic change in tenor. But so far no.\nGeorge Iwanyc: Okay. And just from a competitive standpoint how do you feel about win rates versus your main competitors?\nCharlie Giancarlo: Very good. No real change as you know every week every month every quarter is a tough fight with our competitors but we continue to outpace them in terms of growth. We grew. If we look at Q1 through Q3 where we have the industry analysts we grew three times more than our closest competitor and probably 20 points more than the industry as a whole. I think we're taking share from every competitor. And if you look at some of the more recent announcements they're actually shrinking while we're growing. So we feel very good about our competitive position.\nGeorge Iwanyc: And last question.\nCharlie Giancarlo: Yes please.\nGeorge Iwanyc: Just on the Cloud Box Store with Azure in beta now AWS being GA for a while. How do you see the customer reaction to the expanding reach?\nCharlie Giancarlo: Yes very good. I think for several reasons. One is they really see it as a unifying force in our portfolio. They can design to one set of interfaces. They design to one management environment and manage their data regardless of whether it's on-prem or regardless of which cloud they put it into. They're pleased that they can take some of their primary their primary application environments. And now they have an easier way of being able to transition them to the cloud without having to do a full refactoring or rewrite of the software. And we're seeing a lot of interest in the new use cases that I outlined in my prepared remarks especially around DR DevOps and backup and recovery. So it is very new I will put it that way. It's very new for customers. And so there's and we're happy to see a lot of tire kicking and a lot of testing going on. And we're it gives us great optimism that as we that the products will continue to scale and grow in our customers' minds.\nGeorge Iwanyc: Thank you.\nMattDanziger: Thank you. Next question, please.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Wamsi Mohan from Bank of America.\nWamsi Mohan: Can you help us think through how much of your 2020 growth either in revenue or bookings terms you're expecting that might come from upgrades from prior controller sales versus new customer sales?\nKevan Krysler: Yes this is Kevan. We don't break that out. And really what we're looking at is really the differentiation between our subscription business which is growing at a very fast rate versus cap purchases. And that's really how we were looking at the business.\nCharlie Giancarlo: Yes. Wamsi I think with 500 new customers in the quarter and over 1700 on a year-to-year basis. I think you can understand that there's quite a bit of business that comes from new customers. Of course the new customers have to absorb the products that they buy get used to them understand our value proposition to come in for more. But we get some very large new customer we've gotten some very large orders from brand-new customers which is a change from before. When we were younger there'd be a lot of tire kicking before purchase. Now we're finding new customers buying with sometimes seven-figure new product sales so first time sales I should say. So we're very pleased with new customers. But of course the meat of the business is growing our revenue inside of existing customers. And I think that's an area where we continue to focus a lot of attention.\nWamsi Mohan: And just on cash flow. You obviously had a very nice cash flow generation for the full year. How are you expecting both capex and free cash flow to trend in this coming year?\nKevan Krysler: Yes I think a general line of thinking for capex next year would be about 5% of revenue it's how you should be thinking about it?\nWamsi Mohan: Okay. Thank you so much.\nMattDanziger: Next question, please.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Pinjalim Bora from JP Morgan.\nPinjalim Bora : So thank you. Hey, guys. One question on the platform motion Charlie. We have heard from your partners a pretty positive things about selling the platform. I'd love to hear what how are you driving the sales motion? What are you seeing especially are you positioning Pure as-a-Service as the default choice essentially for the same? And are you making any specific changes on the comp plans to incentivize kind of a bundled platform selling?\nCharlie Giancarlo: Absolutely. Well Pinjalim we just completed our sales kickoff and a big theme of the kickoff was what we call our Modern Data Experience strategy and Pure as-a-Service. And I would say that the encouragement for the sales force is to position Pure as-a-Service first in a new customer situation because it very much differentiates us in the market overall. Now that being said the sales force is paid pretty much equally. There's should be no for a salesman they will get paid roughly the same whether it's Pure as-a-Service or a capex sale because we really want them focused on providing the customer what they want and they need. We want to give the customer flexibility and give them choice. But at the end of the day we want the customer to really be deciding for themselves not our sales team based on how they're how they're compensated. But we're very pleased with the take-up of Pure as-a-service and we definitely a good acceleration year for us. And I think it's taking time customers' time to look at their own data centers differently than they look at the cloud of course cloud's always subscription first but their data centers have been capex first. But now it's opening up great new opportunities. I will say some color on this is that we're getting not just first time six but also seven-figure deals for Pure as-a-Service. First time deal. It might be an existing customer or a new customer. But either way we're these deals now first time Pure as-a-Service deals in these customers six and seven figures.\nPinjalim Bora : Wow interesting. Okay. And on that vein I guess as that takes accelerates and the subscription becomes business becomes larger and you're talking about this lag effect to revenue and you kind of highlighted the bookings metric. How should investors track that on a quarterly basis? I mean should people start looking at calculated billings RPO based bookings? Or would those metrics have kind of an impact from term changes? And maybe add some noise? What is the best metric for investors?\nCharlie Giancarlo: Right. It's a great question. We as Kevan mentioned on the call earlier we provided a bookings metric and that can be used on an annual basis right now is what we're looking at to track it somewhat. But we do understand that there are other metrics that as this becomes a greater percentage of our business that investors are going to want to know. I'll let Kevin speak to this.\nKevan Krysler: Yes I think a good starting point especially with the traction we're getting with our subscription services. It was this first new metric around bookings on an annual basis. And I think an annual basis is the right way to look at it at least for this year. Because you're going to have variability quarter-over-quarter. So we'll give this a start. And as we get into the year if there's important information to reflect we'll definitely do that.\nPinjalim Bora : Thank you.\nMatt Danziger : Pinjalim. Thanks. Next question, please.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Erik Suppiger from JMP Securities.\nErik Suppiger: Yeah, thanks for taking the question. A couple of questions. One just to be clear are you not doing any of your contract manufacturing in China? And then secondly can you talk a little bit about your visibility into your flash supply. Do you have 90 days out? Or what kind of inventory do you stockpile on that?\nCharlie Giancarlo: Yes. Let me start with that and then I'll turn it over to Kevan for some of it. So we do have some of our subassemblies that come out of China. We've been right on top of that where we know each of the factories each of the lines know how they're operating. And so as we said we're very confident. We're fairly confident as confident one can be in an uncertain environment for Q1. We have a high degree of confidence. Q2 obviously it's a fluid situation. It's too early to project for Q2. We have no reason to doubt it but it's still we can't really speak to it with surety at this point in time.\nKevan Krysler: Yes nothing to add to that Charlie.\nCharlie Giancarlo: Yes. In terms of the flash supply we have good visibility into it. We are very close to our suppliers. As you know most flash comes out of places like Korea Japan and the U.S. We are fairly well diversified. And we as I said before we feel fairly confident in our ability to supply this quarter.\nErik Suppiger: All right. Can you just talk about competitive dynamics with FlashArray//C? You've been shipping that for a couple of quarters. Is there any updates in terms of who you're seeing most or any competitive pricing dynamics there?\nMatt Kixmoeller: This is Kix. I'll take this one. So I think one of the biggest surprises around FlashArray//C is it's largely been completely unanswered by the competition. And so we've really enabled ourselves to go after a whole new set of use cases around Tier two data with FlashArray//C and inoperability between X and C allows customers to implement tiering strategies and to really have applications mostly go back and forth between Tier one and Tier two flash. So it's been a great growth story. I haven't heard much from the competition on it at all. And so we feel like that's a great part of our business that set up well for the year.\nMatt Danziger : Thanks so much, Eric. Next question, please you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Amit Daryanani from Evercore.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is Michael [indiscernible] on for Amit. So I wanted to touch on the guide for Q1 you're pointing sales up around 11% versus the full year around 15%. Can you just tell us kind of what changes as the year goes on to have growth inflect?\nKevan Krysler: Yes. And Michael this is Kevan. In my prepared remarks our Q1 revenue does is in line with our expectations. A couple of things that I mentioned though is back in Q1 of last year we had a shipping issue in Q4 that actually benefited Q1 to about four points. And we actually evaluate or normalize that shipping issue and the benefit in Q1 of '20. We're right in line from a seasonality perspective whether you look at it from Q4 to Q1 or whether you look at it as a percentage of total revenue. So I think we're quite aligned in terms of how we're looking at it but it did impact our growth rate for Q1.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. And then just on the it sounds like Pure as-a-Service is going pretty well. We're just kind of wondering with where you're seeing the uptake on that? Is it more existing customers? Or is it something you're seeing enable net new gains?\nCharlie Giancarlo: Yes. No it's both actually. It's very interesting. We're definitely seeing net new gains. But that is new customers who are buying in this like to buy in this manner. But we're also seeing existing customers who are changing the way that they want to buy. And it's actually given us new opportunities frankly in environments where we might not have done quite so well. But the fact that our competitors can't really compete with this model. So it's really given us new opportunities both in existing accounts as well as new accounts.\nMatt Kixmoeller: Yes. One of the dimension I would add that I think sometimes folks miss it Pure as-a-Service is also a transportable subscription. And so the conversation we're having with customers is about being able to deploy now on-prem. But having that optionality to move to the cloud whenever they like is really game changing. And it's something that differentiates our as a service offering compared to all the competition.\nCharlie Giancarlo: Yes. And that was particularly true in one very large customer that we have who planned on migrating over time to Azure. They're beta customer obviously of our CBS on Azure. They're a big user of our on-prem continue to be buyers of our on-prem storage. But the fact that they will be able to more easily move their primary workloads over to Azure because it's based on our product has been just a huge advantage for us.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. And is that something that you're not seeing offered by competitors in the market?\nCharlie Giancarlo: We're seeing repackaged leases. It's not the same.\nMatt Danziger : Thanks so much, Michael. Next question\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Nehal Chokshi from Maxim Group.\nNehal Chokshi: Oh, yeah. Thank you, and Congratulations on a great quarter. So this bookings guidance of 20% revenue growth 16% Delta subscription. To help tease out to make sure that this is indeed the total there is indeed subscription. Can you tell us what percent of bookings in fiscal year '20 was actually subscription? And how much do you expect it to increase to in fiscal year '21?\nKevan Krysler: Yes this is Kevan. And again as I mentioned we're sharing the bookings growth rate for next year really because this is the first year where we're seeing a divergence where expected bookings growth rate is outpacing our revenue growth rate. We did not see a similar dynamic last year. And so that's why we're not going to go into a lot of detail in terms of what our bookings growth rates were in the prior year really because the divergence we're seeing is the first for this upcoming year. And again the bookings growing at a faster rate than revenue is really being driven by the momentum of our Evergreen subscriptions and Pure as-a-Service in our Cloud Block Store.\nNehal Chokshi: Okay. And then can you just give a little detail on the mechanics of the subscriptions here i.e. was the distribution of a subscription booking between revenue deferred revenue and unbilled contract value in the first quarter of $1 of book subscription?\nKevan Krysler: Yes. So in terms of the detail first of all TCV is really being used both for our subscription services as well as our capital transactions. So you've got similarity there. But you're right you are going to have situations where some of the subscription services will be outside of deferred revenue. You should be picking up a big portion of that in the remaining performance obligation that we disclosed as well. And with that we'll turn the call back over to Charlie.\nCharlie Giancarlo: I want to thank you all for joining us on this call. As you might be able to tell we are very pleased not only with Q4 but with our performance throughout FY '20. It was a fantastic product year for us. We announced our strategy for the next decade which is to deliver a platform that allows customers really to realize the value of their data-as-a-Service and with cloud-like efficiency and orchestration. We are very excited about the opportunities in front of us. We understand what our customers want and we believe the combination of our subscription services our product portfolio and frankly the experience that only Pure offers enable us to really deliver the kind of data experience that our customers are expecting and provide the solutions that are that our customers need to allow them to digitally transform. I want to thank you for your time today and we look forward to speaking with you again next quarter.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen this concludes today's conference call, thank you for participating, you may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Charlie Giancarlo",
            "content": "Thank you Matt and good afternoon everyone. Thank you for joining us on today's earnings call. I am pleased with our Q4 performance resulting in record revenue and the largest bookings quarter in Pure's history. I'll share highlights from the year explain why Pure is best positioned to help enterprises navigate their digital transformation and share our excitement for the future. Kevan joining us for his first Pure earnings call will follow with a review of our financials and an outlook for next year.  At Accelerate last September we announced Pure strategy for our second decade. Our portfolio of products running our unified Purity software and all managed by our Pure one Cloud can now serve the majority of data workloads for our customers. Mission-critical production test dev analytics disaster recovery and backup and recovery in all environments on-premise in-cloud and hybrid. The Purity software platform brings performance simplicity and cloud era API automation to storage at any scale. We call this strategy the Modern Data Experience and we are succeeding by helping our customers transform their storage operations to a modern shared as a service model. I will share more on how Pure's technology is at the center of our customers' strategic initiatives.  Before I share our results and because it is on the minds of both our customers and investors I would like to spend a moment on the coronavirus outbreak. We sympathize with all of those directly affected by the virus and we commend everyone working so tirelessly to address it. We have taken active measures to ensure the safety of our employees and those of our supply chain partners. Based on what we know today we do not anticipate a significant impact to this quarter's supply and operations although the situation remains quite fluid. Pure has in place a multi-continent supply chain strategy to source components and assemble our products and we continue to monitor the developing situation diligently. Now to our results. I will share color from the full year and later Kevan will provide highlights from Q4. Fiscal '20 finished strong with total revenue of $1.64 billion growing 21% year-on-year while navigating through an unparalleled industry pricing decline. In Q4 we started to see a return to a more normalized pricing environment. Pure's continued differentiation is evidenced by our 70.5% non-GAAP full year gross margin. Non-GAAP operating profit was $56 million demonstrating yet another full year of profitability. We exited the year with over 1700 new customers bringing our total customer account to more than 7500 which now includes 44% of the Fortune 500.  Pure is delivering the Modern Data Experience through our portfolio solutions and services built around four key tenants: fast matters; cloud everywhere; simple is smart; and the subscription to innovation. These tenants drive our engineering innovation and resonate with customers because it aligns with their requirements for a cloud-like API-driven operations and performance across their infrastructure. It enables them to deliver a storage-as-a-service experience to meet the needs of their developers DevOps teams and modern applications. Pure's technology portfolio and continued pace of innovation are paying off with transformative products and solutions that delight our customers.  Pure enables customers to transform their storage operations from bespoke manually managed silos to a modern shared-as-a-service model delivering choice and flexibility in how storage is consumed and managed. A key hallmark in Pure strategy is our subscription services with Cloud Block Store Pure as-a-Service and our Evergreen business model. Cloud Block Store on AWS released in Q2 of last year is helping customers implement migration test dev and disaster recovery use cases for mission-critical applications. And Cloud Block Store is now in beta for Microsoft Azure. Pure also joined Google Cloud's Anthos Ready Storage Initiative for multi-cloud deployments earlier this month. We achieved the largest ever bookings of Pure as-a-Service in Q4 including wins at three major international banks. Pure as-a-Service allows customers to unify their storage procurement strategy to a consistent cloud model whether deployed on-premise in-cloud or in a hybrid environment so that they can focus on what matters driving business transformation. Pure provides a true hybrid utility model offering flexible storage consumption as a genuine hands-free opex service. Turning to our portfolio. Pure suite of products has never been more comprehensive. Today we announced the seventh generation of FlashArray further raising the bar on the product that continuously redefines modern storage. This new FlashArray//X delivers 25% higher performance for mission-critical applications with a fully end-to-end NVMe architecture across all models and supports advanced storage class memory. And like every generation of FlashArray the new FlashArray//X is available through our nondisruptive Evergreen subscription upgrade for existing customers. FlashArray//C introduced in Q3 of last year is the first and only all-flash product in the industry to bring flash performance to Tier two application economics. We are seeing phenomenal adoption of FlashArray//C and in its first two quarters has already become Pure's fastest growth product ever. Pure FlashBlade product has redefined what's possible with big fast data as customers look to create an all-flash data hub to consolidate their file and object data to power next generation analytics AI and container infrastructure. A particular area of strength is the massive growth of log analytics as customers use FlashBlade to solve cybersecurity fraud detection and IoT use cases in partnership with Splunk Elastic and Vertica. And rapid restore continues to be a popular use case for FlashBlade made better in Q4 with the introduction of FlashBlade safe mode a unique anti ransomware solution that has already helped several metropolitan area cities protect and recover from potential ransomware attacks.  Lastly we had our annual sales kickoff meeting in San Francisco just two weeks ago and the excitement from our team was extraordinary. On our decade anniversary last fall we announced our strategy to transform the current box-based enterprise storage environment to an integrated multi-cloud experience. In FY '21 and beyond we're committed to deliver on our Modern Data Experience and Pure as-a-Service strategies to accelerate our customers' digital transformation journeys. And with that I'll turn it over to Kevan. Right. Well as you know from prior quarters we had a early in the early parts of the year just saw breathtaking price declines in the market that were created through by a free fall of NAND pricing earlier in the year. Now NAND prices do fall every year which is generally good for us because it creates elasticity in the market. It allows us to go after more magnetic storage which we're very excited about. But when it drops very suddenly then elasticity doesn't have time to catch up. We saw in Q4 is what we are used to seeing generally year in and year out in normal years. And we know that the commodity prices are have been have stabilized for some time are projected to go up next year. And so that presages to us a normal pricing environment and one in which we can hopefully regain even better growth initiative and certainly allow us to continue to grow ahead of the industry. As you know we can use gross margin in two ways: one is to fund the business; and the other of course is to fund pricing declines compared to competitors. Our view is that and we look at this literally every week. And our belief is that in fact it's the software value that we provide that is having our customers paying 10% to 20% premium for our product versus our competition. And we don't really believe that we ever lose a deal based on price. I mean we do lose deals. And when we do the price it might be lower than ours but generally it's for other reasons. And so at the minute we feel like we could win we would certainly trade-off price for more wins but we don't believe that that's what we're seeing right now. We continue to believe that expansion of the sales force more feet on the street calling on more customers on more opportunities is the right way to use our margin. Thanks, Aaron Next question. We definitely are looking at this year as a much more normal pricing environment. And that allows us to forecast a 20% growth year compared to a flat industry. We're certainly not we're looking at a roughly a flat macro year-to-year. So we're not projecting upside or downside on in the overall industry overall. We believe that in an overall environment in which pricing holds that we're going to have well above competitive performance in terms of growth. Yes. And Alex you actually know this well. 95% of our developers are software developers. So we're a software company that in started out by shrink wrapping it in iron and now more significantly we have products such as Cloud Block Store which is 100% of our Purity software operating directly on top of AWS and now in beta on Azure. And it's a unique and unified software offering operating across all of our products and multi-cloud multi-platform. And pretty soon both with respect to FlashArray multi-tier and multi-protocol. So we think this is a real big differentiator. Most of our competitors have multiple products to deal with different workloads and environments. We're going to be able to satisfy it with one software base all managed by a single management system in Pure one So we think that it's such a pleasure to have Kevan on board to help us because of course it does mean transitions in the way that we look at recognizing revenue at managing subscription business managing software business. So it's great to have a skill set on board. Well I can't speak to the 7%. I don't understand that calculation. I mean it is we in our prepared remarks identified the revenue growth is 16% but we do believe that increasing amounts of our bookings as subscription revenue is going to of course cause bookings to increase at a faster rate overall than revenue and that's what we meant to start to identify for our investors. Thanks, Bala. Next question, please. Absolutely Katy. We took on an initiative early in the year to really improve our overall ability to build on lead generation and building a good pipeline. And that included really focusing on new customers especially of course enterprise customers. And we're very pleased that to finish so strong in the year. And we believe that this is something that's going to continue to work for us. I'm especially pleased with the growth that we saw in enterprise customers a lot of them quite new and therefore opening up new potential for the future. We as you know Katy I really hesitate to give out individual numbers on individual products especially new products because they can be quite lumpy. But two quarters of growing revenues with FlashArray//C as I mentioned fastest new product fastest growth of any new product in the company's history. I think one reason for that is it is a FlashArray. It's just a FlashArray with QLC rather than regular. So it's a full it's not a I wouldn't consider it for example a version 1.0 product. It's a version 7.0 product with a new price performance range built into it. And so we would expect it to get out of the box early and good but it's probably it's performing even better than we might have hoped. First quarter I knew it was going to be good because obviously we have been there have been pent-up demand if we have been preselling it for a couple of quarters before that. But to see the second quarter outpaced the first was really largely based on in quarter demand gen. It was really nice. Right. And Kate just FYI as you know we have very little revenue that comes out of China. We're not really invested in China in that way. And China is a relatively small part of our supply chain. So in terms of the changing nature of decision-making in the enterprise that's certainly the case. I feel that we've actually that's an area where we've actually had some fairly good results we believe because we're very focused around workloads and use cases and we're able to go into the different departments not always the storage admin. And be able to describe our products in terms of how we can make it easier with less activity around infrastructure management for those organizations to get the output of the applications that they're looking for. So I think that's actually worked for us. I wouldn't say that that's increased our cost of sales at all. If anything I think it's made us a bit more effective in being able to penetrate accounts that let's say we're strongly held before by our competition. On the I'm sorry just... Yes operational efficiencies. Yes we have a big push this year to really expand the efficiency and effectiveness of our channels. Part of that was due to the fact that as a smaller vendor before the channels really relied on us to do most of the selling as we're getting bigger and more a greater percentage of their portfolio is based on Pure they are training more of their staff do more of the selling. But another part of this is that we were deficient in our systems and in our materials to enable to better enable our channel partners to be more independent. And there's this big initiative starting last year but ongoing this year and we I think we'll see some more fruit coming out of that this year. Thanks, Karl. Next question, please. Absolutely Simon. So we're just going to speak very you may very well be correct but let me just speak factually. We're not yet seeing it in any of our Q1 business. And I think it's far too early to start predicting Q2 and beyond given the uncertainty of the virus whether it's contained or not contained how much of the quarantines may affect customers' orders and so forth. So you may very well be correct. I hope you're not but the fact of the matter is we're not yet seeing any effect on our Q1 business or on the Q1 forecast. Obviously that could change in two weeks but we are where we are right now in the quarter. It's very early in the quarter to be honest with you. So I'm not even sure that we would see it unless it were a dramatic change in tenor. But so far no. Very good. No real change as you know every week every month every quarter is a tough fight with our competitors but we continue to outpace them in terms of growth. We grew. If we look at Q1 through Q3 where we have the industry analysts we grew three times more than our closest competitor and probably 20 points more than the industry as a whole. I think we're taking share from every competitor. And if you look at some of the more recent announcements they're actually shrinking while we're growing. So we feel very good about our competitive position. Yes please. Yes very good. I think for several reasons. One is they really see it as a unifying force in our portfolio. They can design to one set of interfaces. They design to one management environment and manage their data regardless of whether it's on-prem or regardless of which cloud they put it into. They're pleased that they can take some of their primary their primary application environments. And now they have an easier way of being able to transition them to the cloud without having to do a full refactoring or rewrite of the software. And we're seeing a lot of interest in the new use cases that I outlined in my prepared remarks especially around DR DevOps and backup and recovery. So it is very new I will put it that way. It's very new for customers. And so there's and we're happy to see a lot of tire kicking and a lot of testing going on. And we're it gives us great optimism that as we that the products will continue to scale and grow in our customers' minds. Yes. Wamsi I think with 500 new customers in the quarter and over 1700 on a year-to-year basis. I think you can understand that there's quite a bit of business that comes from new customers. Of course the new customers have to absorb the products that they buy get used to them understand our value proposition to come in for more. But we get some very large new customer we've gotten some very large orders from brand-new customers which is a change from before. When we were younger there'd be a lot of tire kicking before purchase. Now we're finding new customers buying with sometimes seven-figure new product sales so first time sales I should say. So we're very pleased with new customers. But of course the meat of the business is growing our revenue inside of existing customers. And I think that's an area where we continue to focus a lot of attention. Absolutely. Well Pinjalim we just completed our sales kickoff and a big theme of the kickoff was what we call our Modern Data Experience strategy and Pure as-a-Service. And I would say that the encouragement for the sales force is to position Pure as-a-Service first in a new customer situation because it very much differentiates us in the market overall. Now that being said the sales force is paid pretty much equally. There's should be no for a salesman they will get paid roughly the same whether it's Pure as-a-Service or a capex sale because we really want them focused on providing the customer what they want and they need. We want to give the customer flexibility and give them choice. But at the end of the day we want the customer to really be deciding for themselves not our sales team based on how they're how they're compensated. But we're very pleased with the take-up of Pure as-a-service and we definitely a good acceleration year for us. And I think it's taking time customers' time to look at their own data centers differently than they look at the cloud of course cloud's always subscription first but their data centers have been capex first. But now it's opening up great new opportunities. I will say some color on this is that we're getting not just first time six but also seven-figure deals for Pure as-a-Service. First time deal. It might be an existing customer or a new customer. But either way we're these deals now first time Pure as-a-Service deals in these customers six and seven figures. Right. It's a great question. We as Kevan mentioned on the call earlier we provided a bookings metric and that can be used on an annual basis right now is what we're looking at to track it somewhat. But we do understand that there are other metrics that as this becomes a greater percentage of our business that investors are going to want to know. I'll let Kevin speak to this. Yes. Let me start with that and then I'll turn it over to Kevan for some of it. So we do have some of our subassemblies that come out of China. We've been right on top of that where we know each of the factories each of the lines know how they're operating. And so as we said we're very confident. We're fairly confident as confident one can be in an uncertain environment for Q1. We have a high degree of confidence. Q2 obviously it's a fluid situation. It's too early to project for Q2. We have no reason to doubt it but it's still we can't really speak to it with surety at this point in time. Yes. In terms of the flash supply we have good visibility into it. We are very close to our suppliers. As you know most flash comes out of places like Korea Japan and the U.S. We are fairly well diversified. And we as I said before we feel fairly confident in our ability to supply this quarter. Yes. No it's both actually. It's very interesting. We're definitely seeing net new gains.

It's not the same. I want to thank you all for joining us on this call. As you might be able to tell we are very pleased not only with Q4 but with our performance throughout FY '20. It was a fantastic product year for us. We announced our strategy for the next decade which is to deliver a platform that allows customers really to realize the value of their data-as-a-Service and with cloud-like efficiency and orchestration. We are very excited about the opportunities in front of us. We understand what our customers want and we believe the combination of our subscription services our product portfolio and frankly the experience that only Pure offers enable us to really deliver the kind of data experience that our customers are expecting and provide the solutions that are that our customers need to allow them to digitally transform. I want to thank you for your time today and we look forward to speaking with you again next quarter."

            "name": "Kevan Krysler",
            "content": "Thank you Charlie. We were pleased with our solid broad-based performance across all key financial metrics this quarter. Total revenue during Q4 was $492 million growing 17% year-over-year. Product revenue was $377 million growing 11% year-over-year and subscription services revenue was $116 million growing 41% year-over-year which includes revenues from our Evergreen subscriptions Pure as-a-Service and Cloud Block Store. Total revenue in the United States in Q4 was $345 million growing at 15% year-over-year and total international revenue in Q4 was $147 million growing 21% year-over-year. Non-GAAP gross margins in the quarter for product and subscription services continue to be strong and differentiates us in the market. Total non-GAAP gross margin in Q4 was 72.1% increasing 4.5 basis points year-over-year. Non-GAAP product gross margin in Q4 was 73.3% increasing 5.5 basis points year-over-year. And non-GAAP subscription services margin in Q4 was 68.1% increasing 1.3 basis points year-over-year. Total non-GAAP operating profit during Q4 was $61 million increasing $30 million year-over-year. Non-GAAP net income during Q4 was $64 million and non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.23 per share. Non-GAAP net income in Q4 at the prior year was $37 million and non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.14 per share. Weighted average shares used for the non-GAAP earnings per share calculation was $277 million in Q4 and $264 million in Q4 of the prior year. Operating cash flow for fiscal 2020 was $190 million and was $165 million in fiscal 2019. Operating cash flow in Q4 was $70 million and was $81 million in Q4 of the prior year. Free cash flow for fiscal 2020 was $102 million and $64 million in fiscal 2019. Free cash flow was $56 million in Q4 and was $51 million in Q4 of the prior year. Total cash and cash investments at the end of the year was $1.3 billion compared to $1.2 billion at the end of the prior year. Total deferred revenue at the end of the year was $697 million increasing from $536 million at the end of the prior year. During Q4 we repurchased shares in the open market totaling $15 million and have approximately $135 million remaining in our share repurchase authorization. Total headcount at the end of the year was approximately 3400 employees and was approximately 2900 employees at the end of the prior year.  As Charlie mentioned in his prepared remarks we are actively monitoring the coronavirus developments. And although we are not seeing specific impacts on the business currently the situation is fluid and unpredictable. Potential adverse effects to our business have not been incorporated into our annual guide or our Q1 guide. With the strong performance and growth outlook of our multiple subscription service offerings we expect that our bookings growth will begin to outpace revenue growth next year. Revenue derived from our subscription service offerings is recognized over time and is recurring. As such we leave a useful metric to evaluate and provide more transparency to the growth of our business next year is the annual growth rate of total bookings which we expect to be approximately 20%. We will update our annual guidance including total bookings growth for the full year at the beginning of each fiscal year. We are focused on growing our highly differentiated Evergreen Pure as-a-Service and Cloud Block Store subscription services. Given that these subscription offerings provide recurring revenue total revenue next year is expected to be approximately $1.9 billion growing 16% year-over-year. Non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be approximately 69.5% and non-GAAP operating income is expected to be approximately $60 million for the fiscal year. Moving to our Q1 guidance. Total revenue for Q1 is expected to be approximately $365 million growing 12% year-over-year.  As you might recall last year's Q1 revenue benefited from a shipping issue during Q4 2019. When normalizing for this shipping issue our guided Q1 revenue growth rate would be four basis points higher. Non-GAAP gross margins in Q1 are expected to be approximately 69.5% and non-GAAP operating loss in Q1 is expected to be approximately $40 million. I am very excited to have joined the team at Pure Storage and the opportunity ahead. We see strong momentum in our portfolio including our innovative subscription service offerings. That will continue to position us well in the market and with our customers. With that we will now open the call for questions. And Aaron this is Kevan. When you think about specifically for the annual guide and Q1 guide in this concept of a normalized pricing environment that really contemplates both a volume expansion as well as what we would consider normalized declines in ASPs. And again that's what we've seen outside of the dynamic that we saw this past year. And let me just add on to that if I could Alex and Charlie. Look we're in terms of our business growth next year as Charlie said we're running at 20% and that's why we provided that bookings metric for the Alex for this year in terms of how we're looking at it. And a couple of dynamics that I would just highlight. One is again the subscription services that we're seeing in terms of momentum which really is creating this dynamic of a lag between bookings and revenue that we'll see next year. But we also want to be prudent given the current environment as we're clearly seeing some headwinds on the macro side and want to make sure we're contemplating that. Now that would exclude coronavirus. But outside of that we're still seeing some headwinds. Yes. Yes let me I'll share some initial thoughts in terms of my view but I would also probably comment from an observation standpoint that the company is doing a really nice job. In fact best practice in terms of software development the amount of investment we have in our R&D group on software. And clearly that's what's already differentiating this company from its competitors. And so from there we'll look at different models to expand on and that's why we're really focusing on our subscription services including Pure as-a-Service and Cloud Block Store. Thanks, Alex. Next question, please. Yes. I think the first thing I would highlight is that we're expecting our growth of operating expenses to actually be less than our revenue growth which would be different than what we saw this year. So good improvement on that front. The other thing I'd highlight is when we look at our investment plan for next year we're contemplating a 20% growth rate. So again that's why we provided a new metric for you in terms of bookings. And as we're growing the subscription revenue business obviously you'd see a lag in revenue due to the recurring revenue we're generating on our subscription business. And that's putting some pressure on our operating profit. But even with this dynamic like I said our revenue growth will be outpacing our investment growth. And look we're just committed to continuing to invest in growth. Our philosophy of driving more operating leverage into the business over the long-term remains unchanged. Yes. So we do have some business in APJ. It's a lower percentage than what we see across the world. But as we mentioned we're not seeing any demand issues at this point in time relating to coronavirus. Operational efficiencies. Yes. And Karl this is Kevan. Even when you're contemplating the lag in revenue which is putting some pressure on operating profits this year. When you take a look at our operating expense as a percentage of revenue that's coming down slightly and we're looking to get some operational efficiencies especially within sales and marketing. In the non quota-carrying head environment. And so we expect to see some improvements there despite what we're trying to do from an investment standpoint and R&D as well as continue our investments with our quota-carrying heads. Yes your math is in line there Jason. And we address that and how we are looking at that for next year is first of all when we think about our business growth trajectory it's about a 20% growth rate. And that's why we provided a new metric for bookings to give you a sense on how fast we think the business will grow next year. And so as a result of the fact that that growth is being driven by increased subscription services we're seeing a lag in revenue due to the recurring nature of the revenue being recognized. But even with that dynamic of our revenue growth it's revenue growth that's outpacing our investment growth even with that dynamic. But look at the end of the day we're still committed to investing for growth. And our overall philosophy of driving more operating leverage which again we'll see in sales and marketing next year over the long-term remains unchanged. Yes you're thinking about that right. That's right Jason. Thank you. Yes sure Simon. And this is Kevan and I'll take it at first. And again like you've mentioned our gross margins have been terrific. And I really do believe this is a differentiator for us in the market. Now a couple of things specific to this year that I think is different than how we're looking at it for next year. But we did see some benefit in our gross margin this year. From the extraordinary pricing dynamic that we experienced. And again as Charlie mentioned we think that pricing dynamic is going to normalize similar to what we saw in Q4 and throughout next year. So obviously we wouldn't get the benefit in gross margin next year from that pricing dynamic. The other element I would highlight is that we did see last year more of a mix shift toward our larger systems which also had a higher margin profile for us. And we will we're actually estimating that that mix shift will remain relatively consistent as we look at next year. So those two benefits if you will will normalize going into next year and that's why you see a little bit of a drop in gross margin. Yes this is Kevan. We don't break that out. And really what we're looking at is really the differentiation between our subscription business which is growing at a very fast rate versus cap purchases. And that's really how we were looking at the business. Yes I think a general line of thinking for capex next year would be about 5% of revenue it's how you should be thinking about it? Yes I think a good starting point especially with the traction we're getting with our subscription services. It was this first new metric around bookings on an annual basis. And I think an annual basis is the right way to look at it at least for this year. Because you're going to have variability quarter-over-quarter. So we'll give this a start. And as we get into the year if there's important information to reflect we'll definitely do that. Yes nothing to add to that Charlie. Yes. And Michael this is Kevan. In my prepared remarks our Q1 revenue does is in line with our expectations. A couple of things that I mentioned though is back in Q1 of last year we had a shipping issue in Q4 that actually benefited Q1 to about four points. And we actually evaluate or normalize that shipping issue and the benefit in Q1 of '20. We're right in line from a seasonality perspective whether you look at it from Q4 to Q1 or whether you look at it as a percentage of total revenue. So I think we're quite aligned in terms of how we're looking at it but it did impact our growth rate for Q1. Yes this is Kevan. And again as I mentioned we're sharing the bookings growth rate for next year really because this is the first year where we're seeing a divergence where expected bookings growth rate is outpacing our revenue growth rate. We did not see a similar dynamic last year. And so that's why we're not going to go into a lot of detail in terms of what our bookings growth rates were in the prior year really because the divergence we're seeing is the first for this upcoming year. And again the bookings growing at a faster rate than revenue is really being driven by the momentum of our Evergreen subscriptions and Pure as-a-Service in our Cloud Block Store. Yes. So in terms of the detail first of all TCV is really being used both for our subscription services as well as our capital transactions. So you've got similarity there. But you're right you are going to have situations where some of the subscription services will be outside of deferred revenue. You should be picking up a big portion of that in the remaining performance obligation that we disclosed as well. And with that we'll turn the call back over to Charlie."

            "content": "This is Kix. I'll take this one. So I think one of the biggest surprises around FlashArray//C is it's largely been completely unanswered by the competition. And so we've really enabled ourselves to go after a whole new set of use cases around Tier two data with FlashArray//C and inoperability between X and C allows customers to implement tiering strategies and to really have applications mostly go back and forth between Tier one and Tier two flash. So it's been a great growth story. I haven't heard much from the competition on it at all. And so we feel like that's a great part of our business that set up well for the year. Yes. One of the dimension I would add that I think sometimes folks miss it Pure as-a-Service is also a transportable subscription. And so the conversation we're having with customers is about being able to deploy now on-prem. But having that optionality to move to the cloud whenever they like is really game changing. And it's something that differentiates our as a service offering compared to all the competition."

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers presentation there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Please be advised that today\u2019s conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Head of Investor Relations Matt Danziger. Thank you. Please go ahead, sir.\nMatthew Danziger: Thank you and good afternoon. Welcome to the Pure Storage third quarter fiscal 2020 earnings conference call. Joining me today are our CEO, Charles Giancarlo; our COO, Paul Mountford; our Vice Chair, David Hatfield; and our VP of Strategy, Matt Kixmoeller.  Before we begin, I would like to remind you that during this call management will make forward-looking statements which are subject to various risks and uncertainties. These include statements regarding competitive, industry and technology trends, our strategy, positioning and opportunity, our current and future products, business and operations including our operating model, growth prospects and revenue and margin guidance for future periods. Any forward-looking statements that we make are based on assumptions as of today, and we undertake no obligation to update them. Our actual results may differ materially from the results predicted, and reported results should not be considered as an indication of future performance.

An archive of the webcast will be available on the IR website for at least 45 days and is the property of Pure Storage. With that, I'll turn the call over to our CEO, Charles Giancarlo.\nCharles Giancarlo: Thank you, Matt, and good afternoon everyone. Thank you for joining us on today\u2019s earnings call. I will begin by sharing our high-level results and highlights from the quarter. Hat will provide a go-to-market update, and I will close with our guidance for the remainder of FY20. Revenue for Q3 was $428 million, up 15% year-over-year, significantly faster than our major competitors and the market as a whole. Continued pricing declines, which were higher than we expected, accounted for the gap to our revenue expectations at the beginning of the quarter, although we are also seeing signs of a more challenging global business environment as commented on by other large infrastructure suppliers. Despite these in-quarter headwinds, Pure achieved all-time-high gross margins this quarter of 71.7%, well above our guided range of 66% to 69%. Operating margin for the quarter was 6.8%, at the high end of our guided range. These results speak to the resiliency of our model in the current environment. Turning to Executive Leadership; we recently announced important changes to our leadership team at Pure. After almost seven years, David Hatfield is starting a new chapter at Pure, transitioning to Vice Chair and serving as a strategic advisor to Pure, reporting to me. Hat is moving into a role where he can leverage his passion, focusing on delivering Pure\u2019s value and vision to new customers and partners, globally. I am very excited that Paul Mountford has joined Pure as Chief Operating Officer on November 4. Paul was most recently CEO at Riverbed Technology, and earlier held the role of Chief Sales Officer. His deep knowledge and experience makes him the right person to drive Pure\u2019s next stage of growth and extend our market leadership. Paul assumes responsibility for all Go-to-Market activities, including Sales, Channels, Alliances and Marketing, as well as Customer Experience, including Support and Professional Services. Third, we announced today that Kevan Krysler will be joining Pure as our new CFO in early December. Most recently, Kevan was Senior Vice President of Finance and Chief Accounting Officer at VMware. He will bring a wealth of experience both in Finance and in building scale, and has highly relevant industry experience. Prior to VMware, Kevan was a partner with KPMG, where he served both multi-national and emerging software and technology companies. He will participate in our next Earnings call. These changes and additions to our team will set us up for an incredibly successful second decade.  Turning to highlights from the quarter, we hosted our largest-ever, Accelerate user conference in Austin this past quarter. We introduced almost a dozen new products and services, which were all immediately available. We also shared our vision, which will power the next decade of Pure\u2019s innovation and growth. We call this vision the Modern Data Experience. In Pure\u2019s first decade we redefined what a modern data storage array looked like, fundamentally resetting the bar for the competitive landscape. Despite these advances, data storage still remains the least cloud-like layer of technology in the data center. Delivering data storage in an enterprise is still an extraordinarily manual process with storage arrays highly customized and dedicated to particular workloads. It is data that powers digital transformation, but data storage remains one of its biggest obstacles, because of the limitations of today\u2019s 30-year old storage architecture. Pure is transforming storage to a modern, more cloud-like model, helping our customers to run their operations as a true, automated, storage-as-a-service cloud, delivering consistent data services seamlessly across on-prem and public cloud infrastructure. Pure delivers this modern data experience through our products, solutions and services, built around four key tenets: First, we believe FAST MATTERS. Whether we\u2019re helping customers launch rockets, detect real-time threats or compile code and push releases, Fast Matters.  When looking to deliver data for high-performance applications or enabling multiple applications to access data on one consistent platform, fast matters. We deliver solutions that push the boundaries on low latency, with our new FlashArray with DirectMemory; high bandwidth for big data, with our new twice as larger FlashBlade; and greater efficiency, with our end-to-end QLC-optimized FlashArray//C. Second, we believe in CLOUD EVERYWHERE. Organizations want to both, transform their on-prem operations to the cloud model, and seamlessly link to the public cloud for IT agility. Customers also want a single, consistent, data storage architecture for all clouds, public and private. Cloud Block Store provides multi-cloud consistent operations, including migration, test/dev, disaster recovery and protection for all applications. Our offering on AWS was made Generally Available this past quarter, and we recently previewed Pure Cloud Block Store on Microsoft Azure at the Microsoft Ignite conference. Third, is a core belief that SIMPLE IS SMART. As we all know, making things ridiculously complex is standard practice in IT. Making things simple is hard work. Pure has built a reputation for delivering products that manage themselves, and for those elements that don\u2019t, we leverage increasing intelligence from our Pure1 Meta AI Engine, to deliver a self-driving, self-managing storage experience, preventing problems and enabling as-a-service automation. We are leveraging these capabilities to simplify the entire enterprise storage experience. And finally, a SUBSCRIPTION TO INNOVATION. Unlike other products on the market, Pure products look and act like a SaaS service in terms of continual upgrades and new functionality. With Pure\u2019s Evergreen storage, every product our customers bought in the past, and every product they buy today will always be new, and will constantly evolve toward an ever more modern data experience, all without service downtime or paying for the same storage twice. Pure is leading the industry in both delivering the Modern Data Experience, as well as allowing customers to consume as a true 100% OpEx service. We have seen strong traction and adoption for Pure as-a-Service, formerly ES2, signaling a trend from customers for this type of consumption model. Unlike other offerings in the market, Pure makes its entire portfolio available as-a-Service. We have reimagined the box-based enterprise storage environment as an integrated enterprise-wide storage experience. We\u2019re delivering storage-as-a-service to fuel our customer\u2019s digital transformation. Pure\u2019s Modern Data Experience sets us up well to continue to grow our share of the large data storage market. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Hat.\nDavid Hatfield: Thanks, Charlie. We believe that our Modern Data Experience is the way forward, enabling digital businesses to extract more value from their data, while improving performance and reducing complexity and expense of managing infrastructure. Pure\u2019s modern approach helps companies deliver on their most strategic initiatives, empowering them to achieve outcomes that were not previously possible.  Because of this, Pure is taking market share and at our Investor Day, we shared that Pure was growing 10x faster than our closest competitor. Customers are being done a disservice by others in the industry who still require forklift upgrades and who are NOT innovating, while Pure\u2019s customers benefit from our expanding technology portfolio, industry-leading customer satisfaction, and differentiated Evergreen ownership model. Pure is being chosen because we enable customers to modernize their existing applications and accelerate their adoption of multi-cloud, containers and real-time analytics. Our focus on the Cloud, Enterprise, Commercial and Government segments continues to progress nicely. We finished the quarter with more than 7,000 total customers, adding approximately six net-new customers per day, equating to nearly 400 new customers in Q3. The Government segment in particular continued to be a bright spot in Q3, with business doubling on a year-to-date basis.  Turning to momentum in our portfolio; our ability to make the Modern Data Experience a reality for customers today and into the future has never been more evident. Our industry-leading Pure1 SaaS platform makes it extremely easy for customers to manage their hybrid cloud environments across our portfolio, including FlashArray//X, FlashArray//C, FlashBlade, and Cloud Data Services.  Pure\u2019s simple and automated platform allows customers to consolidate their primary and secondary workloads, delivering faster access to more of their data at a much lower total cost of ownership and is an ideal fit for next-generation data analytics and Rapid Restore use cases. Following our announcement at Accelerate, we have seen the fastest growth of any product we have ever launched with the introduction of our FlashArray//C targeted for tier two. In the quarter, ServiceNow, a leading SaaS company, an existing customer of FlashArray//X and FlashBlade, has now added the all-NVMe FlashArray//C to their environment, with the goal of eliminating spinning disk for tier two workloads. We share their vision of creating an all-flash data center for better reliability, cost, and performance, so they can continue to deliver world-class service levels for their customers. Pure\u2019s Cloud Data Services, including Cloud Block Store on AWS enables data mobility and empowers customers to achieve on-prem economics in the public cloud. And, as part of our multi-cloud strategy, we recently launched our technical preview of Cloud Block Store on Microsoft Azure at the recent Microsoft Ignite conference.  With the growing set of products and unique Pure as-a-Service subscription model, customers can take advantage of our innovation on-prem or in their preferred public cloud whenever and however they want, today or in the future. We\u2019ve always been the most innovative and now we are also the safest choice for customers. Lastly, on a personal note, I want to take a moment to thank our customers, partners and Pure team for the past seven years. They have been the most fulfilling and rewarding of my career. Together, we changed the industry with Evergreen Storage, built an incredible company culture and we grew the business from $0 to more than $1.5 billion, as fast as any Enterprise IT company in history. I\u2019ll be staying on in my new role to help with transition, planning and strategy. I am excited that Paul has joined the team as COO and I look forward to partnering closely with him to help set-up 2020 and beyond for incredible success. While my role is changing, what will never waver is my excitement and enthusiasm and our ability to make an impact on our customers every day. We are as optimistic as ever to execute on our long-term vision to deliver the Modern Data Experience and provide freedom for organizations to build for today and tomorrow. We truly are just getting started. And with that, I will now turn it back over to Charlie, Charlie?\nCharlie Giancarlo: Thank you, Hat. Moving to key financial highlights, we finished the quarter with cash and investments of $1.2 billion, an increase of $59 million from the previous quarter. Free cash flow in Q3 was strong at positive $43 million. We delivered strong deferred revenue again in the quarter. At the end of the quarter, deferred revenue was $643 million, an increase of 39% over the same period a year ago and included a record amount of Pure as-a-Service deal, again formerly ES2. Now I will turn to guidance. In setting our guidance for the remainder of the year, we have taken into account the pricing declines we\u2019ve seen in the past two quarters, as well as a more challenging global environment. We are highly differentiated as evidenced by our industry-leading growth and gross margins, and accordingly we remain focused on continuing to invest in a fiscally prudent manner as evidenced by our operating profit guide which is within the range that we offered last quarter. For Q4 of fiscal 2020, we expect revenues in the range of $484 million to $496 million, $490 million at the midpoint; gross margin in the range of between 67.5% and 70.5%; and operating margin in the range of between 10% and 14% or 12% at the midpoint. For the full year of fiscal 2020, we now expect revenues in the range of between $1.635 billion and $1.647 billion or $1.641 billion at the midpoint; Gross margin in the range of between 69.2% and 70.1%; and operating margin in the range of between 2.6% and 3.9% or 3.2% at the midpoint. With that, we\u2019ll open it up for questions. Operator.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Alex Kurtz from KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nAlex Kurtz: Thanks guys. Can you hear me okay?\nCharles Giancarlo: Yes. Hi Alex.\nAlex Kurtz: Hey, good afternoon. Hat, it\u2019s been great working with you. Hopefully we\u2019ll hear you on future calls, but thanks for working with the investment community. \nDavid Hatfield: As always. \nAlex Kurtz: Near-term or long-term question here, so real quick on the quarter. Charlie, when you look at units or deals or however you want to look at it, like excluding the ASP dynamic, did you hit that number. I guess trying to account for, was there deal slippage that was part of this or is it really on the pricing and you actually got to the number of array shift and then longer term\u2026 Go ahead.\nCharles Giancarlo: Sorry. Well, let me answer that and then I'll let you ask, go on. So we shipped all the units we expected to ship, so it really was an overall pricing issue and that made up for all of miss, so it was entirely on target.\nAlex Kurtz: Okay. And then I think longer term the question is going to become, you know customers get used to the lower pricing in the broader all-flash market, right. And I think there\u2019s a fair skepticism among investors that even with the NAND environment being more favorable for you and your competitors over the next couple of years perhaps, customers aren't going to respond and allow the market to see a pricing increase. So what gives you the confidence that that's not going to happen; that the customers aren't going to just acclimate it to the new pricing levels that we're seeing right now.\nCharles Giancarlo: Well, interestingly Alex, it's good when customers get acclimated to the new pricing, because it allows elasticity to take place and to penetrate, remember less than 20 \u2013 flash is less than 20% of the overall storage market by bits, right. It's 30% by dollars, but less than 20% by bits. So as pricing goes down, we get to take up more of the magnetic market.  The issue is that when pricing drops so quickly in an individual quarter, the market doesn't catch up on elasticity. You know we saw a double-digit drop in pricing each of the last few quarters. That's just very unusual. It was obviously difficult to predict that sort of thing, because it's not normal. But now that pricing is where it is, that bodes well for volumes as we go forward and it can't continue to drop at that rate. FlashArray//C takes advantage of this, right. FlashArray//C is going to now start to penetrate what are typically magnetic workloads in the so called second tier market, that's a very good thing for us. And pricing will eventually moderate. It will reduce its rate of decline; will continue to decline, but reduce its rate, and that's very good for the flash business, very good for us.\nAlex Kurtz: Alright, thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ittai Kidron from Oppenheimer.\nIttai Kidron: Thanks. And maybe Charlie, I'm going to follow up on Alex's questions. Can you talk about how pricing was in the first three weeks of November and what is your working assumption with regards to your guide, that you are a stable pricing from here or there is more to come and I have a follow-up.\nCharles Giancarlo: Yeah. Pricing varies a lot week-by-week, just deal dynamics as you go through. So I can't say that there is a clear \u2013 I can't call exactly when pricing will ease in our market. What we do know is at the commodity level, pricing has not just firmed up, but it's higher right now. Commodity pricing for NAND is in fact higher as of this month. How long that takes to go through you know everybody's inventory and the market and pricing, you know by the time it gets to array pricing? That's why this is a very \u2013 right now we're in a market that's a little bit more challenging to forecast.\nIttai Kidron: Got it. And as a follow-up, not that anyone doesn't appreciate good profits, but could one make the case that you're under investing in your business, you know given the growth in your portfolio and what it's reaching from a vertical, an enterprise tier, an application and use case tier. Shouldn't you perhaps invest more in your operating business and how do you feel about productivity level? You haven't mentioned that. I assume you're happy with productivity?\nCharles Giancarlo: So let me start with the first part of that and I'll pass the productivity one over to Hat. You know unfortunately one can't have it both ways. You know that is to say investing aggressively in the business even during a period of headwinds and also showing investors and your own company that you can be fiscally responsible.  But more than that, honestly every company \u2013 you know we are in a bit of a cyclical business and we take these opportunities to drive more efficiency out of the business and to allow the organizations to catch up on the growth that they've already put into place and make it more productive. So I actually view this is an opportunity to drive efficiency in the operation and as the business hopefully picks up, which I expect it will at some point, we'll begin some additional investment. Hat, do you want to talk about productivity?\nDavid Hatfield: Yeah, I think productivity is in line with our expectations. The latest cohorts that we brought in are our largest classes and they are coming in line with the most productive cohorts from earlier on.  Now, we did put a lot of those into the enterprise segment and the enterprise segment, we knew as we shared in previous quarters, take long to longer sales cycles, etcetera, and with some of the challenging environment that we're seeing in the large enterprise, you know that may take a little bit longer for it to hit the bottom line, but we're very confident. We time those investments to be in line with the product expansion capabilities that we've got and the market share gains and we know it\u2019s the right long-term bet for the business. So there is no doubt that when things turn we're going to be very well positioned to capitalize that in the enterprise.\nIttai Kidron: Very good. Good luck, guys.\nCharles Giancarlo: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers from Wells Fargo.\nAaron Rakers: Yeah, thanks guys. And I apologize for the background noise here, but two questions if I can as well.  First of all, just kind of looking at the guidance, the commentary you offered suggested that you are seeing signs of macro softening. Just curious of what you saw you know as far as the progression of those signs of weakening through the quarter and how do I fit your guidance, midpoint of guidance being up $62 million sequentially in revenue versus like $50 million last year on fiscal 4Q, $62 million a year ago in '18 when the storage market was healthy relative to that kind of softening macro commentary that you offer. I'm just trying to understand what's kind of embedded in the midpoint of your guidance here for revenue this quarter, and again, I do have a follow-up.\nCharles Giancarlo: Thank you. Thank you, Aaron. So as we went through the quarter, we do see \u2013 my experience is that when you do see a little bit of macro headwinds, that it is typically the enterprise that slows down their buying first and by slows down, I just mean things slips, second looks, longer decision cycles, etcetera and we did have seen some of that. The second is, we did term this, not so much as macro, but as globally, economically challenging. We are seeing things that we think of it, Brexit slowdowns, the trade tensions in the \u2013 you know with Asia, those are the things where we saw more slowdown than other areas and that just indicates a little bit of global economic headwinds. And Hat, I will let you take the...\nDavid Hatfield: Yes, so I mean, I think the headline here is if the pricing were in line with our forecast, we would have been within the range that we had. So really do feel like it's pricing, but we are looking at these international phenomenons, in the U.K. specifically, Japan specifically as well as some of the enterprise deals. We're not seeing loss rates decrease. They are improving if anything, so we see really steady win rates that are out there. So it's just a little bit more slowing of the decisions and more pushes. So we have that contemplated in our Q4.\nCharles Giancarlo: Right. And the last thing just on the year-to-year comp, remember last Q4 we had that shipping issue that left product on the doc, so it affects the comps.\nAaron Rakers: Fair point. The follow-up question is, you know if I can, when we think about the pricing dynamics in NAND and I can appreciate that NAND is still less than you know flash and it\u2019s still less than 20% of the bit ship, but to help us appreciate the pricing dynamic, would you say this quarter we saw an acceleration in the growth of your bit shipments relative to last quarter. So just trying to understand and put some context behind elasticity.\nCharles Giancarlo: Yeah, this year in general, the bit shipments are way, way up. That's made up for a large portion of the decrease in prices, but as I said, when prices decline double digit within a quarter as they have in the last two quarters, it's just difficult, just difficult to catch up.\nAaron Rakers: Okay, fair enough. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Simon Leopold from Raymond James.\nSimon Leopold: Great, thank you. I've got one kind of near-term and one longer-term question. On the near-term, when you're discussing the pricing environment, I'd like to get a better understanding of, is this about a particular price aggressor in the market or is this the general behavior of everybody responding to essentially the customers\u2019 willingness to pay. Is it coming from competitors or from customers and then I've got a follow-up.\nCharles Giancarlo: In my experience, it's coming from competitors. I think there are a variety of different competitive strategies in the market. In our case we are a value-oriented competitor, we do not lead with price, but we do respond. There is at least one other competitor out there that I feel operates in the same way, but there are competitors that I would argue are cost-plus competitors, so that is that.  When they see \u2013 they'll sell based on a gross margin model that they've built and they'll go to price right away, and those are the ones that lead with price in the market and then we follow. So it's really how the cost flows through their P&L, through their inventory that makes the difference.\nSimon Leopold: Thank you. And then my follow up is longer term oriented. I want to try to get a better understanding regarding the prospects from the FlashArray//C. You just announced that in September, presumably that's not really contributing much, but you've talked about TAM expansion. Could you put some numbers around how to think about what that product does for the revenue opportunities? Thank you.\nCharles Giancarlo: You bet. So that product, it has had the fastest growth of any new product we've ever introduced, including our first product. So that's of course \u2013 now, of course it was widely anticipated. It was something that we had been talking about with customers for some time, but it is \u2013 it bodes very well for us. Now when we say \u2013 when you say TAM expansion, let me just make sure we are all consistent here. You know we discuss it as opening up more of the TAM that we've put into place and we believe it opens up over the next year or two, you know another $5 billion of TAM that we can expand into. So it's a big market. It opens up a new part of the market that we did not generally sell into before.\nSimon Leopold: Great! Thank you very much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Wamsi Mohan from Bank of America.\nWamsi Mohan: Thank you. I apologize for the background noise. I'm at an airport. Hopefully, you can hear me. While you came in at the higher end of the range for operating margins, your incremental year-on-year is almost the same as the incremental OpEx. Are you running the business with these levels of investment, with an expectation of acceleration in the future or you expecting this mid teen growth rate, although much better than the industry as a new normal and I have a follow-up.\nCharles Giancarlo: Yeah, we're not viewing that as the new normal. We do believe that as we add new products and as pricing stabilizes, the world will get better, but of course, we're not guiding to next year yet. But obviously as I said, I think this has been a challenging year with the pricing declines and we believe life will get better; our FlashArray//C, CBS the products on Azure, and so forth. We're very proud and pleased with the new products we're putting in the market.  We believe, we'll be the aggressor. You know if we continue taking market share at the rates that we're taking market share, in a market that is fundamentally $30 billion to $50 billion, you know we've got a lot of opportunity ahead of us.\nWamsi Mohan: Okay, thanks Charlie. And again as a follow-up, you mentioned price elasticity. I mean it feels like this was the year where you should have seen very significant price elasticity and I think you said you did. Clearly that didn't translate into acceleration in revenue growth because of the pricing itself. Now, as you look forward, why should there be an acceleration in revenue growth? You know price inelasticity kicks in when the pricing doesn't go down quite as fast. So I guess I'm trying to just understand this in the context of what the actual true underlying commodity pricing is doing to the revenue growth.\nCharles Giancarlo: Sure, we've studied this over many years, right. And as prices come down, elasticity goes up. Flash takes over more of the magnetic market. So you have to have price coming down in flash in order to take up more of the market, and this is going to happen.  Now, we would love a world where flash comes down predictably every single quarter and pricing follow suit a couple of quarters later. That would allow customers to plan and for us to be able to better guide, but the fact of the matter is that flash prices vary dramatically with supply of new fabs and demand varying as we saw last quarter or the quarter before rather with hyper-scaler demand and that fluctuation eventually makes its way to our market. But over the long term, the elasticity is real and with very fast price dropping, it usually means slower price dropping in the following year. So while we can't predict it exactly, on a long-term basis, you can.\nWamsi Mohan: Thanks Charlie.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Rod Hall from Goldman Sachs.\nBala Reddy: Hi, this is Bala Reddy on for Rod. Thanks for taking my questions. Just want to better understand the macro weakness that you cited here. So if the macro situation had been better in the quarter, then would that have compensated the pricing pressure issue that you cited?\nCharles Giancarlo: I think what you're asking, if the macro had been better, would that have overcome the pricing? The pricing was by far the dominant reason for the gap to our original guidance, but there is no question \u2013 I mean we're only talking about 2% here, you know and a stronger macro could easily have made that up.\nBala Reddy: If I look at the full year revenue guidance like from the first time that you gave in fiscal Q4 last year. So the overall guide is down like 7% for the full year. Can you help us quantify each of the issues that impacted the revenues in the year? I know you cited the weakness in large enterprise as well a couple of quarters back. So just trying to better understand how to rank order these issues here?\nCharles Giancarlo: It's the same issue really. It really is \u2013 the vast majority is pricing, but of course a stronger macro. We're not talking about a lot of percent; stronger macro might have been able to make that up. But again, when you're \u2013 when you face \u2013 really, this year is quite remarkable in terms of the pricing decline in the market.\nBala Reddy: Thanks. Just had a quick follow-up on the macro question. So, I know that you had an exposure to large, as well as mid-market in addition to SaaS cloud too. Like, which of this \u2013 in the quarter particularly, which of the segments did not do as expected?\nDavid Hatfield: Well, we actually had nice progress as I mentioned in the public sector. Our commercial business was solid for the quarter. There were some ups and downs internationally, and I think those are tied largely to some of the macro issues. There\u2019s some execution in there as well, but the vast majority of it on the international front was tied to very specific markets that are challenged.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Karl Ackerman from Cowen.\nKarl Ackerman: Hey, good afternoon, gentlemen. Two questions if I may. The first is a follow-up question on demand. At your Accelerate conference, you spoke about how the deal funnel was shifting toward more larger deals. Do you see the incremental, your incremental revenue opportunity and the global accounts that are outside of the traditional realm of your SMB focus.  One of your peers spoke about how the chief procurer of storage is shifting away from a traditional storage IT manager. Are those two dynamics the primary influencers of your performance this year, and I guess, how do we combat that going forward?\nDavid Hatfield: Well, this is Hat. I'll take a crack at that. We've seen nice progress in the segments that we serve. Like I just mentioned you know in the Public Sector, Government space, in the commercial segment and in the cloud business continuing to represent a north of 30% of our overall business, so we see sound performance there.  Enterprise, large enterprise was a little bit weaker than what we expected and that we think is tied you know partially to the overall macro.  The changing persona and the decision maker is something that we've been driving the last few years. You know our next generation analytics platform with FlashBlade is largely sold into DevOps, is then sold into the business owner and we've you know made a business you know in our traditional storage attack plan to go you know at the database admin or the virtual system admin or other folks that actually saw the benefits of flash removing latency.  So it's always been a multi-threaded sales process and so we feel comfortable in our ability to go attack that. A lot of what our focus with the modern day experience is shifting from a product-by-product, business unit-by-business units, workload-by-workload kind of sales campaign into more of a platform and a portfolio sale, and leading with our Tier 1 and our peer as a service subscription model is really differentiated.  It really does enable flexibility commercially for customers, and technically allows them to you know put their data where they need to today and move it without penalty in the future, and so as that starts to continue to get traction, we believe that will continue to help us get higher up in the organization and sell a little differentiated platform solution for supplying product solution. \nKarl Ackerman: I appreciate that. Going back to FlashArray//C for a moment, just curious on what level of revenue essentially gets implied for FlashArray//C in the December quarter and I guess you know how do you see that progressing in the next few quarters and what do you need to do to drive increased customer adoption. It sounds like it\u2019s going well, but just any additional metrics there would be helpful. Thank you.\nCharles Giancarlo: Right. Well, as you know, we don't really provide metrics on a product-by-product basis and especially on new products, because new products tend to be lumpy as you're getting through the sales force and new customer experience and so forth.  But that being said, as I said, this is the largest and fastest new product adoption cycle that we've seen at the company ever. I think it bodes well for us. It's a product that by the way is a FlashArray, just with a lower price, lower cost storage module in it, so our customers know it, our field knows it, our channels know it, so from that sense it's easy to sell. Kix, I think Kix has some additional commentary here.\nMatt Kixmoeller: Yeah, I\u2019d also just say than in the last call there was some concern about whether it might be cannibalistic of FlashArray//X, and we made a point of being really close to all the first deployments of FlashArray\u2019s team. They were really pleased with really the net new use cases in motions that it went into. You know we largely targeted Tier 2 applications that might have been on disk, as well as Tier 2 DR and opening up new tiers of applications for DR and so really pleased with them being sold together as opposed to an alternative to one another. \nCharles Giancarlo: I will add one other piece of color. You know we have seven and eight digit deals in the pipeline for this product, so it's a \u2013 you know clearly it's something that stands out. \nKarl Ackerman: Thank you. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Katy Huberty from Morgan Stanley. \nKaty Huberty: Yes, thank you. Charlie, can you just be specific around what you're assuming in the January quarter round price elasticity. It sounds like you didn't see that in the October quarter, expect it to come through. Just not clear whether there's an assumption around whether you see it in January and then I have a follow-up.\nA - Charles Giancarlo: Yeah, we certainly didn't expect double digit this past quarter and we don't expect double digit this coming quarter, so we do expect it to moderate and I wish we could be absolutely positive about that, but without knowing you know the other demand signals for NAND, without knowing the inventory levels \u2013 past inventory levels of competitors, as I said it's hard to pin down with the exact timing. \nKaty Huberty: But are you assuming faster unit growth in the January quarter, because the prices \u2013 the lower prices have now been in the market for several months. \nA - Charles Giancarlo: Certainly, certainly. \nKaty Huberty: Okay, and then just a follow up on FlashArray//C, can you talk about you know whether it's the type of customers by size or vertical or what are the most popular applications that you are seeing FlashArray//C get pulled into?\nMatt Kixmoeller: Yeah, this is Kix, I\u2019ll take this one as well. So I think the first thing to realize about FlashArray//C is its a lower cost per gig, but it's quite large and so our key target has really been larger organizations who have big, big slots of Tier 2 data and so we\u2019ve seen it go into larger environments where they are just going after their Tier 2 applications.  We've also seen customers who deal with very large research data, very large types of IoT data, etcetera, become interested in the platform, because it opens up use of Flash at a fundamentally different Tier.\nKaty Huberty: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mehdi Hosseini from SIG.\nMehdi Hosseini: Yes, thanks for taking my question. I want to go back to the trends in your product revenue and also deferred revenue. I see de-acceleration in both product revenue and deferred revenue and I'm just wondering outside of the pricing pressure, is it a reflection of delay in the ramp of new products. It seems to me your still lacking the diversification in the product mix and in that context. Is it going to take another fiscal year to see that diversification improving and is that really needed to see a higher growth rate, and this is outside of the pricing trend. I'm just trying to separate pricing from product mix.\nCharles Giancarlo: Yeah, well currently our revenue is made up primarily of two physical products of FlashArray, FlashBlade and then of course the subscription and support activities surrounding those two. And we do have our Pure as-a-Service model, but that's still a relatively small revenue stream associated with that. So by far, the deferred revenue is made up of those subscription streams.  Now as we mentioned at our Accelerate offsite, you know we've seen big pickups in subscription, especially in elongation of the contract period for the subscription as customers have found great value in the Evergreen service overall.  But you're largely correct. I mean a lot of the growth rate that we expect in the future is based on new product. FlashArray//C is off to a good start, Cloud Block Store, a high interest level, but still very early days and then of course we are anticipating our File Services coming out mid next year. So these are all things we look forward to and believe will expand our opportunity.\nMehdi Hosseini: Just as a follow-up, if File Services is coming out mid-year, could that help with acceleration in growth rate or should we just assume that fiscal year \u201821 altogether is a transitional phase for the company.\nCharles Giancarlo: Well first, again we're not going to guide fiscal year \u201821 just yet, but we don't invest in new products just to give engineers fun things to work on. The expectation is that it will improve our growth. You know we are very focused on growing this company, we're very focused on being the leader in storage and that has a lot of years of growth left to us to be able to deliver that and of course we're delivering it as a very new and different architecture; you know what we're calling the modern data experience. That is going to make it more of a platform rather than a set of isolated boxes.\nMehdi Hosseini: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Amit Daryanani from Evercore.\nAmit Daryanani: Yeah, thanks for taking my question guys; I have two as well. First off, maybe just help us put some context around your gross margin; that just came in well ahead of your expectations. I am wondering, why not the decision to perhaps be more pricing aggressive and keep the margins within your target and perhaps drive more revenue growth? Was there not that price elasticity for you to take advantage of or you just didn't want to go down that path.\nCharles Giancarlo: Well, I think you saw one of our competitors also come in with higher gross margin, so it indicates that there has been at least some \u2013 you know with such drops \u2013 as I mentioned, double-digit drop in price during the quarter. So there's been a lot of price activity, but obviously cost activity was better than price activity for at least one of our competitors out there as it was for us. Now, part of the gross margin improvement was based on mix. The mix is a shift towards larger arrays. Now I'm not talking about a mix between products, but a mix to larger systems and the larger systems tend to have higher gross margin, but we also benefited a lot from a COGS reduction.  Your point is, look, the field has complete flexibility to drive price if it's going to win a deal. We don't ever want to lose on price, but as I say, we don't lead with price either. So we're doing everything we can to drive the top line, we're not going to hold it for additional margin, but it's the way it worked out this quarter.\nAmit Daryanani : Understood! And then if I could just follow-up on Cloud Block Store, just what feedback are you having or adoption you're seeing from your customers there and perhaps if you could talk about your appetite or the roadmap to have a comparable offering at other platforms beyond AWS.\nMatt Kixmoeller: Yeah, so we announced the GA of Cloud Block Store and Azure at Accelerate this year and I'd say the industry analysts and customer excitement around that was very high, and we saw both excitement around it, translate right into our core business, in terms of being able to have conversations around cloud architecture and hybrid cloud that frankly we weren't invited to before, and then we saw customers really diving in with key use cases. Our key focus in this market has been to really focus on Tier 1 applications moving to the cloud and Tier 1 applications run on block storage. And so to give you an example of one of the first production deployments, we have a customer who runs SAP on-prem on Pure and they\u2019ve taken advantage of Cloud Block Store to really move test to the cloud and so it's a perfect hybrid case.  You have SAP running on Tier 1 on-prem, you're replicating data to the cloud, refreshing it constantly and that particular customer was able to get 40 to one data reduction in their test dev-environment. So think about the ROI of saving the cloud savings there and enabling that new model for more agile test dev. These are the types of use cases that were really driving into the market with CBS.\nAmit Daryanani: Perfect! Thank you, guys.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jason Ader from William Blair.\nJason Ader: Yeah. Thank you. Guys, there\u2019s been some talk out there on some of the SaaS companies moving their data centers to the Big 3 infrastructure as a service vendors, and I'm wondering if that's something that you have seen at all in your SaaS vertical, where some of your traditional customers are deciding to outsource their data centers to the Big 3 and if so, what's your outlook on that segment of the business going forward?\nCharles Giancarlo: Yeah, it's a great question, Jason. I think we actually see both activities; we see people oddly enough moving to the cloud, but we also see people moving out of the cloud, especially their data storage, because data storage tends to be extraordinarily expensive in the cloud environment.  Cloud Block Store is meant to make it easier to move in both directions. That is to say that makes it easier to lift and shift into the cloud if your cloud data experience looks similar if not identical to what's on-prem and of course we have a lot of value in the cloud as Matt just mentioned; lower cost and higher performance, But also it makes it easier if you decide if you're in the cloud using our service and then want to move back on-prem as many customers have done to reduce their overall costs.  It also makes it easier to move in that direction as well. And from our standpoint, a terabyte is a terabyte between cloud and on-prem, one contract, one price.\nJason Ader: So is it fair to say that your SaaS vertical segment have seen above company growth rate like you have historically.\nCharles Giancarlo: We've seen no effect, honestly from the phenomenon you're talking about with our SaaS, in our SaaS business.\nJason Ader: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Matt Cabral from Credit Suisse.\nMatt Cabral: Yeah, thank you. You talked a lot earlier this year about ramping sales capacity by 40%. You touched on this a little bit earlier, but can you just talk a little bit more about where you are in getting that cohort productive and just how you're thinking about your hiring plans going into next year, given some of the revenue slowdown you're seeing?\nDavid Hatfield: Yeah, so as I mentioned, you know a lot of the sales capacity investments did go into the enterprise knowing full well that it was going take a bit longer for those to ramp and to hit the bottom line, but that it was the right long-term move for us. The new cohorts that we brought on board are ramping nicely. They're really in line with what we have seen previously and what we expected out of them going forward. As we look at you know, and as Paul and I kind of work together on the allocation of those sales resources across the globe and across the segments, as you do any year, you kind of fine tune that to make sure you get the right mix of long-term and mid-term ROI. But we're very confident in the investments that we\u2019ve made and are going to pay dividends for us. It may take a little bit longer, but we're very confident that we made the right bets going into the year.\nMatt Cabral: And then just, how you are thinking about the hiring plans going into next year, given some of the revenue dynamics?\nCharles Giancarlo: Yeah. Well clearly, we're not going \u2013 we invested ahead. We knew this year, we invested ahead. Those assets, those people that we hired are going to be much more productive in the second year as like in any ramped environment. That allows us to be a bit more, let's say, prudent or slow down our hiring for this coming year, really to match much more our growth rate as we go in.\nMatt Cabral: Got it. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Steven Fox from Cross Research.\nSteven Fox: Thanks, good afternoon. I was wondering if you could just sort of give us a little more color on the gross margin. So if we think about the 230 basis points improvement quarter-over-quarter, how much of that was related to mix versus the benefits of cost over exceeding price declines.\nCharles Giancarlo: Yeah. It was a little less than \u2013 half of it was mix. The largest part of course was the cost reduction compared to the price reduction, so costs lowering or having lower.  Remember, it takes about six weeks to eight weeks for inventory to flow through our system, right. So we started off with a lot of low cost NAND and product in the pipeline as we went through the quarter, as I mentioned toward the end of the quarter and certainly in this quarter, prices in NAND have literally gone up, so the majority of it was price, but a significant portion of it was mix.\nSteven Fox: Okay, that's very helpful. And then just on the macro pressures you're now seeing, I think like 90 days ago, you sort of had your antennas up, but you really weren't seeing it as much as maybe some of your competitors were. What changed relative to last quarter? Is it just sort of your geographic mix, is reflected in the timing of you being hit harder now versus say competitors that saw it earlier. Or is there anything else we should think of? Thanks.\nDavid Hatfield: Yeah. No, I think it is the international mix you know tied to some of the dynamics that Charlie and I had referenced earlier. We continue to see larger deals and more bundling, but the decision cycles are just taking longer and people are pushing into longer periods of time to evaluate more looks at it, more executive needing to touch deals, etcetera, and so more work.  But the encouraging thing to us is as our win rates continue to be super strong and so we're not losing more business and we're actually seeing more terabytes included in every deal and more bundling. It's just that it's taken a little bit longer to close.\nSteven Fox: And you, when you say international mix, you mean your direct mix not necessarily, second derivative of U.S. customers who are having weaker business overseas.\nCharles Giancarlo: Yeah. No. Customers that are buying from international where the deals are originating, and so we mentioned the UK, we mentioned Japan as a couple of those examples that were lower than what we expected.\nSteven Fox: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Pinjalim Bora from JPMorgan.\nPinjalim Bora: Hey. Thanks for squeezing me in. Hat, great working with you. Could you talk about maybe a little bit more on what drove the decision for you to step away from leading sales channel? Was it thought out from a while ago, and then as we move into next year, should we expect any big changes in the sales structure processes as the new leadership takes hold?\nDavid Hatfield: Yeah, thanks Pinjalim for that, I appreciate it. It has been a great joy to be active in an operating capacity and helping build this. It's really a personal driver to be very direct. I have a health issue in my family that over the summer became very acute and I think over the last several quarters Charlie and I have been talking about what's right for Pure, and Pure deserve somebody that's got 150% of their energy that they can put into it. And so as that health issue kind of surfaced and my need to be a little bit more balanced, it was clearly the right time. We're thrilled to have gotten Paul on board. The company is going to benefit not only from his 150% focus, but his skill, experience and cross-functional experience to go drive this. So I think you know the timing is never perfect for these situations, but it's definitely the right thing for me personally and it's the right thing and very good for Pure, to have somebody like Paul step in. The third point, I'd make is that I'm still here. I'm very excited. I love this place. As Charlie mentioned, you know my real passion is to be out in front with customers and teams helping drive this. And so I look forward to helping not only in the transition, but also playing a role going forward, not only on strategy, but being able, out in the field to help with customers. So I think it's kind of a win-win for the company and for me.\nPinjalim Bora: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Sheerin from Stifel.\nAlvin Park: Hi, thank you for taking the call. This is Alvin Park on behalf of Matt Sheerin. I just wanted to confirm that revenue contributions from Pure as-a-Service and Flash ES2 was not as mature, not significantly material. And second of all, I was wondering if you could just give us some color into the economics, the revenue recognition and the cost recognition cadence versus your traditional CapEx sales, I mean Pure as-a-Service.\nCharles Giancarlo: Sure. Well first of all, I mean just on an overall absolute basis, that is correct and it's not as significant. But it's up well over 200% year-over-year, so it's growing very nicely.  Secondly, it is recognized ratably on a monthly basis, over the years, as customers purchase the service overall. It's priced at a premium currently to a traditional CapEx model. So in the three year time horizon, it tends to be richer for Pure, but it really helps those customers that really want to operate on an OpEx model overall. So does that answer your question?\nAlvin Park: Yeah. And a follow-up; so then in a CapEx versus an OpEx, you mentioned OpEx is ratable. So is it safe to say that an OpEx will be more with the subscription service afterwards will be front-end heavy, where most of the revenue and cost is recognized upfront and tempered down.\nCharles Giancarlo: No, no, the whole thing is ratable, both revenue and cost.\nAlvin Park: No. From a CapEx \u2013 you know.\nDavid Hatfield: Oh no! CapEx, we recognize roughly and for $100 we recognize we're approximately $70 upfront and then we have roughly $10 each over the three years.\nAlvin Park: So, okay \u2013 and then\u2026\nCharles Giancarlo: And sort of Pure as-a-service and what I just said about the $30 of subscription base, those are recognized the same, they're both matched, revenue and COGS.\nAlvin Park: I see. And going forward, and then do you have any projections or ideas of what your sales mix might be between the as-a-services versus your CapEx model going forward?\nCharles Giancarlo: We've not really provided that breakout. I'd say the as-a-service model is still relatively new and the new meaning, both to customers as well as our sales force. As we start to get more experience under our belt that might be something that we highlight in a \u2013 sort of in a highlighted one of our calls, but at the moment we've not really broken that out and I'm not sure we're ready to, just from an experience standpoint.\nAlvin Park: Understand. Thank you for taking the questions.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Eric Desrosiers from GMP Securities.\nEric Desrosiers: Yeah, thanks for taking the question. One, could you just talk, what competitors specifically are you seeing the pricing pressure? Is it both Dell and NetApp or who are you seeing the pressure from. Then secondly, well let me get that one and I have a follow-up.\nDavid Hatfield: Yeah, so I wouldn't say, there's any discernible difference between the large competitors from a pricing dynamic in the marketplace. Dell has always been very aggressive and kind of operates in our view in kind of a cost-plus model, you saw, NetApp, you know (a) announce 11 points negative on growth year-on-year and increased gross margin on the product line as well. So they saw some of the benefits from the COGS reduction as well. I'll just reinforce what Charlie said earlier, you know we are a very aggressive team. When we see an opportunity, particularly in the large enterprise, we sell on value and we make sure we establish that. But if we need to use gross margin points to be able to win a deal, we won't lose on price, and so that's something that we're continuing to be focused on whether we're competing with NetApp or Dell. But I think the 25 points of delta between us and the only other company so far that's reported is indicative of how differentiated our value prop is and how much share we're taking in the marketplace. So, we're going to continue to be aggressive. If we could have put more of those gross margin points to work, we would have \u2013 that was a negating factor. You know the pricing dynamic was really kind of across the board and again, we believe that's temporary. Hopefully, it will start to firm up in Q4, like we talked about, but we feel very good about next year.\nEric Desrosiers: Okay. Then, real quick, I just want to confirm. In the U.S., you did not see the macro concerns. That was all international, is that correct?\nDavid Hatfield: No, we saw some of the international tied to those specific market dynamics trade and Brexit most likely, but we did see some slowness in the U.S. enterprise and I think that's an area where we like the trend, relative to pipeline and you know with the narrow span of control of our sales resource, we're getting in advance, and so we'll be able to bundle in multiple products and sell more terabytes. It's just taking a little bit longer from a deal push perspective, but win rates are holding nicely as well. So it's \u2013 we see a little bit of the international and a little bit in the large enterprise U.S.\nEric Desrosiers: Alright, thank you.\nOperator: And your last question comes from the line of Nehal Chokshi from Maxim Group.\nNehal Chokshi: Yeah, thank you. It looks like your guidance implies OpEx will be flat Q over Q more or less for a second straight quarter in a row. So it looks like there was effectively a hiring fees that's been in effect since August. Why (a) is this correct and provided it's correct, and why do this considering the opportunity in what I presume invariably will result in external slowdown of topline growth?\nCharles Giancarlo: Right. Well, to be clear, there was a hiring slowdown, but certainly not a freeze. In fact each quarter the net hires will be slightly higher than the quarter before. But again, we have to respond to the market slowdown. We are not going to run at a loss as a company and also as I mentioned earlier, I take this opportunity to allow each team to catch their breath after a lot of hiring and to rebalance their organizations. So, I actually view it as an opportunity for each group to really make sure that they're disciplined, that they are efficient and effective and that they rethink where they've placed \u2013 how they've structured their team and taken opportunity to rebuild before the next spurt of growth. So you're correct in identifying that there\u2019s been a slowdown, but there\u2019s certainly not a freeze.\nNehal Chokshi: Okay. And as a follow-up, you guys did initiate a share repurchase program on the last earnings call. It looks like you didn't utilize it all. Can you update your thoughts on (a) why you didn't utilize it and (b) what are the parameters around when you will utilize it?\nCharles Giancarlo: Well, as we indicated, when we took out the program, that we wanted that program in case of - what we saw as a huge price dislocation in the market and we have that facility at our disposal should we choose to use it, but it is really a discretionary \u2013 we're keeping it as a discretionary opportunity.\nNehal Chokshi: Okay, thank you.\nCharles Giancarlo: You bet. As we look ahead to the next decade, our goal is to take the fragmented and antiquated architecture of the current data storage environment and recreate it into a unified automated multi cloud data experience. By helping our customers to create a modern data experience, we help them to deliver real business value and we empower them to realize their digital transformation. I'd like to again welcome Paul and Kevan Krysler to the team and I want to thank Hat for his partnership and dedication to Pure these last seven years. He\u2019s had a great impact on Pure and I'm excited to continue to work with him in his new role.  For those in the U.S., I want to wish you all a very Happy Thanksgiving and I want to thank all of you on the call for your time today.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating and you may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Charles Giancarlo",
            "content": "Thank you, Matt, and good afternoon everyone. Thank you for joining us on today's earnings call. I will begin by sharing our high-level results and highlights from the quarter. Hat will provide a go-to-market update, and I will close with our guidance for the remainder of FY20. Revenue for Q3 was $428 million, up 15% year-over-year, significantly faster than our major competitors and the market as a whole. Continued pricing declines, which were higher than we expected, accounted for the gap to our revenue expectations at the beginning of the quarter, although we are also seeing signs of a more challenging global business environment as commented on by other large infrastructure suppliers. Despite these in-quarter headwinds, Pure achieved all-time-high gross margins this quarter of 71.7%, well above our guided range of 66% to 69%. Operating margin for the quarter was 6.8%, at the high end of our guided range. These results speak to the resiliency of our model in the current environment. Turning to Executive Leadership; we recently announced important changes to our leadership team at Pure. After almost seven years, David Hatfield is starting a new chapter at Pure, transitioning to Vice Chair and serving as a strategic advisor to Pure, reporting to me. Hat is moving into a role where he can leverage his passion, focusing on delivering Pure's value and vision to new customers and partners, globally. I am very excited that Paul Mountford has joined Pure as Chief Operating Officer on November 4. Paul was most recently CEO at Riverbed Technology, and earlier held the role of Chief Sales Officer. His deep knowledge and experience makes him the right person to drive Pure's next stage of growth and extend our market leadership. Paul assumes responsibility for all Go-to-Market activities, including Sales, Channels, Alliances and Marketing, as well as Customer Experience, including Support and Professional Services. Third, we announced today that Kevan Krysler will be joining Pure as our new CFO in early December. Most recently, Kevan was Senior Vice President of Finance and Chief Accounting Officer at VMware. He will bring a wealth of experience both in Finance and in building scale, and has highly relevant industry experience. Prior to VMware, Kevan was a partner with KPMG, where he served both multi-national and emerging software and technology companies. He will participate in our next Earnings call. These changes and additions to our team will set us up for an incredibly successful second decade.  Turning to highlights from the quarter, we hosted our largest-ever, Accelerate user conference in Austin this past quarter. We introduced almost a dozen new products and services, which were all immediately available. We also shared our vision, which will power the next decade of Pure's innovation and growth. We call this vision the Modern Data Experience. In Pure's first decade we redefined what a modern data storage array looked like, fundamentally resetting the bar for the competitive landscape. Despite these advances, data storage still remains the least cloud-like layer of technology in the data center. Delivering data storage in an enterprise is still an extraordinarily manual process with storage arrays highly customized and dedicated to particular workloads. It is data that powers digital transformation, but data storage remains one of its biggest obstacles, because of the limitations of today's 30-year old storage architecture. Pure is transforming storage to a modern, more cloud-like model, helping our customers to run their operations as a true, automated, storage-as-a-service cloud, delivering consistent data services seamlessly across on-prem and public cloud infrastructure. Pure delivers this modern data experience through our products, solutions and services, built around four key tenets: First, we believe FAST MATTERS. Whether we're helping customers launch rockets, detect real-time threats or compile code and push releases, Fast Matters.  When looking to deliver data for high-performance applications or enabling multiple applications to access data on one consistent platform, fast matters. We deliver solutions that push the boundaries on low latency, with our new FlashArray with DirectMemory; high bandwidth for big data, with our new twice as larger FlashBlade; and greater efficiency, with our end-to-end QLC-optimized FlashArray//C. Second, we believe in CLOUD EVERYWHERE. Organizations want to both, transform their on-prem operations to the cloud model, and seamlessly link to the public cloud for IT agility. Customers also want a single, consistent, data storage architecture for all clouds, public and private. Cloud Block Store provides multi-cloud consistent operations, including migration, test/dev, disaster recovery and protection for all applications. Our offering on AWS was made Generally Available this past quarter, and we recently previewed Pure Cloud Block Store on Microsoft Azure at the Microsoft Ignite conference. Third, is a core belief that SIMPLE IS SMART. As we all know, making things ridiculously complex is standard practice in IT. Making things simple is hard work. Pure has built a reputation for delivering products that manage themselves, and for those elements that don't, we leverage increasing intelligence from our Pure1 Meta AI Engine, to deliver a self-driving, self-managing storage experience, preventing problems and enabling as-a-service automation. We are leveraging these capabilities to simplify the entire enterprise storage experience. And finally, a SUBSCRIPTION TO INNOVATION. Unlike other products on the market, Pure products look and act like a SaaS service in terms of continual upgrades and new functionality. With Pure's Evergreen storage, every product our customers bought in the past, and every product they buy today will always be new, and will constantly evolve toward an ever more modern data experience, all without service downtime or paying for the same storage twice. Pure is leading the industry in both delivering the Modern Data Experience, as well as allowing customers to consume as a true 100% OpEx service. We have seen strong traction and adoption for Pure as-a-Service, formerly ES2, signaling a trend from customers for this type of consumption model. Unlike other offerings in the market, Pure makes its entire portfolio available as-a-Service. We have reimagined the box-based enterprise storage environment as an integrated enterprise-wide storage experience. We're delivering storage-as-a-service to fuel our customer's digital transformation. Pure's Modern Data Experience sets us up well to continue to grow our share of the large data storage market. With that, I'll turn it over to Hat. Yes. Hi Alex. Sorry. Well, let me answer that and then I'll let you ask, go on. So we shipped all the units we expected to ship, so it really was an overall pricing issue and that made up for all of miss, so it was entirely on target. Well, interestingly Alex, it's good when customers get acclimated to the new pricing, because it allows elasticity to take place and to penetrate, remember less than 20 \u2013 flash is less than 20% of the overall storage market by bits, right. It's 30% by dollars, but less than 20% by bits. So as pricing goes down, we get to take up more of the magnetic market.  The issue is that when pricing drops so quickly in an individual quarter, the market doesn't catch up on elasticity. You know we saw a double-digit drop in pricing each of the last few quarters. That's just very unusual. It was obviously difficult to predict that sort of thing, because it's not normal. But now that pricing is where it is, that bodes well for volumes as we go forward and it can't continue to drop at that rate. FlashArray//C takes advantage of this, right. FlashArray//C is going to now start to penetrate what are typically magnetic workloads in the so called second tier market, that's a very good thing for us. And pricing will eventually moderate. It will reduce its rate of decline; will continue to decline, but reduce its rate, and that's very good for the flash business, very good for us. Yeah. Pricing varies a lot week-by-week, just deal dynamics as you go through. So I can't say that there is a clear \u2013 I can't call exactly when pricing will ease in our market. What we do know is at the commodity level, pricing has not just firmed up, but it's higher right now. Commodity pricing for NAND is in fact higher as of this month. How long that takes to go through you know everybody's inventory and the market and pricing, you know by the time it gets to array pricing? That's why this is a very \u2013 right now we're in a market that's a little bit more challenging to forecast. So let me start with the first part of that and I'll pass the productivity one over to Hat. You know unfortunately one can't have it both ways. You know that is to say investing aggressively in the business even during a period of headwinds and also showing investors and your own company that you can be fiscally responsible.  But more than that, honestly every company \u2013 you know we are in a bit of a cyclical business and we take these opportunities to drive more efficiency out of the business and to allow the organizations to catch up on the growth that they've already put into place and make it more productive. So I actually view this is an opportunity to drive efficiency in the operation and as the business hopefully picks up, which I expect it will at some point, we'll begin some additional investment. Hat, do you want to talk about productivity? Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Aaron. So as we went through the quarter, we do see \u2013 my experience is that when you do see a little bit of macro headwinds, that it is typically the enterprise that slows down their buying first and by slows down, I just mean things slips, second looks, longer decision cycles, etcetera and we did have seen some of that. The second is, we did term this, not so much as macro, but as globally, economically challenging. We are seeing things that we think of it, Brexit slowdowns, the trade tensions in the \u2013 you know with Asia, those are the things where we saw more slowdown than other areas and that just indicates a little bit of global economic headwinds. And Hat, I will let you take the... Right. And the last thing just on the year-to-year comp, remember last Q4 we had that shipping issue that left product on the doc, so it affects the comps. Yeah, this year in general, the bit shipments are way, way up. That's made up for a large portion of the decrease in prices, but as I said, when prices decline double digit within a quarter as they have in the last two quarters, it's just difficult, just difficult to catch up. In my experience, it's coming from competitors. I think there are a variety of different competitive strategies in the market. In our case we are a value-oriented competitor, we do not lead with price, but we do respond. There is at least one other competitor out there that I feel operates in the same way, but there are competitors that I would argue are cost-plus competitors, so that is that.  When they see \u2013 they'll sell based on a gross margin model that they've built and they'll go to price right away, and those are the ones that lead with price in the market and then we follow. So it's really how the cost flows through their P&L, through their inventory that makes the difference. You bet. So that product, it has had the fastest growth of any new product we've ever introduced, including our first product. So that's of course \u2013 now, of course it was widely anticipated. It was something that we had been talking about with customers for some time, but it is \u2013 it bodes very well for us. Now when we say \u2013 when you say TAM expansion, let me just make sure we are all consistent here. You know we discuss it as opening up more of the TAM that we've put into place and we believe it opens up over the next year or two, you know another $5 billion of TAM that we can expand into. So it's a big market. It opens up a new part of the market that we did not generally sell into before. Yeah, we're not viewing that as the new normal. We do believe that as we add new products and as pricing stabilizes, the world will get better, but of course, we're not guiding to next year yet. But obviously as I said, I think this has been a challenging year with the pricing declines and we believe life will get better; our FlashArray//C, CBS the products on Azure, and so forth. We're very proud and pleased with the new products we're putting in the market.  We believe, we'll be the aggressor. You know if we continue taking market share at the rates that we're taking market share, in a market that is fundamentally $30 billion to $50 billion, you know we've got a lot of opportunity ahead of us. Sure, we've studied this over many years, right. And as prices come down, elasticity goes up. Flash takes over more of the magnetic market. So you have to have price coming down in flash in order to take up more of the market, and this is going to happen.  Now, we would love a world where flash comes down predictably every single quarter and pricing follow suit a couple of quarters later. That would allow customers to plan and for us to be able to better guide, but the fact of the matter is that flash prices vary dramatically with supply of new fabs and demand varying as we saw last quarter or the quarter before rather with hyper-scaler demand and that fluctuation eventually makes its way to our market. But over the long term, the elasticity is real and with very fast price dropping, it usually means slower price dropping in the following year. So while we can't predict it exactly, on a long-term basis, you can. I think what you're asking, if the macro had been better, would that have overcome the pricing? The pricing was by far the dominant reason for the gap to our original guidance, but there is no question \u2013 I mean we're only talking about 2% here, you know and a stronger macro could easily have made that up. It's the same issue really. It really is \u2013 the vast majority is pricing, but of course a stronger macro. We're not talking about a lot of percent; stronger macro might have been able to make that up. But again, when you're \u2013 when you face \u2013 really, this year is quite remarkable in terms of the pricing decline in the market. Right. Well, as you know, we don't really provide metrics on a product-by-product basis and especially on new products, because new products tend to be lumpy as you're getting through the sales force and new customer experience and so forth.  But that being said, as I said, this is the largest and fastest new product adoption cycle that we've seen at the company ever. I think it bodes well for us. It's a product that by the way is a FlashArray, just with a lower price, lower cost storage module in it, so our customers know it, our field knows it, our channels know it, so from that sense it's easy to sell. Kix, I think Kix has some additional commentary here. I will add one other piece of color. You know we have seven and eight digit deals in the pipeline for this product, so it's a \u2013 you know clearly it's something that stands out. Yeah, well currently our revenue is made up primarily of two physical products of FlashArray, FlashBlade and then of course the subscription and support activities surrounding those two. And we do have our Pure as-a-Service model, but that's still a relatively small revenue stream associated with that. So by far, the deferred revenue is made up of those subscription streams.  Now as we mentioned at our Accelerate offsite, you know we've seen big pickups in subscription, especially in elongation of the contract period for the subscription as customers have found great value in the Evergreen service overall.  But you're largely correct. I mean a lot of the growth rate that we expect in the future is based on new product. FlashArray//C is off to a good start, Cloud Block Store, a high interest level, but still very early days and then of course we are anticipating our File Services coming out mid next year. So these are all things we look forward to and believe will expand our opportunity. Well first, again we're not going to guide fiscal year \u201821 just yet, but we don't invest in new products just to give engineers fun things to work on. The expectation is that it will improve our growth. You know we are very focused on growing this company, we're very focused on being the leader in storage and that has a lot of years of growth left to us to be able to deliver that and of course we're delivering it as a very new and different architecture; you know what we're calling the modern data experience. That is going to make it more of a platform rather than a set of isolated boxes. Well, I think you saw one of our competitors also come in with higher gross margin, so it indicates that there has been at least some \u2013 you know with such drops \u2013 as I mentioned, double-digit drop in price during the quarter. So there's been a lot of price activity, but obviously cost activity was better than price activity for at least one of our competitors out there as it was for us. Now, part of the gross margin improvement was based on mix. The mix is a shift towards larger arrays. Now I'm not talking about a mix between products, but a mix to larger systems and the larger systems tend to have higher gross margin, but we also benefited a lot from a COGS reduction.  Your point is, look, the field has complete flexibility to drive price if it's going to win a deal. We don't ever want to lose on price, but as I say, we don't lead with price either. So we're doing everything we can to drive the top line, we're not going to hold it for additional margin, but it's the way it worked out this quarter. Yeah, it's a great question, Jason. I think we actually see both activities; we see people oddly enough moving to the cloud, but we also see people moving out of the cloud, especially their data storage, because data storage tends to be extraordinarily expensive in the cloud environment.  Cloud Block Store is meant to make it easier to move in both directions. That is to say that makes it easier to lift and shift into the cloud if your cloud data experience looks similar if not identical to what's on-prem and of course we have a lot of value in the cloud as Matt just mentioned; lower cost and higher performance, But also it makes it easier if you decide if you're in the cloud using our service and then want to move back on-prem as many customers have done to reduce their overall costs.  It also makes it easier to move in that direction as well. And from our standpoint, a terabyte is a terabyte between cloud and on-prem, one contract, one price. We've seen no effect, honestly from the phenomenon you're talking about with our SaaS, in our SaaS business. Yeah. Well clearly, we're not going \u2013 we invested ahead. We knew this year, we invested ahead. Those assets, those people that we hired are going to be much more productive in the second year as like in any ramped environment. That allows us to be a bit more, let's say, prudent or slow down our hiring for this coming year, really to match much more our growth rate as we go in. Yeah. It was a little less than \u2013 half of it was mix. The largest part of course was the cost reduction compared to the price reduction, so costs lowering or having lower.  Remember, it takes about six weeks to eight weeks for inventory to flow through our system, right. So we started off with a lot of low cost NAND and product in the pipeline as we went through the quarter, as I mentioned toward the end of the quarter and certainly in this quarter, prices in NAND have literally gone up, so the majority of it was price, but a significant portion of it was mix. Yeah. No. Customers that are buying from international where the deals are originating, and so we mentioned the UK, we mentioned Japan as a couple of those examples that were lower than what we expected. Sure. Well first of all, I mean just on an overall absolute basis, that is correct and it's not as significant. But it's up well over 200% year-over-year, so it's growing very nicely.  Secondly, it is recognized ratably on a monthly basis, over the years, as customers purchase the service overall. It's priced at a premium currently to a traditional CapEx model. So in the three year time horizon, it tends to be richer for Pure, but it really helps those customers that really want to operate on an OpEx model overall. So does that answer your question? No, no, the whole thing is ratable, both revenue and cost. And sort of Pure as-a-service and what I just said about the $30 of subscription base, those are recognized the same, they're both matched, revenue and COGS. We've not really provided that breakout. I'd say the as-a-service model is still relatively new and the new meaning, both to customers as well as our sales force. As we start to get more experience under our belt that might be something that we highlight in a \u2013 sort of in a highlighted one of our calls, but at the moment we've not really broken that out and I'm not sure we're ready to, just from an experience standpoint. Right. Well, to be clear, there was a hiring slowdown, but certainly not a freeze. In fact each quarter the net hires will be slightly higher than the quarter before. But again, we have to respond to the market slowdown. We are not going to run at a loss as a company and also as I mentioned earlier, I take this opportunity to allow each team to catch their breath after a lot of hiring and to rebalance their organizations. So, I actually view it as an opportunity for each group to really make sure that they're disciplined, that they are efficient and effective and that they rethink where they've placed \u2013 how they've structured their team and taken opportunity to rebuild before the next spurt of growth. So you're correct in identifying that there's been a slowdown, but there's certainly not a freeze. Well, as we indicated, when we took out the program, that we wanted that program in case of - what we saw as a huge price dislocation in the market and we have that facility at our disposal should we choose to use it, but it is really a discretionary \u2013 we're keeping it as a discretionary opportunity. You bet. As we look ahead to the next decade, our goal is to take the fragmented and antiquated architecture of the current data storage environment and recreate it into a unified automated multi cloud data experience. By helping our customers to create a modern data experience, we help them to deliver real business value and we empower them to realize their digital transformation. I'd like to again welcome Paul and Kevan Krysler to the team and I want to thank Hat for his partnership and dedication to Pure these last seven years. He's had a great impact on Pure and I'm excited to continue to work with him in his new role.  For those in the U.S., I want to wish you all a very Happy Thanksgiving and I want to thank all of you on the call for your time today."

            "content": "Thanks, Charlie. We believe that our Modern Data Experience is the way forward, enabling digital businesses to extract more value from their data, while improving performance and reducing complexity and expense of managing infrastructure. Pure's modern approach helps companies deliver on their most strategic initiatives, empowering them to achieve outcomes that were not previously possible.  Because of this, Pure is taking market share and at our Investor Day, we shared that Pure was growing 10x faster than our closest competitor. Customers are being done a disservice by others in the industry who still require forklift upgrades and who are NOT innovating, while Pure's customers benefit from our expanding technology portfolio, industry-leading customer satisfaction, and differentiated Evergreen ownership model. Pure is being chosen because we enable customers to modernize their existing applications and accelerate their adoption of multi-cloud, containers and real-time analytics. Our focus on the Cloud, Enterprise, Commercial and Government segments continues to progress nicely. We finished the quarter with more than 7,000 total customers, adding approximately six net-new customers per day, equating to nearly 400 new customers in Q3. The Government segment in particular continued to be a bright spot in Q3, with business doubling on a year-to-date basis.  Turning to momentum in our portfolio; our ability to make the Modern Data Experience a reality for customers today and into the future has never been more evident. Our industry-leading Pure1 SaaS platform makes it extremely easy for customers to manage their hybrid cloud environments across our portfolio, including FlashArray//X, FlashArray//C, FlashBlade, and Cloud Data Services.  Pure's simple and automated platform allows customers to consolidate their primary and secondary workloads, delivering faster access to more of their data at a much lower total cost of ownership and is an ideal fit for next-generation data analytics and Rapid Restore use cases. Following our announcement at Accelerate, we have seen the fastest growth of any product we have ever launched with the introduction of our FlashArray//C targeted for tier two. In the quarter, ServiceNow, a leading SaaS company, an existing customer of FlashArray//X and FlashBlade, has now added the all-NVMe FlashArray//C to their environment, with the goal of eliminating spinning disk for tier two workloads. We share their vision of creating an all-flash data center for better reliability, cost, and performance, so they can continue to deliver world-class service levels for their customers. Pure's Cloud Data Services, including Cloud Block Store on AWS enables data mobility and empowers customers to achieve on-prem economics in the public cloud. And, as part of our multi-cloud strategy, we recently launched our technical preview of Cloud Block Store on Microsoft Azure at the recent Microsoft Ignite conference.  With the growing set of products and unique Pure as-a-Service subscription model, customers can take advantage of our innovation on-prem or in their preferred public cloud whenever and however they want, today or in the future. We've always been the most innovative and now we are also the safest choice for customers. Lastly, on a personal note, I want to take a moment to thank our customers, partners and Pure team for the past seven years. They have been the most fulfilling and rewarding of my career. Together, we changed the industry with Evergreen Storage, built an incredible company culture and we grew the business from $0 to more than $1.5 billion, as fast as any Enterprise IT company in history. I'll be staying on in my new role to help with transition, planning and strategy. I am excited that Paul has joined the team as COO and I look forward to partnering closely with him to help set-up 2020 and beyond for incredible success. While my role is changing, what will never waver is my excitement and enthusiasm and our ability to make an impact on our customers every day. We are as optimistic as ever to execute on our long-term vision to deliver the Modern Data Experience and provide freedom for organizations to build for today and tomorrow. We truly are just getting started. And with that, I will now turn it back over to Charlie, Charlie? As always. Yeah, I think productivity is in line with our expectations. The latest cohorts that we brought in are our largest classes and they are coming in line with the most productive cohorts from earlier on.  Now, we did put a lot of those into the enterprise segment and the enterprise segment, we knew as we shared in previous quarters, take long to longer sales cycles, etcetera, and with some of the challenging environment that we're seeing in the large enterprise, you know that may take a little bit longer for it to hit the bottom line, but we're very confident. We time those investments to be in line with the product expansion capabilities that we've got and the market share gains and we know it's the right long-term bet for the business. So there is no doubt that when things turn we're going to be very well positioned to capitalize that in the enterprise. Yes, so I mean, I think the headline here is if the pricing were in line with our forecast, we would have been within the range that we had. So really do feel like it's pricing, but we are looking at these international phenomenons, in the U.K. specifically, Japan specifically as well as some of the enterprise deals. We're not seeing loss rates decrease. They are improving if anything, so we see really steady win rates that are out there. So it's just a little bit more slowing of the decisions and more pushes. So we have that contemplated in our Q4. Well, we actually had nice progress as I mentioned in the public sector. Our commercial business was solid for the quarter. There were some ups and downs internationally, and I think those are tied largely to some of the macro issues. There's some execution in there as well, but the vast majority of it on the international front was tied to very specific markets that are challenged. Well, this is Hat. I'll take a crack at that. We've seen nice progress in the segments that we serve. Like I just mentioned you know in the Public Sector, Government space, in the commercial segment and in the cloud business continuing to represent a north of 30% of our overall business, so we see sound performance there.  Enterprise, large enterprise was a little bit weaker than what we expected and that we think is tied you know partially to the overall macro.  The changing persona and the decision maker is something that we've been driving the last few years. You know our next generation analytics platform with FlashBlade is largely sold into DevOps, is then sold into the business owner and we've you know made a business you know in our traditional storage attack plan to go you know at the database admin or the virtual system admin or other folks that actually saw the benefits of flash removing latency.  So it's always been a multi-threaded sales process and so we feel comfortable in our ability to go attack that. A lot of what our focus with the modern day experience is shifting from a product-by-product, business unit-by-business units, workload-by-workload kind of sales campaign into more of a platform and a portfolio sale, and leading with our Tier 1 and our peer as a service subscription model is really differentiated.  It really does enable flexibility commercially for customers, and technically allows them to you know put their data where they need to today and move it without penalty in the future, and so as that starts to continue to get traction, we believe that will continue to help us get higher up in the organization and sell a little differentiated platform solution for supplying product solution. Yeah, so as I mentioned, you know a lot of the sales capacity investments did go into the enterprise knowing full well that it was going take a bit longer for those to ramp and to hit the bottom line, but that it was the right long-term move for us. The new cohorts that we brought on board are ramping nicely. They're really in line with what we have seen previously and what we expected out of them going forward. As we look at you know, and as Paul and I kind of work together on the allocation of those sales resources across the globe and across the segments, as you do any year, you kind of fine tune that to make sure you get the right mix of long-term and mid-term ROI. But we're very confident in the investments that we've made and are going to pay dividends for us. It may take a little bit longer, but we're very confident that we made the right bets going into the year. Yeah. No, I think it is the international mix you know tied to some of the dynamics that Charlie and I had referenced earlier. We continue to see larger deals and more bundling, but the decision cycles are just taking longer and people are pushing into longer periods of time to evaluate more looks at it, more executive needing to touch deals, etcetera, and so more work.  But the encouraging thing to us is as our win rates continue to be super strong and so we're not losing more business and we're actually seeing more terabytes included in every deal and more bundling. It's just that it's taken a little bit longer to close. Yeah, thanks Pinjalim for that, I appreciate it. It has been a great joy to be active in an operating capacity and helping build this. It's really a personal driver to be very direct. I have a health issue in my family that over the summer became very acute and I think over the last several quarters Charlie and I have been talking about what's right for Pure, and Pure deserve somebody that's got 150% of their energy that they can put into it. And so as that health issue kind of surfaced and my need to be a little bit more balanced, it was clearly the right time. We're thrilled to have gotten Paul on board. The company is going to benefit not only from his 150% focus, but his skill, experience and cross-functional experience to go drive this. So I think you know the timing is never perfect for these situations, but it's definitely the right thing for me personally and it's the right thing and very good for Pure, to have somebody like Paul step in. The third point, I'd make is that I'm still here. I'm very excited. I love this place. As Charlie mentioned, you know my real passion is to be out in front with customers and teams helping drive this. And so I look forward to helping not only in the transition, but also playing a role going forward, not only on strategy, but being able, out in the field to help with customers. So I think it's kind of a win-win for the company and for me. Oh no! CapEx, we recognize roughly and for $100 we recognize we're approximately $70 upfront and then we have roughly $10 each over the three years. Yeah, so I wouldn't say, there's any discernible difference between the large competitors from a pricing dynamic in the marketplace. Dell has always been very aggressive and kind of operates in our view in kind of a cost-plus model, you saw, NetApp, you know (a) announce 11 points negative on growth year-on-year and increased gross margin on the product line as well. So they saw some of the benefits from the COGS reduction as well. I'll just reinforce what Charlie said earlier, you know we are a very aggressive team. When we see an opportunity, particularly in the large enterprise, we sell on value and we make sure we establish that. But if we need to use gross margin points to be able to win a deal, we won't lose on price, and so that's something that we're continuing to be focused on whether we're competing with NetApp or Dell. But I think the 25 points of delta between us and the only other company so far that's reported is indicative of how differentiated our value prop is and how much share we're taking in the marketplace. So, we're going to continue to be aggressive. If we could have put more of those gross margin points to work, we would have \u2013 that was a negating factor. You know the pricing dynamic was really kind of across the board and again, we believe that's temporary. Hopefully, it will start to firm up in Q4, like we talked about, but we feel very good about next year. No, we saw some of the international tied to those specific market dynamics trade and Brexit most likely, but we did see some slowness in the U.S. enterprise and I think that's an area where we like the trend, relative to pipeline and you know with the narrow span of control of our sales resource, we're getting in advance, and so we'll be able to bundle in multiple products and sell more terabytes. It's just taking a little bit longer from a deal push perspective, but win rates are holding nicely as well. So it's \u2013 we see a little bit of the international and a little bit in the large enterprise U.S."

            "name": "Matt Kixmoeller",
            "content": "Yeah, I'd also just say than in the last call there was some concern about whether it might be cannibalistic of FlashArray//X, and we made a point of being really close to all the first deployments of FlashArray's team. They were really pleased with really the net new use cases in motions that it went into. You know we largely targeted Tier 2 applications that might have been on disk, as well as Tier 2 DR and opening up new tiers of applications for DR and so really pleased with them being sold together as opposed to an alternative to one another. Yeah, this is Kix, I'll take this one as well. So I think the first thing to realize about FlashArray//C is its a lower cost per gig, but it's quite large and so our key target has really been larger organizations who have big, big slots of Tier 2 data and so we've seen it go into larger environments where they are just going after their Tier 2 applications.  We've also seen customers who deal with very large research data, very large types of IoT data, etcetera, become interested in the platform, because it opens up use of Flash at a fundamentally different Tier. Yeah, so we announced the GA of Cloud Block Store and Azure at Accelerate this year and I'd say the industry analysts and customer excitement around that was very high, and we saw both excitement around it, translate right into our core business, in terms of being able to have conversations around cloud architecture and hybrid cloud that frankly we weren't invited to before, and then we saw customers really diving in with key use cases. Our key focus in this market has been to really focus on Tier 1 applications moving to the cloud and Tier 1 applications run on block storage. And so to give you an example of one of the first production deployments, we have a customer who runs SAP on-prem on Pure and they've taken advantage of Cloud Block Store to really move test to the cloud and so it's a perfect hybrid case.  You have SAP running on Tier 1 on-prem, you're replicating data to the cloud, refreshing it constantly and that particular customer was able to get 40 to one data reduction in their test dev-environment. So think about the ROI of saving the cloud savings there and enabling that new model for more agile test dev. These are the types of use cases that were really driving into the market with CBS."

            "content": "Thank you, Hat. Moving to key financial highlights, we finished the quarter with cash and investments of $1.2 billion, an increase of $59 million from the previous quarter. Free cash flow in Q3 was strong at positive $43 million. We delivered strong deferred revenue again in the quarter. At the end of the quarter, deferred revenue was $643 million, an increase of 39% over the same period a year ago and included a record amount of Pure as-a-Service deal, again formerly ES2. Now I will turn to guidance. In setting our guidance for the remainder of the year, we have taken into account the pricing declines we've seen in the past two quarters, as well as a more challenging global environment. We are highly differentiated as evidenced by our industry-leading growth and gross margins, and accordingly we remain focused on continuing to invest in a fiscally prudent manner as evidenced by our operating profit guide which is within the range that we offered last quarter. For Q4 of fiscal 2020, we expect revenues in the range of $484 million to $496 million, $490 million at the midpoint; gross margin in the range of between 67.5% and 70.5%; and operating margin in the range of between 10% and 14% or 12% at the midpoint. For the full year of fiscal 2020, we now expect revenues in the range of between $1.635 billion and $1.647 billion or $1.641 billion at the midpoint; Gross margin in the range of between 69.2% and 70.1%; and operating margin in the range of between 2.6% and 3.9% or 3.2% at the midpoint. With that, we'll open it up for questions. Operator."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Pure Storage Second Quarter Fiscal 2020 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Matthew Danziger, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin your conference.\nMatthew Danziger: Thank you, and good afternoon. Welcome to the Pure Storage second quarter fiscal 2020 earnings conference call. Joining me today are our CEO, Charlie Giancarlo; our CFO, Tim Riitters; our President, David Hatfield; and our VP of Strategy, Matt Kixmoeller. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that during this call, management will make forward-looking statements, which are subject to various risks and uncertainties. These include statements regarding competitive, industry and technology trends, our strategy, positioning and opportunity, our current and future products, business and operations including our operating model, growth prospects, and revenue and margin guidance for future periods. Any forward-looking statements that we make are based on assumptions as of today, and we undertake no obligation to update them. Our actual results may differ materially from the results predicted, and reported results should not be considered as an indication of future performance. A discussion of various risks and uncertainties relating to our business is contained in our filings with the SEC, and we refer you to these public filings. During this call, we will discuss non-GAAP measures in talking about the Company's performance, and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are provided in our earnings press release and slides. This call is being broadcast live on the Pure Storage Investor Relations website and is being recorded for playback purposes. An archive of the webcast will be available on the IR website for at least 45 days and is the property of Pure Storage. With that, I'll turn the call over to our CEO, Charlie Giancarlo.\nCharles Giancarlo: Thank you, Matt, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us on today\u2019s earnings call. I will begin by sharing our high-level results from the quarter, Hat will provide a go-to-market update, and Tim will offer a detailed review of our financials. We had a strong quarter and the fundamentals of our business remain solid. For Q2, revenue was $396 million, growing 28% year-over-year, which was above the midpoint of our guidance. Our industry-leading gross margin grew to 69.4% and operating margin was a negative 0.8%, beating our guidance range. In less than 10 years, we disrupted the storage industry by creating solutions that are intelligent, automated, and modern and delivered 10x improvements in the performance, the cost of operation, and usability. We are now setting a bold new path for Pure for our second decade which will deliver the next set of 10x breakthroughs. Our goal is to take the fragmented and antiquated data storage environment and recreate it into a unified, automated, and multi-cloud data experience. Pure delivers a modern data experience to our customers. Unlike legacy infrastructure vendors, Pure enables customers to utilize more of their data, while reducing the complexity and expense of managing the infrastructure behind it. We provide a data experience that creates a common operating environment across multiple data centers and clouds, easing operations via APIs and intelligent AI-driven automation. We now offer our customers integrated hybrid cloud and on-prem solutions, consumable as a flexible subscription to deliver that modern data experience. Looking at the market as a whole, Pure is clearly out-executing our traditional competitors, some of whom have expressed concerns around the macro economy. We do not believe the macro environment has affected us this past quarter. What we do see is a significant transitory NAND supply/demand imbalance which impacted component prices and the storage industry as a whole. We expect this situation to continue to affect us for the balance of the year given the natural lag between component costs and storage market pricing. However, we are already seeing NAND pricing rise in the spot market, and suppliers are delaying additional fab capacity. We believe these signals point to an improving market next year. As compared to others, Pure\u2019s continued exceptional growth and margin leadership highlight our differentiation which is consistently validated by our growing, happy customer base. Our results underscore that our strategy is working. We also know that it is in challenging market environments when our superior value proposition enables us to gain even more market share. In today\u2019s world where data is at the core of digital transformation, legacy vendors have inexplicably decreased their investment in innovation and instead are relying on commodity hardware and software. They attempt to convince customers that all systems are the same, and that price is all that matters. Customers, however, understand that an investment in innovation is an investment in their future. Our continued investment in successful innovation is one of several reasons we are growing faster than public market competitors. At our Accelerate conference next month, we will announce groundbreaking portfolio additions and future innovations as part of our strategy for the next decade. Pure\u2019s focus on priorities important to CIOs today building a hybrid cloud; transitioning to fast, consolidated data architectures; deriving business value from AI and analytics; and enabling customers to rapidly recover from IT failures, mean that more customers than ever are choosing Pure. We are the essential company driving change in the data industry, providing an unparalleled experience which delivers business outcomes and ensures customer delight. Now, I would like to share more personal news. As you may have read in our press release, our CFO, Tim Riitters, will be leaving Pure for personal reasons. An executive search is already underway for our next CFO. Tim will participate in that process and will help in the transition. When he first joined Pure, we were less than $200 million in revenue, a private company, we had 600 employees, and just one product. Five years later, we disrupted an entire industry, we have grown almost 10x, consistently delivering double-digit annual revenue growth; we achieved profitability, acquired two companies, and dramatically expanded our portfolio. He\u2019s been an invaluable asset and has had an incredible impact on our company. I want to personally thank Tim for his years of excellent service, his consistent energy and care, and for his friendship and partnership over my tenure. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Hat.\nDavid Hatfield: Thanks, Charlie. And let me add my thanks to Tim for all he has done over the past five years. We hope you can enjoy some much deserved time with family and friends. Pure is positioned to help enterprises tackle their most strategic IT initiatives, is gaining market share, and enabling our customers to achieve outcomes that were not previously possible. Our industry-leading customer satisfaction, our Evergreen ownership model, and our expanding suite of solutions position us not only as the most innovative, but also the safest choice for our customers. In contrast, Pure is growing approximately 10x faster than any competitor and their rate of spending on innovation is on average 2x less than Pure\u2019s R&D investment. Customers are challenged with navigating competitor product-line consolidation and disruptive upgrades, while Pure\u2019s customers reap the benefit of our Evergreen experience with its continuous expansion of new capabilities and services. We believe that data is strategic to our customer\u2019s digital transformation journey. Data requires innovation and investment, especially as new application architectures are driving unprecedented levels of performance, parallelism, and multi-cloud data workflows. Customers are selecting Pure because we enable them to simultaneously modernize their existing applications and accelerate their adoption of hybrid cloud, containers, DevOps, AI, and real-time analytics, at scale. Unlike our competitors, who are simply shipping commodity storage arrays, Pure\u2019s modern data experience is cloud-managed, AI-driven, constantly improving, and consumable via a flexible subscription model that can be deployed in a hybrid IT environment. This is not your grandparents\u2019 data storage environment. Our focus on the largest consumers of storage across Cloud, Enterprise, Commercial and Public Sector markets is working. Customers are realizing Pure\u2019s differentiation and our win rates continued to hold nicely. We finished the quarter with more than 6,600 total customers, adding approximately seven net-new each business day, equated to more than 450 new customers in Q2, the highest number in any Q2 of our history. During last earnings, we discussed the increase of new sellers and the transition we encountered in Q1. In Q2, we were pleased with the level of sales execution and the quality and ramp of new sellers. This quarter, we closed a number of large transactions, including a 50% increase in million-dollar deals from Q1. We were particularly pleased with the progress in our Enterprise and Public Sector segments, as both outpaced the growth of our overall business. Turning to our technology and strategic partnerships. We saw continued progress across our ecosystem in the fastest growing segments of the market. Alliances include Splunk and Elastic in next-generation analytics, NVIDIA for AI and Machine Learning, Cisco for mission-critical converged infrastructure, and a broad range of data protection partners to deliver the next-generation of Rapid Restore and Data Protection. We were thrilled with the continued FlashBlade momentum, specifically in the Rapid Restore and data analytics use cases, as well as the excitement for our Cloud Data Services, including Cloud Block Store on AWS. We will share more on this with them at Accelerate next month. To highlight some of this momentum, in Q2 a large U.S. government agency chose FlashBlade and Splunk SmartStore to meet policy objectives for regulatory compliance and to manage a large scale implementation. As a result, the agency eliminated multiple copies of data, reduced their physical footprint by 8 to 1, and avoided thousands of dollars in potential penalties for power and space consumption achieving a highly compelling TCO. Another notable customer success in the quarter, a large global asset management firm, chose Pure for ease of management, cloud-native automation, and orchestration in their hybrid cloud environment. By freeing up time, resources, and money, this firm can now focus on their own innovation instead of day-to-day operations. And finally, the interest in our unique unified subscription model across hybrid IT with our Cloud Data Services and Evergreen Storage Service is growing. This quarter, a mid-sized hospital in Illinois invested more than $2 million in our ES2 offering. This customer moved their existing infrastructure to a 100% subscription model with Pure, which enables easy capacity and performance planning, and will allow them to shift to Cloud Block Store on AWS under their ES2 contract. Customers like this have realized that ES2 empowers them to utilize our technology on-premises today, while also preserving future flexibility for where and how they will architect their data strategy going forward. We are as excited as ever to execute on our long-term vision and provide freedom for organizations to build for today and tomorrow. Pure\u2019s Q2 performance and rapid market share gains against the competition demonstrate our differentiation from our traditional peers. We truly are just getting started. See you at Accelerate next month. And with that, I will now turn it over to Tim. Tim?\nTimothy Riitters: Thanks, Hat. Q2 was a strong quarter for Pure as we continued to demonstrate industry-leading growth, gross margins, and continued innovation across our product portfolio in an evolving environment. Before I dive into the specifics, I\u2019ll make my usual note that the gross margin, operating margin, OpEx, net income, and free cash flow numbers I will use are non-GAAP unless otherwise noted. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP metrics to the GAAP comparables, as well as our full Q2 results and presentation, are available on our website at investor.purestorage.com. For the quarter, total revenue grew 28% year-on-year to $396.3 million. Product revenue grew 24% year-on-year to $300.1 million and support and subscription revenue grew 42% year-on-year to $96.2 million. Geographically, 74% of our sales came from the United States and 26% came from our International markets for the quarter. Our gross margins continue to be industry-leading with product margins well above our competitors and aggregate gross margins reaching an all-time high in the quarter of 69.4%, up 1.3 points sequentially. Total gross margins reflect the significant differentiation and innovation we deliver to our customers. Product gross margins in the quarter were 70%, up 1.3 points, due largely to benefits we are seeing in component cost declines. Support gross margins were 67.4%, up 1.1 points sequentially. The sequential increase in margins were due both to operating ongoing efficiency improvements, along with an approximately one-half point impact from one-time benefits in this line of business. Moving to operating margin, in Q2 operating profit was negative $3.2 million, or negative 0.8% of revenue, and compares to an operating profit of $0.9 million, or 0.3% in the year-ago quarter. Operating profit was better than expected due primarily to over performance on gross margins for the quarter. Q2 net income for the quarter was positive $2.5 million or positive $0.01 per share. This compares to the year-ago period of positive $2.4 million or positive $0.01 per share. The weighted-average shares used for the per-share calculation are 271 million shares in Q2 and 263 million shares in the year-ago period. Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow, we finished the quarter with cash and investments of $1.18 billion, an increase of $16 million from the previous quarter. Our quarter-on-quarter increase in cash was driven primarily by strong free cash flow in Q2 which is a typically low quarter for us. Free cash flow in Q2 was positive $19.9 million, which includes $5.7 million of impact related to our employee stock purchase plan. Adjusting for the normal impact of our employee stock purchase plan, free cash flow was positive $14.2 million in the quarter. We delivered strong deferred revenue growth in the quarter. Deferred revenue at the end of the quarter was $607.3 million, an increase of 47% over the same period a year ago. The strong deferred revenue performance was driven by three ongoing key trends: meaningful year-on-year renewals growth, longer initial subscription agreement purchases, and the early traction of our ES2 product. In addition, you will note from today\u2019s press release, Pure\u2019s Board of Directors has authorized an up to $150 million stock repurchase program. This program demonstrates the confidence in our company strategy and our long-term growth potential. Our top priority continues to be investing in our business for growth. At the same time, this program gives us one more capital allocation tool to return value to shareholders in periods where we can repurchase shares at reasonable levels and will help reduce the net amount of employee stock award dilution going forward. Now I will turn to our guidance. As it relates to revenue, first and most importantly, as Charlie mentioned we are in an inflection phase with respect to the NAND pricing environment with price declines falling faster in Q2 than we had originally anticipated. While we were able to show strong topline growth in Q2 in spite of these circumstances, we want to be mindful of this dynamic as we think about the rest of the year in developing our guide. We believe a more balanced revenue and NAND market environment will emerge as the quarters progress, and return to the consistent long-term NAND market trend line. Second, while we did not see any specific indications that macro impacted our business in the quarter, we nevertheless want to be mindful of the environment given the recent headlines and cautionary tone of other infrastructure vendors. We remain confident in our ability to drive growth in the quarters ahead. With this as context, for the third quarter of fiscal 2020, we expect revenues in the range of between $434 million and $446 million, or $440 million at the midpoint, non-GAAP gross margins in the range of between 66% and 69%, and non-GAAP operating margin in the range of between 3% and 7%, or 5% at the midpoint. For the full-year of fiscal 2020, we now expect revenues in the range of between $1.645 billion and $1.715 billion, or $1.680 billion at the midpoint, non-GAAP gross margin in the range of between 67% and 69%, and non-GAAP operating margin in the range of between 2.25% and 4.75%, or 3.5% at the midpoint. You will notice that our operating profit guidance remains unchanged. This speaks to our focus on thoughtfully and carefully investing given the current environment, and adjusting our spend plans to maintain our profit goals despite the reduction in our topline expectations. As I wrap up, I\u2019d like to offer some final thoughts on why we continue to be excited about the road ahead here at Pure. Number one, our Q2 results highlight Pure\u2019s momentum with us growing roughly 10x faster than any of our public competitors. Number two, the fundamentals in our business remain strong. Number three, we are on the cusp of a significant and exciting product cycle. And finally, we remain focused on driving a smart and profitable business. In closing, as Charlie mentioned, I have made the personal decision to leave Pure. My last day will be later in the year, and in the interim I\u2019ll participate with the selection of and transition to our new CFO. And I will be at Accelerate next month and look forward to meeting many of you at our Investor Day. It has really been an honor to serve as Pure\u2019s CFO. The company is positioned well for the future, and I am excited to see what Pure does in its next decade. With that, I\u2019ll turn it back to the operator for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Alex Kurtz from KeyBanc.\nAlexander Kurtz: Thanks, guys. Can you hear me, okay?\nCharles Giancarlo: You bet.\nTimothy Riitters: Hi, Alex.\nAlexander Kurtz: Hey, before we get into questions, I just want to say, Tim, it's been a real pleasure working with you, and maybe we will see you on the mountain one day.\nTimothy Riitters: I appreciate, Alex. Thank you.\nAlexander Kurtz: Yes. Best of luck on what's next. So as I try to understand your pricing dynamic points you made in the prepared remarks, can I just give a quick example and you can tell me how far I'm off here. So at the beginning of the year, customers are expecting maybe $2 to $3 per effective gig, when they came into a deal. Now this oversupply in the NAND market, maybe they're looking for $1 to $3. And so your reps are hitting their numbers, but now they'd have to ship extra bit to get to the original guidance. Is that the right framework?\nCharles Giancarlo: Yes. We're just shipping more terabytes per sale, right. And when prices drop more rapidly than you expect, it takes a while for customers to adjust to the idea of two things; one is buying more terabytes for workloads that they've already planned, but now looking at new workloads, at new tiers, and that takes a little more time and planning on the customer side. So as I've said many times in the past, Alex, that, in a steady \u2013 we live in an environment with steadily decreasing component in commodity prices, right. That's the entire tech market. And as long as it's slow and steady, the market equilibrates on that, but you do have quarters where it's faster than you expect and it takes a while for the customers to catch up with that, so that's what we saw.\nAlexander Kurtz: And just to be clear, cohorts as far as their yield rates have been trending correctly, any context there, Tim?\nTimothy Riitters: Yes. You mean sales cohorts or customer cohorts?\nAlexander Kurtz: Yes, sales cohorts.\nTimothy Riitters: Sales cohorts performing nicely. I mean we had a big class come in this year and that's \u2013 the early signs are positive.\nAlexander Kurtz: Thank you.\nTimothy Riitters: You bet.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Matt Cabral from Credit Suisse.\nMatthew Cabral: Yes. Thank you. Also wanted to ask where the lower guidance, just wonder if you could parse a little bit between just the push you're making in the larger enterprise deals versus the more run rate commercial business and just help us understand the incremental caution that you're putting into the guidance and just how that compares to where you were looking about it 90 days ago?\nCharles Giancarlo: Yes, I'll let Hat answer that first piece, but really, those two things are quite separate for us. We're not \u2013 the balance, let's say, between enterprise and commercial is not \u2013 it did not affect or calculate into our guide at all, but I'll let Hat answer the complexion between those two.\nDavid Hatfield: Yes, really good progress in enterprise. In my prepared remarks, we talked about enterprise and the public sector both outpacing the growth of the company. That's a highlight. Quarter-on-quarter, more million dollar deals closed, including a couple of the larger ones we talked about in Q1 for seven and eight figures. So we feel great about the momentum in the business overall.\nMatthew Cabral: And then on gross margins, obviously came in meaningfully above your range for the quarter. Just wondering if you could talk a little bit about how you're balancing growth versus profitability? And just if you think there's an opportunity to get a little bit more aggressive against what seems to be a little bit more of a difficult environment out there?\nDavid Hatfield: Yes. I've said this before. We don't win on price, we don't lose on price, and generally, we're not losing on price. So, I think the upward margin reflects the fact that we do get to take advantage of lower component pricing before the rest of the competition, so that adds a little bit to it. I think if we thought that we could win a deal, especially with a new customer by discounting, we do it. So that's not holding us back. So generally, those are not the things that \u2013 pricing is not the thing that's holding us back.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Pinjalim Bora from JPMorgan.\nPinjalim Bora: Great. Hey, guys, thanks for taking my question, and congrats on the strong Q2. I also wanted to deal on the revenue guidance, is there a way to basically pause the 300 points or so of cut. I mean, well, how much is macro concerns? How much is the pricing environment? And then I know the narrative in the market is across your peers is pretty bleak. But are you seeing any signs of macro softness in the pipeline or maybe more scrutiny or maybe Brexit related weakness or any kind of signal which is causing you to be more prudent with the guidance?\nTimothy Riitters: Yes. This is Tim. The first part of your question, we're not just \u2013 the number, but the majority of it is really the pricing environment that Charlie talked about. As it relates to macro, certainly we want to put some sort of prudence in there as well and that's a second quarter reason for the guidance. But to your question about the signals we're seeing, one of the big measures I look at is push deals and our push deal number was down quarter-on-quarter, right, which \u2013 if you're into a macro situation that you'd expect that number to go up. So we're just really not seeing those signals when we're driving the leadership, the differentiation we are, it's obviously a good thing, but we just didn't see those signals.\nCharles Giancarlo: And let me just add to that. When you're an innovator and a share taker, I think the macro tends to affect you less because you're \u2013 so it maybe out there and we may just be a little less sensitive to it. But we're a share taker right now. And so that's not what \u2013 as Tim said, it's mostly the pricing environment that has created the caution.\nPinjalim Bora: Understood, well said. I just wanted to ask a follow-up on DR strength. Obviously, you've kind of jump out of the page. And I think part of the reason you said is longer initial subscription agreements. Has there been a meaningful change in the duration for these agreements and is that the main driver for the growth here because I think ES2isprobably pretty small?\nTimothy Riitters: Yes. So on deferred revenue, a couple of things. Number one, the main reason for deferred revenue growing the way it is, is our renewals business, our subscription business. That Evergreen model is indeed working and starting to see big tranches renew a very nice renewal rates. So that's really what's happening and the main reason. On elongation of the overall initial rates that's happening, but it's more of a second order effect than the primary reason, which is renewal.\nPinjalim Bora: Got it. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Katy Huberty from Morgan Stanley.\nKathryn Huberty: Yes. Thank you. Just looking at your guidance versus consensus coming into today, you lowered October, but not so much the January quarter. Is there something you see in terms of large deal pipeline or product cycles that give you more confidence around the January versus the October quarter?\nTimothy Riitters: Katy, this is Tim. Really it's a question of more sort of challenging in easier comps last year. So if you look at last year given some of the things we had in Q4, it's a relatively easier comp, and so by definition it's less of the adjustment that we made versus the harder comp is in Q3?\nKathryn Huberty: Okay. That makes sense. And Tim, DSOs have run higher the last three quarters. Is there a changing dynamic in terms of timing of deals or collections as you move towards subscription or something else going on that's impacting DSOs?\nTimothy Riitters: Yes, something slightly different, Katy. We've talked a lot about our up-market focus and getting into larger and larger enterprise customers. Those enterprise customers tend to be more forceful and wanting longer extended terms. And it's a great use of our balance sheet. We'll do that any day if we can get into big accounts. So they'll typically take a little bit longer-term and that's what you're seeing more than anything else than they are.\nKathryn Huberty: Okay. And then just lastly, sales and marketing as a percentage of revenue continues to grow despite pretty significant scale and market leading growth rate. Do you have a view as to when we can start seeing sustainable leverage on the sales resources that you put in place?\nCharles Giancarlo: I'll take that Katy. As we said at the beginning of this year, this was going to be a major investment year for us as we expanded into enterprise and really believe that with the addition of new products that are coming out this year and early next that we were really going to be able to take just more larger share in the enterprise. But of course it's the \u2013 yes, that matter. So I would expect that this will be the year when you start to \u2013 this will be the last year where you see that and you'll start to see it come down in future years.\nKathryn Huberty: Okay. Thank you. Congrats on the quarter. Best of luck, Tim.\nTimothy Riitters: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Simon Leopold from Raymond James.\nVictor Chiu: Hi, guys. This is Victor Chiu in for Simon Leopold. Can you provide some color around the linearity in the July quarter specifically, whether you saw business slowed during the month of July and reduced pipeline as you go into the October quarter?\nDavid Hatfield: Yes. This is Hat. I'd say that we actually saw a really strong July, and we had solid linearity throughout the quarter, but differently what some of our peers were seeing. We actually see things really had great momentum toward the end and continued momentum in the beginning of Q3.\nVictor Chiu: Okay. And I guess, do you have any metrics, I guess to give us an update on progress of the new sales hires in ramping up the speed and how that's impacting that progress towards \u2013 pivoting towards larger deals?\nDavid Hatfield: Yes. We're super diligent on looking at all the cohort classes. We have 27 cohort classes that we've had since I've been here and we looked at month-by-month. And what we measure is, they ramped productivity relative to their peer group. And so we've seen the largest classes we've had over the last couple of quarters come in and deliver in line with expectations and in line with previous cohorts. So it's early days and we're spending a lot of time and energy, driving enablement, et cetera, but really nice early signs.\nVictor Chiu: Okay, great. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Steven Fox from Cross Research.\nSteven Fox: Thanks. Good afternoon. First, I was wondering if you can give a little more color on the public sector. You mentioned one large win, how broad was the growth that exceeded overall growth beyond that one win? And then I had a follow-up.\nCharles Giancarlo: Yes. Public sector has been an area that we've been investing in for the last couple of years. We wanted to get into a more meaningful run rate and I think the last two quarters that we've seen, three quarters that we've seen real consistent growth quarter-on-quarter. It's across the large central agencies in the federal government in the U.S., as well as state and local governments coming in and contributing. So it's nice breadth. We feel positive that will continue especially into the September quarter for the end of the fiscal year. And so we feel like we've kind of starting to hit our stride in the public sector business in the U.S. in particular, but also globally.\nSteven Fox: Thanks. And then just as a follow-up, when we think about the transition to NVMe, which you guys have move forward pretty rapidly. I mean, what does that \u2013 was that impacting on financials from just that technology transition?\nCharles Giancarlo: Yes. Thanks for that question. So as you may recall, we were the \u2013 well we innovated in both cases, both at the back end and the front end and we were the first to incorporate NVMe on the back end. And of course that helped both margin and pricing and made us competitive in the market, helped overall performance of the systems versus the competitors. And then just a couple quarters ago, we introduced it on the front end with the NVMe over fabric. We are seeing a very nice interest level by the most advanced customers. As you may recall, NVMe over fabric requires a change in overall rack architecture. We're seeing a nice pickup there, but its early days. Kix, do you want to add?\nMatt Kixmoeller: No, I think that\u2019s great. I mean, the only thing I would add is as we talk with industry analysts, I think in the last quarter we mentioned that we're at this point, kind of a majority of our businesses shift with NVMe. And the comments from the analysts lead us to believe that we're far, far ahead of any competitor in that regard.\nSteven Fox: Great. That's helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Aaron Rakers from Wells Fargo.\nAaron Rakers: Yes. Thanks for taking the question and also, Tim, it's been great working with you and wish you the best of luck. I want to go back to kind of the sales leverage question. Can you first of all talk about maybe any updated metrics around the success that you've seen as far as bundling across the product portfolio given kind of the expansion that you've seen? And then also in this last quarter, I know a couple quarters ago you had a large GSI systems integrator alignment. Have you started to recognize revenue from that relationship? Or is that still that 100 million plus opportunities still in front of us?\nDavid Hatfield: Hey, Aaron. This is Hat. Yes. So first of all, the portfolio motion is really working well. It's a key contributor to why we're thrilled with the FlashBlade performance, but we also saw a really nice uptick in our FlashStack business. And as we introduced new products, the ability to have our core reps attached that to their deals or find other opportunities through that portfolio motion is super encouraging. So we haven't provided any specific metrics on that. But we're seeing a nice uptick on the percentage of our core sellers selling multiple products, which is really the key pull through metric that we look at. And on the GSI win that we mentioned a couple of quarters ago, yes, we did see some incremental contribution from that in the quarter and seeing great pipeline build in the number of product announcements with their organization specifically and then broadly across the rest of the GSI sector, we're seeing nice momentum. So that route to market as we talked about was going to be critical for us and it's nice to see us starting to contribute net revenue in the quarter.\nAaron Rakers: Okay, perfect. And then a real quick follow-up. As flash pricing kind of normalize here as we look forward, can you help us just understand why we should expect gross margin to fall possibly below 68% again in the product gross margin line? Or do you think that we've hit kind of a new level of sustainability on product gross margin?\nTimothy Riitters: Yes. Aaron, this is Tim. What I would point to is the guide that we offered for the year. I mean again, we raised it for the full-year, which speaks to the environment we're in. As it relates to a longer-term gross margin number, we don't typically talk about a longer-term number in an earnings call, so we'll probably leave it at that.\nAaron Rakers: Fair enough. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Tim Long from Barclays.\nTimothy Long: Thank you. Just two quick ones, if I could. Just back to the large enterprise and OpEx, can you just talk a little bit about where we are with the investment needed to better penetrate that. It sounds like you're seeing good traction with the large deals, if you can just talk about the investment and where we are? And then secondly, you mentioned ES2 traction and maybe if you can talk about Cloud Data Services as well. How does the trajectory look there over the next few quarters for those businesses? Thank you.\nDavid Hatfield: Yes. Tim, this is Hat. Let me take the first part of that. The investments really are across the number of areas. One is sales capacity, and so we've obviously made a significant investment in Q4 and Q1 of that, Q2 is route to the market. And so one of the reasons why we've been highlighting the GSI wins and the managed service provider wins with Rackspace and others, those are critical routes to market to be able to go get access to the enterprise customers that take some time to build. But we see really nice trajectory on that as well as continued growth of the mix of the pipeline of larger deals. And I think as we look at those metrics, all very encouraging signs. As Charlie mentioned, we do expect to get some leverage as that capacity comes on line through next year and the year beyond that. And those are opportunities where the TAM is higher. So we do get, and we'll expect to get more revenue per quota-bearing head that are catering to those enterprise customers.\nMatt Kixmoeller: I'll answer the question about Cloud Data Services. So I'd say overall, we're still in the beta phase with our Cloud Block Store. But it's already turning into be a success for our product line as a whole. If you talk about the platform motion that Hat mentioned earlier, having a cloud dimension to our platform has materially changed the kinds of conversations we're in and how people look at not only the platform today, but where it can take them in the future. And the flexibility we provide around ES2 is to be able to deploy on-prem and extend that to the cloud in the future again has really materially changed the discussion. In terms of the beta, going really well, great results from that so far and come to Accelerate next month, you'll hear more from both us and Amazon at Accelerate.\nCharles Giancarlo: And customers that are using it on Amazon.\nTimothy Long: Okay. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Andrew Vadheim from Wolfe Research.\nAndrew Vadheim: Yes, I\u2019ve a follow-up on the DSO question. So if we move to the other side of the balance sheet, you saw days payable go down meaningfully as compared to the prior year. So it seems like it\u2019s taking longer collect, but also it seems like customers aren't allowing you as longer to pay and together those kind of seem like tepid indicators. So is there anything else to read macro wise from this?\nCharles Giancarlo: No, not at all. On the asset side, we talked about the reason ARs does sort of rise a little bit. On the AP side, it's just timing. There's not really anything we're seeing in any of our vendors, which would sort of change terms or whatnot, so that I wouldn't read into that.\nAndrew Vadheim: Okay. And then maybe just a follow-up on the public sector commentary, so strength in the quarter, but any indication there might be pulled forward that that occurred and might potentially dilute what we'll see in the October quarter?\nCharles Giancarlo: No, I don't think so. It's still reasonable smaller contributor to our overall topline, and the deals that we're getting are new wins that they build on. So there's not a lot of pull forward in this quarter or the quarter before, and we're optimistic about what we'll see at the fiscal year-end.\nAndrew Vadheim: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Jason Ader from William Blair.\nJason Ader: Thank you. First question just for Charlie, can you give us an update on ObjectEngine and then also just on Cloud Block Store? Can you talk about some use cases where the customers that you've seen traction with are applying the technology?\nCharles Giancarlo: Sure. Well, the rapid restore has proven to be a really strong product introduction for us. This is based on FlashBlade, ObjectEngine helps in that depending on the circumstances. But rapid restore, a lot of customers never realized that they could get back up and running in less than an hour and it's proven to be a major mover of that overall FlashBlade product line. As Kix mentioned on Cloud Block Store, because it's in beta, of course, there's no revenue to speak of yet. We do have customers that are \u2013 look, I feel fairly confident, we'll see the first revenue in Q3, but as you know it's a subscription revenue, so it will be recognized ratably over the life of the contract. But we have many dozens of beta customers, and some of whom are talking about standardizing their application development as they go into the cloud on Cloud Block Store, so very promising, but very early days.\nMatt Kixmoeller: I'll just add, you asked about use cases. I think one of the things we've been pleased about is, is really the diversity of the use cases, where we see people wanting to do application migration, but actually in both directions. So people are interested in doing say, Dev/Test on-prem, deploy in the cloud or the other way around. People are interested in DR as a use case between on-prem and cloud, and then of course, just application mobility. So it's still early days, but we're encouraged by what we're seeing.\nJason Ader: Okay. And then second question for Tim. Tim, have you made any different assumptions on conversion rates in your guide relative to your normal guidance methodology?\nTimothy Riitters: Well, I think, Jason is a function of acknowledging pricing as well as sort of ensuring that, so we think about macro as well. I mean implicit in that is to think about different sort of ways of measuring conversions. So I think the short answer is yes.\nJason Ader: Okay, great. And good luck to you, Tim.\nTimothy Riitters: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Karl Ackerman from Cowen and Company.\nKarl Ackerman: Hi. Two questions please. The first question, I was hoping you could address how you think philosophically about utilizing more of the channel as well as changing your pricing structure with the channel. I asked that because the cynic would say, you don't have an innovation or technology challenge, you have a variable cost challenge. So perhaps that changes with the new CFO. But any color on the company's plans to reign in a discretionary and semi-variable spending amidst this soft and demand backdrop would be very helpful? And I have a follow-up please.\nCharles Giancarlo: Karl, that's an interesting question. We changed our pricing structure about a year-ago in order to accommodate the channel where we went to standard discount across all of the product lines and made the pricing more transparent, more easily, and gave them much clearer discretionary paths if you will in terms of how to price the product without Pure being involved. I think we were \u2013 it took us a little time to get all the tools out. That is all the electronic tools and so forth, but that's been largely done now. So I'm not quite sure where the question is ending up, but we have provided now very standard pricing into the channel. Of course, when prices drop more rapidly, we follow-up with list price changes, so that they can follow the same swim lanes if you will, which we've done and do continuously. So you want to handle the rest of the channel question, Hat?\nDavid Hatfield: Yes. So philosophically the channel has been incredibly a productive asset for us from the very beginning and we anticipated continuing to do so. I mean majority of our net new customers are identified by our channel partners. Getting the right routes to market to map to the customers that we're segmenting in, our GSIs are getting us access to large scale enterprises. That was very difficult for us to get access to on our own. And we're driving toward independence. So we can actually lower our costs by leveraging the channel over time to be able to quote and configure and sell independent of Pure. And so as I look at the channel of the partner ecosystem, those are all accelerators and routes to market, but to the extent they don't deliver that value to us. We'll look at it very practically and making sure we're getting the right ROI for every dollar we put into it.\nKarl Ackerman: That's helpful. If I may move back to the outlook question, one of the investor questions I've received is, how much visibility do you have at attaining your new revenue outlook for 2019, which has been curtailed again? Yes, core fundamentals from several peers would suggest the overall IT spending environment, perhaps might get worse before it gets better and mid-range competition may be accelerating. You've mentioned earlier on this call how NAND pricing and not the macro is the larger factor. But I guess, are there any steps that you may provide or that you have taken that would enable you to have perhaps better visibility over a multi-quarter time pricing, and how we should think about that as investors? Thank you.\nCharles Giancarlo: Every time we have a learning process as we had over the last couple of quarters with respect to, in particular, this pricing challenge. We bring that into our planning model going forward. But I'll tell you that it's certainly the case that when you have a commodity market that is less steady, less linear, it does get it, it does make it a little more challenging to predict going forward. With that, we try to incorporate everything that we are aware of this time, including the signals that we're seeing from the commodity market, which as I said, that, overall, the commodity prices are firming up. Now we also believe that our strategy overall is working. I mean, we are growing. I mean, despite let's say, a modification of our forecast, I mean, we're growing, in some cases 40% or more faster than our competition. That means, we're actually gaining more share. And I do believe that in tough times, leaders that is the time when leaders take more share. We are putting out \u2013 a boat loaded new products this year and early next, and I think that's going to allow us to continue to win in the future. But short-term swings are more difficult to predict.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Rod Hall from Goldman Sachs.\nRoderick Hall: Yes. Hi, guys. Thanks for the question. I guess, I wanted to go back to these dynamics around NAND and just ask kind of a question about what you're assuming in terms of contract pricing lead time or lag time I should say to the spot market. So we know that it lags, but are you then assuming because the spot market has been recovering, are you assuming that then positively impacts your revenues in that fiscal Q4 implied guidance? And then can you also talk us through sort of the margin puts and takes around this? Because we understand that lower NAND pricing is leading to lower revenues and then that's partially offset by higher gross margins, but then we expect the impact on gross profit there to be neutral unless you pass through 100% of the component cost reductions, but then gross profit guidance is coming down. So I know that's kind of a long-winded one, but just the dynamics of those margins relative to what you've commented on the component pricing changes in the revenues would be helpful? Thanks.\nCharles Giancarlo: Well, Rod, you've, I think perfectly identified the fact that it creates a complex environment. Because the one thing I think that you alluded to, but then explicitly mention is also the elasticity of the market. That as pricing goes down, you can now compete for more workloads, workloads that would go to hybrid or to disk because the pricing of semiconductor flash now is more competitive. So when you roll that all together, what occurs is that in day one, you're pricing is lower, you've got to sell more terabytes to do it, customers may not yet be ready for those more terabytes. But as they do, as they understand the lower pricing, start looking at other workloads, they can bulk up on it. It's the ability of our sales force to convince the customer that they should \u2013 while prices are low, that they should buy more terabytes. It's all those things that go into making the quarter at the end of the day. With respect to margins, because we do believe that we are able to take advantage of the costs before our competitors, generally it is a good news for margins for Pure. So we think of it affecting our margins less than it does the most immediate quarter. And as to timing, yes, we see it as, we see the spot market and as well as our indications that new fab capacity is being delayed by NAND suppliers as positive for the pricing environment, but whether that hits our market in Q3, Q4 or Q1, that's always \u2013 that's more difficult to predict.\nRoderick Hall: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Nehal Chokshi from Maxim Group.\nNehal Chokshi: Yes. So that was actually really strong deferred revenue add especially relative to our model. And you did give the three reasons of strong renewals, longer initial subscriptions and ES2 traction. I guess, first of all, the longer initial subs, is that on ES2 or is that the other cloud-based products?\nCharles Giancarlo: Our traditional mainline business, Nehal.\nNehal Chokshi: Okay, got you. And so could you parse those three drivers in terms of what were the biggest drivers or percentage of the strong deferred revenue add?\nCharles Giancarlo: In terms of order of operations is the biggest to smallest. So again, renewals first, elongation of contracts second, and then ES2, and we're not talking about what they are on a percentage basis, but it gives you at least a sense of magnitude on how they stack up.\nNehal Chokshi: Okay. So this is your second reduction in full-year guidance. Have you guys actually reduced the sales quarter along with this reduction in your guidance? Or are the salespeople are still marching the same objectives that was initially laid out for their own plans?\nDavid Hatfield: Yes, we don't comment, Nehal. This is Hat, on quota piece, but they're marching toward the productive goals that we put out for them and those are all data driven and opportunity-based inside of their territories. And so that's what we're focused and we're driving toward participation of those folks hitting their goal.\nNehal Chokshi: Okay. And then finally, definitely appreciate the million dollar deals increased 50% Q-over-Q, but can you give color on how that did on a year-over-year basis?\nDavid Hatfield: Yes, nice progress, up year-on-year as well, so continued momentum there.\nNehal Chokshi: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini from Susquehanna Financial.\nDavid Ryzhik: Hi. Thanks so much for taking the question. This is David Ryzhik for Mehdi. Charlie, you talked about some meaningful additions to the portfolio to be announced at Accelerate. Would those be commercialized by Q4, and does your implied Q4 guide include some impact from those new products? And I had a follow-up.\nCharles Giancarlo: Yes. We've got some very exciting new products, some of which will be GA and some of which we will announce at beta. But there will be new GA products at Accelerate.\nDavid Ryzhik: Got it. Thanks. And can you maybe provide an update on your international strategy. Maybe give us, what percentage of business is international and maybe what steps you're taking to diversify the revenue base?\nCharles Giancarlo: Yes. We continue to see great progress internationally, a 24% of our revenue, I believe on the quarter. We had a particularly strong quarter on APJ, which was great, and nice to have that business come online. And obviously, you want to be looking at the biggest business, which is the Americas business in the context of that international growth, and we've had three consecutive quarters of improved performance in our Americas business. And so, that's a great indicator of the health. We think that's driven by the enterprise and public sector that we talked about, the portfolio motion that's there and the routes to market really kicking in. So of course, that leaves EMEA, and EMEA was a little softer than what we would expected, but any given quarter, you're going to have some segments perform higher and some perform lower, but we feel great about the pipeline in the second half for EMEA as well. So really nice contribution and in line with expectations.\nDavid Ryzhik: Great, thanks. And Tim, best of luck to you. It really was a pleasure.\nTimothy Riitters: Thank you, David. Appreciate it.\nDavid Ryzhik: Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from George Iwanyc from Oppenheimer.\nGeorge Iwanyc: Thank you for taking the question. With the strong new customer adds, can you maybe give us a little bit more color. Is there anything changing with the size of the lands or the makeup of the customers you're adding?\nCharles Giancarlo: Well, we've been very clear on saying, volume isn't the focus, the quality is, and so we saw a really nice mix across our focus segments of cloud, enterprise, public sector and commercial on a global basis, so continuing to focus on that G2K, native-cloud 1K and non-public kind of the central government organization. So we saw progress across all of those theaters. We like the 450 number. In our situation, we have to go take share from somebody, so 450 or seven net new customers per day \u2013 business day. Everybody else is trying to protect their base and we're having to go out and win that news. So we keep a real focus on the quality and the execution there. We think it's a really nice indicator. Relative to size, we don't talk about ASP specifically. We're seeing nice lands in each of those segments, they vary by segment, as you'd appreciate. But we're seeing nice lands and we're also seeing a continued progress on our repeat purchases. So when you look at the fundamentals, we've got to go win and take share from somebody. We're doing that better than anybody else. We're doing so at a nice ASP and our repeat purchase rate. So the temporal nature of this pricing dynamic, I think is what it is, that we'll drive through and gain our share in Q3 and Q4. We feel great about next year.\nGeorge Iwanyc: All right. And expanding on that from a competitive standpoint, so are win rates ticking up a little bit in the current environment, and is that helping drive those lands? Or are they primarily just a larger channel presence that's giving you a chance to land across more customers at the same time?\nCharles Giancarlo: Yes, we saw a nice quarter-on-quarter uptick on win rates. Year-on-year, they're stable and kind of across the board. So you're going to see little nuances on a quarter-by-quarter basis by competitor. But broadly speaking, we saw a nice pickup quarter-on-quarter, so I think that's the majority of the contribution. Our biggest competition remains not being in the fight in the first place which we are at bats. And so, as we continue to invest in our channel and continue to make them more independent, it's getting in more and more fights on the front end. We've always said, we take a lower win rate in exchange for more at bats and I maintain that, but we feel great. We're clearly differentiating ourselves, especially in the market like this with the competition, and we feel like it's the time for us to really dig in and grind, and pop out the other side of this with a lot more market share.\nGeorge Iwanyc: Thank you. And Tim, best of luck.\nTimothy Riitters: Thank you. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Eric Martinuzzi from Lake Street.\nEric Martinuzzi: Yes. My question has to do with the use of cash, you've got a tremendous amount of cash on the balance sheet. Typically, people put that to work either M&A or investing in the business, you guys are obviously pulling the lever with the repurchase program. But I guess, are we inferring from the actions that you're taking that there's not really a front burner M&A opportunity and that you're not interested and kind of taking a deeper dive into maybe a midyear course correction on sales hiring to continue to press and take share versus competitors?\nDavid Hatfield: No, our M&A strategy remains the same, which is build, partner or buy. And we have the assets to be able to do that with cash or if appropriate, stock as well. We do see a very well priced asset right now, it's called Pure Storage. And so our Board has enabled us to take advantage of that.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call back over to Charlie Giancarlo for closing remarks.\nCharles Giancarlo: Thank you. As you can see, Pure is clearly outpacing and out-innovating the legacy vendors. By creating a modern data experience, we're offering a dynamic solution that solves our customer\u2019s problems today and in the future. I want to thank Tim for his partnership over the last two years, Tim. He has had an impressive impact on Pure and he will be missed. We wish him the very best on his new adventure. And then all of us here look forward to seeing many of you at Accelerate next month. And I want to thank you for your time today.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call.

            "content": "Thanks, Hat. Q2 was a strong quarter for Pure as we continued to demonstrate industry-leading growth, gross margins, and continued innovation across our product portfolio in an evolving environment. Before I dive into the specifics, I'll make my usual note that the gross margin, operating margin, OpEx, net income, and free cash flow numbers I will use are non-GAAP unless otherwise noted. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP metrics to the GAAP comparables, as well as our full Q2 results and presentation, are available on our website at investor.purestorage.com. For the quarter, total revenue grew 28% year-on-year to $396.3 million. Product revenue grew 24% year-on-year to $300.1 million and support and subscription revenue grew 42% year-on-year to $96.2 million. Geographically, 74% of our sales came from the United States and 26% came from our International markets for the quarter. Our gross margins continue to be industry-leading with product margins well above our competitors and aggregate gross margins reaching an all-time high in the quarter of 69.4%, up 1.3 points sequentially. Total gross margins reflect the significant differentiation and innovation we deliver to our customers. Product gross margins in the quarter were 70%, up 1.3 points, due largely to benefits we are seeing in component cost declines. Support gross margins were 67.4%, up 1.1 points sequentially. The sequential increase in margins were due both to operating ongoing efficiency improvements, along with an approximately one-half point impact from one-time benefits in this line of business. Moving to operating margin, in Q2 operating profit was negative $3.2 million, or negative 0.8% of revenue, and compares to an operating profit of $0.9 million, or 0.3% in the year-ago quarter. Operating profit was better than expected due primarily to over performance on gross margins for the quarter. Q2 net income for the quarter was positive $2.5 million or positive $0.01 per share. This compares to the year-ago period of positive $2.4 million or positive $0.01 per share. The weighted-average shares used for the per-share calculation are 271 million shares in Q2 and 263 million shares in the year-ago period. Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow, we finished the quarter with cash and investments of $1.18 billion, an increase of $16 million from the previous quarter. Our quarter-on-quarter increase in cash was driven primarily by strong free cash flow in Q2 which is a typically low quarter for us. Free cash flow in Q2 was positive $19.9 million, which includes $5.7 million of impact related to our employee stock purchase plan. Adjusting for the normal impact of our employee stock purchase plan, free cash flow was positive $14.2 million in the quarter. We delivered strong deferred revenue growth in the quarter. Deferred revenue at the end of the quarter was $607.3 million, an increase of 47% over the same period a year ago. The strong deferred revenue performance was driven by three ongoing key trends: meaningful year-on-year renewals growth, longer initial subscription agreement purchases, and the early traction of our ES2 product. In addition, you will note from today's press release, Pure's Board of Directors has authorized an up to $150 million stock repurchase program. This program demonstrates the confidence in our company strategy and our long-term growth potential. Our top priority continues to be investing in our business for growth. At the same time, this program gives us one more capital allocation tool to return value to shareholders in periods where we can repurchase shares at reasonable levels and will help reduce the net amount of employee stock award dilution going forward. Now I will turn to our guidance. As it relates to revenue, first and most importantly, as Charlie mentioned we are in an inflection phase with respect to the NAND pricing environment with price declines falling faster in Q2 than we had originally anticipated. While we were able to show strong topline growth in Q2 in spite of these circumstances, we want to be mindful of this dynamic as we think about the rest of the year in developing our guide. We believe a more balanced revenue and NAND market environment will emerge as the quarters progress, and return to the consistent long-term NAND market trend line. Second, while we did not see any specific indications that macro impacted our business in the quarter, we nevertheless want to be mindful of the environment given the recent headlines and cautionary tone of other infrastructure vendors. We remain confident in our ability to drive growth in the quarters ahead. With this as context, for the third quarter of fiscal 2020, we expect revenues in the range of between $434 million and $446 million, or $440 million at the midpoint, non-GAAP gross margins in the range of between 66% and 69%, and non-GAAP operating margin in the range of between 3% and 7%, or 5% at the midpoint. For the full-year of fiscal 2020, we now expect revenues in the range of between $1.645 billion and $1.715 billion, or $1.680 billion at the midpoint, non-GAAP gross margin in the range of between 67% and 69%, and non-GAAP operating margin in the range of between 2.25% and 4.75%, or 3.5% at the midpoint. You will notice that our operating profit guidance remains unchanged. This speaks to our focus on thoughtfully and carefully investing given the current environment, and adjusting our spend plans to maintain our profit goals despite the reduction in our topline expectations. As I wrap up, I'd like to offer some final thoughts on why we continue to be excited about the road ahead here at Pure. Number one, our Q2 results highlight Pure's momentum with us growing roughly 10x faster than any of our public competitors. Number two, the fundamentals in our business remain strong. Number three, we are on the cusp of a significant and exciting product cycle. And finally, we remain focused on driving a smart and profitable business. In closing, as Charlie mentioned, I have made the personal decision to leave Pure. My last day will be later in the year, and in the interim I'll participate with the selection of and transition to our new CFO. And I will be at Accelerate next month and look forward to meeting many of you at our Investor Day. It has really been an honor to serve as Pure's CFO. The company is positioned well for the future, and I am excited to see what Pure does in its next decade. With that, I'll turn it back to the operator for questions. Hi, Alex. I appreciate, Alex. Thank you. Yes. You mean sales cohorts or customer cohorts? Sales cohorts performing nicely. I mean we had a big class come in this year and that's \u2013 the early signs are positive. You bet. Yes. This is Tim. The first part of your question, we're not just \u2013 the number, but the majority of it is really the pricing environment that Charlie talked about. As it relates to macro, certainly we want to put some sort of prudence in there as well and that's a second quarter reason for the guidance. But to your question about the signals we're seeing, one of the big measures I look at is push deals and our push deal number was down quarter-on-quarter, right, which \u2013 if you're into a macro situation that you'd expect that number to go up. So we're just really not seeing those signals when we're driving the leadership, the differentiation we are, it's obviously a good thing, but we just didn't see those signals. Yes. So on deferred revenue, a couple of things. Number one, the main reason for deferred revenue growing the way it is, is our renewals business, our subscription business. That Evergreen model is indeed working and starting to see big tranches renew a very nice renewal rates. So that's really what's happening and the main reason. On elongation of the overall initial rates that's happening, but it's more of a second order effect than the primary reason, which is renewal. Katy, this is Tim. Really it's a question of more sort of challenging in easier comps last year. So if you look at last year given some of the things we had in Q4, it's a relatively easier comp, and so by definition it's less of the adjustment that we made versus the harder comp is in Q3? Yes, something slightly different, Katy. We've talked a lot about our up-market focus and getting into larger and larger enterprise customers. Those enterprise customers tend to be more forceful and wanting longer extended terms. And it's a great use of our balance sheet. We'll do that any day if we can get into big accounts. So they'll typically take a little bit longer-term and that's what you're seeing more than anything else than they are. Thank you. Yes. Aaron, this is Tim. What I would point to is the guide that we offered for the year. I mean again, we raised it for the full-year, which speaks to the environment we're in. As it relates to a longer-term gross margin number, we don't typically talk about a longer-term number in an earnings call, so we'll probably leave it at that. Well, I think, Jason is a function of acknowledging pricing as well as sort of ensuring that, so we think about macro as well. I mean implicit in that is to think about different sort of ways of measuring conversions. So I think the short answer is yes. Thank you. Thank you, David. Appreciate it. Thank you."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Charles Giancarlo",
            "content": "Thank you, Matt, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us on today's earnings call. I will begin by sharing our high-level results from the quarter, Hat will provide a go-to-market update, and Tim will offer a detailed review of our financials. We had a strong quarter and the fundamentals of our business remain solid. For Q2, revenue was $396 million, growing 28% year-over-year, which was above the midpoint of our guidance. Our industry-leading gross margin grew to 69.4% and operating margin was a negative 0.8%, beating our guidance range. In less than 10 years, we disrupted the storage industry by creating solutions that are intelligent, automated, and modern and delivered 10x improvements in the performance, the cost of operation, and usability. We are now setting a bold new path for Pure for our second decade which will deliver the next set of 10x breakthroughs. Our goal is to take the fragmented and antiquated data storage environment and recreate it into a unified, automated, and multi-cloud data experience. Pure delivers a modern data experience to our customers. Unlike legacy infrastructure vendors, Pure enables customers to utilize more of their data, while reducing the complexity and expense of managing the infrastructure behind it. We provide a data experience that creates a common operating environment across multiple data centers and clouds, easing operations via APIs and intelligent AI-driven automation. We now offer our customers integrated hybrid cloud and on-prem solutions, consumable as a flexible subscription to deliver that modern data experience. Looking at the market as a whole, Pure is clearly out-executing our traditional competitors, some of whom have expressed concerns around the macro economy. We do not believe the macro environment has affected us this past quarter. What we do see is a significant transitory NAND supply/demand imbalance which impacted component prices and the storage industry as a whole. We expect this situation to continue to affect us for the balance of the year given the natural lag between component costs and storage market pricing. However, we are already seeing NAND pricing rise in the spot market, and suppliers are delaying additional fab capacity. We believe these signals point to an improving market next year. As compared to others, Pure's continued exceptional growth and margin leadership highlight our differentiation which is consistently validated by our growing, happy customer base. Our results underscore that our strategy is working. We also know that it is in challenging market environments when our superior value proposition enables us to gain even more market share. In today's world where data is at the core of digital transformation, legacy vendors have inexplicably decreased their investment in innovation and instead are relying on commodity hardware and software. They attempt to convince customers that all systems are the same, and that price is all that matters. Customers, however, understand that an investment in innovation is an investment in their future. Our continued investment in successful innovation is one of several reasons we are growing faster than public market competitors. At our Accelerate conference next month, we will announce groundbreaking portfolio additions and future innovations as part of our strategy for the next decade. Pure's focus on priorities important to CIOs today building a hybrid cloud; transitioning to fast, consolidated data architectures; deriving business value from AI and analytics; and enabling customers to rapidly recover from IT failures, mean that more customers than ever are choosing Pure. We are the essential company driving change in the data industry, providing an unparalleled experience which delivers business outcomes and ensures customer delight. Now, I would like to share more personal news. As you may have read in our press release, our CFO, Tim Riitters, will be leaving Pure for personal reasons. An executive search is already underway for our next CFO. Tim will participate in that process and will help in the transition. When he first joined Pure, we were less than $200 million in revenue, a private company, we had 600 employees, and just one product. Five years later, we disrupted an entire industry, we have grown almost 10x, consistently delivering double-digit annual revenue growth; we achieved profitability, acquired two companies, and dramatically expanded our portfolio. He's been an invaluable asset and has had an incredible impact on our company. I want to personally thank Tim for his years of excellent service, his consistent energy and care, and for his friendship and partnership over my tenure. With that, I'll turn it over to Hat. You bet. Yes. We're just shipping more terabytes per sale, right. And when prices drop more rapidly than you expect, it takes a while for customers to adjust to the idea of two things; one is buying more terabytes for workloads that they've already planned, but now looking at new workloads, at new tiers, and that takes a little more time and planning on the customer side. So as I've said many times in the past, Alex, that, in a steady \u2013 we live in an environment with steadily decreasing component in commodity prices, right. That's the entire tech market. And as long as it's slow and steady, the market equilibrates on that, but you do have quarters where it's faster than you expect and it takes a while for the customers to catch up with that, so that's what we saw. Yes, I'll let Hat answer that first piece, but really, those two things are quite separate for us. We're not \u2013 the balance, let's say, between enterprise and commercial is not \u2013 it did not affect or calculate into our guide at all, but I'll let Hat answer the complexion between those two. And let me just add to that. When you're an innovator and a share taker, I think the macro tends to affect you less because you're \u2013 so it maybe out there and we may just be a little less sensitive to it. But we're a share taker right now. And so that's not what \u2013 as Tim said, it's mostly the pricing environment that has created the caution. I'll take that Katy. As we said at the beginning of this year, this was going to be a major investment year for us as we expanded into enterprise and really believe that with the addition of new products that are coming out this year and early next that we were really going to be able to take just more larger share in the enterprise. But of course it's the \u2013 yes, that matter. So I would expect that this will be the year when you start to \u2013 this will be the last year where you see that and you'll start to see it come down in future years. Yes. Public sector has been an area that we've been investing in for the last couple of years. We wanted to get into a more meaningful run rate and I think the last two quarters that we've seen, three quarters that we've seen real consistent growth quarter-on-quarter. It's across the large central agencies in the federal government in the U.S., as well as state and local governments coming in and contributing. So it's nice breadth. We feel positive that will continue especially into the September quarter for the end of the fiscal year. And so we feel like we've kind of starting to hit our stride in the public sector business in the U.S. in particular, but also globally. Yes. Thanks for that question. So as you may recall, we were the \u2013 well we innovated in both cases, both at the back end and the front end and we were the first to incorporate NVMe on the back end. And of course that helped both margin and pricing and made us competitive in the market, helped overall performance of the systems versus the competitors. And then just a couple quarters ago, we introduced it on the front end with the NVMe over fabric. We are seeing a very nice interest level by the most advanced customers. As you may recall, NVMe over fabric requires a change in overall rack architecture. We're seeing a nice pickup there, but its early days. Kix, do you want to add? And customers that are using it on Amazon. No, not at all. On the asset side, we talked about the reason ARs does sort of rise a little bit. On the AP side, it's just timing. There's not really anything we're seeing in any of our vendors, which would sort of change terms or whatnot, so that I wouldn't read into that. No, I don't think so. It's still reasonable smaller contributor to our overall topline, and the deals that we're getting are new wins that they build on. So there's not a lot of pull forward in this quarter or the quarter before, and we're optimistic about what we'll see at the fiscal year-end. Sure. Well, the rapid restore has proven to be a really strong product introduction for us. This is based on FlashBlade, ObjectEngine helps in that depending on the circumstances. But rapid restore, a lot of customers never realized that they could get back up and running in less than an hour and it's proven to be a major mover of that overall FlashBlade product line. As Kix mentioned on Cloud Block Store, because it's in beta, of course, there's no revenue to speak of yet. We do have customers that are \u2013 look, I feel fairly confident, we'll see the first revenue in Q3, but as you know it's a subscription revenue, so it will be recognized ratably over the life of the contract. But we have many dozens of beta customers, and some of whom are talking about standardizing their application development as they go into the cloud on Cloud Block Store, so very promising, but very early days. Karl, that's an interesting question. We changed our pricing structure about a year-ago in order to accommodate the channel where we went to standard discount across all of the product lines and made the pricing more transparent, more easily, and gave them much clearer discretionary paths if you will in terms of how to price the product without Pure being involved. I think we were \u2013 it took us a little time to get all the tools out. That is all the electronic tools and so forth, but that's been largely done now. So I'm not quite sure where the question is ending up, but we have provided now very standard pricing into the channel. Of course, when prices drop more rapidly, we follow-up with list price changes, so that they can follow the same swim lanes if you will, which we've done and do continuously. So you want to handle the rest of the channel question, Hat? Every time we have a learning process as we had over the last couple of quarters with respect to, in particular, this pricing challenge. We bring that into our planning model going forward. But I'll tell you that it's certainly the case that when you have a commodity market that is less steady, less linear, it does get it, it does make it a little more challenging to predict going forward. With that, we try to incorporate everything that we are aware of this time, including the signals that we're seeing from the commodity market, which as I said, that, overall, the commodity prices are firming up. Now we also believe that our strategy overall is working. I mean, we are growing. I mean, despite let's say, a modification of our forecast, I mean, we're growing, in some cases 40% or more faster than our competition. That means, we're actually gaining more share. And I do believe that in tough times, leaders that is the time when leaders take more share. We are putting out \u2013 a boat loaded new products this year and early next, and I think that's going to allow us to continue to win in the future. But short-term swings are more difficult to predict. Well, Rod, you've, I think perfectly identified the fact that it creates a complex environment. Because the one thing I think that you alluded to, but then explicitly mention is also the elasticity of the market. That as pricing goes down, you can now compete for more workloads, workloads that would go to hybrid or to disk because the pricing of semiconductor flash now is more competitive. So when you roll that all together, what occurs is that in day one, you're pricing is lower, you've got to sell more terabytes to do it, customers may not yet be ready for those more terabytes. But as they do, as they understand the lower pricing, start looking at other workloads, they can bulk up on it. It's the ability of our sales force to convince the customer that they should \u2013 while prices are low, that they should buy more terabytes. It's all those things that go into making the quarter at the end of the day. With respect to margins, because we do believe that we are able to take advantage of the costs before our competitors, generally it is a good news for margins for Pure. So we think of it affecting our margins less than it does the most immediate quarter. And as to timing, yes, we see it as, we see the spot market and as well as our indications that new fab capacity is being delayed by NAND suppliers as positive for the pricing environment, but whether that hits our market in Q3, Q4 or Q1, that's always \u2013 that's more difficult to predict. Our traditional mainline business, Nehal. In terms of order of operations is the biggest to smallest. So again, renewals first, elongation of contracts second, and then ES2, and we're not talking about what they are on a percentage basis, but it gives you at least a sense of magnitude on how they stack up. Yes. We've got some very exciting new products, some of which will be GA and some of which we will announce at beta. But there will be new GA products at Accelerate. Yes. We continue to see great progress internationally, a 24% of our revenue, I believe on the quarter. We had a particularly strong quarter on APJ, which was great, and nice to have that business come online. And obviously, you want to be looking at the biggest business, which is the Americas business in the context of that international growth, and we've had three consecutive quarters of improved performance in our Americas business. And so, that's a great indicator of the health. We think that's driven by the enterprise and public sector that we talked about, the portfolio motion that's there and the routes to market really kicking in. So of course, that leaves EMEA, and EMEA was a little softer than what we would expected, but any given quarter, you're going to have some segments perform higher and some perform lower, but we feel great about the pipeline in the second half for EMEA as well. So really nice contribution and in line with expectations. Well, we've been very clear on saying, volume isn't the focus, the quality is, and so we saw a really nice mix across our focus segments of cloud, enterprise, public sector and commercial on a global basis, so continuing to focus on that G2K, native-cloud 1K and non-public kind of the central government organization. So we saw progress across all of those theaters. We like the 450 number. In our situation, we have to go take share from somebody, so 450 or seven net new customers per day \u2013 business day. Everybody else is trying to protect their base and we're having to go out and win that news. So we keep a real focus on the quality and the execution there. We think it's a really nice indicator. Relative to size, we don't talk about ASP specifically. We're seeing nice lands in each of those segments, they vary by segment, as you'd appreciate. But we're seeing nice lands and we're also seeing a continued progress on our repeat purchases. So when you look at the fundamentals, we've got to go win and take share from somebody. We're doing that better than anybody else. We're doing so at a nice ASP and our repeat purchase rate. So the temporal nature of this pricing dynamic, I think is what it is, that we'll drive through and gain our share in Q3 and Q4. We feel great about next year. Yes, we saw a nice quarter-on-quarter uptick on win rates. Year-on-year, they're stable and kind of across the board. So you're going to see little nuances on a quarter-by-quarter basis by competitor. But broadly speaking, we saw a nice pickup quarter-on-quarter, so I think that's the majority of the contribution. Our biggest competition remains not being in the fight in the first place which we are at bats. And so, as we continue to invest in our channel and continue to make them more independent, it's getting in more and more fights on the front end. We've always said, we take a lower win rate in exchange for more at bats and I maintain that, but we feel great. We're clearly differentiating ourselves, especially in the market like this with the competition, and we feel like it's the time for us to really dig in and grind, and pop out the other side of this with a lot more market share. Thank you. As you can see, Pure is clearly outpacing and out-innovating the legacy vendors. By creating a modern data experience, we're offering a dynamic solution that solves our customer's problems today and in the future. I want to thank Tim for his partnership over the last two years, Tim. He has had an impressive impact on Pure and he will be missed. We wish him the very best on his new adventure. And then all of us here look forward to seeing many of you at Accelerate next month. And I want to thank you for your time today."

            "name": "David Hatfield",
            "content": "Thanks, Charlie. And let me add my thanks to Tim for all he has done over the past five years. We hope you can enjoy some much deserved time with family and friends. Pure is positioned to help enterprises tackle their most strategic IT initiatives, is gaining market share, and enabling our customers to achieve outcomes that were not previously possible. Our industry-leading customer satisfaction, our Evergreen ownership model, and our expanding suite of solutions position us not only as the most innovative, but also the safest choice for our customers. In contrast, Pure is growing approximately 10x faster than any competitor and their rate of spending on innovation is on average 2x less than Pure's R&D investment. Customers are challenged with navigating competitor product-line consolidation and disruptive upgrades, while Pure's customers reap the benefit of our Evergreen experience with its continuous expansion of new capabilities and services. We believe that data is strategic to our customer's digital transformation journey. Data requires innovation and investment, especially as new application architectures are driving unprecedented levels of performance, parallelism, and multi-cloud data workflows. Customers are selecting Pure because we enable them to simultaneously modernize their existing applications and accelerate their adoption of hybrid cloud, containers, DevOps, AI, and real-time analytics, at scale. Unlike our competitors, who are simply shipping commodity storage arrays, Pure's modern data experience is cloud-managed, AI-driven, constantly improving, and consumable via a flexible subscription model that can be deployed in a hybrid IT environment. This is not your grandparents' data storage environment. Our focus on the largest consumers of storage across Cloud, Enterprise, Commercial and Public Sector markets is working. Customers are realizing Pure's differentiation and our win rates continued to hold nicely. We finished the quarter with more than 6,600 total customers, adding approximately seven net-new each business day, equated to more than 450 new customers in Q2, the highest number in any Q2 of our history. During last earnings, we discussed the increase of new sellers and the transition we encountered in Q1. In Q2, we were pleased with the level of sales execution and the quality and ramp of new sellers. This quarter, we closed a number of large transactions, including a 50% increase in million-dollar deals from Q1. We were particularly pleased with the progress in our Enterprise and Public Sector segments, as both outpaced the growth of our overall business. Turning to our technology and strategic partnerships. We saw continued progress across our ecosystem in the fastest growing segments of the market. Alliances include Splunk and Elastic in next-generation analytics, NVIDIA for AI and Machine Learning, Cisco for mission-critical converged infrastructure, and a broad range of data protection partners to deliver the next-generation of Rapid Restore and Data Protection. We were thrilled with the continued FlashBlade momentum, specifically in the Rapid Restore and data analytics use cases, as well as the excitement for our Cloud Data Services, including Cloud Block Store on AWS. We will share more on this with them at Accelerate next month. To highlight some of this momentum, in Q2 a large U.S. government agency chose FlashBlade and Splunk SmartStore to meet policy objectives for regulatory compliance and to manage a large scale implementation. As a result, the agency eliminated multiple copies of data, reduced their physical footprint by 8 to 1, and avoided thousands of dollars in potential penalties for power and space consumption achieving a highly compelling TCO. Another notable customer success in the quarter, a large global asset management firm, chose Pure for ease of management, cloud-native automation, and orchestration in their hybrid cloud environment. By freeing up time, resources, and money, this firm can now focus on their own innovation instead of day-to-day operations. And finally, the interest in our unique unified subscription model across hybrid IT with our Cloud Data Services and Evergreen Storage Service is growing. This quarter, a mid-sized hospital in Illinois invested more than $2 million in our ES2 offering. This customer moved their existing infrastructure to a 100% subscription model with Pure, which enables easy capacity and performance planning, and will allow them to shift to Cloud Block Store on AWS under their ES2 contract. Customers like this have realized that ES2 empowers them to utilize our technology on-premises today, while also preserving future flexibility for where and how they will architect their data strategy going forward. We are as excited as ever to execute on our long-term vision and provide freedom for organizations to build for today and tomorrow. Pure's Q2 performance and rapid market share gains against the competition demonstrate our differentiation from our traditional peers. We truly are just getting started. See you at Accelerate next month. And with that, I will now turn it over to Tim. Tim? Yes, really good progress in enterprise. In my prepared remarks, we talked about enterprise and the public sector both outpacing the growth of the company. That's a highlight. Quarter-on-quarter, more million dollar deals closed, including a couple of the larger ones we talked about in Q1 for seven and eight figures. So we feel great about the momentum in the business overall. Yes. I've said this before. We don't win on price, we don't lose on price, and generally, we're not losing on price. So, I think the upward margin reflects the fact that we do get to take advantage of lower component pricing before the rest of the competition, so that adds a little bit to it. I think if we thought that we could win a deal, especially with a new customer by discounting, we do it. So that's not holding us back. So generally, those are not the things that \u2013 pricing is not the thing that's holding us back. Yes. This is Hat. I'd say that we actually saw a really strong July, and we had solid linearity throughout the quarter, but differently what some of our peers were seeing. We actually see things really had great momentum toward the end and continued momentum in the beginning of Q3. Yes. We're super diligent on looking at all the cohort classes. We have 27 cohort classes that we've had since I've been here and we looked at month-by-month. And what we measure is, they ramped productivity relative to their peer group. And so we've seen the largest classes we've had over the last couple of quarters come in and deliver in line with expectations and in line with previous cohorts. So it's early days and we're spending a lot of time and energy, driving enablement, et cetera, but really nice early signs. Hey, Aaron. This is Hat. Yes. So first of all, the portfolio motion is really working well. It's a key contributor to why we're thrilled with the FlashBlade performance, but we also saw a really nice uptick in our FlashStack business. And as we introduced new products, the ability to have our core reps attached that to their deals or find other opportunities through that portfolio motion is super encouraging. So we haven't provided any specific metrics on that. But we're seeing a nice uptick on the percentage of our core sellers selling multiple products, which is really the key pull through metric that we look at. And on the GSI win that we mentioned a couple of quarters ago, yes, we did see some incremental contribution from that in the quarter and seeing great pipeline build in the number of product announcements with their organization specifically and then broadly across the rest of the GSI sector, we're seeing nice momentum. So that route to market as we talked about was going to be critical for us and it's nice to see us starting to contribute net revenue in the quarter. Yes. Tim, this is Hat. Let me take the first part of that. The investments really are across the number of areas. One is sales capacity, and so we've obviously made a significant investment in Q4 and Q1 of that, Q2 is route to the market. And so one of the reasons why we've been highlighting the GSI wins and the managed service provider wins with Rackspace and others, those are critical routes to market to be able to go get access to the enterprise customers that take some time to build. But we see really nice trajectory on that as well as continued growth of the mix of the pipeline of larger deals. And I think as we look at those metrics, all very encouraging signs. As Charlie mentioned, we do expect to get some leverage as that capacity comes on line through next year and the year beyond that. And those are opportunities where the TAM is higher. So we do get, and we'll expect to get more revenue per quota-bearing head that are catering to those enterprise customers. Yes. So philosophically the channel has been incredibly a productive asset for us from the very beginning and we anticipated continuing to do so. I mean majority of our net new customers are identified by our channel partners. Getting the right routes to market to map to the customers that we're segmenting in, our GSIs are getting us access to large scale enterprises. That was very difficult for us to get access to on our own. And we're driving toward independence. So we can actually lower our costs by leveraging the channel over time to be able to quote and configure and sell independent of Pure. And so as I look at the channel of the partner ecosystem, those are all accelerators and routes to market, but to the extent they don't deliver that value to us. We'll look at it very practically and making sure we're getting the right ROI for every dollar we put into it. Yes, we don't comment, Nehal. This is Hat, on quota piece, but they're marching toward the productive goals that we put out for them and those are all data driven and opportunity-based inside of their territories. And so that's what we're focused and we're driving toward participation of those folks hitting their goal. Yes, nice progress, up year-on-year as well, so continued momentum there. No, our M&A strategy remains the same, which is build, partner or buy. And we have the assets to be able to do that with cash or if appropriate, stock as well. We do see a very well priced asset right now, it's called Pure Storage. And so our Board has enabled us to take advantage of that."

            "name": "Matt Kixmoeller",
            "content": "No, I think that's great. I mean, the only thing I would add is as we talk with industry analysts, I think in the last quarter we mentioned that we're at this point, kind of a majority of our businesses shift with NVMe. And the comments from the analysts lead us to believe that we're far, far ahead of any competitor in that regard. I'll answer the question about Cloud Data Services. So I'd say overall, we're still in the beta phase with our Cloud Block Store. But it's already turning into be a success for our product line as a whole. If you talk about the platform motion that Hat mentioned earlier, having a cloud dimension to our platform has materially changed the kinds of conversations we're in and how people look at not only the platform today, but where it can take them in the future. And the flexibility we provide around ES2 is to be able to deploy on-prem and extend that to the cloud in the future again has really materially changed the discussion. In terms of the beta, going really well, great results from that so far and come to Accelerate next month, you'll hear more from both us and Amazon at Accelerate. I'll just add, you asked about use cases. I think one of the things we've been pleased about is, is really the diversity of the use cases, where we see people wanting to do application migration, but actually in both directions. So people are interested in doing say, Dev/Test on-prem, deploy in the cloud or the other way around. People are interested in DR as a use case between on-prem and cloud, and then of course, just application mobility. So it's still early days, but we're encouraged by what we're seeing."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Pure Storage First Quarter Fiscal 2020 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Matthew Danziger, Head of Investor Relations. You may begin your conference. \nMatthew Danziger: Thank you and good afternoon. Welcome to the Pure Storage First Quarter Fiscal 2020 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me today are our CEO, Charlie Giancarlo; our CFO, Tim Riitters; our President, David Hatfield; and our VP of Strategy, Matt Kixmoeller.\n Before we begin, I would like to remind you that during this call, management will make forward-looking statements, which are subject to various risks and uncertainties. These include statements regarding competitive industry and technology trends; our strategy, positioning and opportunity; our current and future products; business and operations, including our operating model; growth prospects; and revenue and margin guidance for future periods. Any forward-looking statements that we make are based on assumptions as of today, and we undertake no obligation to update them. Our actual results may differ materially from the results predicted, and reported results should not be considered as an indication of future performance. A discussion of risks and uncertainties relating to our business is contained in our filings with the SEC, and we refer you to these public filings.\n During this call, we will discuss non-GAAP measures in talking about the company's performance, and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are provided in our earnings press release and slides.\n This call is being broadcast live on the Pure Storage Investor Relations website and is being recorded for playback purposes. An archive of the webcast will be available on the IR website for at least 45 days and is the property of Pure Storage.\n With that, I'll turn the call over to our CEO, Charlie Giancarlo. \nCharles Giancarlo: Thank you, Matt, and good afternoon, everyone. We appreciate you joining us on today's earnings call. I will begin by sharing our high-level results from the quarter. Hat will provide a go-to-market update; and finally, Tim will offer a detailed review of our financials.\n The fundamentals of our business are strong. We are broadening our customer base. We are delivering new innovation through both organic and inorganic investments, and we continue to delight our customers.\n For Q1, revenue was $327 million, growing 28% year-over-year. While we are growing well above the industry average, we were not satisfied with our results this quarter. Gross margin remained strong at 68.1% and operating margin was negative 9.6%. Revenue was just below the low end of our guidance, and consequently, profitability was below our guidance.\n As you know, a particular area of focus has been to increase our at bats and expand our engagement with large enterprise customers. To that end, we have hired aggressively, adding nearly 40% more capacity to our sales force this last year. With this additional investment, we are seeing a significant increase in the number of large enterprise opportunities.\n We are aggressively going after legacy storage vendors. We are consistently beating them in the commercial market, and now we are increasingly going after them in the largest enterprise environments. We are excited about these opportunities as we continue to expand both our product portfolio and our enterprise business model. The shape of our business is changing for the good, but it will have more variability. Thus, we believe it prudent to modestly adjust our revenue guide for the year to 27.5% annual growth.\n We continue to position Pure ahead of the relevant trends that are top priorities for CIOs: hybrid cloud, fast consolidated data architectures, AI and analytics, and rapid recovery from failure. I want to share some highlights on our work in these areas this past quarter.\n Pure is leading the industry with DirectFlash Fabric on FlashArray, a hyperscale architecture enabling large-scale stateless compute. Hyperscale architecture leverages Pure shared storage with direct attached performance for modern, efficient application environments.\n ObjectEngine, which became generally available in Q1, is resonating with customers, delivering on our vision that customers need rapid restoration of critical data and applications rather than just backup. Customers can now recover data in minutes versus hours or days by using ObjectEngine with FlashBlade on-prem. And by using AWS S3, ObjectEngine becomes a cost-effective archive destination for long-term data retention, enabling additional uses of data in the cloud.\n ObjectEngine is just one part of our comprehensive suite of Cloud Data Services. We are enabling our core FlashArray software, Purity, to run natively in the public cloud. Cloud Block Store, which delivers enterprise-grade storage on the public cloud, is now many months into beta use with great customer feedback.\n Lastly, this quarter, we acquired Compuverde, a leading developer of file software solutions for enterprises and cloud providers. Their highly scalable software will accelerate our road map to provide a unified file and block offering, opening new markets for Pure and expanding our file capabilities for Pure customers.\n We remain excited about the opportunities in front of us. We have a $50 billion total addressable market in multiple product segments that are essential to powering modern digital businesses. We continue to delight our customers, expanding in accounts once we are established. We continue to take market share in our industry and are extending our enterprise sales motion. And we have a strong pipeline of new and innovative products to enable continued growth of our business. We are confident in the investments we are making.\n With that, I'll turn it over to Hat. \nDavid Hatfield: Thanks, Charlie. Pure's strategy remains clear: to deliver the technology, the customer experience and business model that enterprises want, setting the company completely apart from the industry. Our investments in and focus on the enterprise, largest cloud and service providers and governments globally is working, but it is changing the shape of our business and this impacted our Q1 results.\n First, we added over 40% new sales capacity in the past year, including nearly 30% in the past 6 months alone. This, together with typical account transitions that occur at the beginning of the fiscal year, took more focus than expected. Second, the mix of large enterprise deals increased by 2x more than it has been historically, reflecting solid progress as we move upmarket. However, these transactions tend to take longer to close and have more variability.\n As we enter Q2, the account transitions are behind us. The series of large deals we had in Q1 are still active, and the changing shape of the business is reflected in our guidance for the year. The underlying metrics of repeat purchases, customer retention, partner leverage and win rates are all continuing to perform nicely.\n The core of our business, cloud, commercial and public sector, is strong, growing over 30% year-over-year. We finished the quarter with approximately 6,200 total customers, greater than 350 new customers in Q1, equating to more than 5 new customer additions per day. In addition, we are pleased with our growth in international markets, contributing to 30% of revenue in the quarter.\n Shifting to our portfolio. We continue to be excited with the speed of innovation supporting Pure's 4 growth areas: hybrid cloud, fast consolidated data architectures, AI/analytics, and rapid restore. These capabilities expand our TAM while also increasing the relevance with senior executives and new buying centers.\n Pure's cloud strategy is resonating, and in particular, Cloud Block Store beta customers, including Mid-America Labs, have seen early success with key use cases such as disaster recovery and application migration. This quarter, we also announced the expansion of our Evergreen Storage Service, ES2, providing customers with a unified subscription model across hybrid environments. Enterprises can now use Pure's storage-as-a-service model on-premises, hosted and in the cloud without the need to manage multiple subscriptions or purchase separate overlapping capacity.\n Next, we see continued progress with AI initiatives, and Pure is paving the way with solutions from early inception to large-scale production. This quarter, customers across several industries, including Geisinger Health, have chosen the AIRI converge platform from Pure, NVIDIA and Cisco as the backbone of their AI deployments to gain better insight into their data.\n And finally, this quarter, U.K. Ministry of Defense and the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center have both chosen FlashBlade, signaling the excitement around our flash-to-flash-to-cloud architecture and rapid restore use case. This is yet another proof point for Pure beginning to disrupt the roughly $8 billion data protection market.\n Shifting to our go-to-market momentum. Pure's partner ecosystem continues to broaden and deliver real impact to the business. We saw another good quarter from national partners with solid year-over-year growth and increased net new logo contribution. Strategic alliance partnerships were also a bright spot in Q1, particularly with next-generation analytics use cases like Spark, Elastic and Splunk. And perhaps most exciting, as we execute on our cloud strategy, our relationship with AWS is advancing through further joint engineering development, sales enablement and global alignment.\n We also continue to see success driving large enterprise and government businesses through global systems integrators with a combination of sell to activities, migrating dozens of the largest global enterprises onto Pure as part of their managed services and sell with motions, building new pipeline [ in advance ] from our joint offerings.\n In summary, we are as excited as ever with the added sales capacity, continued rate of innovation and expanding partner ecosystem. We continue to execute on our long-term vision, are making great progress with large enterprises, and we are growing 3x faster than our competitors, taking share in the overall storage market. We truly are just getting started.\n With that, I will now turn it over to Tim. Tim? \nTimothy Riitters: Thanks, Hat. Q1 was a solid beginning of the year for Pure as we continue to demonstrate growth at scale, industry-leading gross margins and continued innovation across our product portfolio. Before I dive into the specifics, I'll make my usual note that the gross margin, operating margin, OpEx, net income and free cash flow numbers I will use are non-GAAP unless otherwise noted. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP metrics to their GAAP comparables as well as our full Q1 results and presentation are available on our website at investor.purestorage.com.\n For the quarter, total revenue grew 28% year-on-year to $326.7 million. Product revenue grew 22% year-on-year to $238.7 million, and support revenue grew 45% year-on-year to $88 million. Geographically, 70% of sales came from the United States and 30% came from our international markets for the quarter.\n Our gross margins continue to be strong, remaining at the upper end of our long-term model range of between 63% and 68%. Total gross margins for the quarter were 68.1%, up 0.5 point sequentially. Our industry-leading gross margins continue to reflect the value we deliver to our customers through consistent differentiation, technological innovation and customer focus. Product gross margins were 68.7%, up 0.9 point sequentially due primarily to benefits we are seeing in component costs. Support gross margins were 66.3%, down 0.5 point sequentially. The sequential decrease in margins is due to continued investments in our professional services organization as we build support capabilities to serve our largest and most strategic customers.\n OpEx was $254 million for the quarter. As has been our pattern for the last several years, Q1 was an investment quarter, particularly in the hiring of our sales force, and this year was no different. As you heard from Charlie and Hat earlier, we are pleased with the significant additional sales capacity we've added in the last 6 months.\n Moving to operating margins. In Q1, operating profit was negative $31.2 million or negative 9.6% of revenue and compares to an operating profit of negative $15.3 million or negative 6% in the year ago quarter. Operating profit was less than expected due to our lower-than-expected top line performance. This revenue shortfall directly impacts our bottom line. While we were not satisfied with our profit performance this quarter given our revenue shortfall, we remain on track to drive profitability for the full year.\n Q1 net income for the quarter was negative $27.6 million or negative $0.11 per share. This compares to the year ago period of negative $16.2 million or negative $0.07 per share. The weighted average shares used for the per share calculations were 245 million shares in Q1 and 224 million shares for the year ago period.\n Moving on to the balance sheet and cash flow. We finished the quarter with cash and investments of $1.17 billion, a decrease of $31 million from the previous quarter. Our quarter-on-quarter decrease in cash was impacted by a $60 million cash payment as part of the Compuverde acquisition. Without this impact, we would have grown our cash balance for the seventh straight quarter in a row.\n We had another strong quarter of deferred revenue growth, which we believe is a key indicator of the success we are having in executing on our strategy and building long-term relationships with our customers. Deferred revenue at the end of the quarter was $564.3 million, an increase of 45% over the same period a year ago. The strong deferred revenue performance continues to be driven by 3 key trends: significant year-on-year renewals growth, longer initial service agreement purchases and the early momentum we are seeing with our ES2 product line.\n Free cash flow in Q1 was negative $17.7 million, which includes $22 million of impact related to our employee stock purchase plan. Adjusting for the normal impact of our employee stock purchase plan, free cash flow was positive $4.3 million in the quarter.\n Now I will turn to our guidance. As you heard us say earlier, we have put a significant amount of capacity into the business with an emphasis on our enterprise segment. Our focus on the enterprise has already yielded results, adding a significant number of large opportunities for our sales team to execute on.\n We're excited that larger deals are becoming a more important part of our overall business. At the same time, we would naturally expect a greater degree of fluctuation in any given quarter. As such, we are prudently incorporating these dynamics into our outlook.\n For the second quarter of fiscal 2020, we expect revenues in the range of between $389 million and $401 million, a $395 million midpoint or 28% year-over-year revenue growth; non-GAAP gross margin in the range of between 65% and 68%; and non-GAAP operating margin in the range of between negative 5% to negative 1% or negative 3% at the midpoint. For the full year of fiscal 2020, we now expect revenues of between $1.7 billion and $1.77 billion, a $1.735 billion midpoint or 27.5% year-over-year growth; non-GAAP gross margin in the range of between 65.5% and 68%; and non-GAAP operating margin in the range of between positive 1.5% and positive 5.5% or positive 3.5% at the midpoint.\n With that, I'll turn it back over to the operator for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Alex Kurtz from KeyBanc. \nAlexander Kurtz: Can you hear me okay? \nCharles Giancarlo: Yes, Alex. \nAlexander Kurtz: Just a clarification, then a question. So on -- Tim, on ES2, I know there had been some revenue headwinds created by that service. Was wondering if there's any contribution this quarter. And then on the broader sales question, just want to take your temperature on the competitive environment. I know that the incumbents are appearing to discount at pretty extreme levels to retain footprint. I'm just kind of wondering if that's playing into all of this as well. \nTimothy Riitters: Yes. So Alex, this is Tim. On ES2, ES2 is tracking very nicely to our expectations for the quarter. So that business is performing where we expected it. So not an explanation of the couple of points off of our overall performance. \nDavid Hatfield: And Alex, this is Hat. On the competitive landscape, I wouldn't say anything's materially different in the quarter than what we've seen historically. As you know, we focus on value, not price. And so when we get our TCO argument in place and people understand our technology and our differentiated business model and customer experience, our win rates are holding great against them. \nAlexander Kurtz: So Dave, just... \nCharles Giancarlo: I would -- Alex, I'd add, though, that in the net new logos in the large enterprise, they'll go to almost any length to keep us out. And so our -- the early entry into the enterprise is something that we're putting a special attention on. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Steve Milunovich from Wolfe Research. \nSteven Milunovich: First of all, just want to be clear. Last quarter, you had an issue with your EMS provider on the timing of deliveries. Has that completely passed? Was that a factor at all? And then second, Charlie, when you first arrived, you talked about wanting to get more efficiency out of new salespeople, get them effective faster. You're obviously bringing in lots of people, and it sounds like it's fairly recent. Do you feel like you're getting that efficiency from the cohorts? Or is it going to lag a little bit because you are going for these larger accounts? \nCharles Giancarlo: Right. So on the ops question, no, ops performed flawlessly that -- this quarter, so I think that's largely behind us now. And then let me just start on the productivity question. We do think we have a very good factory for new sales reps that -- and new SEs that come in. So we've got a pretty good factory. But really not only did we have a record number, but we had a record percentage add this Q1 over the last 6 months. And so that always takes a lot of work and effort as Hat put in, and it's something that we're going to pay a lot of attention to over the next quarter or 2. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Aaron Rakers from Wells Fargo. \nAaron Rakers: I'm going to slip in 2 as well. Maybe first a little bit of a clarification just so I understand the model. Can you explain or define exactly what enterprise deals are? What percentage of your revenue is in enterprise deals and maybe how that compares to a year ago? I'm just trying to understand and put some context behind this business push in going after these enterprise deals. And then the second real quick question, I'll just put it out there right away, is, Charlie, can you give us some flavor of how effective you've been, either be it metrics quantitatively or even qualitatively in selling a portfolio motion for the company, meaning deals that you sell both FlashArray and FlashBlade? Or any kind of metrics you can share on that front would be helpful. \nCharles Giancarlo: Yes. Hat, you want to start? \nDavid Hatfield: Yes. So a, when we talk about enterprise deals, we're talking about multi-million-dollar large deals, so the shape of those is expanding and really nice lead 2x over a year ago period. And then as a percent of the overall, we haven't broken everything out from a revenue mix perspective, but we did talk about we're now 40% of the Fortune 500, so we're incrementally adding there and added over 100 enterprise customers in the quarter as well. So not only the quantity of new customer adds were great, but the quality were nice as well. \nAaron Rakers: Just to be clear, that's 100 new customers that were deal sizes greater than $1 million or not? I'm just -- I want to... \nDavid Hatfield: There are 2 different issues. We're obviously working within our installed base, and so the average deals [ suits ] are growing and the mix of the larger deals as a percentage of the overall pipeline is higher, 2x higher than we've seen historically. So we like that shape. Obviously, there's more variability in those deals and takes sometimes longer for those to close. But we like the strategic nature in which we're competing for the larger transactions. And a separate topic, from an enterprise perspective, a combination of the Fortune 500 now at 40% and 100 new -- net new enterprise customer adds in the quarter are 2 good proof points in terms of the progress upmarket. \nAaron Rakers: Okay. And then on the portfolio motion? \nCharles Giancarlo: Right. On the portfolio, it had been something along the lines of 30%, although I'm not -- is that correct, Kix? FlashBlade and FlashArray customers -- or 30% of FlashBlade customers are FlashArray customers. \nMatt Kixmoeller: I don't know the number off hand, but we are absolutely seeing bundling working. And I think that was one of our key investment areas, was the belief that not only can we get synergy between FlashArray and FlashBlade, but as we start to tie in rapid recovery and use cases to really drive closer synergies between them, we're just seeing that bundling take off. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Pinjalim Bora from JPMorgan. \nPinjalim Bora: Just on double clicking on the performance, seems like the DR at least outperformed our numbers, grew massively. Is it possible to understand how much of a positive variance was DR for you in Q1 versus what you had expected 90 days ago? \nTimothy Riitters: Well, on deferred revenue, I guess I would say we've known, as we've looked at the business for the last several quarters, that, that flywheel in our strategy is indeed working. So you're seeing very nice customer retention rates, and so very nice customer retention rates resulted in increasing deferred revenue balance. So that's obviously a positive trend.\n I think the other positive trend we're seeing there is that customers are taking and buying longer-term subscription contracts with us from the get-go, which basically speaks to us about making a longer term and a more pronounced commitment to Pure. And obviously, we like that. That builds the deferred revenue balance as well. So I think, again, we were expecting these types of performance, and we're very happy with where the deferred revenue balance landed this quarter. \nPinjalim Bora: Okay. And again, on tariffs, I mean obviously, I don't think you will probably have much impact from it. But it was -- was there any direct impact? And more importantly, was there -- did you sign -- saw any kind of slowness in sales cycle as an indirect impact of tariffs affecting spending environments, leading to higher security [ and ] deal sign-offs, et cetera? Or was there any hangover from the government shutdown last -- end of the year? \nTimothy Riitters: Yes, I'll take the first part of the question and I'll have Hat answer the second part of the question. On the COGS and bill of materials side, relatively small amount of our overall BOM is sourced out of China so therefore, very, very little impact to us on the cost side. \nDavid Hatfield: Yes. Similar on the sales cycle. Directly related to that, we had a nice contribution, 30% of our revenue coming from our international markets. So those businesses are firing nicely. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Jason Ader from William Blair. \nJason Ader: I have got a couple I want to slip in, too. Just on continuing on the last thread. Did you say the environment is tougher today just from a business standpoint, getting deals done versus a year ago? I mean you saw NetApp have a challenge last quarter. You saw Nutanix have some struggle. It seems like maybe there's a larger environment issue here. \nCharles Giancarlo: Yes. Obviously, last year this time, there was a bit of tailwind in the -- in this market, overall growing or growing fairly well or better than it had been in several years. I would say, today, there's no tail -- we don't perceive a tailwind, but we don't see a lot of headwind either from an overall macro standpoint. We think our challenges are our challenges, and we're still a relatively small player in a huge market. So it's really up to us to capture more of that share. \nJason Ader: Okay. Great. And then secondly, maybe for Tim. When did you know you were going to miss? And with these deals that slipped, were they -- that didn't close? Were they lost to competitors? Or did they slip into the Q2 period? \nTimothy Riitters: Yes. So all of those deals absolutely are still active, Jason. So they slipped into the Q2 period. And I think, again, that's what we talked about in our prepared remarks, is that as you engage in these larger deals, they go sometimes on their own cycles. And so again, what we're happy about is we're absolutely continuing to be in the fight on these deals. \nDavid Hatfield: Yes. And I just... \nJason Ader: And when does it... \nDavid Hatfield: Sorry, Jason. \nJason Ader: Go ahead. Go ahead. \nDavid Hatfield: Yes, I mean I think we did anticipate sort of every year you've got -- you have transition of accounts and new capacity, et cetera. I think the added capacity at the scale that we did it, kind of order 40%, created more transition from a territory management perspective than we have done historically. And so the good news is that's behind us. And I think on the larger deals, we love the size of deals we're competing for and the relevance that we're having in the large enterprise. And so the shape changes, but it changes for the better. And I think we factored that in -- variability in for the balance of the year. \nJason Ader: I mean was this a situation where you kind of thought you were going to hit numbers until like the very end and it just didn't come true? Or was this something that was problematic throughout the quarter and it just didn't -- sort of you were behind plan all quarter? \nTimothy Riitters: No, I mean I guess -- and we typically don't talk about variability in the quarter, Jason. What I'll tell you is that sort of we had a good last half -- last part of the quarter, very strong part of the quarter end. Again, this is relative to our expectations. We're outside of guidance by a couple of million dollars. So again, it's not a big number. It's really -- we really look at the fact that the business continues to grow 28%. And doing that at scale in this environment, it's something we're particularly proud of. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Karl Ackerman from Cowen. \nKarl Ackerman: I think investors understand your weaker operating margin this quarter given you previously committed to invest in R&D and head count. But in the event compute and source spending doesn't return as healthily in the back half as you may expect, how much capability do you have at pushing out R&D projects that perhaps don't yet have order rates attached to them yet? \nCharles Giancarlo: Right. Well, that's a perspective for the future. But in general, at this kind of gross margins that we're operating with, we've got a lot of leverage in the business. And so -- and I've been clear that if investments don't yield the kind of results we expect on the top line in terms of growth that we will bring spending in line with that. So that's for the future right now. Right now we believe we're making the right investments, and it's going to yield the kind of growth that we've seen historically. And so we feel very strongly about the investments that we're making currently. We have -- as you might imagine and if you look at it, we are bring spending down more in line with our growth. But at this point, we feel confident about the investments we're currently making. \nKarl Ackerman: Appreciate that. If I may squeeze in one more. You previously suggested Cloud Data Services, I think, would be in GA later this quarter. But Compuverde would seem to accelerate your efforts. So maybe quantify the capabilities Compuverde provides you for Cloud Data Services and whether you think you have all the pieces of your portfolio to compete more competitively in cloud file services. \nMatt Kixmoeller: This is Kix. I'll take that one. So yes, we're tracking well, first off, with Block Store as well as our ObjectEngine cloud product. Both are on track for GA in the second half of the year. And more broadly beyond that, the Compuverde acquisition was an acquisition for really bringing the software-defined file capability in the company. Our first approach with that is really going to be to leverage it as part of the FlashArray product line. If you look at the unified space within the block world, there is a number of customers who buy just a few arrays and really expect both file and -- file protocol and block protocol out of those arrays. And so our first integration with Compuverde will be to help deliver unified capabilities for FlashArray, and we really think that sets us up well to go after the entirety of the file market. We're already doing really well at the high end with FlashBlade going after next-gen use cases, going after really high-performance use cases. This will allow us to feather in the more scalable kind of lower part of the file market to really be able to have a solution and the right solution for every part of the market. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Andrew Nowinski from Piper Jaffray. \nAndrew Nowinski: I want to ask a question as it relates to your guidance for the year. So if we take out the $15 million to $20 million that slipped into Q1 from that contract manufacturing issue you had last quarter, your revenue has only increased about 21%, which is well below the 27.5% growth you guided to for the year. So I'm wondering if you could just walk us through the puts and takes that give you confidence that your business can accelerate well above that normalized growth rate that you just delivered. \nCharles Giancarlo: Right. Well, as we've stated last quarter, I mean every quarter is a new quarter for sales operations. So you start from 0. And we had incorporated in the Q4 results obviously into our Q1 at the time. So as we look -- what we have done is we've taken the same kind of map that we do for guide and in this case, looked at the percentage of large deals in the pipeline and adjusted for the greater variability of those large deals. And all of that gave us confidence in this new guide. Obviously, we are where we are today. We don't want to be in the same position later in the year, which was the primary reason for adjusting the guide. \nTimothy Riitters: Well -- and Andrew, I'd say a couple of additional things as well. So first of all, you sort of quoted the $15 million to $20 million number, and again, we've never said $15 million to $20 million. Remember that a portion of that was ES2 -- a large portion of that was ES2, so that $15 million number is a bit high as you sort of think about how you sort of rolled your model from Q4 into Q1.\n I think more broadly, though, as well is that we talked about this at the beginning of the year. We talk about it again right now, which is new routes to market, new product innovations Kix just talked about coming out later this year combined with a very significant increase in overall productive capacity in the form of quota bearing heads. All of those things sort of bode well for our excitement about what really is and not that much, if any, reacceleration in the business after you sort of normalize some of these revenue patterns we just talked about. \nAndrew Nowinski: Okay. And then your DSOs increased for roughly 5 straight quarters and are kind of the highest level we've ever seen. I guess is that what we would expect given the increasing mix from enterprise? \nTimothy Riitters: Well, I think you're absolutely right on a portion of that. Certainly, we see enterprise customers that are a little bit more aggressive in terms of how they negotiate terms, payment terms. And candidly, that's an easy give for us to get into an account and get good margin business. So you are going to absolutely see some of that.\n And then I think in Q1, you always have a seasonal dynamic in terms of our DSOs. And so if you look back many years, it will spike in Q1 just because of seasonality. I think you're seeing both of those dynamics play out in Q1. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Katy Huberty from Morgan Stanley. \nKathryn Huberty: Two questions for me as well. How much contribution did you get from the large systems integrator deal that you talked about last quarter in April? And then what would you say is the right revenue run rate for the remainder of the year from that contract? \nDavid Hatfield: Katy, this is Hat. Yes, so the minimum commitment, as we articulated, was a couple year deal, and it continues to trend very, very well. Much like the large enterprise, it's not linear every quarter, so there was no net new contribution from that deal that we announced in this quarter, but we're thrilled with the progress. We're migrating currently dozens of the largest enterprise customers onto our platform via the managed services agreements with this partner that would take us a much longer period of time to get to on our own. So serving as a route to market and getting at some of the largest global customers I think is great. We also certified a number of joint offerings with that partner and are building pipeline against it. So it's definitely on track and continuing to accelerate, but it's not going to be a linear contribution each quarter. \nKathryn Huberty: And then Charlie, maybe a question for you. How are you thinking about opportunity to expand the TAM and maybe even move up the stack over time and whether that would be organic or inorganic investments? \nCharles Giancarlo: Well, Katy, it's going to be both. It'll be a bit of organic and a bit of inorganic. And I'll give you one example. What we discussed is our DirectFlash Fabric, what I just talked about on the -- on my prepared remarks of hyperscale infrastructure and hyperscale architecture. That is a new construct that allows stateless compute in a data center scale environment. That's something that we put together internally. I can tell you that there are a number of internal projects on that, and we do look external for some capabilities as well to be able to deliver whole stack compute in a hyperconverged for hyperscale environment. So that is an area that we are very focused on both internally and externally.\n In addition to that, though, as I mentioned, we're focused on a number of different areas. One is hybrid cloud, which is extremely important to us, and everything we're doing in that area, including ObjectEngine, Cloud Block Store, CloudSnap, et cetera. We've got a lot of activity there. The fast consolidated data, what we're doing with Splunk and Cisco, Arista and others to be able to create an environment where data can be consolidated, not so many copies with many applications accessing the same data at the same time. You know our work in AI and analytics, which is growing nicely. And then finally, the idea that companies don't want backup, they want restoration, and bringing restoration from hours to minutes is really resonating well with our customer base. So quite a few things in the pipeline. You'll hear about -- a lot more about them at the Accelerate conference in September, and I invite you all to come. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Rod Hall from Goldman Sachs. \nRoderick Hall: I just have 5. I'm actually kidding. So I wanted to just go back to the sales efficiency question and see if you guys could expand on that a little bit. It doesn't seem like the kind of thing that would crop up in a quarter and drive weakness. So I'm just trying to understand what the color around that is, what might have caused that to be one of the things you called out this particular quarter and why it sort of caught you by surprise. And then I also, I guess, would like to kind of understand a little bit better how things are going with FlashBlade on the AI front. Just any color you can give us on market dynamics there, what you're seeing in terms of demand? \nDavid Hatfield: This is Hat. Yes, so we definitely anticipated that we were going to have transition in the quarter. You know that I'm not a big fan of any big changes, and so we made incremental changes but didn't really change much under the hood. We just absorbed 40% more capacity. So the amount of change that happened in the quarter took more focus than in years past. And so I think that contributed to a series of deals that we had that pushed in the quarter, that any one of those that we would have closed would have made a big difference. So when you're dealing with deals that are multimillion, they elevate in the organization up to the CEO and to the CFO and things happen outside of your control, even though you've got a technical win, a budget, an executive sponsor and the rest of it.\n So from a Q1 perspective, there was more disruption [ than ] we typically had, and that absorption, I think, had an impact. The best news is that it's behind us, and we feel great about this quarter and the quarters ahead.\n On the FlashBlade front, we had a great FlashBlade quarter and continue to have momentum in that business. It's tied to AI, next-generation analytics use cases and rapid restore, the 2 primary use cases that are driving it, and we see continued progress there. \nMatt Kixmoeller: Real quick. This is Kix. If you look at Gartner and IDC data, AI continues to be 1 of the top 3 CIOs care-abouts. And so when you look at something that helps us get into net new enterprises, this is a huge entry vector for Pure. We also announced a -- an update to the AIRI architecture this quarter where we embraced DGX-2. That just helps us continue to grow to larger and larger sites.\n And then the final thing I'll say is that our thesis of AI not existing in a vacuum I think is playing out well, where people who do AI also do analytics at large scale. And so the power of FlashBlade is not only the power of the AI initiative but really to look at that whole data pipeline. And so we're seeing more and more of the analytics players [ willing ] to refactor for not only cloud but on-prem flash and using the S3 API. That's been a great area of growth for us. \nRoderick Hall: Any update on FlashBlade mix for the quarter? \nCharles Giancarlo: No, we've not been reporting on individual products now for some quarters. But FlashBlade really is doing quite well for us, and we're really pleased with it. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Steven Fox from Cross Research. \nSteven Fox: Just going back to the new cohort hirings. Can you talk -- maybe step back and talk a little bit about the strategy even by industry vertical, region that you're going after? And I guess within that strategy, is it clear to say that this was the plan all along? Or did just something change in terms of the opportunities that started to rise as you thought about the full fiscal year? And then as a quick follow-up, you mentioned public sales growing. I thought you said 30%. I just want to clarify that. And if there's any color around that, that would be helpful. \nDavid Hatfield: Yes. Steven, this is Hat. So no, no, no new strategy. This is exactly the strategy that we set out to go do. We wanted to add capacity and put the majority of that capacity in the most important accounts and opportunities upmarket. We have verticalized our public sector business at a national level in the U.S., and we've broken it out across EMEA as well. And we saw very nice progress on our public sector business and so as one industry vertical that we're starting to see really nice progress now consistently quarter in, quarter out for the production there.\n And then in the large enterprise, we're -- we've focused at a territorial level around industry solution groups, around financials, service providers and telcos, health care, et cetera. And so when you get to application-specific solutions by industry, it drives the portfolio motion as well. And so we're focused on 5 key industry verticals, and we're continuing to invest upmarket in the largest accounts across each of those verticals. So in line with what we planned on doing, I think the part that was a little bit different is just absorbing the amount of capacity in the quarter -- just took us more time than we anticipated. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Simon Leopold from Raymond James. \nSimon Leopold: I wanted to see if maybe you could build a gross margin bridge to us in terms of some of the dynamics affecting your gross margin outlook. You had good gross margin this quarter. We know memory prices are coming down, yet you're guiding to 65% to 68% from just over 68% this quarter. How much of it is competitiveness? How much is your customer mix? How much is expectations on costs? \nTimothy Riitters: Yes. Simon, this is Tim. In terms of the guide going forward, it's really kind of how we thought about guiding the business in the past. And if you watched this guidance from us, it's pretty consistent kind of over the last couple of years. What it really does is it gives us flexibility, right? So we have the flexibility to use gross margin at our disposal. Sometimes we run a little bit higher on gross margin, which is what you saw in this quarter, and that's allowed us to spend more in OpEx and hire more productive capacity. Other times, it may make sense to go and do some hyper discounted deals to sort of get into some really good and interesting footprints, right? So we just want to leave ourselves the room and the flexibility to manage the business over the course of the next couple of quarters as the year sort of plays out. And that's really been kind of standard operating procedure for the last couple of years as a public company. \nCharles Giancarlo: And just to be clear, we're not signaling any major change either in premium we get in the market or any costs that we see. Obviously, we expect the standard competition and the standard declining cost base. \nSimon Leopold: So just to be clear, it sounds like your answer is to say you're being conservative to give yourselves the opportunity to discount. But looking at the last 4 quarters, you've been in this 68% neighborhood. I'm not quite sure I'd see any reason why that would change. \nTimothy Riitters: I guess I would say it slightly different. We're giving ourselves flexibility to invest in the business as we see fit, whether that be through OpEx or using those points of margin to our advantage to sort of get into better deals. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Eric Martinuzzi from Lake Street. \nEric Martinuzzi: I had a question in particular about the AWS relationship. You talked about 3 things that you're evidencing the closeness of the relationship: the engineering, the sales alignment and then the global alignment. I think all 3 of those things could be said about each of your competitors. And I'm wondering if there's -- is there anything you can point to that maybe differentiates your relationship with the biggest player in cloud? \nMatt Kixmoeller: Yes. This is Kix. I'll take that one. So if you look at our cloud strategy, I think actually differentiation with respect to competition has gotten even more clearer over the last quarter or so. You've seen most of the major storage vendors go down a path where they're largely putting their arrays in cloud-connected data centers to kind of a pseudo-cloud service [ off deck ] connected to the hyperscalers. And while that's an expedient thing to do because they can just put their hardware in there, sometimes even just through a partner and kind of calling it their own service, it's not real cloud. And so I think as we've worked with the hyperscalers, they're quite excited about our initiative and our focus to basically take our software and optimize it to run natively on the cloud providers. And so as we said publicly, our first goal is absolutely to have a premium set of offerings on AWS, the market share leader, but our strategy is multicloud. And so as we [ shift AWS, ] we'll certainly move on. And we already have engineering efforts underway on more than AWS. \nEric Martinuzzi: And is that tighter relationship, are you seeing that evident in this large enterprise pipeline that you've discussed? \nDavid Hatfield: It's different -- definitely contributing to it. I mean customers and CIOs are interested in a hybrid cloud strategy and what we're doing. They love the fact that we're doing software-only and embedding us natively inside of their environment. And ultimately, the goal is to make the data movement in and out of on-prem or in a hosted environment or into public cloud very seamless not only technically but also commercially. And the expansion of what we talked about in my prepared remarks around our ES2 offering, including providing that flexibility, makes it commercially easy. So we really are an insurance policy to get them to the public cloud whenever they want commercially, and we think that customers are responding well to that. \nMatt Kixmoeller: Yes. I'd also just add that I think the technology approach we're taking is also a better go-to-market motion with the key cloud partners. When we sell our software in their cloud, the customer also has to buy the native services to run that software. And so it's a win-win for us and the cloud partner, really aligns the go-to-market motion. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Matt Cabral from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. \nMatthew Cabral: Just wanted to circle back to the downtick in guidance for the full year. Just want to make sure, are you guys seeing a change in pipeline or win rates or anything for the balance of the year versus how you were thinking about it 90 days ago? Or is this just about adding in more of an element of variability just given the unknowns around deal timing? \nTimothy Riitters: It's absolutely the latter, Matt, in terms of how we think about the business. \nMatthew Cabral: Got it. And then just thinking about Q1 specifically and some of the prices that we've seen in terms of NAND, is that having any impact on sort of customer behavior or decision delays as they sort of wait to see what happens in terms of underlying commodity costs? \nCharles Giancarlo: No, I'd say that's the first time -- your mentioning is the first time I ever heard that question. So no, I don't think so. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini from SIG. \nMehdi Hosseini: I'm going to go back to the sales productivity, and I realize the question has come up a couple of times, but I'm going to try to ask the same thing a different way. I see sales per employee down perhaps single digit and down -- on a year-over-year and down double digit on a Q-to-Q. Should we expect as we exit this fiscal year we will see a rebound in these metrics? Or is this more of a sometime next fiscal year? And I have a follow-up. \nTimothy Riitters: No, Mehdi. This is Tim. It definitely should start to climb. And as we've talked in the past, you've followed the story for a while now, it takes a while to ramp up productive capacity. And so you have the influx of people that Charlie and Hat talked about. It's going to take some time to ramp. So your aggregate sort of productivity measures will look like they're going down, but that's really just a maturation of the sales force versus anything else. So you're thinking about it exactly right. \nCharles Giancarlo: I'll just repeat, record number and record percentage of new sellers in the field, so yes. And obviously, they start at low productivity and then continue scaling up through a period of time. \nMehdi Hosseini: So we should see a rebound in the next 2, 3 quarters, correct? \nCharles Giancarlo: Yes. \nMehdi Hosseini: Okay. And then a follow-up, which is more of a big picture, you have -- you and your peers have been highlighting hybrid cloud infrastructure. Some of these arrays were installed 5, 8 years ago. There's also opportunity with a 10,000 RPM replacement. And in that context, when should I expect, a, replacement cycle kick in and when incremental opportunity from replacing 10,000 RPM to materialize? \nMatt Kixmoeller: Yes, so this is Kix. I think there's 2 dynamics that I can talk to in our business. First of all, just with our business, as you know, we run an evergreen cycle. And so we constantly have the opportunity to go back to existing customers and [ departments ], of which there are many now, and get them to upgrade to the latest thing and to do so in a very positive motion for both the customer and for Pure. And so that continues to be an important part of our business, especially as our installed base out there grows.\n If you look at the market at large though, I think the days of the 15,000 hard drive have been long gone. The 10,000 hard drive is not far behind it, and we feel like today we [ very ] economically compete with that. And I would say there's a particularly strong opportunity in the market right now, which is the midrange product refresh from our competitor Dell. They've gone out and publicly announced the next-generation product coming 6 to 12 months away. Meanwhile, 3 of their existing product lines essentially need to be converted to that. And so we think that's a huge opportunity to go out and bring people over to a [ completely ] better model. \nMehdi Hosseini: If I may, just a quick follow-up. Would it be fair to say that those opportunities have yet to come into your backlog, those are the kind of opportunities that could actually help you with considering -- continuing increasing deferred revenue and it would actually strengthen your enterprise mix of business in the coming quarters? \nMatt Kixmoeller: Well, look, I think it's fair to say that part of why we've been excited over time around the long-term trajectory of flash getting less and less expensive is every time flash gets a little bit less expensive, a new crop of hard drives out there come up for refresh that we can now economically go target. And so I think we remain very excited about the coming years where flash continues to drive standardization, and we're on the cusp of a transition around QLC coming over the next few years. And that just opens up even more of the market. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Nehal Chokshi from Maxim Group. \nNehal Chokshi: Appreciate the color on the -- adding over 100 enterprise customers net adds in the quarter and at now 40% of Fortune 500. But I'm still trying to wrap my head around exactly what percent of your sales force -- and I'd rather think about it in terms of mature sales force or at least percent of your sales force that has been around for 1 year -- is focused on enterprise opportunities. And perhaps -- and then versus 1 year ago. Could you try to help key that out for us? \nDavid Hatfield: Yes. So the numbers that we provided are 40% increase in capacity, right? So that's new. And the majority of that capacity is moving into the enterprise. So those investments take a little bit more time to mature. But what we love that we're seeing is an already larger number of deal sizes as a mix of the overall pipeline. So we're seeing some early results of that mix, but we haven't broken out the exact percentage of all of our sellers in terms of how they break out by segment. \nNehal Chokshi: And to make it clear, in the year ago period, the percent of new sales reps that came in was well below the majority -- the percent of new sales reps focused on enterprise opportunities was well below the majority. Is that correct, well below 50%? \nDavid Hatfield: Well, below what we're doing now. But we definitely ramped up efforts because we see the opportunity in the enterprise with the combination of our product portfolio expanding. Our routes to market now are getting us access into those at bats that I've been wanting for the last several years. And so we think it's prudent to make those investments. So the GSI win that we talked about last quarter, it's not just one. It's multiple GSIs, and they are proving to be quite productive in getting us access to accounts that we've been trying to get access to on our own for years and are now actually deploying and migrating data. So we see more of that. We're going to keep investing. \nNehal Chokshi: Okay. Great. And if I might, one for Tim. And I recognize that ES2 did -- where you expected, did not exceed and was not a factor in the underperformance. But for future reference, I think it would be helpful if you could take us through an example how an ES2 booking would differ from a FlashArray booking in terms of product revenue, service revenue, deferred revenue. \nTimothy Riitters: Yes. I'll give you a quick overview on that, Nehal, and then obviously we've talked about talking in more deep dive when we come up to our Analyst Day here later in the year. As we've typically said, for every $100 of a traditional CapEx deal, think kind of between 70% and 75% of those dollars get recognized immediately upon shipment and call it, the remaining 25% to 30% gets amortized over 3 years. Someone signing up for a 3-year TCV with us on the ES2 product, that will get amortized at 1/3, 1/3, 1/3 so obviously very different sort of rev rec dynamics in the business. \nNehal Chokshi: And does that all go to service revenue? \nTimothy Riitters: Yes, all roll up through support and subscription revenue. All in that line. Nothing in product. \nOperator: Your last question at this time comes from the line of George Iwanyc from Oppenheimer. \nGeorge Iwanyc: Touching on the sales and the hiring again. When you look at the rest of this year, how much hiring do you anticipate? And when we follow through to the following year, how much seasonality? Is it going to be the same pattern where you anticipate a very heavy upfront hiring pattern and possibly a repeat of the disruption? \nCharles Giancarlo: Yes. In the sales force, Q1 is our largest hiring period. It's not our only one, but the biggest hiring quarter for, I think, maybe obvious reasons, right? Sales guys that you're recruiting want to finish off their year wherever they are, tends to be in -- either at the end of calendar Q4, so in our Q4 or early in Q1. So that tends to be the majority of hires, but we do continue to hire through the year, especially to cover any attrition that we have but then a bit more.\n For the rest of the company, it's much more linear through the year. And if anything, we probably bring them in a little -- not in Q1 just because we know we're bringing in so much in the sales force in Q1. So Hat, do you want to... \nDavid Hatfield: I just think you would see it tapering off for the balance of the year. I think we had a particularly strong Q4 of hiring and a record Q1. And the combination of those 2 I think made the absorption levels higher than we have ever seen in the past. But it'll follow more of a seasonal route Q2 through the balance of the year and will taper off. \nGeorge Iwanyc: All right. And with all the new product expansion, can you give us a sense of ES2, Cloud Data Services, how much of a wildcard from a late year contribution standpoint they are? Or should we look at that more as a calendar year '20 getting more mature and becoming a bigger contributing factor? \nTimothy Riitters: Yes. George, this is Tim. I think it's too early to tell on those factors. Remember, those are going to be largely subscription businesses as well, so you probably aren't going to see as much on the revenue side. You'd see it more manifest itself in the continued build of the deferred revenue line item. \nOperator: And that was our last question. At this time, I will turn the call back over to Charlie Giancarlo for closing comments. \nCharles Giancarlo: Thank you. We're excited about the future of Pure. We're proud of our progress and the opportunities ahead of us in FY '20. I want to thank the entire Pure team and our global partners for their commitment to making Pure the industry leader. I also want to thank our customers for their business and their confidence in the solutions we provide. And thanks to all of you on this call for your time today. Goodbye. \nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Timothy Riitters",
            "content": "Thanks, Hat. Q1 was a solid beginning of the year for Pure as we continue to demonstrate growth at scale, industry-leading gross margins and continued innovation across our product portfolio. Before I dive into the specifics, I'll make my usual note that the gross margin, operating margin, OpEx, net income and free cash flow numbers I will use are non-GAAP unless otherwise noted. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP metrics to their GAAP comparables as well as our full Q1 results and presentation are available on our website at investor.purestorage.com.\n For the quarter, total revenue grew 28% year-on-year to $326.7 million. Product revenue grew 22% year-on-year to $238.7 million, and support revenue grew 45% year-on-year to $88 million. Geographically, 70% of sales came from the United States and 30% came from our international markets for the quarter.\n Our gross margins continue to be strong, remaining at the upper end of our long-term model range of between 63% and 68%. Total gross margins for the quarter were 68.1%, up 0.5 point sequentially. Our industry-leading gross margins continue to reflect the value we deliver to our customers through consistent differentiation, technological innovation and customer focus. Product gross margins were 68.7%, up 0.9 point sequentially due primarily to benefits we are seeing in component costs. Support gross margins were 66.3%, down 0.5 point sequentially. The sequential decrease in margins is due to continued investments in our professional services organization as we build support capabilities to serve our largest and most strategic customers.\n OpEx was $254 million for the quarter. As has been our pattern for the last several years, Q1 was an investment quarter, particularly in the hiring of our sales force, and this year was no different. As you heard from Charlie and Hat earlier, we are pleased with the significant additional sales capacity we've added in the last 6 months.\n Moving to operating margins. In Q1, operating profit was negative $31.2 million or negative 9.6% of revenue and compares to an operating profit of negative $15.3 million or negative 6% in the year ago quarter. Operating profit was less than expected due to our lower-than-expected top line performance. This revenue shortfall directly impacts our bottom line. While we were not satisfied with our profit performance this quarter given our revenue shortfall, we remain on track to drive profitability for the full year.\n Q1 net income for the quarter was negative $27.6 million or negative $0.11 per share. This compares to the year ago period of negative $16.2 million or negative $0.07 per share. The weighted average shares used for the per share calculations were 245 million shares in Q1 and 224 million shares for the year ago period.\n Moving on to the balance sheet and cash flow. We finished the quarter with cash and investments of $1.17 billion, a decrease of $31 million from the previous quarter. Our quarter-on-quarter decrease in cash was impacted by a $60 million cash payment as part of the Compuverde acquisition. Without this impact, we would have grown our cash balance for the seventh straight quarter in a row.\n We had another strong quarter of deferred revenue growth, which we believe is a key indicator of the success we are having in executing on our strategy and building long-term relationships with our customers. Deferred revenue at the end of the quarter was $564.3 million, an increase of 45% over the same period a year ago. The strong deferred revenue performance continues to be driven by 3 key trends: significant year-on-year renewals growth, longer initial service agreement purchases and the early momentum we are seeing with our ES2 product line.\n Free cash flow in Q1 was negative $17.7 million, which includes $22 million of impact related to our employee stock purchase plan. Adjusting for the normal impact of our employee stock purchase plan, free cash flow was positive $4.3 million in the quarter.\n Now I will turn to our guidance. As you heard us say earlier, we have put a significant amount of capacity into the business with an emphasis on our enterprise segment. Our focus on the enterprise has already yielded results, adding a significant number of large opportunities for our sales team to execute on.\n We're excited that larger deals are becoming a more important part of our overall business. At the same time, we would naturally expect a greater degree of fluctuation in any given quarter. As such, we are prudently incorporating these dynamics into our outlook.\n For the second quarter of fiscal 2020, we expect revenues in the range of between $389 million and $401 million, a $395 million midpoint or 28% year-over-year revenue growth; non-GAAP gross margin in the range of between 65% and 68%; and non-GAAP operating margin in the range of between negative 5% to negative 1% or negative 3% at the midpoint. For the full year of fiscal 2020, we now expect revenues of between $1.7 billion and $1.77 billion, a $1.735 billion midpoint or 27.5% year-over-year growth; non-GAAP gross margin in the range of between 65.5% and 68%; and non-GAAP operating margin in the range of between positive 1.5% and positive 5.5% or positive 3.5% at the midpoint.\n With that, I'll turn it back over to the operator for questions. Yes. So Alex, this is Tim. On ES2, ES2 is tracking very nicely to our expectations for the quarter. So that business is performing where we expected it. So not an explanation of the couple of points off of our overall performance. Well, on deferred revenue, I guess I would say we've known, as we've looked at the business for the last several quarters, that, that flywheel in our strategy is indeed working. So you're seeing very nice customer retention rates, and so very nice customer retention rates resulted in increasing deferred revenue balance. So that's obviously a positive trend.\n I think the other positive trend we're seeing there is that customers are taking and buying longer-term subscription contracts with us from the get-go, which basically speaks to us about making a longer term and a more pronounced commitment to Pure. And obviously, we like that. That builds the deferred revenue balance as well. So I think, again, we were expecting these types of performance, and we're very happy with where the deferred revenue balance landed this quarter. Yes, I'll take the first part of the question and I'll have Hat answer the second part of the question. On the COGS and bill of materials side, relatively small amount of our overall BOM is sourced out of China so therefore, very, very little impact to us on the cost side. Yes. So all of those deals absolutely are still active, Jason. So they slipped into the Q2 period. And I think, again, that's what we talked about in our prepared remarks, is that as you engage in these larger deals, they go sometimes on their own cycles. And so again, what we're happy about is we're absolutely continuing to be in the fight on these deals. No, I mean I guess -- and we typically don't talk about variability in the quarter, Jason. What I'll tell you is that sort of we had a good last half -- last part of the quarter, very strong part of the quarter end. Again, this is relative to our expectations. We're outside of guidance by a couple of million dollars. So again, it's not a big number. It's really -- we really look at the fact that the business continues to grow 28%. And doing that at scale in this environment, it's something we're particularly proud of. Well -- and Andrew, I'd say a couple of additional things as well. So first of all, you sort of quoted the $15 million to $20 million number, and again, we've never said $15 million to $20 million. Remember that a portion of that was ES2 -- a large portion of that was ES2, so that $15 million number is a bit high as you sort of think about how you sort of rolled your model from Q4 into Q1.\n I think more broadly, though, as well is that we talked about this at the beginning of the year. We talk about it again right now, which is new routes to market, new product innovations Kix just talked about coming out later this year combined with a very significant increase in overall productive capacity in the form of quota bearing heads. All of those things sort of bode well for our excitement about what really is and not that much, if any, reacceleration in the business after you sort of normalize some of these revenue patterns we just talked about. Well, I think you're absolutely right on a portion of that. Certainly, we see enterprise customers that are a little bit more aggressive in terms of how they negotiate terms, payment terms. And candidly, that's an easy give for us to get into an account and get good margin business. So you are going to absolutely see some of that.\n And then I think in Q1, you always have a seasonal dynamic in terms of our DSOs. And so if you look back many years, it will spike in Q1 just because of seasonality. I think you're seeing both of those dynamics play out in Q1. Yes. Simon, this is Tim. In terms of the guide going forward, it's really kind of how we thought about guiding the business in the past. And if you watched this guidance from us, it's pretty consistent kind of over the last couple of years. What it really does is it gives us flexibility, right? So we have the flexibility to use gross margin at our disposal. Sometimes we run a little bit higher on gross margin, which is what you saw in this quarter, and that's allowed us to spend more in OpEx and hire more productive capacity. Other times, it may make sense to go and do some hyper discounted deals to sort of get into some really good and interesting footprints, right? So we just want to leave ourselves the room and the flexibility to manage the business over the course of the next couple of quarters as the year sort of plays out. And that's really been kind of standard operating procedure for the last couple of years as a public company. I guess I would say it slightly different. We're giving ourselves flexibility to invest in the business as we see fit, whether that be through OpEx or using those points of margin to our advantage to sort of get into better deals. It's absolutely the latter, Matt, in terms of how we think about the business. No, Mehdi. This is Tim. It definitely should start to climb. And as we've talked in the past, you've followed the story for a while now, it takes a while to ramp up productive capacity. And so you have the influx of people that Charlie and Hat talked about. It's going to take some time to ramp. So your aggregate sort of productivity measures will look like they're going down, but that's really just a maturation of the sales force versus anything else. So you're thinking about it exactly right. Yes. I'll give you a quick overview on that, Nehal, and then obviously we've talked about talking in more deep dive when we come up to our Analyst Day here later in the year. As we've typically said, for every $100 of a traditional CapEx deal, think kind of between 70% and 75% of those dollars get recognized immediately upon shipment and call it, the remaining 25% to 30% gets amortized over 3 years. Someone signing up for a 3-year TCV with us on the ES2 product, that will get amortized at 1/3, 1/3, 1/3 so obviously very different sort of rev rec dynamics in the business. Yes, all roll up through support and subscription revenue. All in that line. Nothing in product. Yes. George, this is Tim. I think it's too early to tell on those factors. Remember, those are going to be largely subscription businesses as well, so you probably aren't going to see as much on the revenue side. You'd see it more manifest itself in the continued build of the deferred revenue line item."

            "content": "Thank you, Matt, and good afternoon, everyone. We appreciate you joining us on today's earnings call. I will begin by sharing our high-level results from the quarter. Hat will provide a go-to-market update; and finally, Tim will offer a detailed review of our financials.\n The fundamentals of our business are strong. We are broadening our customer base. We are delivering new innovation through both organic and inorganic investments, and we continue to delight our customers.\n For Q1, revenue was $327 million, growing 28% year-over-year. While we are growing well above the industry average, we were not satisfied with our results this quarter. Gross margin remained strong at 68.1% and operating margin was negative 9.6%. Revenue was just below the low end of our guidance, and consequently, profitability was below our guidance.\n As you know, a particular area of focus has been to increase our at bats and expand our engagement with large enterprise customers. To that end, we have hired aggressively, adding nearly 40% more capacity to our sales force this last year. With this additional investment, we are seeing a significant increase in the number of large enterprise opportunities.\n We are aggressively going after legacy storage vendors. We are consistently beating them in the commercial market, and now we are increasingly going after them in the largest enterprise environments. We are excited about these opportunities as we continue to expand both our product portfolio and our enterprise business model. The shape of our business is changing for the good, but it will have more variability. Thus, we believe it prudent to modestly adjust our revenue guide for the year to 27.5% annual growth.\n We continue to position Pure ahead of the relevant trends that are top priorities for CIOs: hybrid cloud, fast consolidated data architectures, AI and analytics, and rapid recovery from failure. I want to share some highlights on our work in these areas this past quarter.\n Pure is leading the industry with DirectFlash Fabric on FlashArray, a hyperscale architecture enabling large-scale stateless compute. Hyperscale architecture leverages Pure shared storage with direct attached performance for modern, efficient application environments.\n ObjectEngine, which became generally available in Q1, is resonating with customers, delivering on our vision that customers need rapid restoration of critical data and applications rather than just backup. Customers can now recover data in minutes versus hours or days by using ObjectEngine with FlashBlade on-prem. And by using AWS S3, ObjectEngine becomes a cost-effective archive destination for long-term data retention, enabling additional uses of data in the cloud.\n ObjectEngine is just one part of our comprehensive suite of Cloud Data Services. We are enabling our core FlashArray software, Purity, to run natively in the public cloud. Cloud Block Store, which delivers enterprise-grade storage on the public cloud, is now many months into beta use with great customer feedback.\n Lastly, this quarter, we acquired Compuverde, a leading developer of file software solutions for enterprises and cloud providers. Their highly scalable software will accelerate our road map to provide a unified file and block offering, opening new markets for Pure and expanding our file capabilities for Pure customers.\n We remain excited about the opportunities in front of us. We have a $50 billion total addressable market in multiple product segments that are essential to powering modern digital businesses. We continue to delight our customers, expanding in accounts once we are established. We continue to take market share in our industry and are extending our enterprise sales motion. And we have a strong pipeline of new and innovative products to enable continued growth of our business. We are confident in the investments we are making.\n With that, I'll turn it over to Hat. Yes, Alex. I would -- Alex, I'd add, though, that in the net new logos in the large enterprise, they'll go to almost any length to keep us out. And so our -- the early entry into the enterprise is something that we're putting a special attention on. Right. So on the ops question, no, ops performed flawlessly that -- this quarter, so I think that's largely behind us now. And then let me just start on the productivity question. We do think we have a very good factory for new sales reps that -- and new SEs that come in. So we've got a pretty good factory. But really not only did we have a record number, but we had a record percentage add this Q1 over the last 6 months. And so that always takes a lot of work and effort as Hat put in, and it's something that we're going to pay a lot of attention to over the next quarter or 2. Yes. Hat, you want to start? Right. On the portfolio, it had been something along the lines of 30%, although I'm not -- is that correct, Kix? FlashBlade and FlashArray customers -- or 30% of FlashBlade customers are FlashArray customers. Yes. Obviously, last year this time, there was a bit of tailwind in the -- in this market, overall growing or growing fairly well or better than it had been in several years. I would say, today, there's no tail -- we don't perceive a tailwind, but we don't see a lot of headwind either from an overall macro standpoint. We think our challenges are our challenges, and we're still a relatively small player in a huge market. So it's really up to us to capture more of that share. Right. Well, that's a perspective for the future. But in general, at this kind of gross margins that we're operating with, we've got a lot of leverage in the business. And so -- and I've been clear that if investments don't yield the kind of results we expect on the top line in terms of growth that we will bring spending in line with that. So that's for the future right now. Right now we believe we're making the right investments, and it's going to yield the kind of growth that we've seen historically. And so we feel very strongly about the investments that we're making currently. We have -- as you might imagine and if you look at it, we are bring spending down more in line with our growth. But at this point, we feel confident about the investments we're currently making. Right. Well, as we've stated last quarter, I mean every quarter is a new quarter for sales operations. So you start from 0. And we had incorporated in the Q4 results obviously into our Q1 at the time. So as we look -- what we have done is we've taken the same kind of map that we do for guide and in this case, looked at the percentage of large deals in the pipeline and adjusted for the greater variability of those large deals. And all of that gave us confidence in this new guide. Obviously, we are where we are today. We don't want to be in the same position later in the year, which was the primary reason for adjusting the guide. Well, Katy, it's going to be both. It'll be a bit of organic and a bit of inorganic. And I'll give you one example. What we discussed is our DirectFlash Fabric, what I just talked about on the -- on my prepared remarks of hyperscale infrastructure and hyperscale architecture. That is a new construct that allows stateless compute in a data center scale environment. That's something that we put together internally. I can tell you that there are a number of internal projects on that, and we do look external for some capabilities as well to be able to deliver whole stack compute in a hyperconverged for hyperscale environment. So that is an area that we are very focused on both internally and externally.\n In addition to that, though, as I mentioned, we're focused on a number of different areas. One is hybrid cloud, which is extremely important to us, and everything we're doing in that area, including ObjectEngine, Cloud Block Store, CloudSnap, et cetera. We've got a lot of activity there. The fast consolidated data, what we're doing with Splunk and Cisco, Arista and others to be able to create an environment where data can be consolidated, not so many copies with many applications accessing the same data at the same time. You know our work in AI and analytics, which is growing nicely. And then finally, the idea that companies don't want backup, they want restoration, and bringing restoration from hours to minutes is really resonating well with our customer base. So quite a few things in the pipeline. You'll hear about -- a lot more about them at the Accelerate conference in September, and I invite you all to come. No, we've not been reporting on individual products now for some quarters. But FlashBlade really is doing quite well for us, and we're really pleased with it. And just to be clear, we're not signaling any major change either in premium we get in the market or any costs that we see. Obviously, we expect the standard competition and the standard declining cost base. No, I'd say that's the first time -- your mentioning is the first time I ever heard that question. So no, I don't think so. I'll just repeat, record number and record percentage of new sellers in the field, so yes. And obviously, they start at low productivity and then continue scaling up through a period of time. Yes. Yes. In the sales force, Q1 is our largest hiring period. It's not our only one, but the biggest hiring quarter for, I think, maybe obvious reasons, right? Sales guys that you're recruiting want to finish off their year wherever they are, tends to be in -- either at the end of calendar Q4, so in our Q4 or early in Q1. So that tends to be the majority of hires, but we do continue to hire through the year, especially to cover any attrition that we have but then a bit more.\n For the rest of the company, it's much more linear through the year. And if anything, we probably bring them in a little -- not in Q1 just because we know we're bringing in so much in the sales force in Q1. So Hat, do you want to... Thank you. We're excited about the future of Pure. We're proud of our progress and the opportunities ahead of us in FY '20. I want to thank the entire Pure team and our global partners for their commitment to making Pure the industry leader. I also want to thank our customers for their business and their confidence in the solutions we provide. And thanks to all of you on this call for your time today. Goodbye."

            "content": "Thanks, Charlie. Pure's strategy remains clear: to deliver the technology, the customer experience and business model that enterprises want, setting the company completely apart from the industry. Our investments in and focus on the enterprise, largest cloud and service providers and governments globally is working, but it is changing the shape of our business and this impacted our Q1 results.\n First, we added over 40% new sales capacity in the past year, including nearly 30% in the past 6 months alone. This, together with typical account transitions that occur at the beginning of the fiscal year, took more focus than expected. Second, the mix of large enterprise deals increased by 2x more than it has been historically, reflecting solid progress as we move upmarket. However, these transactions tend to take longer to close and have more variability.\n As we enter Q2, the account transitions are behind us. The series of large deals we had in Q1 are still active, and the changing shape of the business is reflected in our guidance for the year. The underlying metrics of repeat purchases, customer retention, partner leverage and win rates are all continuing to perform nicely.\n The core of our business, cloud, commercial and public sector, is strong, growing over 30% year-over-year. We finished the quarter with approximately 6,200 total customers, greater than 350 new customers in Q1, equating to more than 5 new customer additions per day. In addition, we are pleased with our growth in international markets, contributing to 30% of revenue in the quarter.\n Shifting to our portfolio. We continue to be excited with the speed of innovation supporting Pure's 4 growth areas: hybrid cloud, fast consolidated data architectures, AI/analytics, and rapid restore. These capabilities expand our TAM while also increasing the relevance with senior executives and new buying centers.\n Pure's cloud strategy is resonating, and in particular, Cloud Block Store beta customers, including Mid-America Labs, have seen early success with key use cases such as disaster recovery and application migration. This quarter, we also announced the expansion of our Evergreen Storage Service, ES2, providing customers with a unified subscription model across hybrid environments. Enterprises can now use Pure's storage-as-a-service model on-premises, hosted and in the cloud without the need to manage multiple subscriptions or purchase separate overlapping capacity.\n Next, we see continued progress with AI initiatives, and Pure is paving the way with solutions from early inception to large-scale production. This quarter, customers across several industries, including Geisinger Health, have chosen the AIRI converge platform from Pure, NVIDIA and Cisco as the backbone of their AI deployments to gain better insight into their data.\n And finally, this quarter, U.K. Ministry of Defense and the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center have both chosen FlashBlade, signaling the excitement around our flash-to-flash-to-cloud architecture and rapid restore use case. This is yet another proof point for Pure beginning to disrupt the roughly $8 billion data protection market.\n Shifting to our go-to-market momentum. Pure's partner ecosystem continues to broaden and deliver real impact to the business. We saw another good quarter from national partners with solid year-over-year growth and increased net new logo contribution. Strategic alliance partnerships were also a bright spot in Q1, particularly with next-generation analytics use cases like Spark, Elastic and Splunk. And perhaps most exciting, as we execute on our cloud strategy, our relationship with AWS is advancing through further joint engineering development, sales enablement and global alignment.\n We also continue to see success driving large enterprise and government businesses through global systems integrators with a combination of sell to activities, migrating dozens of the largest global enterprises onto Pure as part of their managed services and sell with motions, building new pipeline [ in advance ] from our joint offerings.\n In summary, we are as excited as ever with the added sales capacity, continued rate of innovation and expanding partner ecosystem. We continue to execute on our long-term vision, are making great progress with large enterprises, and we are growing 3x faster than our competitors, taking share in the overall storage market. We truly are just getting started.\n With that, I will now turn it over to Tim. Tim? And Alex, this is Hat. On the competitive landscape, I wouldn't say anything's materially different in the quarter than what we've seen historically. As you know, we focus on value, not price. And so when we get our TCO argument in place and people understand our technology and our differentiated business model and customer experience, our win rates are holding great against them. Yes. So a, when we talk about enterprise deals, we're talking about multi-million-dollar large deals, so the shape of those is expanding and really nice lead 2x over a year ago period. And then as a percent of the overall, we haven't broken everything out from a revenue mix perspective, but we did talk about we're now 40% of the Fortune 500, so we're incrementally adding there and added over 100 enterprise customers in the quarter as well. So not only the quantity of new customer adds were great, but the quality were nice as well. There are 2 different issues. We're obviously working within our installed base, and so the average deals [ suits ] are growing and the mix of the larger deals as a percentage of the overall pipeline is higher, 2x higher than we've seen historically. So we like that shape. Obviously, there's more variability in those deals and takes sometimes longer for those to close. But we like the strategic nature in which we're competing for the larger transactions. And a separate topic, from an enterprise perspective, a combination of the Fortune 500 now at 40% and 100 new -- net new enterprise customer adds in the quarter are 2 good proof points in terms of the progress upmarket. Yes. Similar on the sales cycle. Directly related to that, we had a nice contribution, 30% of our revenue coming from our international markets. So those businesses are firing nicely. Yes. And I just... Sorry, Jason. Yes, I mean I think we did anticipate sort of every year you've got -- you have transition of accounts and new capacity, et cetera. I think the added capacity at the scale that we did it, kind of order 40%, created more transition from a territory management perspective than we have done historically. And so the good news is that's behind us. And I think on the larger deals, we love the size of deals we're competing for and the relevance that we're having in the large enterprise. And so the shape changes, but it changes for the better. And I think we factored that in -- variability in for the balance of the year. Katy, this is Hat. Yes, so the minimum commitment, as we articulated, was a couple year deal, and it continues to trend very, very well. Much like the large enterprise, it's not linear every quarter, so there was no net new contribution from that deal that we announced in this quarter, but we're thrilled with the progress. We're migrating currently dozens of the largest enterprise customers onto our platform via the managed services agreements with this partner that would take us a much longer period of time to get to on our own. So serving as a route to market and getting at some of the largest global customers I think is great. We also certified a number of joint offerings with that partner and are building pipeline against it. So it's definitely on track and continuing to accelerate, but it's not going to be a linear contribution each quarter. This is Hat. Yes, so we definitely anticipated that we were going to have transition in the quarter. You know that I'm not a big fan of any big changes, and so we made incremental changes but didn't really change much under the hood. We just absorbed 40% more capacity. So the amount of change that happened in the quarter took more focus than in years past. And so I think that contributed to a series of deals that we had that pushed in the quarter, that any one of those that we would have closed would have made a big difference. So when you're dealing with deals that are multimillion, they elevate in the organization up to the CEO and to the CFO and things happen outside of your control, even though you've got a technical win, a budget, an executive sponsor and the rest of it.\n So from a Q1 perspective, there was more disruption [ than ] we typically had, and that absorption, I think, had an impact. The best news is that it's behind us, and we feel great about this quarter and the quarters ahead.\n On the FlashBlade front, we had a great FlashBlade quarter and continue to have momentum in that business. It's tied to AI, next-generation analytics use cases and rapid restore, the 2 primary use cases that are driving it, and we see continued progress there. Yes. Steven, this is Hat. So no, no, no new strategy. This is exactly the strategy that we set out to go do. We wanted to add capacity and put the majority of that capacity in the most important accounts and opportunities upmarket. We have verticalized our public sector business at a national level in the U.S., and we've broken it out across EMEA as well. And we saw very nice progress on our public sector business and so as one industry vertical that we're starting to see really nice progress now consistently quarter in, quarter out for the production there.\n And then in the large enterprise, we're -- we've focused at a territorial level around industry solution groups, around financials, service providers and telcos, health care, et cetera. And so when you get to application-specific solutions by industry, it drives the portfolio motion as well. And so we're focused on 5 key industry verticals, and we're continuing to invest upmarket in the largest accounts across each of those verticals. So in line with what we planned on doing, I think the part that was a little bit different is just absorbing the amount of capacity in the quarter -- just took us more time than we anticipated. It's different -- definitely contributing to it. I mean customers and CIOs are interested in a hybrid cloud strategy and what we're doing. They love the fact that we're doing software-only and embedding us natively inside of their environment. And ultimately, the goal is to make the data movement in and out of on-prem or in a hosted environment or into public cloud very seamless not only technically but also commercially. And the expansion of what we talked about in my prepared remarks around our ES2 offering, including providing that flexibility, makes it commercially easy. So we really are an insurance policy to get them to the public cloud whenever they want commercially, and we think that customers are responding well to that. Yes. So the numbers that we provided are 40% increase in capacity, right? So that's new. And the majority of that capacity is moving into the enterprise. So those investments take a little bit more time to mature. But what we love that we're seeing is an already larger number of deal sizes as a mix of the overall pipeline. So we're seeing some early results of that mix, but we haven't broken out the exact percentage of all of our sellers in terms of how they break out by segment. Well, below what we're doing now. But we definitely ramped up efforts because we see the opportunity in the enterprise with the combination of our product portfolio expanding. Our routes to market now are getting us access into those at bats that I've been wanting for the last several years. And so we think it's prudent to make those investments. So the GSI win that we talked about last quarter, it's not just one. It's multiple GSIs, and they are proving to be quite productive in getting us access to accounts that we've been trying to get access to on our own for years and are now actually deploying and migrating data. So we see more of that. We're going to keep investing. I just think you would see it tapering off for the balance of the year. I think we had a particularly strong Q4 of hiring and a record Q1. And the combination of those 2 I think made the absorption levels higher than we have ever seen in the past. But it'll follow more of a seasonal route Q2 through the balance of the year and will taper off."

        "speaker4": {
            "name": "Matt Kixmoeller",
            "content": "I don't know the number off hand, but we are absolutely seeing bundling working. And I think that was one of our key investment areas, was the belief that not only can we get synergy between FlashArray and FlashBlade, but as we start to tie in rapid recovery and use cases to really drive closer synergies between them, we're just seeing that bundling take off. This is Kix. I'll take that one. So yes, we're tracking well, first off, with Block Store as well as our ObjectEngine cloud product. Both are on track for GA in the second half of the year. And more broadly beyond that, the Compuverde acquisition was an acquisition for really bringing the software-defined file capability in the company. Our first approach with that is really going to be to leverage it as part of the FlashArray product line. If you look at the unified space within the block world, there is a number of customers who buy just a few arrays and really expect both file and -- file protocol and block protocol out of those arrays. And so our first integration with Compuverde will be to help deliver unified capabilities for FlashArray, and we really think that sets us up well to go after the entirety of the file market. We're already doing really well at the high end with FlashBlade going after next-gen use cases, going after really high-performance use cases. This will allow us to feather in the more scalable kind of lower part of the file market to really be able to have a solution and the right solution for every part of the market. Real quick. This is Kix. If you look at Gartner and IDC data, AI continues to be 1 of the top 3 CIOs care-abouts. And so when you look at something that helps us get into net new enterprises, this is a huge entry vector for Pure. We also announced a -- an update to the AIRI architecture this quarter where we embraced DGX-2. That just helps us continue to grow to larger and larger sites.\n And then the final thing I'll say is that our thesis of AI not existing in a vacuum I think is playing out well, where people who do AI also do analytics at large scale. And so the power of FlashBlade is not only the power of the AI initiative but really to look at that whole data pipeline. And so we're seeing more and more of the analytics players [ willing ] to refactor for not only cloud but on-prem flash and using the S3 API. That's been a great area of growth for us. Yes. This is Kix. I'll take that one. So if you look at our cloud strategy, I think actually differentiation with respect to competition has gotten even more clearer over the last quarter or so. You've seen most of the major storage vendors go down a path where they're largely putting their arrays in cloud-connected data centers to kind of a pseudo-cloud service [ off deck ] connected to the hyperscalers. And while that's an expedient thing to do because they can just put their hardware in there, sometimes even just through a partner and kind of calling it their own service, it's not real cloud. And so I think as we've worked with the hyperscalers, they're quite excited about our initiative and our focus to basically take our software and optimize it to run natively on the cloud providers. And so as we said publicly, our first goal is absolutely to have a premium set of offerings on AWS, the market share leader, but our strategy is multicloud. And so as we [ shift AWS, ] we'll certainly move on. And we already have engineering efforts underway on more than AWS. Yes. I'd also just add that I think the technology approach we're taking is also a better go-to-market motion with the key cloud partners. When we sell our software in their cloud, the customer also has to buy the native services to run that software. And so it's a win-win for us and the cloud partner, really aligns the go-to-market motion. Yes, so this is Kix. I think there's 2 dynamics that I can talk to in our business. First of all, just with our business, as you know, we run an evergreen cycle. And so we constantly have the opportunity to go back to existing customers and [ departments ], of which there are many now, and get them to upgrade to the latest thing and to do so in a very positive motion for both the customer and for Pure. And so that continues to be an important part of our business, especially as our installed base out there grows.\n If you look at the market at large though, I think the days of the 15,000 hard drive have been long gone. The 10,000 hard drive is not far behind it, and we feel like today we [ very ] economically compete with that. And I would say there's a particularly strong opportunity in the market right now, which is the midrange product refresh from our competitor Dell. They've gone out and publicly announced the next-generation product coming 6 to 12 months away. Meanwhile, 3 of their existing product lines essentially need to be converted to that. And so we think that's a huge opportunity to go out and bring people over to a [ completely ] better model. Well, look, I think it's fair to say that part of why we've been excited over time around the long-term trajectory of flash getting less and less expensive is every time flash gets a little bit less expensive, a new crop of hard drives out there come up for refresh that we can now economically go target. And so I think we remain very excited about the coming years where flash continues to drive standardization, and we're on the cusp of a transition around QLC coming over the next few years. And that just opens up even more of the market."

With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to our CEO, Charlie Giancarlo.\nCharlie Giancarlo: Hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us on our Q4 earnings call today. I hope that each of you, your loved ones, and colleagues are all safe and healthy. Pure ended fiscal 2021 with great strength and growth, setting revenue and sales records for the quarter and for the full fiscal year. Our portfolio has never been stronger, with record sales in our Pure-as-a-service offering, FlashBlade, FlashArray//C, and Portworx. The completeness of our product suite accelerated sales growth in our enterprise and cloud segments in each and every theater and in our major verticals. Our Q4 results are confirmation of the strength of our long-term strategy and a leading indicator of our opportunity to accelerate growth. I am pleased to share with you today these Q4 successes. Our long-term strategy is to deliver a modern data experience to customers. It was gratifying that so many of our existing customers chose to significantly deepen the relationship with Pure as we've become an ever more critical component in their own plans for digital transformation. We also saw net new customer acquisition growth over last quarter and continued strength in enterprise. In Q4, we booked eight, eight-figure deals with eight large enterprise customers, a new record. It was just two years ago that we began significant investments in our enterprise go-to-market team. Our strength in that segment this past year is proof point of the successful execution of that strategy. Our ongoing commitment to marrying technological innovation with our customer-centric business model is increasingly recognized by customers and the industry. With seven years ranked as a leader, Gartner's recognition this year of Pure\u2019s clear leadership across both ability to execute and vision in their Magic Quadrant for Primary Storage Arrays is a great validation of our strategy. And we also improved our already leading excellence in customer experience as measured through our net promoter score. For calendar 2020, Pure\u2019s third-party certified NPS was 83.5%, our sixth year in a leadership position and the highest score among vendors measured by Medallia. One of the most important components of our growth strategy is, of course, Pure\u2019s leadership team. This quarter, we welcomed Ajay Singh, our new Chief Product Officer. As CPO, Ajay will be responsible for our five business units and our technology alliances and will be a key contributor to our strategy to deliver modern data services. He brings to Pure extensive expertise in software and services to accelerate our growth into our as-a-service model and cloud-native support. Our growth in Q4 is proof that our ability to deliver a modern data experience is resonating with our customers. They see the benefits of advanced technology from a trusted storage leader that supports a wide range of structured and unstructured data at scale and across any workload, but the Pure value proposition goes well beyond this. The Pure vision is to deliver real-time access to resilient hybrid cloud managed storage services via code to developers and operations managers. Customers desire of managed data services that are dynamic and provide a cloud experience with flexible on-demand consumption. Needless to say, we continue to dramatically outpace our industry in both innovation and customer delight, and I'm excited to share four reasons why customers continue to lead with Pure. First, Pure delivers the simplest storage platform to operate. We continue to innovate with what customers appreciate namely seamless upgrades, cloud management, pay-as-you-go consumption models, and both traditional and cloud native data services. This strategy is resonating with customers as validated in a Wikibon analyst report for cloud spending and adoption. Their survey showed that Pure leads both hyperscalers and on-premise legacy vendors in customer spending intent with an off-the-chart net score of 63%. Second, we continue to see strong customer adoption of our subscription services which include our Evergreen and Pure as-a-Service offerings. Only Pure delivers a true enterprise class utility with flexible storage consumption, a cloud experience on-premise, an easy path to move data to the cloud at any time, and aligns spend with actual consumption. This year we've continued to advance our subscription services platform reducing complexity by eliminating additional licenses and support costs and introducing a service catalog with transparent pricing. This quarter, our subscription services grew over 30% from one year ago. New Customers for our Pure as-a-Service offering included one customer over $10 million, as well as US customer Cloud@Work, MACA Mining Services in Australia, and German telecom provider, Broadcom [ph]. And we saw customer adoption increase across every major area of the world. Given the significant customer benefits with our subscription services, we have created enhancements to our field compensation for these offers going forward. Third, last quarter, we expanded our industry-leading data services capabilities for containerized cloud-native applications with the acquisition of Portworx. Cloud-native databases, analytics applications, and AI frameworks such as Cassandra, MongoDB, Postgres, Kafka, Elasticsearch, SPARC, and TensorFlow are the tools upon which customers build their modern data pipelines. Pure has been successfully serving these applications at the highest performance levels with FlashBlade. And now, Portworx helps us expand support for these applications on any infrastructure, on-prem or in-cloud, at any scale. We saw significant growth of in-cloud deployments of Portworx this quarter, with particular growth through our IBM partnership given our best-in-class support for Red Hat OpenShift, an IBM cloud pack for data. The integration of Portworx into Pure has been one of the best that I have ever experienced, and we are just beginning to leverage Pure\u2019s go-to-market engine to drive Portworx. And earlier this month, we expanded our market leadership with major software updates to our flagship Purity software on both FlashBlade and FlashArray to deliver enhanced performance, comprehensive ransomware protection and security. And we broadened file capabilities to serve more markets and use cases. Best of all, we enabled customers to adopt these new innovations without disruption, downtime, additional costs, or the requirement to rebuy new capacity. Sustainability is my fourth and final point. From our founding, Pure has focused on how our products can use less energy, require less cooling, needs less maintenance, and take up less space in the data centers and to produce less waste. In the last eight years, we estimate that Pure\u2019s FlashArray offering alone has saved over 4 billion kilowatt hours in energy use, avoiding the greenhouse gas emissions equivalent to over 7 billion miles of automobile travel. It's eliminated 96% of data center Rackspace when compared to legacy solutions which is approximately 19,000 racks or over 10,000 tons of legacy gear not deployed. With Evergreen upgrades, customers continuously upgrade rather than discard their older storage equipment, avoiding the rip-and-replace required by legacy vendors and reducing waste in landfills. Pure\u2019s industry-leading storage density allows customers to save on data center space and power when compared to other flash storage vendors. Now, with FlashArray//C, customers can fit 1 petabyte of effective storage into roughly one rack unit, the size of a pizza box. Paying for only what one consumes is the right model for customer\u2019s bottom line, and right-sizing energy use and physical infrastructure ensures that customers don't pay to cool and power excess equipment. I'm very pleased with both the internal investments we've made over the past fiscal year and our focus on operational discipline. We made a commitment early in the COVID-19 pandemic that we would continue to make strategic investments in global talent focusing on innovation including our acquisition of Portworx, customer support, and scaling the company. We dramatically reduced travel, entertainment, and other operating expenses while increasing our investments in talent and critical growth initiatives in anticipation of increasing growth this year while continuing to deliver operating income and generating positive operating cash flows. Our employees and our charitable foundation, Pure Good, also stepped up investments focused on COVID-19 response, food and housing in our local communities, and in our Workforce Development Initiative. Continuing our thoughtful approach to operating in this new normal, we recently announced to the company that we plan to use a hybrid approach when we return to the office with most employees able to work from home part-time. We believe that the hybrid office model will deliver the best combination of individual and team productivity and allow us to continue to attract and retain the best employees in the industry. I have never felt more fortunate to be at Pure. Our dedicated Puritans, our loyal customers, and our partners and suppliers all displayed incredible perseverance, creativity, and positivity during the past 12 months despite the personal challenges they each faced. The effect of the COVID economy on Pure\u2019s business has largely played out as we predicted over this past year. First, a short acceleration of business as customers shifted to work-at-home and online business, then a sharp pullback as they took stock both of their business prospects and new plans for digital transformation, followed by a gradual stabilization based on the new normal. Now, we look forward to return to a more significant economic growth as we expect the effects of COVID will begin to diminish during our fiscal Q2. I have increasing confidence that this year will be far better than last. On a macro front, I'm hopeful about the promise of increasingly plentiful and effective vaccines being distributed throughout the world. I believe that in this fiscal year, our customers will accelerate their investment in digital transformation with renewed confidence of economic recovery. They will be increasingly confident in their ability to deploy new vendors, new systems, and software into new use cases. And Pure will be high on their list. Thank you. And now, I will turn the meeting over to Kevan for details on our financials.\nKevan Krysler: Thank you, Charlie, and good afternoon. We are very pleased with the strength of our Q4 performance which was much stronger than we planned. FlashBlade and FlashArray//C, both achieved consecutive record sales. And we continue to see strong demand with our enterprise customers who recognize the value that we are delivering. We completed a record number of deals above $10 million and also achieved record sales during the quarter to our Fortune 500 customers. Sales of our subscription services continue to be strong consistent with what we have been seeing throughout the year, including one of our top deals above $10 million being Pure as-a-Service. Our sales growth excluding cancellable orders was slightly over 9% in Q4 compared to last year driven by strength both in the US and international markets. We're also very pleased with new customer acquisitions during the quarter as 471 new customers chose one or more of our solutions. Now, turning to specific Q4 financial results. Total revenue of approximately $503 million exceeded our expectations growing 2% year-over-year. Despite the strong comparators, Q5 last year was not impacted by COVID headwinds. Subscription services revenue grew approximately 32% year-over-year and represents approximately 30% of total revenue. As a reminder, subscription services revenue includes Evergreen subscriptions, the unified Pure as-a-Service subscription which includes Cloud Block Store. Total revenue, both in the United States and international saw slight growth compared to a strong Q4 last year. Our remaining performance obligations or RPO which includes our committed and non-cancellable future revenue grew approximately 24% year-over-year. Non-GAAP total gross margins in Q4 was 69.4%, up 30 basis points sequentially compared to 72.1% last year. Product gross margins were 69.1% compared to 73.3% last year. As you might recall, last year's product gross margin benefited from unprecedented pricing dynamics of NAND. Subscription services gross margins were strong at 70.2% compared to 68.1% last year. Non-GAAP operating profit during the quarter was approximately $36.7 million compared to $60.9 million last year. We were pleased that as we were navigating COVID-related headwinds, we continue to invest in the business while only slightly increasing overall operating expenses. Operating income for the year was $46 million as operating expenses for the year grew less than 3%. Non-GAAP net income during Q4 was $38.8 million and non-GAAP net income per share was $0.13. Weighted average shares used for the Q4 non-GAAP net earnings per share calculation was approximately 297 million shares. We ended the quarter with over $1.25 billion in cash and approximately 3,800 employees. Cash flow from operations was $69 million and free cash flows was $48 million in the quarter. During Q4, we repurchased a little over 1 million shares for approximately $23.6 million, completing our $150 million planned purchase program. We have also announced a new share repurchase program of up to $200 million. Now turning to guidance where we will provide some color on how we're thinking about this year as well as Q1. We do not plan on updating our annual view as we progress throughout the year. For FY 2022, we expect that total revenue growth will be in the range of 14% to 15% during a continued growth of our subscription service offerings that will be a significant contributor to our overall performance. Capitalizing on the investments we made an FY 2021, we expect to grow operating income to near $90 million. Now, moving to our Q1 outlook. As visibility continues to improve and with the strength of our enterprise business and momentum of our technology platform, we are forecasting revenue will be $405 million, growing approximately 10% from last year. Consistent with our Q1 seasonality, we are forecasting an operating loss of $20 million for the quarter. And expect to generate positive operating income in the remainder of the year. In conclusion, we are pleased to end the year on a high note as our Q4 performance surpassed our expectations in the midst of continued COVD headwinds. We have confidence in our investments innovation that we believe will drive accelerated revenue growth and continued high levels of customer satisfaction while increasing share value. We are excited to build on our momentum this year, capitalizing on the tremendous opportunities that we have in front of us. We expect COVID headwinds to lessen during our second quarter. With that, I will turn it over to the operator, so we can get to your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Aaron Rakers of Wells Fargo. You may now ask your question.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi. This is Jake [ph] on for Aaron. First of all, congrats on a great quarter. I was wondering if you could start out by talking a little bit about deferred revenue growth and reminding me what sits outside of deferred and RPO?\nCharlie Giancarlo: Let me just start because I'd like to just start the overall conversation with the fact that we really did see an excellent quarter across the board, and given the strength that we've had in subscription revenues that we commented upon as you might expect, we're seeing good growth and even greater growth in deferred than we see in actual revenues which bodes well for the future, gives us additional confidence overall going forward. Kevan?\nKevan Krysler: Yeah, Jake, let me just add on in terms of, obviously RPO or remaining performance obligations, when you're seeing growth sequentially is really being driven by the momentum we're seeing in our subscription services principally around Pure as-a-Service and the unified subscription with CBS. We're seeing some strength as well on deferred revenue, and that's really in part due to the momentum overall. We're seeing both with our sales of our subscription services as well as increased momentum with the sales of the momentum with the sales of our integrated solutions and appliances as well.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great. Thanks for that. And then, on another note, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about Portworx and what you\u2019re seeing in the competitive landscape there?\nCharlie Giancarlo: You bet. Right now, Portworx actually is almost the only game in town from what we can see with respect to two areas. One is SDS offering for container-based storage systems that operates both on-prem and in the cloud. And the second is the Kubernetes layer on top which allows for the orchestration and management of data services. And in fact, we've recently provided additional information around Pete, what we call PX backup or Portworx backup that enables customers to automate by policy. The regular backup of the storage that they\u2019ve created for their container base systems. So and really, it\u2019s the only capability that combines those two elements and we\u2019re seeing very good traction. We\u2019re seeing good traction through our channels, and we\u2019re seeing good traction directly by customers and in particular, what is especially gratifying is the fact that the -- we have a very high uptake by enterprise customers. Large banks and other areas as well.\nKevan Krysler: Yeah. I would just add to that Charlie, that I think it's been really gratifying to see the different types of customers that are adopting Portworx and Kubernetes. On one hand, you have literally the largestWall Street banks in the world transitioning all their applications to Kubernetes and using Portworx to build out very large shared container environment. Now, on the other hand, you have, for example, some of the largest gaming customers in the world that my kids spend probably too much time with unfortunately where every time we log on globally, they're building more and more points of presence to host those gaming sessions, totally in the cloud, all powered by Portworx. And so the diversity between large on-prem as well as totally cloud-native use cases is amazing.\nCharlie Giancarlo: It\u2019s still early days, of course, but we're seeing good growth.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Jason Ader with William Blair. You may now ask your question.\nJason Ader: Yeah. Thank you. Charlie, can you talk about I guess generally enterprise demand, which are the strongest verticals for you right now and then what -- I guess what surprised you in the quarter overall?\nCharlie Giancarlo: Yeah. We are seeing, as we mentioned in our remarks, really good uptake by enterprise. And as you know, it\u2019s a -- while we've sold in enterprise most of our existence, we really didn't make a major focus on it from a sales standpoint until a couple of years ago. And since that time, we've had two effects that we can really call out. One is that major strengthening of sales into existing enterprise customers, taking on more and more of their overall portfolio that we can fill. And secondly, a faster uptake by new enterprise customers and in particular, as we mentioned, are -- customers in the eight figures. We've had several this year that were brand new customers that contracted with us for eight figures. One of whom was a PaaS -- actually two of them through the year, were PaaS deals. And so, our reputation I think in enterprise has been very strong, and we can expect, we think, this to continue asconditions around COVID improve.\nJason Ader: And just any comments on verticals and then what surprised you in the quarter?\nCharlie Giancarlo: Yeah. Frankly, the one vertical that where we had been struggling a bit is now coming through for us and that is big banks. We -- big banks were, if you might say, more conservative in their use of new technology and new -- well, especially new vendors. And we've seen an opening up of that segment for us. We\u2019re also strong in service provider and health care and those have been good for us this year as well.\nJason Ader: And then obviously, the cloud business continues to --.\nCharlie Giancarlo: Yeah. I mean, of course, we've talked about that before, again, 30% plus of our sales into cloud customers. We call it cloud 4 through n, 4 through 1000, and that includes companies that provide -- only provide cloud service to their customers as well as the cloud service of more traditional companies such as Apex. So, we're in the epic cloud.\nJason Ader: In federal, any quick one on that?\nCharlie Giancarlo: Yeah. Federal is still not an area of strength for us to be honest. That\u2019s an area where we are making some changes and looking to make improvement.\nJason Ader: All right. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Alex Kurtz of KeyBanc. You may now ask your question.\nAlex Kurtz: Thanks and congrats on the good quarter, guys. Just on RPO and thinking about what the right metrics are for measuring the business given the move to Pure as-a-service and Cloud Block Store, is that really how we should be thinking about the growth rate going forward? I'd just like to hear your thoughts on how you guys look at the growth of the business outside of reported revenue growth.\nKevan Krysler: Yeah, Alex. This is Kevan. A couple of things that we look at share. Obviously the bookings outpacing revenue is one metric that we look at and we were at 9% year-over-year growth on sales which is outpacing revenue really in large part given the continued momentum we\u2019re seeing in our subscription services. If you break that down a bit more, we\u2019re looking at the unbilled component of RPO and the strength there. That\u2019s primarily driven by our Pure as-a-Service offering. And then deferred revenue is really supported by the continued momentum we\u2019re seeing around our Evergreen offering as well as the incremental momentum we\u2019re seeing in sales of our appliances which includes the Evergreen support as well and subscription. So that\u2019s kind of how we\u2019re thinking about it and seeing good strength in momentum across the board there.\nAlex Kurtz: And, Charlie, would you add anything there because if the future of the company is increasingly going to be Pure as-a-Service, shouldn\u2019t RPO be kind of at the center of the discussions around what the growth rate of the business is?\nCharlie Giancarlo: On a longer term basis, there are going to be other metrics, RPO certainly one of them such as ACV and net new. We talked about this in the past. We think we need to get through certain critical mass before we can -- before we think it makes sense to start to identify those on a regular basis. But increasingly as subscription becomes a larger and larger part of what we do, yes, we\u2019re going to need to release more information along those lines to investors.\nKevan Krysler: Yeah. And, Alex, we\u2019ll take a look at that as we go through this year. We do plan on having an Analyst Day this year and will land on a date and obviously we\u2019ll look at some other metrics that will give you a good read in terms of our overall subscription business. Because for me, it\u2019s far beyond just Pure as-a-Service which is great. But our Evergreen and Portworx are layered nicely into that as well obviously.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Karl Ackerman with Cowen. You may now ask your question.\nKarl Ackerman: Yes. Good afternoon, gentlemen. Kevan, could you discuss the linearity of OpEx leverage for fiscal 2022? I asked because the $20 million loss in Q1 appears a little bit larger than normal seasonality, but yet the full year outlook for operating margin, $90 million implies the best operating margin on record. So, I guess, maybe specifically, could you discuss the investments you are making in Portworx that might explain the outlook for Q1?\nCharlie Giancarlo: Yeah, I think -- yeah, good question, Karl. And then I think the first thing I\u2019d start out with is with Q1, you typically have this seasonality. That is our seasonally lowest quarter in terms of revenue and that\u2019s pretty consistent. And so, we will benefit if you look at the compare in Q1 of last year on a couple of different areas, one which really around the fact that we did do some realignment with our workforce and took s benefit in Q1 last year. When I think about what we\u2019re looking at in Q1 that might be a little bit different on the OpEx front, certainly some strength around our sales of our subscription services so we do have more comp coming through as a result over time because of the subscription services. So, we\u2019re dealing with that a little bit in Q1. But to your point, seeing a lot of strengths post Q1 in terms of what we see and returning to operating profitability and to your point, really happy with the fact that we\u2019re looking at almost $90 million of profitability for the year. And really, what we\u2019re doing is just capitalizing on the investments we made really through this COVID environment. And we saw some early indicators of that return in Q4, expect that to carry forward as we continue through the rest of the year. Just hopefully it helps you out, Carl.\nKarl Ackerman: Yes, it does, Kevan. Thank you. Maybe a question for Charlie. Earlier today, Seagate\u2019s talked about how data growth is going to double every three years. While it would appear that most of these data will continue to be stored on high-capacity disk in the arrow, especially improvement shown from ATV road maps, your FlashArray//C addresses very well. I think the demand for low-cost storage across multi-tenant environment. And so, first, do you think FlashArray//C will remain the largest driver for you over the next two or three years? Second, now that FlashArray//C appears to be more than 10% of revenue, is there a way to frame the TAM or growth opportunity of your FlashArray offering? Thank you.\nCharlie Giancarlo: Yeah. No. It\u2019s a great question. We do think -- we had regularly given out TAM numbers before. We think FlashArray//C fits within the TAM numbers that we had identified previously, just opens up more of that market to us from a serviceable portion. But FlashArray//C continues to be, first of all, the fastest new product we've ever introduced. Secondly, the only product of its class that can keep from a purely a price standpoint with hybrid disk arrays. And third, and to your point, the price of QLC and the price of -- and what we\u2019re able to do with 4C shows that Flash continues to decrease on a per bit basis faster than magnetic. And what that means is that the -- as those cost converged, we\u2019re going to see we're going to see more and more of the magnetic market move over to flash. It opens up the opportunity for us given our first mover advantage in that secondary tier of storage with FlashArray//C. We think we're in the best position to continue to take advantage of that.\nKevan Krysler: And the only thing I would add to that is there are some great analysts\u2019 commentary just this last quarter about how we're a couple years off from that complete convergence. But that commentary misses the benefit of data reduction. And so today, we actually deliver the value that folks think are years away of being able to replace disk in the datacenter completely with flash. And I think it's the crystalarity of our founding vision of Pure 10 years ago to look at flash as something that would really be the dominant storage technology in the data center to deliver the all-flash datacenter. It seemed like a pipe dream 10 years ago, but those are the exact kind of deals we're doing today for customers, bringing together the strength of FlashArray, FlashBlade and FlashArray//C to go after every use case.\nCharlie Giancarlo: And to finish your question which has to do with the FlashArray//C versus everything else, it's a great it's a great new product and we expect great things of it. I also expect great things from FlashBlade and from Portworx. They're all in large growth segments of the market. It's certainly true that the secondary tier market has been immune to the economics of flash up until now, and it's equal in size and opportunity to the primary tier market that we've already taken advantage of. So, yes, we think it's going to be a great opportunity for us but not the only one.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Rod Hall of Goldman Sachs. You may now ask your question.\nRod Hall: Oh, great. Thank you. So I wanted to ask you -- I'm going to go back to these eight large enterprise deals that you guys call out -- called out and see if maybe you could talk a little bit about the competitive situation there. Was there any particular competitor you we're displacing there? Any particular used case that's resonating with people. Just wonder if you could dig in at those deals a little bit more and help us understand how you won those, and then I've got a follow-up.\nCharlie Giancarlo: Absolutely. It was a mixture of new and existing customers, mostly existing customers, certainly, mixture of portfolio on the verticals, big banks, cloud and traditional, more traditional enterprise companies. I would say that, on average, as I think across all eight of them, it shook out pretty similarly to our average competitive portfolio that is to say mostly Dell but certainly NetApp very big win in -- up against NetApp and primarily those two vendors, I would say.\nRod Hall: Okay. Great. And then I wanted to follow-up on the supply shortages that are out there and expectations that NAND price is going to go up later in the year. I wonder if you can maybe can wrap those two questions into one answer.\nCharlie Giancarlo: Yeah.\nRod Hall: Do you expect supply shortages to be a problem and you're factoring that into your thinking, how you're factoring it in, and then what is NAND do to your economics later in the year? Thanks.\nCharlie Giancarlo: You bet. So, as you may recall, we are -- we have a very strong supply chain. We were unaffected and, of course, our supply chain team was very busy. But we -- our customers were completely unaffected at the beginning of last year when COVID hit. We have some of the best lead times in the business overall. As we look going forward, yes, we do expect NAND pricing to stabilize, if not to get a bit strong that is a bit higher in the next couple of quarters, as we think demand has picked up and supplies are a bit constrained. But we don\u2019t expect any shortages. There have also been reports of course, of other semiconductor shortages. We\u2019re on top of that. We don\u2019t expect to see any, although, certainly lead times are starting to lengthened but we\u2019re taking appropriate actions there overall. There was another part to the question was. I think that was it.\nRod Hall: Well on the NAND that the margin impact you sort of remind us that you would expect any kind of\u2026\nCharlie Giancarlo: Oh, yeah. We don\u2019t expect much of a lot of change in margins due to -- NAND is fairly well behaved from the way we look at things. But right now and therefore, we don\u2019t really expect much change in margin due to NAND pricing.\nRod Hall: Great. Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Tim Long of Barclays. You may now ask your question.\nTim Long: Thank you. Just two if I could. Just following on those, the big deals. Could you just talk a little bit about obviously, it was a great quarter. Talk a little bit about how the pipeline for the large deals looks and anything on the complexion there? And then second, can you, Charlie, can you touch a little bit on the commercial vertical? Obviously, cloud and enterprise were call it strong. So maybe just walk us through what\u2019s going on there? I\u2019m sure it\u2019s a lot of macro but kind of the outlook for some recovery in that vertical? Thanks.\nCharlie Giancarlo: Let me take that second part and then, I\u2019ll hand it over to Kevan. So we continue to see weakness in commercial, although I will say we saw a serial strength in the end of that or sequential I should say strengthening of commercial. But frankly, it\u2019s still suffering and it\u2019s one of the areas that as COVID subsides, we hope to see improve. There are some early signs that that might be the case, but clearly, the midmarket has suffered much more than large enterprise overall on average. Our expectation what we've built into our planning is that we should see because of the both the summer months and hopefully some effect of the vaccine, we should see a dissipation of the COVID effects in the middle or somewhere in our Q2. And that's in our forecast sort of is based on a lessening of COVID effect both in the commercial market, as well as in enterprise generally. But, yeah, commercial and midmarket are still suffering. But we're seeing some light at the end of the tunnel, and we're hoping that as COVID subsides, we're going to see that improve.\nKevan Krysler: And then, just adding then a little bit of light in terms of around our guide for Q1 and annual in correlation with the big deals that we were really pleased to see in Q4. Look, I think we've got plenty of opportunities that they were looking at and working with customers on and we're hopeful. We'll continue the pace as we progress through next year including these large deals we saw in Q4 and building on that. But when we think about the opportunity set, it's really broader as we think about next year. Subscription services continues to have great momentum and that's building for us. And then, obviously, that helps out with a little bit more certainty in terms of how that rolls out into revenue. And so, that's great for us to see. As we see build of our opportunities, we see some nice build-out further beyond Q1, which is nice in terms of our guide for the annual year. So we've got some good confidence on that. But it's broad-based and not completely focused, if you will, on the big deals which we're always pleased to get.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Eric Suppiger of JMP Securities. You may ask your question.\nEric Suppiger: Yeah. Thanks for taking the question. First off, I'd just be interested to hear as you look out to the pandemic dissipating, how do you think that will materialize? What will change for you? Is it more just being able to engage personally with the customer or where do you think the most notable changes will take place?\nCharlie Giancarlo: Yeah. We thought about this a lot. I think the most noticeable change will actually be customers being willing to start to re-enter the office. And why is that? Well, we depend a lot on, as a company on two things, one is commercial as we talked about. But the second one is customers willing to take on new products or put products into new use cases. And we're largely still an on-prem vendor and their willingness to do so is enhanced tremendously when they can go into the office. So, you might imagine that using a new product and a new workload is something that customers are can be concerned about. And when they're able to go into the office and address things, if something goes wrong, they feel much more comfortable being able to do that. So, our dependence on both commercial and net new logos depends on customers feeling more comfortable to go into the office. So, that's really what we're going to be looking at. Now, it doesn\u2019t require 90% of their team be able to go in the office, just their technology team to be -- to feel comfortable going to the office trying new things. So, that's what we'll be looking at.\nEric Suppiger: Okay. That's very helpful. You don't break this out, but can you talk a little bit about what portion of your customer base buys across the different product categories, FlashBlade, FlashArray and maybe Taz [ph] do you look at your cross-sell metrics? Anything you could share on that front?\nCharlie Giancarlo: We do look at cross-sell metrics and it\u2019s quite interesting, it\u2019s the -- if we look at FlashBlade, it\u2019s roughly 50% of our sales will go into an existing FlashArray customer, an existing customer. And half will go into a brand new customer as well. I would say, Portworx is a bit too early. FlashArray//C tends to be majority new customer -- sorry, existing customer. But we do have new customer -- brand new customers for FlashArray//C as well. So it's a good balance. If I had to put an overall percentage on it, it\u2019d be about 50/50. But it depends on the on the product.\nEric Suppiger: What about the Pure-as-a-Service?\nCharlie Giancarlo: That's very interesting. We've had a very high percentage of net new customers on Pure-as-a-Service. It really has allowed us to enter new customers with a unique value proposition, where we might not have been given a chance before.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Pinjalim Bora of JPMorgan. You may now ask your question.\nPinjalim Bora: Thank you guys and congrats on the quarter. Charlie, given that this is the first fiscal year for Dominic to put his investment on the sales and its processes, could you talk about any material changes that you\u2019re thinking of how you\u2019ve already put in place going into the new fiscal year in terms of concrete designs and construction changes?\nCharlie Giancarlo: Yeah. Absolutely. What we've consolidated are overlay sales operations now into a single overlay. And that\u2019s going to allow us to really treat -- and which is going to be a highly technical sales and as the operation and that really allows us to balance if you will new products while at the same time transitioning the more mature new products into the core sales -- the mainstream sales operations. So, that has been a significant change. Of course we've made as we do every year. We\u2019ve made changes to the compensation. And I want to be clear. Not major changes but balancing all of the products and intentions that we have for this year making sure that we have instead of just we talked about before and I talked about in my prepared remarks for periods of service but also for Portworx going forward. I think Dominick\u2019s understanding of how to sell an enterprise and how to sell, in particular software and service offerings it has really modified the way we've thought about that. and therefore allowed us to change in many ways simplify our compensation program to really focus on the elements that are important while at the same time making everything else mainstream and to make sure that our sales force really has the training, the knowledge and the skills to sell our entire portfolio.\nMatt Kixmoeller: And I have to say just in terms of, Charlie, on the fuel compensation and what Dom and yourself for doing it really extends to Evergreen Gold subscription. We\u2019re really trying to make sure that the field is promoting that given the value proposition there, Pure as-a-Service, Cloud Block Store and Portworx as well and FlashBlade. So, we continue to highlight FlashBlade. We got wonderful momentum with FlashBlade and then offering new cases and that will continue as we look at the next year.\nPinjalim Bora: And just a follow up, maybe Charlie or Kevan, anyone of you can take this. But when I look at -- the guidance seems pretty solid. But when I look at the range maybe it's a little bit wider than usual. So, trying to understand how would you peg the environment going forward. Would you say it is back to normal? Is there -- I mean the shape of the year, would it be more towards the second half ramp versus the first half. Help us understand that.\nKevan Krysler: Yeah. I'll start with that tactically and let Charlie add on to it. But I think you're thinking about that right, right? So, we're looking at probably in the Q2 timeframe really to start to see noticeable diminishing effects, if you will, of COVID. And we\u2019ve built that in to how we're thinking about the entire year. And so that is playing into it. So obviously second half, we are looking for some incremental momentum in terms of how we're thinking about our annual outlook. Charlie, you have any thoughts you want to add on that?\nCharlie Giancarlo: Yeah. I think that's correct. The only -- the uncertainty we face is at the beginning of Q2, is at the end of Q2 and what does the end of the -- what does the fall of the year look like from a COVID standpoint. But our belief is that it will continue to improve throughout the year, second half. And obviously the comparison next to this coming year are going to be wonky as well given COVID last year. But that being said, we feel fairly good about the about the guide that we've -- about got the forecast that we have.\nMatt Kixmoeller: Yeah. I\u2019d just add on a little bit more in terms of obviously the momentum that we've seen this year and expect to continue next year in terms of outperformance on our subscription services, that give us a little bit more predictability in terms of how things will fall. We've got really solid growth drivers As we've talked about with FlashBlade and FlashArray/C, we do expect continued momentum with enterprise. And as Charlie mentioned, it's really looking at the commercial and midmarket recovery really second half post-COVID if you will.\nPinjalim Bora: Got it. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Simon Leopold with Raymond James. You may ask your question.\nSimon Leopold: Thanks for taking the question. Charlie, I think my question really goes back to the -- your comment about the trend being a little bit wonky and that we've got a relatively or a very easy comparison to the pandemic. So I'm wondering if you could give us some idea of what you see as the maybe normalized growth rate on a year-over-year basis if there is some way to adjust for what the effect of the pandemic has been and what you think your growth should be?\nCharlie Giancarlo: Yeah. Well, definitely, safely within the double-digit range certainly. You might recall, this time last year, we were projecting a 20% growth rate. I have no reason to believe why that wouldn\u2019t have been the growth rate going forward. But as it is, we're going to be facing at least four to five months of this calendar year still with a strong COVID effect. And it\u2019s hard to say exactly how long that will be. So, I hope that gives you some semblance on where we would expect to be.\nMatt Kixmoeller: I would add on to that for the quarter for Q1 of last year. That would be a strong compare. Obviously, when COVID set in for us that was later in the quarter. And so we had a strong start to last quarter as well as the fact that we had some tailwinds as folks were working through some technical debt to respond to COVID. So I actually view Q1 last year as a strong compare, but it's a fair statement for the full year.\nSimon Leopold: Great. And then in line of sort of the idea that this recovery and some return to normal, what is your thinking in terms of your operating expense budget where you might be introducing or reintroducing travel expenses and things like that? Have you made some assumption for the timing and impact and is that incorporated into this operating income for the full year that you've considered, or do you think that happens for later? Thanks.\nCharlie Giancarlo: All right. You're thinking about this exactly right. We're going to feather that in. It's incorporated into our guide. Clearly, we've taken this past year -- we've taken T&E and put it into head count, if you want to put it that way, into investment. As we go forward, travel start up like a light switch. It's going to take time to build up. Customers will have their own pace by which they will want to physically meet and get together. So we're going to be cautious. I don't even want travel and entertainment to get up to the same level it was pre-COVID. But at the same time, our expectation is that expenses will grow slower than revenue, and that's on a total basis. So by definition, since we've pre-invested, if you will, into head count, it will mean an even slower growth in the area of travel and entertainment.\nOperator: And your next question comes from Katie Huberty of Morgan Stanley. You may now ask your question. All right. Katie Huberty of Morgan Stanley, your line is now open. You may ask your question.\nKatie Huberty: The $10 million subscription deal was particularly impressive in the quarter. Can you just talk about what you think is driving underlying adoption of Pure as a service? Is COVID a factor as companies focus on cash preservation, or is this much more of a sustained shift in how customers are thinking about buying product on time? And I have a follow up.\nCharlie Giancarlo: Yes. Katie, I think it's more the latter, a sustained shift. I think what they are -- it's more about -- it's less about cash flow per se for the customer and more about uncertainty of where they want their data on a going-forward basis. And so with the Pure as service, they're able to fulfill their needs which tend to be on-prem today and know that whether it's a year or two years or 30 months that they can then shift the cloud without having ongoing obligation on-prem or having a reduced obligation or whatever balance that they're looking for. So it gives them extreme flexibility. So it saves them -- it allows them to make a decision today without worrying about long-term effects.\nKatie Huberty: That makes sense.\nCharlie Giancarlo: I would also just add there real quickly that we really view this as a product innovation strategy as much as a business model. And it's one that I think when you look at what we're offering compared to the kind of financing options many of our competitors offer, it really allows us to differentiate our experience with customers. We're delivering a cloud-like experience that bridges on-prem and actual deployment in the cloud that\u2019s unified subscription. And another interesting thing we did this last quarter was open up the services catalog. So we were providing transparent pricing where a customer can go in and see exactly what storage costs and subscribe to it. And we've seen the first transactions come through that in an automated fashion.\nKatie Huberty: Great. And, Charlie, I want to come back to an earlier question somebody asked about large deal pipeline. Can you just talk about the broader pipeline exiting January. What that looked like versus October? And have you already started to see improved conversion and close rates even in the commercial market?\nCharlie Giancarlo: We\u2019ve seen -- the commercial market, as I\u2019ve mentioned, is improving somewhat but still far below where we had exited last year, for instance. We\u2019re seeing better conversions on the enterprise side of things. And so that gives us hope. And in general, I\u2019d say certainly compared to a year ago, increased the amount of enterprise and large enterprise, much larger fraction of large deal exiting. I hope that gives you some color.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Amit Daryanani of Evercore. Your line is open. You may ask your question.\nIrvin Liu: Hi. This is Irvin Liu dialing in with Amit. I jumped on the call a bit late, so forgive me if this was addressed. Can you help us better understand some of the assumptions that are embedded in your 14% to 15% revenue growth outlook for fiscal 2022? Just any thoughts on products versus support revenue trajectories would be helpful, just trying to parse this out. Thanks.\nKevan Krysler: Yeah. I\u2019ll start and then I\u2019ll let Charlie jump in. But obviously what we\u2019ve been chatting about is the terrific momentum of the subscription services that we\u2019ve seen really throughout the entire year. We fully expect to build on that as we look out to next year. And that\u2019s really being driven by our Evergreen Subscription, by Pure as-a-Service, unified subscription with Cloud Block Store and Portworx. So, again, I\u2019d say business as usual with continued momentum there. I think on the product side, what you\u2019ve seen is some modest improvement in Q4 in terms of what -- where we\u2019re landing from that perspective. We expect to build on that. You\u2019ll see some improvement in terms of how we look at that for Q1. And then obviously, we would expect to get back to growth on product revenue as well as we go throughout the year in terms of how we're thinking about it. The growth drivers really will continue to be. Enterprise as well as FlashBlade, FlashArray//C. And then, we fully expect to Charlie's point, after or as COVID diminishes to get further recovery from our commercial business. And building upon our strengths that we saw in Q4 on net new logo. Charlie would you anything to answer that?\nCharlie Giancarlo: I think Kevan you handled most of it. I would just say that, we do expect product growth that is traditional CapEx product growth to increase albeit, we expect subscription growth to outpace the capital expense -- the capital equipment growth going -- on a going forward basis.\nOperator: Hi. This concludes the question-and-answer session. At this time, I will turn the call back over to Charlie Giancarlo for closing remarks.\nCharlie Giancarlo: Thank you. In closing, I'd like to thank you all and thank all of our employees, our customers and our partners for all of their support through this past year. Despite it all, Pure has accomplished a great deal both in terms of the innovation in our products, as well as our market penetration. And even with all of the uncertainty around the exact timing of the recovery from this pandemic. We're confident in our vision, our strategy and our team's ability to grow and to scale Pure. I want to thank you all for joining us today. Goodbye.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Charlie Giancarlo",
            "content": "Hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us on our Q4 earnings call today. I hope that each of you, your loved ones, and colleagues are all safe and healthy. Pure ended fiscal 2021 with great strength and growth, setting revenue and sales records for the quarter and for the full fiscal year. Our portfolio has never been stronger, with record sales in our Pure-as-a-service offering, FlashBlade, FlashArray//C, and Portworx. The completeness of our product suite accelerated sales growth in our enterprise and cloud segments in each and every theater and in our major verticals. Our Q4 results are confirmation of the strength of our long-term strategy and a leading indicator of our opportunity to accelerate growth. I am pleased to share with you today these Q4 successes. Our long-term strategy is to deliver a modern data experience to customers. It was gratifying that so many of our existing customers chose to significantly deepen the relationship with Pure as we've become an ever more critical component in their own plans for digital transformation. We also saw net new customer acquisition growth over last quarter and continued strength in enterprise. In Q4, we booked eight, eight-figure deals with eight large enterprise customers, a new record. It was just two years ago that we began significant investments in our enterprise go-to-market team. Our strength in that segment this past year is proof point of the successful execution of that strategy. Our ongoing commitment to marrying technological innovation with our customer-centric business model is increasingly recognized by customers and the industry. With seven years ranked as a leader, Gartner's recognition this year of Pure's clear leadership across both ability to execute and vision in their Magic Quadrant for Primary Storage Arrays is a great validation of our strategy. And we also improved our already leading excellence in customer experience as measured through our net promoter score. For calendar 2020, Pure's third-party certified NPS was 83.5%, our sixth year in a leadership position and the highest score among vendors measured by Medallia. One of the most important components of our growth strategy is, of course, Pure's leadership team. This quarter, we welcomed Ajay Singh, our new Chief Product Officer. As CPO, Ajay will be responsible for our five business units and our technology alliances and will be a key contributor to our strategy to deliver modern data services. He brings to Pure extensive expertise in software and services to accelerate our growth into our as-a-service model and cloud-native support. Our growth in Q4 is proof that our ability to deliver a modern data experience is resonating with our customers. They see the benefits of advanced technology from a trusted storage leader that supports a wide range of structured and unstructured data at scale and across any workload, but the Pure value proposition goes well beyond this. The Pure vision is to deliver real-time access to resilient hybrid cloud managed storage services via code to developers and operations managers. Customers desire of managed data services that are dynamic and provide a cloud experience with flexible on-demand consumption. Needless to say, we continue to dramatically outpace our industry in both innovation and customer delight, and I'm excited to share four reasons why customers continue to lead with Pure. First, Pure delivers the simplest storage platform to operate. We continue to innovate with what customers appreciate namely seamless upgrades, cloud management, pay-as-you-go consumption models, and both traditional and cloud native data services. This strategy is resonating with customers as validated in a Wikibon analyst report for cloud spending and adoption. Their survey showed that Pure leads both hyperscalers and on-premise legacy vendors in customer spending intent with an off-the-chart net score of 63%. Second, we continue to see strong customer adoption of our subscription services which include our Evergreen and Pure as-a-Service offerings. Only Pure delivers a true enterprise class utility with flexible storage consumption, a cloud experience on-premise, an easy path to move data to the cloud at any time, and aligns spend with actual consumption. This year we've continued to advance our subscription services platform reducing complexity by eliminating additional licenses and support costs and introducing a service catalog with transparent pricing. This quarter, our subscription services grew over 30% from one year ago. New Customers for our Pure as-a-Service offering included one customer over $10 million, as well as US customer Cloud@Work, MACA Mining Services in Australia, and German telecom provider, Broadcom [ph]. And we saw customer adoption increase across every major area of the world. Given the significant customer benefits with our subscription services, we have created enhancements to our field compensation for these offers going forward. Third, last quarter, we expanded our industry-leading data services capabilities for containerized cloud-native applications with the acquisition of Portworx. Cloud-native databases, analytics applications, and AI frameworks such as Cassandra, MongoDB, Postgres, Kafka, Elasticsearch, SPARC, and TensorFlow are the tools upon which customers build their modern data pipelines. Pure has been successfully serving these applications at the highest performance levels with FlashBlade. And now, Portworx helps us expand support for these applications on any infrastructure, on-prem or in-cloud, at any scale. We saw significant growth of in-cloud deployments of Portworx this quarter, with particular growth through our IBM partnership given our best-in-class support for Red Hat OpenShift, an IBM cloud pack for data. The integration of Portworx into Pure has been one of the best that I have ever experienced, and we are just beginning to leverage Pure's go-to-market engine to drive Portworx. And earlier this month, we expanded our market leadership with major software updates to our flagship Purity software on both FlashBlade and FlashArray to deliver enhanced performance, comprehensive ransomware protection and security. And we broadened file capabilities to serve more markets and use cases. Best of all, we enabled customers to adopt these new innovations without disruption, downtime, additional costs, or the requirement to rebuy new capacity. Sustainability is my fourth and final point. From our founding, Pure has focused on how our products can use less energy, require less cooling, needs less maintenance, and take up less space in the data centers and to produce less waste. In the last eight years, we estimate that Pure's FlashArray offering alone has saved over 4 billion kilowatt hours in energy use, avoiding the greenhouse gas emissions equivalent to over 7 billion miles of automobile travel. It's eliminated 96% of data center Rackspace when compared to legacy solutions which is approximately 19,000 racks or over 10,000 tons of legacy gear not deployed. With Evergreen upgrades, customers continuously upgrade rather than discard their older storage equipment, avoiding the rip-and-replace required by legacy vendors and reducing waste in landfills. Pure's industry-leading storage density allows customers to save on data center space and power when compared to other flash storage vendors. Now, with FlashArray//C, customers can fit 1 petabyte of effective storage into roughly one rack unit, the size of a pizza box. Paying for only what one consumes is the right model for customer's bottom line, and right-sizing energy use and physical infrastructure ensures that customers don't pay to cool and power excess equipment. I'm very pleased with both the internal investments we've made over the past fiscal year and our focus on operational discipline. We made a commitment early in the COVID-19 pandemic that we would continue to make strategic investments in global talent focusing on innovation including our acquisition of Portworx, customer support, and scaling the company. We dramatically reduced travel, entertainment, and other operating expenses while increasing our investments in talent and critical growth initiatives in anticipation of increasing growth this year while continuing to deliver operating income and generating positive operating cash flows. Our employees and our charitable foundation, Pure Good, also stepped up investments focused on COVID-19 response, food and housing in our local communities, and in our Workforce Development Initiative. Continuing our thoughtful approach to operating in this new normal, we recently announced to the company that we plan to use a hybrid approach when we return to the office with most employees able to work from home part-time. We believe that the hybrid office model will deliver the best combination of individual and team productivity and allow us to continue to attract and retain the best employees in the industry. I have never felt more fortunate to be at Pure. Our dedicated Puritans, our loyal customers, and our partners and suppliers all displayed incredible perseverance, creativity, and positivity during the past 12 months despite the personal challenges they each faced. The effect of the COVID economy on Pure's business has largely played out as we predicted over this past year. First, a short acceleration of business as customers shifted to work-at-home and online business, then a sharp pullback as they took stock both of their business prospects and new plans for digital transformation, followed by a gradual stabilization based on the new normal. Now, we look forward to return to a more significant economic growth as we expect the effects of COVID will begin to diminish during our fiscal Q2. I have increasing confidence that this year will be far better than last. On a macro front, I'm hopeful about the promise of increasingly plentiful and effective vaccines being distributed throughout the world. I believe that in this fiscal year, our customers will accelerate their investment in digital transformation with renewed confidence of economic recovery. They will be increasingly confident in their ability to deploy new vendors, new systems, and software into new use cases. And Pure will be high on their list. Thank you. And now, I will turn the meeting over to Kevan for details on our financials. Let me just start because I'd like to just start the overall conversation with the fact that we really did see an excellent quarter across the board, and given the strength that we've had in subscription revenues that we commented upon as you might expect, we're seeing good growth and even greater growth in deferred than we see in actual revenues which bodes well for the future, gives us additional confidence overall going forward. Kevan? You bet. Right now, Portworx actually is almost the only game in town from what we can see with respect to two areas. One is SDS offering for container-based storage systems that operates both on-prem and in the cloud. And the second is the Kubernetes layer on top which allows for the orchestration and management of data services. And in fact, we've recently provided additional information around Pete, what we call PX backup or Portworx backup that enables customers to automate by policy. The regular backup of the storage that they've created for their container base systems. So and really, it's the only capability that combines those two elements and we're seeing very good traction. We're seeing good traction through our channels, and we're seeing good traction directly by customers and in particular, what is especially gratifying is the fact that the -- we have a very high uptake by enterprise customers. Large banks and other areas as well. It's still early days, of course, but we're seeing good growth. Yeah. We are seeing, as we mentioned in our remarks, really good uptake by enterprise. And as you know, it's a -- while we've sold in enterprise most of our existence, we really didn't make a major focus on it from a sales standpoint until a couple of years ago. And since that time, we've had two effects that we can really call out. One is that major strengthening of sales into existing enterprise customers, taking on more and more of their overall portfolio that we can fill. And secondly, a faster uptake by new enterprise customers and in particular, as we mentioned, are -- customers in the eight figures. We've had several this year that were brand new customers that contracted with us for eight figures. One of whom was a PaaS -- actually two of them through the year, were PaaS deals. And so, our reputation I think in enterprise has been very strong, and we can expect, we think, this to continue asconditions around COVID improve. Yeah. Frankly, the one vertical that where we had been struggling a bit is now coming through for us and that is big banks. We -- big banks were, if you might say, more conservative in their use of new technology and new -- well, especially new vendors. And we've seen an opening up of that segment for us. We're also strong in service provider and health care and those have been good for us this year as well. Yeah. I mean, of course, we've talked about that before, again, 30% plus of our sales into cloud customers. We call it cloud 4 through n, 4 through 1000, and that includes companies that provide -- only provide cloud service to their customers as well as the cloud service of more traditional companies such as Apex. So, we're in the epic cloud. Yeah. Federal is still not an area of strength for us to be honest. That's an area where we are making some changes and looking to make improvement. On a longer term basis, there are going to be other metrics, RPO certainly one of them such as ACV and net new. We talked about this in the past. We think we need to get through certain critical mass before we can -- before we think it makes sense to start to identify those on a regular basis. But increasingly as subscription becomes a larger and larger part of what we do, yes, we're going to need to release more information along those lines to investors. Yeah, I think -- yeah, good question, Karl. And then I think the first thing I'd start out with is with Q1, you typically have this seasonality. That is our seasonally lowest quarter in terms of revenue and that's pretty consistent. And so, we will benefit if you look at the compare in Q1 of last year on a couple of different areas, one which really around the fact that we did do some realignment with our workforce and took s benefit in Q1 last year. When I think about what we're looking at in Q1 that might be a little bit different on the OpEx front, certainly some strength around our sales of our subscription services so we do have more comp coming through as a result over time because of the subscription services. So, we're dealing with that a little bit in Q1. But to your point, seeing a lot of strengths post Q1 in terms of what we see and returning to operating profitability and to your point, really happy with the fact that we're looking at almost $90 million of profitability for the year. And really, what we're doing is just capitalizing on the investments we made really through this COVID environment. And we saw some early indicators of that return in Q4, expect that to carry forward as we continue through the rest of the year. Just hopefully it helps you out, Carl. Yeah. No. It's a great question. We do think -- we had regularly given out TAM numbers before. We think FlashArray//C fits within the TAM numbers that we had identified previously, just opens up more of that market to us from a serviceable portion. But FlashArray//C continues to be, first of all, the fastest new product we've ever introduced. Secondly, the only product of its class that can keep from a purely a price standpoint with hybrid disk arrays. And third, and to your point, the price of QLC and the price of -- and what we're able to do with 4C shows that Flash continues to decrease on a per bit basis faster than magnetic. And what that means is that the -- as those cost converged, we're going to see we're going to see more and more of the magnetic market move over to flash. It opens up the opportunity for us given our first mover advantage in that secondary tier of storage with FlashArray//C. We think we're in the best position to continue to take advantage of that. And to finish your question which has to do with the FlashArray//C versus everything else, it's a great it's a great new product and we expect great things of it. I also expect great things from FlashBlade and from Portworx. They're all in large growth segments of the market. It's certainly true that the secondary tier market has been immune to the economics of flash up until now, and it's equal in size and opportunity to the primary tier market that we've already taken advantage of. So, yes, we think it's going to be a great opportunity for us but not the only one. Absolutely. It was a mixture of new and existing customers, mostly existing customers, certainly, mixture of portfolio on the verticals, big banks, cloud and traditional, more traditional enterprise companies. I would say that, on average, as I think across all eight of them, it shook out pretty similarly to our average competitive portfolio that is to say mostly Dell but certainly NetApp very big win in -- up against NetApp and primarily those two vendors, I would say. Yeah. You bet. So, as you may recall, we are -- we have a very strong supply chain. We were unaffected and, of course, our supply chain team was very busy. But we -- our customers were completely unaffected at the beginning of last year when COVID hit. We have some of the best lead times in the business overall. As we look going forward, yes, we do expect NAND pricing to stabilize, if not to get a bit strong that is a bit higher in the next couple of quarters, as we think demand has picked up and supplies are a bit constrained. But we don't expect any shortages. There have also been reports of course, of other semiconductor shortages. We're on top of that. We don't expect to see any, although, certainly lead times are starting to lengthened but we're taking appropriate actions there overall. There was another part to the question was. I think that was it. Oh, yeah. We don't expect much of a lot of change in margins due to -- NAND is fairly well behaved from the way we look at things. But right now and therefore, we don't really expect much change in margin due to NAND pricing. Let me take that second part and then, I'll hand it over to Kevan. So we continue to see weakness in commercial, although I will say we saw a serial strength in the end of that or sequential I should say strengthening of commercial. But frankly, it's still suffering and it's one of the areas that as COVID subsides, we hope to see improve. There are some early signs that that might be the case, but clearly, the midmarket has suffered much more than large enterprise overall on average. Our expectation what we've built into our planning is that we should see because of the both the summer months and hopefully some effect of the vaccine, we should see a dissipation of the COVID effects in the middle or somewhere in our Q2. And that's in our forecast sort of is based on a lessening of COVID effect both in the commercial market, as well as in enterprise generally. But, yeah, commercial and midmarket are still suffering. But we're seeing some light at the end of the tunnel, and we're hoping that as COVID subsides, we're going to see that improve. Yeah. We thought about this a lot. I think the most noticeable change will actually be customers being willing to start to re-enter the office. And why is that? Well, we depend a lot on, as a company on two things, one is commercial as we talked about. But the second one is customers willing to take on new products or put products into new use cases. And we're largely still an on-prem vendor and their willingness to do so is enhanced tremendously when they can go into the office. So, you might imagine that using a new product and a new workload is something that customers are can be concerned about. And when they're able to go into the office and address things, if something goes wrong, they feel much more comfortable being able to do that. So, our dependence on both commercial and net new logos depends on customers feeling more comfortable to go into the office. So, that's really what we're going to be looking at. Now, it doesn't require 90% of their team be able to go in the office, just their technology team to be -- to feel comfortable going to the office trying new things. So, that's what we'll be looking at. We do look at cross-sell metrics and it's quite interesting, it's the -- if we look at FlashBlade, it's roughly 50% of our sales will go into an existing FlashArray customer, an existing customer. And half will go into a brand new customer as well. I would say, Portworx is a bit too early. FlashArray//C tends to be majority new customer -- sorry, existing customer. But we do have new customer -- brand new customers for FlashArray//C as well. So it's a good balance. If I had to put an overall percentage on it, it'd be about 50/50. But it depends on the on the product. That's very interesting. We've had a very high percentage of net new customers on Pure-as-a-Service. It really has allowed us to enter new customers with a unique value proposition, where we might not have been given a chance before. Yeah. Absolutely. What we've consolidated are overlay sales operations now into a single overlay. And that's going to allow us to really treat -- and which is going to be a highly technical sales and as the operation and that really allows us to balance if you will new products while at the same time transitioning the more mature new products into the core sales -- the mainstream sales operations. So, that has been a significant change. Of course we've made as we do every year. We've made changes to the compensation. And I want to be clear. Not major changes but balancing all of the products and intentions that we have for this year making sure that we have instead of just we talked about before and I talked about in my prepared remarks for periods of service but also for Portworx going forward. I think Dominick's understanding of how to sell an enterprise and how to sell, in particular software and service offerings it has really modified the way we've thought about that. and therefore allowed us to change in many ways simplify our compensation program to really focus on the elements that are important while at the same time making everything else mainstream and to make sure that our sales force really has the training, the knowledge and the skills to sell our entire portfolio. Yeah. I think that's correct. The only -- the uncertainty we face is at the beginning of Q2, is at the end of Q2 and what does the end of the -- what does the fall of the year look like from a COVID standpoint. But our belief is that it will continue to improve throughout the year, second half. And obviously the comparison next to this coming year are going to be wonky as well given COVID last year. But that being said, we feel fairly good about the about the guide that we've -- about got the forecast that we have. Yeah. Well, definitely, safely within the double-digit range certainly. You might recall, this time last year, we were projecting a 20% growth rate. I have no reason to believe why that wouldn't have been the growth rate going forward. But as it is, we're going to be facing at least four to five months of this calendar year still with a strong COVID effect. And it's hard to say exactly how long that will be. So, I hope that gives you some semblance on where we would expect to be. All right. You're thinking about this exactly right. We're going to feather that in. It's incorporated into our guide. Clearly, we've taken this past year -- we've taken T&E and put it into head count, if you want to put it that way, into investment. As we go forward, travel start up like a light switch. It's going to take time to build up. Customers will have their own pace by which they will want to physically meet and get together. So we're going to be cautious. I don't even want travel and entertainment to get up to the same level it was pre-COVID. But at the same time, our expectation is that expenses will grow slower than revenue, and that's on a total basis. So by definition, since we've pre-invested, if you will, into head count, it will mean an even slower growth in the area of travel and entertainment. Yes. Katie, I think it's more the latter, a sustained shift. I think what they are -- it's more about -- it's less about cash flow per se for the customer and more about uncertainty of where they want their data on a going-forward basis. And so with the Pure as service, they're able to fulfill their needs which tend to be on-prem today and know that whether it's a year or two years or 30 months that they can then shift the cloud without having ongoing obligation on-prem or having a reduced obligation or whatever balance that they're looking for. So it gives them extreme flexibility. So it saves them -- it allows them to make a decision today without worrying about long-term effects. I would also just add there real quickly that we really view this as a product innovation strategy as much as a business model. And it's one that I think when you look at what we're offering compared to the kind of financing options many of our competitors offer, it really allows us to differentiate our experience with customers. We're delivering a cloud-like experience that bridges on-prem and actual deployment in the cloud that's unified subscription. And another interesting thing we did this last quarter was open up the services catalog. So we were providing transparent pricing where a customer can go in and see exactly what storage costs and subscribe to it. And we've seen the first transactions come through that in an automated fashion. We've seen -- the commercial market, as I've mentioned, is improving somewhat but still far below where we had exited last year, for instance. We're seeing better conversions on the enterprise side of things. And so that gives us hope. And in general, I'd say certainly compared to a year ago, increased the amount of enterprise and large enterprise, much larger fraction of large deal exiting. I hope that gives you some color. I think Kevan you handled most of it. I would just say that, we do expect product growth that is traditional CapEx product growth to increase albeit, we expect subscription growth to outpace the capital expense -- the capital equipment growth going -- on a going forward basis. Thank you. In closing, I'd like to thank you all and thank all of our employees, our customers and our partners for all of their support through this past year. Despite it all, Pure has accomplished a great deal both in terms of the innovation in our products, as well as our market penetration. And even with all of the uncertainty around the exact timing of the recovery from this pandemic. We're confident in our vision, our strategy and our team's ability to grow and to scale Pure. I want to thank you all for joining us today. Goodbye."

            "name": "Kevan Krysler",
            "content": "Thank you, Charlie, and good afternoon. We are very pleased with the strength of our Q4 performance which was much stronger than we planned. FlashBlade and FlashArray//C, both achieved consecutive record sales. And we continue to see strong demand with our enterprise customers who recognize the value that we are delivering. We completed a record number of deals above $10 million and also achieved record sales during the quarter to our Fortune 500 customers. Sales of our subscription services continue to be strong consistent with what we have been seeing throughout the year, including one of our top deals above $10 million being Pure as-a-Service. Our sales growth excluding cancellable orders was slightly over 9% in Q4 compared to last year driven by strength both in the US and international markets. We're also very pleased with new customer acquisitions during the quarter as 471 new customers chose one or more of our solutions. Now, turning to specific Q4 financial results. Total revenue of approximately $503 million exceeded our expectations growing 2% year-over-year. Despite the strong comparators, Q5 last year was not impacted by COVID headwinds. Subscription services revenue grew approximately 32% year-over-year and represents approximately 30% of total revenue. As a reminder, subscription services revenue includes Evergreen subscriptions, the unified Pure as-a-Service subscription which includes Cloud Block Store. Total revenue, both in the United States and international saw slight growth compared to a strong Q4 last year. Our remaining performance obligations or RPO which includes our committed and non-cancellable future revenue grew approximately 24% year-over-year. Non-GAAP total gross margins in Q4 was 69.4%, up 30 basis points sequentially compared to 72.1% last year. Product gross margins were 69.1% compared to 73.3% last year. As you might recall, last year's product gross margin benefited from unprecedented pricing dynamics of NAND. Subscription services gross margins were strong at 70.2% compared to 68.1% last year. Non-GAAP operating profit during the quarter was approximately $36.7 million compared to $60.9 million last year. We were pleased that as we were navigating COVID-related headwinds, we continue to invest in the business while only slightly increasing overall operating expenses. Operating income for the year was $46 million as operating expenses for the year grew less than 3%. Non-GAAP net income during Q4 was $38.8 million and non-GAAP net income per share was $0.13. Weighted average shares used for the Q4 non-GAAP net earnings per share calculation was approximately 297 million shares. We ended the quarter with over $1.25 billion in cash and approximately 3,800 employees. Cash flow from operations was $69 million and free cash flows was $48 million in the quarter. During Q4, we repurchased a little over 1 million shares for approximately $23.6 million, completing our $150 million planned purchase program. We have also announced a new share repurchase program of up to $200 million. Now turning to guidance where we will provide some color on how we're thinking about this year as well as Q1. We do not plan on updating our annual view as we progress throughout the year. For FY 2022, we expect that total revenue growth will be in the range of 14% to 15% during a continued growth of our subscription service offerings that will be a significant contributor to our overall performance. Capitalizing on the investments we made an FY 2021, we expect to grow operating income to near $90 million. Now, moving to our Q1 outlook. As visibility continues to improve and with the strength of our enterprise business and momentum of our technology platform, we are forecasting revenue will be $405 million, growing approximately 10% from last year. Consistent with our Q1 seasonality, we are forecasting an operating loss of $20 million for the quarter. And expect to generate positive operating income in the remainder of the year. In conclusion, we are pleased to end the year on a high note as our Q4 performance surpassed our expectations in the midst of continued COVD headwinds. We have confidence in our investments innovation that we believe will drive accelerated revenue growth and continued high levels of customer satisfaction while increasing share value. We are excited to build on our momentum this year, capitalizing on the tremendous opportunities that we have in front of us. We expect COVID headwinds to lessen during our second quarter. With that, I will turn it over to the operator, so we can get to your questions. Yeah, Jake, let me just add on in terms of, obviously RPO or remaining performance obligations, when you're seeing growth sequentially is really being driven by the momentum we're seeing in our subscription services principally around Pure as-a-Service and the unified subscription with CBS. We're seeing some strength as well on deferred revenue, and that's really in part due to the momentum overall. We're seeing both with our sales of our subscription services as well as increased momentum with the sales of the momentum with the sales of our integrated solutions and appliances as well. Yeah. I would just add to that Charlie, that I think it's been really gratifying to see the different types of customers that are adopting Portworx and Kubernetes. On one hand, you have literally the largestWall Street banks in the world transitioning all their applications to Kubernetes and using Portworx to build out very large shared container environment. Now, on the other hand, you have, for example, some of the largest gaming customers in the world that my kids spend probably too much time with unfortunately where every time we log on globally, they're building more and more points of presence to host those gaming sessions, totally in the cloud, all powered by Portworx. And so the diversity between large on-prem as well as totally cloud-native use cases is amazing. Yeah, Alex. This is Kevan. A couple of things that we look at share. Obviously the bookings outpacing revenue is one metric that we look at and we were at 9% year-over-year growth on sales which is outpacing revenue really in large part given the continued momentum we're seeing in our subscription services. If you break that down a bit more, we're looking at the unbilled component of RPO and the strength there. That's primarily driven by our Pure as-a-Service offering. And then deferred revenue is really supported by the continued momentum we're seeing around our Evergreen offering as well as the incremental momentum we're seeing in sales of our appliances which includes the Evergreen support as well and subscription. So that's kind of how we're thinking about it and seeing good strength in momentum across the board there. Yeah. And, Alex, we'll take a look at that as we go through this year. We do plan on having an Analyst Day this year and will land on a date and obviously we'll look at some other metrics that will give you a good read in terms of our overall subscription business. Because for me, it's far beyond just Pure as-a-Service which is great. But our Evergreen and Portworx are layered nicely into that as well obviously. And the only thing I would add to that is there are some great analysts' commentary just this last quarter about how we're a couple years off from that complete convergence. But that commentary misses the benefit of data reduction. And so today, we actually deliver the value that folks think are years away of being able to replace disk in the datacenter completely with flash. And I think it's the crystalarity of our founding vision of Pure 10 years ago to look at flash as something that would really be the dominant storage technology in the data center to deliver the all-flash datacenter. It seemed like a pipe dream 10 years ago, but those are the exact kind of deals we're doing today for customers, bringing together the strength of FlashArray, FlashBlade and FlashArray//C to go after every use case. And then, just adding then a little bit of light in terms of around our guide for Q1 and annual in correlation with the big deals that we were really pleased to see in Q4. Look, I think we've got plenty of opportunities that they were looking at and working with customers on and we're hopeful. We'll continue the pace as we progress through next year including these large deals we saw in Q4 and building on that. But when we think about the opportunity set, it's really broader as we think about next year. Subscription services continues to have great momentum and that's building for us. And then, obviously, that helps out with a little bit more certainty in terms of how that rolls out into revenue. And so, that's great for us to see. As we see build of our opportunities, we see some nice build-out further beyond Q1, which is nice in terms of our guide for the annual year. So we've got some good confidence on that. But it's broad-based and not completely focused, if you will, on the big deals which we're always pleased to get. Yeah. I'll start with that tactically and let Charlie add on to it. But I think you're thinking about that right, right? So, we're looking at probably in the Q2 timeframe really to start to see noticeable diminishing effects, if you will, of COVID. And we've built that in to how we're thinking about the entire year. And so that is playing into it. So obviously second half, we are looking for some incremental momentum in terms of how we're thinking about our annual outlook. Charlie, you have any thoughts you want to add on that? Yeah. I'll start and then I'll let Charlie jump in. But obviously what we've been chatting about is the terrific momentum of the subscription services that we've seen really throughout the entire year. We fully expect to build on that as we look out to next year. And that's really being driven by our Evergreen Subscription, by Pure as-a-Service, unified subscription with Cloud Block Store and Portworx. So, again, I'd say business as usual with continued momentum there. I think on the product side, what you've seen is some modest improvement in Q4 in terms of what -- where we're landing from that perspective. We expect to build on that. You'll see some improvement in terms of how we look at that for Q1. And then obviously, we would expect to get back to growth on product revenue as well as we go throughout the year in terms of how we're thinking about it. The growth drivers really will continue to be. Enterprise as well as FlashBlade, FlashArray//C. And then, we fully expect to Charlie's point, after or as COVID diminishes to get further recovery from our commercial business. And building upon our strengths that we saw in Q4 on net new logo. Charlie would you anything to answer that?"

            "content": "And I have to say just in terms of, Charlie, on the fuel compensation and what Dom and yourself for doing it really extends to Evergreen Gold subscription. We're really trying to make sure that the field is promoting that given the value proposition there, Pure as-a-Service, Cloud Block Store and Portworx as well and FlashBlade. So, we continue to highlight FlashBlade. We got wonderful momentum with FlashBlade and then offering new cases and that will continue as we look at the next year. Yeah. I'd just add on a little bit more in terms of obviously the momentum that we've seen this year and expect to continue next year in terms of outperformance on our subscription services, that give us a little bit more predictability in terms of how things will fall. We've got really solid growth drivers As we've talked about with FlashBlade and FlashArray/C, we do expect continued momentum with enterprise. And as Charlie mentioned, it's really looking at the commercial and midmarket recovery really second half post-COVID if you will. I would add on to that for the quarter for Q1 of last year. That would be a strong compare. Obviously, when COVID set in for us that was later in the quarter. And so we had a strong start to last quarter as well as the fact that we had some tailwinds as folks were working through some technical debt to respond to COVID. So I actually view Q1 last year as a strong compare, but it's a fair statement for the full year."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. At the conclusion of our prepared remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today\u2019s conference call, Ms. Nicole Noutsios. Noutsios, please go ahead.\nNicole Noutsios: Thank you, and good afternoon. Welcome to the Pure Storage Third Quarter Fiscal 2021 earnings call. My name is Nicole Noutsios, Investor Relations at Pure Storage. Joining me today are our CEO, Charlie Giancarlo, our CFO, Kevan Krysler, and our VP of Strategy Matt Kixmoeller. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that during this call, management will make forward-looking statements, which are all subject to various risks and uncertainties. These include statements regarding: the COVID-19 pandemic and related disruptions, our growth and sales prospects, including our Q4 outlook, competitive, industry and technology trends, our strategy and its advantages, our current and future product offerings, including Portworx, and business and operations. Any forward-looking statements that we make are based on facts and assumptions as of today, and we undertake no obligation to update them. Our actual results may differ materially from the results forecasted, and reported results should not be considered as an indication of future performance. A discussion of some of the risks and uncertainties relating to our business is contained in our filings with the SEC, and we refer you to these public filings. During this call, we will discuss non-GAAP measures in talking about the company\u2019s performance, and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are provided in our earnings press release and slides. This call is being broadcast live on the Pure Storage Investor Relations website and is being recorded for playback purposes. An archive of the webcast will be available on the IR website and is the property of Pure Storage. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to our CEO, Charlie Giancarlo.\nCharlie Giancarlo: Good afternoon and good evening everyone. Thank you for joining us on today\u2019s earnings call. As we look to the end of 2020 with relief, and look forward with high hopes for a brighter 2021, my thoughts are with all of you on this call. I hope that you, your families, colleagues and friends are all staying healthy and faring well. The challenges and the changes we\u2019ve experienced this year have been extraordinary and seem never ending, and they have certainly reset all of our expectations and assumptions. COVID has been the change agent of this decade, and we have all learned many lessons in stamina and resilience. Like you, I am excited about the many reports on the fantastic progress with vaccines and therapies created by the world\u2019s scientists, doctors, and engineers. However we all know that there will continue to be challenges due to the virus and its economic impact for months to come for all of our communities and stakeholders. Through all of the challenges that COVID created this past year, Pure has been there for our customers, delivering capacity, performance, and services that enabled our customers to cope and thrive during the crisis. I feel confident that regardless of the rate of progress in the battle against COVID, Pure and most of our customers have turned the corner on their plans and ability to operate in this new normal. I am pleased with this quarter\u2019s performance and the progress Pure has made. Growth in our global Enterprise business continues to provide me with confidence that we will exit this downturn with an accelerated opportunity. Our strategy and our vision to deliver the Modern Data Experience strongly resonates with our customers. In our first 10 years, Pure completely changed customers\u2019 expectations of what they should see from storage arrays and storage vendors. In our second decade, we are changing the expectations for hybrid cloud data and storage management. We are growing from a two-product company to offering a full, multi-cloud data services platform \u2013 increasing our relevance to both those who build infrastructure \u2013 IT, and those that build applications \u2013 namely Developers and DevOps. I am very pleased to welcome the Portworx team, now part of the Pure family! Portworx brings to Pure a Kubernetes data services platform for cloud-native applications running across container-based hybrid cloud environments. With Portworx and our existing Pure Service Orchestrator or PSO, we have expanded our industry-leading data services capabilities to both traditional and cloud-native applications and containers. We\u2019ve made good progress with the integration, and the Portworx team continues to perform well, easily beating their pre-acquisition sales plan. Our strategy with Portworx is to continue their software-defined storage, container and Kubernetes-control roadmap, and layer in Pure\u2019s capabilities with VMs and bare metal workloads; all managed through our unique, SaaS-based, Pure1 management system. Customers are looking for more complete solutions for their digital transformation. They are not specifically looking to migrate to subscriptions. They are not specifically moving to SaaS and hyperscalers because it\u2019s \u201cthe cloud.\u201d Customers are moving to services and suppliers that provide the outcomes they desire, rather than just the means for customers to create those outcomes themselves. Pure\u2019s solutions continue to evolve to enable customers to automate their data storage and management, and to deliver data management as code to their developers. And importantly, like our Purity software, Portworx is just as comfortably deployed in-cloud as on-premises, supporting a new set of customers who are born in the cloud and may never consider on-prem infrastructure. This quarter, we saw strong momentum in both existing and new Portworx customers including Eurobank, Expedient and DataScan; and I\u2019m pleased to share that we were just named a leader by GigaOm for Kubernetes Data Protection. Leading customers are choosing containers, Portworx and PSO to build and run their most strategic new initiatives. They are also choosing to use object storage for these same advanced systems, and we are benefiting from this demand in the continued strong momentum for FlashBlade. FlashBlade continues to be chosen by customers to consolidate and modernize their unstructured data across a number of uses including technical computing, analytics, and rapid recovery. Momentum with customers like First National Bankers Bank, the Louisiana Office of Technology Services, and Sinai Health System demonstrates that FlashBlade continues to be the leading choice to enable rapid recovery to defeat ransomware. We are also seeing strong interest and initial customer adoption for our recently released FlashRecover solution to modernize the entire data protection stack. This quarter, Cadence, a global leader in electronic design and computational software, selected Pure\u2019s fast file and object service through our Pure as-a-Service offering to accelerate their transition to a modern IT environment, and to automate their data services. FlashBlade\u2019s performance and ability to consolidate many workloads, combined with our consumption-based model and Service Level Guarantees, enables Cadence to increase developer productivity and accelerate their time to market. Customers like Cadence are looking to deliver outcomes to their developers. Pure\u2019s Subscription Services, which include our Evergreen and Pure as-a-Service offerings, had strong growth again this quarter. Selecting Pure as-a-Service in Q3, organizations such as ME Bank in Australia and The University of Texas Health Science Center recognize the flexibility and choice that these offerings provide. Our unified subscription in Pure-as-a-Service, which includes Cloud Block Store, enables customers to subscribe to storage both in their data center and in the cloud, paying for only what they consume, making migration to the public cloud possible at any time without worrying about stranded assets. The operational benefits of subscribing to a service managed by Pure makes their lives substantially easier. Today marks another milestone and industry first for our Pure as-a-Service offering with the announcement of the Pure Service Catalog. The new Service Catalog provides cloud-like transparency by publishing pricing for on-premises and hybrid cloud storage delivered as-a-Service \u2013 so customers can easily choose the right storage service level for each workload. Combined with Pure1\u2019s AI-driven workload planner, customers can place workloads on the right storage service tier based on intelligence derived from thousands of customer scenarios. FlashArray//C, well into its second generation, continues to grow at an accelerated pace. This month, FlashArray//C received the Best of Show Award at the Flash Memory Summit for Most Innovative Flash Memory Technology. The performance and financial efficiencies delivered by FlashArray//C enable customers to both consolidate workloads and reduce costs below that of hybrid disk arrays. The full FlashArray portfolio enables customers to address a wide range of price performance levels for both block and file workloads, all delivered by our single Purity code base. The services available under our unified subscription on prem and in the cloud are powered by the same Purity software, providing customers flexibility and consistency in how and where they want to place their applications and consume their data services. As we scale our company from a single product just four years ago, to a broad-based provider of data storage capabilities, we continue to scale our management team as well. Earlier this month, we announced Dominick Delfino as our new Chief Revenue Officer, reporting directly to me. Dominick brings fresh perspective and incredible expertise selling subscription- and consumption-based business models with software innovation at their core. He has a deep understanding for our customers\u2019 digital transformation strategies; and is well-versed in introducing new solutions into the market, working closely with customers to deliver solutions that improve their business outcomes. I\u2019m excited to welcome him as we position Pure for its next stage of growth. Navigating the ebb and flow of the COVID crisis has certainly been an exercise in flexibility and resilience for all organizations and actually all individuals worldwide. As we have stated in prior earnings calls, after a rush to solve for new, urgent and immediate needs in Q1, companies reset in Q2 to replan their digital strategies given the new environment. This past Q3, we saw customers begin to re-engage with clearer plans to drive digital transformation. As part of these new initiatives, customers have largely done away with business as usual and are looking to simplify their operations, yet provide their developers with efficient and self-service infrastructure. Pure\u2019s offerings provide the efficiency, reliability, and automation these customers are craving. And with environmental impact concerns rising in importance, Pure makes it easy for organizations to improve their sustainability initiatives with the savings in power, cooling, and electronic waste we deliver across our portfolio. Pure has made fantastic progress over the last several years to position us well for the future. We have dramatically expanded our product portfolio. We have enabled our capabilities to be run and consumed as a service. We have created a true hybrid cloud environment for enterprise workloads. And now we deliver storage solutions for cloud-native application development and deployment. Even with the uncertainties which remain in the economy from the pandemic, we are confident in our vision, our strategy, and the ability of our team to grow and scale. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to you Kevan.\nKevan Krysler: Thank you Charlie and good afternoon. We are pleased with our Q3 financial performance and execution as we continue to navigate headwinds caused by COVID-19. Our Q3 results demonstrate the value our product and subscription solutions provide to our customers. Strong sales and recurring revenue growth continues for both our Evergreen and unified Pure as-a-Service subscription offerings. Q3 total revenue was $410.6 million, down 4.2% year-over-year, slightly exceeding our expectations at the beginning of the quarter. Product revenue was $274.5 million down 15.1% year-over-year, and Subscription Services revenue totaled $136.1 million, growing 29.5% year-over-year. Subscription Services revenue during Q3 represents approximately 33% of total revenue, up from approximately 25% of total revenue during Q3 of the prior year. Subscription Services revenue includes Evergreen subscriptions, and our unified Pure as-a-Service subscription, which includes Cloud Block Store. We were pleased with the strong sales growth and demand for our Subscription Services, Flashblade and FlashArray//C offerings during the quarter. Our investments in innovation continue to drive results as both our FlashBlade platform and our second generation FlashArray//C offerings achieved their highest level of sales during the quarter. Customers, including large enterprise customers, continue to invest in our FlashBlade platform for their high-performance file and object needs, including data protection. Our remaining performance obligations, or RPO, which includes our committed and non-cancelable future revenue grew approximately 25% year-over-year, slightly exceeding $1 billion at the end of the quarter. Total deferred revenue which is included in RPO was $763 million growing 19% year-over-year. Bookings or sales during Q3, excluding cancelable orders, was generally flat declining less than 1% year-over-year. Total revenue in the United States during Q3 was $302.1 million, declining 4% year-over-year, and total international revenue was $108.5 million declining approximately 3% year-over-year. Across our full solution portfolio, we continue to acquire new customers despite the challenging environment created by COVID-19. We acquired over 316 new customers this quarter compared to 379 customers during Q3 of the prior year. Non-GAAP gross margins for product and subscription services during the quarter was 69.1% compared to 71.7% during the same quarter in the prior year. Non-GAAP product gross margin declined approximately three points year-over-year and one-half of a point sequentially. Non-GAAP product gross margins in the prior year benefited from both cost reductions caused by the unprecedented price reductions of NAND, as well as mix shift where we sold larger FlashArray systems. Non-GAAP Subscription Services gross margin increased approximately one-half of a point year-over-year and declined one point sequentially. Non-GAAP operating profit during the quarter was approximately $3.4 million, compared to $29.1 million during Q3 of the prior year. Operating expenses during the quarter have remained relatively flat year-over-year as we continue to invest in innovation and scale. Non-GAAP net income during Q3 was $1.8 million and non-GAAP net income per share was one penny. Non-GAAP net income in Q3 of the prior year was $34.2 million and non-GAAP net income per share was thirteen cents. Weighted-average shares used for the non-GAAP net earnings-per-share calculation was 284.8 million shares in Q3 and 272.2 million shares in the prior year. We are pleased to have completed the close of our acquisition of Portworx during the quarter. Our purchase of Portworx was funded through a combination of our revolving line of credit and cash. Total cash and investments at the end of Q3 is approximately $1.2 billion. During Q3 we returned $21.4 million to shareholders through share repurchases of 1.36 million shares. Approximately $23.6 million of our share repurchase authorization remains. Total headcount at the end of the quarter was approximately 3,860 employees. Now moving to our Q4 outlook. We remain confident in our strategy and execution as we navigate the impacts caused by COVID-19. Visibility of business conditions has improved, but uncertainty of the near term impacts the global resurgence of COVID may have on our business continues to exist. While we navigate the impacts of COVID we will continue to share internal expectations of our business performance, but not provide formal guidance. We are pleased to see strong sequential broad-based growth of our total product pipeline opportunity; however, we have not achieved the same levels as Q4 of the prior year. Our current internal view is that total revenues for the full fiscal year will be $1.66 billion representing approximately 1% of growth and total revenues for Q4 will be approximately $480 million, a decline of 2% year-over-year. We expect operating expenses during Q4 to increase slightly year-over-year, including a full quarter of investment for Portworx. With our current view of revenue we believe operating profit for the full year will be approximately $35 million and approximately $26 million in Q4. Overall, we are pleased with our Q3 financial performance and execution and resilience of our employees, partners, and customers. The performance, simplicity, and flexibility of our solutions are creating valuable outcomes for our customers which is further accentuated during the COVID-19 environment. Our rich portfolio of solutions including the addition of Portworx positions us for strong revenue growth, including growth of our recurring revenues. With that, we will now open the call for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Jason Ader of William Blair.\nJason Ader: Yes, hi. I wanted to know from you guys, if -do you have any sense of pent up demand going into 2021? And then any update on NAND pricing and how that\u2019s -- how that might be impacting the Street pricing?\nCharlie Giancarlo: Thank you, Jason. Good to hear your voice. We\u2019re very pleased with what we saw in terms of pick up momentum in Q3, the improvement in visibility and the fact that our customers plans seem to solidify during the quarter. All the way through the end of the quarter is a very good reason for optimism as we go forward. I don\u2019t know that I can call it pent-up demand as much as I would call it, the new. They\u2019re planning for, you know, they\u2019re planning for digital transformation, if anything are accelerated. And that\u2019s, good news for the collection and storage of data, as well as managing that data and being able to take more out of it to improve their business. And I think that is going to be - that is going to continue even after the COVID is long forgotten. And so with all of the optimism around vaccines, I think we believe that comes spring or early summer, you know, we\u2019ll start to see, you know, new buying patterns and new acceleration emerge. You know, whether that\u2019s pent up demand or whether that\u2019s based on accelerated digital transformation trends, I\u2019ll leave that up to you.\nJason Ader: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Alex Kurtz of KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nAlex Kurtz: Yeah, thanks. Can you guys hear me okay?\nCharlie Giancarlo: Absolutely, Alex.\nAlex Kurtz: Great. I hope everyone is safe and healthy. And we\u2019ll have a good Thanksgiving week here.\nCharlie Giancarlo: Indeed.\nAlex Kurtz: To Charlie, you brought in a new Head of Sales, obviously from a very strong background in software and subscription. And it\u2019s clear that, with Pure as-a-Service doing well, there\u2019s a move towards a bigger focus on this type of selling motion and licensing to your customers. So, I guess, if you could just frame up how you would talk to your sales organization and to big customers next fiscal year? Like, what\u2019s the message from here about, how you want to be selling the product, how you wanted to - how you want to be licensed? And ultimately for Kevan, like, what does this mean for revenue growth? Because obviously deferred would start to pick up. So, some big top-level question, you know, just do the best you can on those?\nCharlie Giancarlo: You bet. And well, actually, I\u2019m fully practiced because I addressed my entire sales force on this just a couple of weeks ago at our Global Leadership Summit. So, the world is changing and the world is changing from if you ask why are they going to SaaS, why are they going to the cloud? It\u2019s not because it\u2019s in the cloud, you know, it\u2019s because they\u2019re choosing to -- they were choosing services and vendors that provide them with outcomes -- better outcomes, rather than just the means for a customer to develop the outcome for themselves. You know, SaaS, if you will, if you go to a SaaS service, it actually provides a direct interface to their internal customers with a solution, rather than just providing, for example, software for the customer to implement themselves. And so, as we go forward, we are increasingly tailoring our solutions to provide those outcomes for customers. What our customers want is data management, not a device that for them to be able to create data management out of. And you see that in our Pure as-a-Service offering that we announced today, which is our Pure services catalog, where a customer now can go online, find all sorts of tools to measure and figure out what type of service categories and tiers they need for their workloads and then completely subscribe to it online. And whether it\u2019s on-prem or in the cloud, Pure takes the responsibility for delivering that to the customer, you know, as I said, of service level guarantees. So increasingly, you know, our approach is to provide customers what they need, both onprem and in the cloud, but to do so through a service offering. Now, that does generally mean migrating to more of a subscription style of sales, although the customers can get this even if they go with a CapEx purchase. But we\u2019ve been signaling for quite a while that our expectations that subscriptions would be picking up, you know, as a percentage of our sales. That has largely come out to be true. As you can tell from our announcements this quarter about the improvement in overall subscription sales. And we expect that to continue to be true. But we will manage that. We\u2019re the - forecasting that we\u2019re providing to the Street takes that into account. And so, we feel comfortable with that. And of course, we think this is a better solution for our customers. And so increasingly, our sales team wants to go where the customers are going and they feel good about the changes we\u2019re making.\nKevan Krysler: No, I\u2019ll just add a little bit to that, Charlie. Look, you know, a third of our revenue is really coming from Subscription Services to begin with. So, we\u2019ve got a great start to this transition.. Given that our Eevergreen subscription model is running at scale, the idea that we will have ramp of our Pure-as-a-Service unified subscription will have less of an impact in my mind on total revenue though there will be some impact. The other benefit that we\u2019ll see is obviously Portworx being part of our subscription revenue, and that would be incremental to our growth curve as it relates to our Subscription Services.\nAlex Kurtz: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Aaron Rakers of Wells Fargo.\nAaron Rakers: Yeah, thanks for taking the question. I want to kind of build on that last comment around subscription. I think one of the metrics that\u2019s always a little bit interesting is just the RPO balance expansion. And that delta relative to deferred revenue I think it was up about 47.5% year-over-year. Can you just remind us how much of that is the true subscription business? And was there any Portworx contribution in that number this quarter?\nKevan Krysler: Great question. And this is Kevan. Thank you, Aaron. In terms of the differential, when you look at it sequentially in the growth we\u2019re seeing sequentially between deferred revenue and RPO, that is really our Pure as-a-Service offering that\u2019s contributing to that build. And then Portworx would not have a significant contribution though there would be some contribution to RPO for Portworx.\nAaron Rakers: Okay. And just as a quick follow up, maybe you\u2019ve got one of your competitors also reporting tonight. Just curious, PowerStore been in the market for a quarter or better now. Just kind of update us on what you\u2019re seeing in the competitive landscapes as you say, the digital transformation is poised to kind of accelerate?\nCharlie Giancarlo: Yeah, I\u2019m going to underwhelm you here, Aaron. We\u2019re just not seeing power store. I mean, the little we\u2019re seeing of it is not being terribly successful. So if anything, when it\u2019s introduced to a customer, it gives us an opportunity to go in because it\u2019s always a disruptive upgrade to the customer, regardless of which of the products that they\u2019re attempting to sell or upgrade against. So, it\u2019s just not been - it\u2019s not been a big factor. Our win rates generally with Dell have been very consistent. You know, they\u2019re consistent quarter-by-quarter. I\u2019d say no, not terribly different this quarter, if anything, a little bit better. So, the power store has been largely absent. I will say that most of the time, even if they go in with power store, they quickly change their bid to power max. And that\u2019s the more typical competition for us.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Pinjalim Bora of JPMorgan.\nPinjalim Bora: Hello, thank you. Hey Charlie and Kevin. The first question, just on the pipeline, I think you said the pipeline is up, but is not as up as much as last year. But help us understand the composition of the pipeline that you\u2019re seeing last quarter. I think you\u2019ve kind of indicated that the maturity curve is towards the early stage. Has that changed at all as we head into Q4?\nKevan Krysler: Yeah, great. Great question. And absolutely. You know, when we\u2019re looking at the pipeline composition, you are right in terms of the year-over-year compare. What we are pleased with is the strength we\u2019re seeing sequentially in our build from Q3 to Q4, which gives us some confidence in terms of our internal view of our Q4 outlook. And then when we actually peel that back a little bit, we are confident to see some evolution in terms of the aging of those pipeline opportunities. As you mentioned, when we are going into Q3, we saw that, we are getting some nice build, but those were earlier stage opportunities. And as we\u2019re looking at Q4, we see a much better balance between early stage opportunities as well as advanced stage. So nice evolution in terms of what we\u2019re seeing sequentially between our Q3 and Q4 pipeline.\nPinjalim Bora: Understood. Thank you for that. And Charlie, one for you. Talking to some of your partners, we have kind of gathered with you -- that there has been a few mid-eight figures and even larger past contracts. Help us understand what\u2019s driving that. Is that transitory as companies try to preserve cash outlay right now in this environment? Or do you think it\u2019s kind of a fundamental change in hardware buying behavior?\nCharlie Giancarlo: Well, I think it\u2019s the beginning of a fundamental change. And again, I won\u2019t say, it\u2019s hardware buying behavior there. We\u2019re delivering this as a service. So, I really want to call attention to the fact that, you know, and especially with PaaS 2.0, but actually also when we first introduced PaaS, it was a lot more than just a financial construct for customers to acquire hardware. We\u2019re delivering it as a service. They have no commitment to long-term holding of the hardware. And it\u2019s a unified subscription with the same set of services, in fact, the same software in the cloud. And increasingly, every aspect of their usage, if you will, of the service will be service oriented. That is to say that, you know, it\u2019ll be fully managed. It\u2019ll scale up and scale down without disruption and without the customer getting involved in that at all. We take full responsibility for it. So, I just want to identify that it\u2019s not about acquiring hardware. It really is about subscribing to a service that just happens to be on their premises as well as in the cloud. And I do think that over time we\u2019ll see more and more of this. Absolutely.\nMatt Kixmoeller: Yeah. Just to jump in for a second, I think Charlie is really hitting on one of the key differentiators of PaaS from our competition where we\u2019re really pursuing this like a product opportunity. You know, if you look at our competitors, their offerings tend to come from their financial services groups and they\u2019re just kind of dressed up leases in a different name. We have a business unit that has engineers as the GM who\u2019s running this program. And we\u2019re thinking about how we really change the entire customer experience around and as a service experience. And so hopefully what you\u2019ve seen with the launch of the service catalog today is a good example where we\u2019re really rethinking what\u2019s the entire way a customer thinks about purchasing a service, looks at their existing workloads, and uses AI-driven modeling tools to understand the right service. And then just enjoys the same level of transparency that people have today in the public cloud around open service pricing, performance SLAs and then driving the process for getting procurement going. So really, it\u2019s the beginning of a whole new interaction with customers of Pure.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Nehal Chokshi of Northland Capital.\nNehal Chokshi: Yeah, thanks, and congrats on the strong results and strong guidance as well, in my opinion. I want to go back to the discussion of RPO especially the unbuild RPO portion, which -- it was up $16 million QoQ, which is more than the $5 million in the year ago period. So clearly on a year-over-year basis, as Aaron had alluded to, a nice acceleration. But still a step down from the $20 plus million in the past two quarters. So, is that a deceleration of the performance of the past few quarters or is there some seasonality that you\u2019re seeing with the Pure as-a-Service dignified periods of service offerings?\nCharlie Giancarlo: Nehal, really, I think this may be more of the fact that we did a large Pure as-a-Service deal this quarter and we\u2019re able to bill for the entire amount upfront. So that entire portion is actually in deferred revenue. So when we look at our Pure as-a-Service trends quarter over quarter. Actually they\u2019re very strong and we\u2019re quite pleased with those trends. What you\u2019re looking at between the unbilled portion versus deferred revenue, we do have some mix in there where we\u2019ve got some PaaS deals that are being reflected in deferred revenue because we were fortunate to bill for those upfront.\nNehal Chokshi: I see. Okay. Great. Fantastic. Congratulations.\nCharlie Giancarlo: Thanks, Nehal.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Karl Ackerman of Cowen.\nKarl Ackerman: Yes, good afternoon. Charlie, starting with you first, if I may. Your internal outlook is healthy, considering the headwinds across commercial. Are you seeing any rebound internationally, particularly in Europe, that is giving you greater confidence for the January quarter? Or are you actually seeing a sustained improvement in onprem in the U.S.? And I have a follow-up Thanks.\nCharlie Giancarlo: Yeah. So, interesting Karl. So, I think international really shows the effect of COVID on business in general. So, as you know, in Q2 we saw a real improvement in international overall as they came out of the crisis earlier than did the U.S. and we saw an uptick. In Q3 in contrast, we saw Europe in particular, but Asia -- but international in general start to go back into lockdown, you know, early late September, early October. And already we started right around the same time with little bit of latency we saw the effect on our business. So COVID really does have an effect on the local economies, whichever country it happens to hit. And it\u2019s why we\u2019re a little bit cautious for Q4. But we do believe at the same time that businesses now have become, let\u2019s say, more accustomed to operating in the COVID environment. And therefore, they\u2019re more robust in terms of pursuing their IT and digital transformation plans. So we don\u2019t expect the kind of turn down that we saw in Q2. Even with our cautious optimism, we feel that --we feel confident in what -- how we\u2019re looking at Q4 right now. But clearly, I think once, the same effect that we saw in Europe when they came out of the crisis in the spring gives us confidence for this spring, especially, let\u2019s say around the spring to summer of this year. And then with vaccines, we think that\u2019ll be a longer-term phenomenon. So we\u2019re very much looking forward to the future, but we do believe the next few months are reasons to be a bit more cautious.\nKarl Ackerman: Yeah. Understood. Appreciate that. For Kevan, it\u2019s quite apparent that your recent acquisition and expansion of as a service offering today underscore your desire to increasingly shift your portfolio toward a recurring revenue model. How does that impact OpEx growth in 2021 over the next couple of quarters? When we think about that, will 2021 be characterized by an investment year in sales and marketing? You know, I guess we\u2019ve modified our sales approach. But how do we think about the ability to get leverage on the OpEx side, because it\u2019s really, I think, a great initiative. But if we could think about that from an OpEx side, that would be helpful. Thank you.\nKevan Krysler: Yeah. Thanks Karl. When I think about our operating margin leverage potential, even with the transition to increasing Pure as-a-Service and our subscription offerings, both are very achievable and we\u2019re planning on that as we look out to next year. I think we\u2019re making some great efforts across the board to leverage our investments, especially this year as we kind of invested ahead of the growth curve, if you will, going into next year. So, I\u2019m looking to actually improve operating margin and profitability even when considering growth in our subscription offerings.\nOperator: Your next question from Mehdi Hosseini of SIG.\nMehdi Hosseini: Thanks for taking my questions. I have two follow-ups. When we go to your presentation with slides, specifically slide 5 and 6, obviously the number of new customer addition has declined on a year-over-year basis. But what is interesting, the revenue mix is shifting. And I just want to get some clarification. Is that just driven by the change in the customer type, more driven by app developers and if that was probably more better project, especially impacting the subscription services. Is that the right way of thinking about on a year-over-year basis?\nKevan Krysler: Well, I\u2019ll take that first, Charlie and then feel free to add on. I mean, when we think about our new customers, our new customers will either purchase our Pure as-a-Service offering, which would contribute to our subscription services, or they\u2019ll purchase our integrated appliance that comes with our Evergreen subscription. And so that will play into it as well. But we\u2019re also getting a significant amount of momentum with customers who are continuing to invest in the Evergreen subscriptions from a renewal standpoint. And that momentum is really coming from our existing customers. And so that hopefully would answer that question specific to the mix occurring.\nCharlie Giancarlo: Well, let me also answer, in terms of the mix of new customers overall and as you point out, a decline in year-over-year. First of all, I have to say that given the COVID environment, we\u2019re pretty pleased with the number of new customers we\u2019ve been able to gain because in the COVID environment, clearly, incumbents tend to have a bit of an advantage as new customers are just more -- as customers are more cautious about considering changes to their existing environment. That being said, if you were to break down the new customers or the net new logos, what you\u2019d find out is, a good growth as a percentage in enterprise and of course, lower net new logos in commercial. And simply again, because commercial is under pressure worldwide much more so than enterprises, you know, in terms of numbers from the Corona environment. So, again, our expectation is that when the Corona pandemic abates, hopefully by spring, we should see a good pick up in this.\nKevan Krysler: Yeah, thanks, Charlie. But the momentum when we think about recurring revenues will be driven probably more from our existing customer base as well.\nCharlie Giancarlo: Much more from the existing customer base. Yeah\nMehdi Hosseini: Now, one quick follow up, more of a housekeeping item. When I -- looking at the product revenue, as we look into next fiscal year and the increased availability of QLC NAND, is that going to have a positive impact on product margin or would you prefer passing that along to customers to increase market share?\nCharlie Giancarlo: Yeah, let me take a try. I think it\u2019s a little bit early for us to be able to opine with great confidence on that. But I suppose my belief is that, we\u2019re utilizing QLC first and primarily to penetrate into new markets, you know, in the disk space and therefore, disk economics are the ones that were competing with in that environment. And as such, I would expect margins to be consistent with our overall company margins rather than to be used strictly as an enhancement. I think over the long term it may improve overall product margin. But in the short term, I expect that it will be utilizing it to penetrate into that market.\nMatt Kixmoeller: And I\u2019d also say that, your question somewhat implied that our QLC product was being limited by availability of NAND, and that\u2019s not the case. You know, we\u2019re in a second generation of that product being GI now. We\u2019ve now shipped the largest QLC flash module in the industry, our 48-terabyte module. And so, we\u2019re in a really great place from a supply point of view to supply that product. And we believe it\u2019s really differentiated in the market.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Simon Leopold of Raymond James.\nSimon Leopold: Thanks for taking the question. First thing I wanted to ask a little bit more about this announcement you\u2019ve made today about publishing the service catalog. I guess, I\u2019m trying to think about the potential consequences. One scenario might suggest this could trigger price wars responses from your competitors. On the other hand, I could imagine maybe this leads to less discounting by you, given that you\u2019re putting prices out in print for your customers. Just wondering how you think about the various scenarios or outcomes from this action you\u2019ve taken.\nMatt Kixmoeller: I\u2019ll take the first stab at that. Look, I guess the first thing here is, we\u2019re doing this because it\u2019s something customers demand and increasingly customers want to self-qualify research solutions on their own. Do someone understand relative pricing and then contact a sales rep or a channel partner when they\u2019re much further along in the buying process. And so, this is, from a Pure point of view, is all about really upping our digital go to market chops and being able to sell how customers want to buy much more in this cloud model. In the case of the service catalog, what we publish in there are MSRP prices. And so, customer can get a discount obviously by coming to Pure and working through our channel programs and that\u2019s not published. So, there\u2019s still some, you know, room for negotiation in there. But you know, what the service catalog does do is, it allows them to very openly see what the different services are or see what the performance levels are, so they can make a good choice around. Okay, is it worth a 2x increase in spend in order to get a certain amount of increase in performance? And indeed, if you look at the new service tiers that we\u2019ve introduced, we now offer a 10x range in pricing for a 20x range of performance. And so, there\u2019s quite a range of services and customers have the right service level for every work load in their environment.\nSimon Leopold: That\u2019s very helpful and just maybe as a follow up, I think earlier in the Q&A, you talked about customers adjusting to this new normal. So even as we aren\u2019t fully backed and don\u2019t have a vaccine widely available yet, your customers are adjusting to how they do business. With that in mind, do you think that your next quarter, basically, as we turn it to next year, you might defy normal seasonality, that we might have a more muted sequential decline as your customers are sort of catching up to business that they didn\u2019t do during the pandemic\u2019s worst period? Thank you.\nCharlie Giancarlo: Well, it\u2019s an interesting question. Look, we\u2019re not epidemiologists here, but I think it\u2019s fair to say that our expectation would be that COVID will be with us through the early spring and then hopefully start to abate at that point in time. And I would expect to see then, a return to growth economically across the world. That\u2019s what we\u2019re planning on right around that time and then get back to, you know, so that might suggest greater seasonality next year, simply because the beginning of the year might be a little bit more muted than the end of the year. But from that point going forward, I would expect to start to get back to, you know, our normal seasonality.\nKevan Krysler: What I was pleased to see is a couple of things. I was pleased to see overperformance in Q3, followed by what we\u2019re seeing currently is sequential strength going from Q3 to Q4. And I think those are positive, actually, because I think the COVID resurgence. Back to your point, Simon, in terms of folks knowing how to sell in this new environment, customers being more comfortable purchasing, I think, will help mitigate this resurgence we\u2019re seeing globally. And then we just need to see how Q4 performance evolves throughout the quarter. But look, we\u2019re really confident in our growth drivers, especially with what we saw in Q3 in terms of our Subscription Services, FlashBlade performance and FlashArray//C. So, it\u2019s coming together for us. COVID certainly creates uncertainty. And to Charlie\u2019s point, we do expect that to continue in Q1. We\u2019re going in the right direction.\nOperator: And your next question comes from Tim Long of Barclays.\nTim Long: Thank you. Yes, just two, if I could as well. Just wanted to follow up on FlashArray//C. Just curious what you kind of learned from Gen 1 to Gen 2 of that product, maybe just, win rates, deal sizes, new applications, what are you seeing as that product evolves? And then second, Charlie, if you could just give us, it sounded like Enterprise was pretty strong. Could you just give us a little color around small-medium businesses and what you think it\u2019s going to take to see a better rebound from that customer group? Thank you.\nCharlie Giancarlo: Yeah, well, let me give it a shot. In terms of the -- let me start with the second one first, which is that commercial as we I think as other companies have identified as well, the mid-market and small medium have as a group have been harder hit by the COVID crisis than large enterprise. And perhaps because they were not quite as ready to operate entirely online as were many of the large enterprises that had already invested in it. So I think it\u2019s just a generally stronger economy overall will help that. As you can see, it\u2019s not completely disappeared. The net new logos indicates by us, you know, indicates that there is still a healthy commercial market, but it\u2019s far muted from, you know, from pre-COVID days overall. And I\u2019m sorry, remind me the first part of the question. But I think the main thing is that with FlashArray//C, with its primary target being the secondary tier market and disk economics, the additional pricing flexibility that it gave us to go after the disk market when we were able to introduce true QLC, has made a big difference and allowed the very fast, early momentum allowed that to continue.\nMatt Kixmoeller: Yeah, I guess selling of that is that it just hasn\u2019t been the type of product that\u2019s been very hard to sell in terms of going and finding very focused use cases. It turns out customers run disk-based arrays for a wide range of use cases. And so really the easiest way to go to market with it is just to go to a customer who\u2019s already bought in and understood the benefits of flash at the high end of their application space. And ask them are they still running disk array, and work with them to say, look, if we can actually sell you an old FlashArray that brings the simplicity and performance of flash, and it\u2019s actually 30% less expensive than a disk, why do we need disk still?\nOperator: Your next question comes from Eric Martinuzzi of Lake Street.\nEric Martinuzzi: I wanted to pick apart the pipeline a little bit by vertical. I would assume the strength that you\u2019ve seen, at least sequentially, is that from the -- this would have been more resilient verticals, financial services, healthcare, government, any green shoots in some of the other more COVID exposed verticals, you know, your transportation, hospitality, entertainment, that sort of thing?\nCharlie Giancarlo: You know, Eric, I would not call out any of the more affected verticals right now as -- from our point of view, showing green shoots. I would say that we were less exposed to those industries to begin with. But no, we\u2019ve not. I can\u2019t say that. But we\u2019ve seen some significant changes in the - in how they\u2019re faring at least from buying signals to us over the last couple of quarters.\nKevan Krysler: Yeah, I would add on that. The enterprise strength, it was across many of our verticals and that was broad based and it was global. So that was kind of a new green shoot for us in terms of what we were looking at. We\u2019ve had resilience across the board on Enterprise, but the broad-based growth we saw in Enterprise was actually pleasing for us.\nEric Martinuzzi: Okay. And that was echoed in the pipeline as well?\nCharlie Giancarlo: Correct.\nEric Martinuzzi: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Katy Huberty of Morgan Stanley.\nKaty Huberty: Thank you. Good afternoon. Kevan, what\u2019s the revenue contribution from Portworx that\u2019s embedded in your fourth quarter internal model? And then, Charlie, can you provide a bit more color on Paul\u2019s decision to step down as COO? And are there any other changes or hires that you\u2019re planning to make on the back of his departure? Thanks.\nKevan Krysler: I\u2019ll hit the Portworx first, Katy. We\u2019re super excited with the strategic acquisition. Revenue is actually pretty small in terms of contribution as we look out into Q4. We\u2019ll probably see that start to build in RPO and deferred revenue before that starts making its way in any significant or meaningful way to revenue. Charlie, you want to hit, Paul?\nCharlie Giancarlo: Thank you, Katy. Yeah, I want to thank Paul for his contributions to the company over the past year or so that he\u2019s been here. And he\u2019s really brought a lot of structure to our operations at the company and contributed a lot and also was part of recruiting Dominick to the company. In conversations with Paul as we were recruiting Dominick, Paul started to feel and I had to agree that Dominick was going to bring a lot of capabilities into the into the Chief Revenue Officer role that Paul had been handling. I and Paul felt that look, given Dominick coming on board and given the accession of, you know, Jason Rose as Chief Marketing Officer and so forth, that we really had, now a strong operating cadence. And that Paul\u2019s role as Chief Operating Officer was not really required at the company. And that he had a number of opportunities that he could go pursue. And so maybe it was better to make that change. And so, we agreed with that. Paul is going to continue with us through the end of the quarter to ensure a smooth acquisition with Dominick and then move on. I do want to thank Paul for what he has contributed. And while I have this moment, I want to thank Kady as well for his leadership of the salesforce over the last three years on a global basis. Kady has gotten us - he has over his period of time leading the salesforce we\u2019ve doubled almost every aspect of our company, the revenue, the size of the company, the size of the salesforce, et cetera. And he\u2019s done a great job. Bringing Dom on board really signals the fact that we\u2019re changing as a company, having now moved from a single product to two product to now a full portfolio, both in the cloud and onprem and increasingly moving to subscription. And Dominick brings the right type of background for this next step in our journey. And so we\u2019re very pleased with that overall.\nKaty Huberty: Thank you for that color.\nOperator: And this concludes the question-and-answer. At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Charlie Giancarlo for closing remarks.\nCharlie Giancarlo: Thank you. In closing, I\u2019d like to thank all of our employees, our customers, our partners, and for all of you on the call for your hard work and dedication to our mission. It\u2019s been a wild year and it\u2019s not over yet. I\u2019m looking forward to working with all of you to build a much better 2021. Thank you for joining us today. And stay safe and please have a very happy Thanksgiving to all of you. I know, we all need the rest. Please take time with family and look forward to engaging with you in the future. Take care.",

            "name": "Charlie Giancarlo",
            "content": "Good afternoon and good evening everyone. Thank you for joining us on today's earnings call. As we look to the end of 2020 with relief, and look forward with high hopes for a brighter 2021, my thoughts are with all of you on this call. I hope that you, your families, colleagues and friends are all staying healthy and faring well. The challenges and the changes we've experienced this year have been extraordinary and seem never ending, and they have certainly reset all of our expectations and assumptions. COVID has been the change agent of this decade, and we have all learned many lessons in stamina and resilience. Like you, I am excited about the many reports on the fantastic progress with vaccines and therapies created by the world's scientists, doctors, and engineers. However we all know that there will continue to be challenges due to the virus and its economic impact for months to come for all of our communities and stakeholders. Through all of the challenges that COVID created this past year, Pure has been there for our customers, delivering capacity, performance, and services that enabled our customers to cope and thrive during the crisis. I feel confident that regardless of the rate of progress in the battle against COVID, Pure and most of our customers have turned the corner on their plans and ability to operate in this new normal. I am pleased with this quarter's performance and the progress Pure has made. Growth in our global Enterprise business continues to provide me with confidence that we will exit this downturn with an accelerated opportunity. Our strategy and our vision to deliver the Modern Data Experience strongly resonates with our customers. In our first 10 years, Pure completely changed customers' expectations of what they should see from storage arrays and storage vendors. In our second decade, we are changing the expectations for hybrid cloud data and storage management. We are growing from a two-product company to offering a full, multi-cloud data services platform \u2013 increasing our relevance to both those who build infrastructure \u2013 IT, and those that build applications \u2013 namely Developers and DevOps. I am very pleased to welcome the Portworx team, now part of the Pure family! Portworx brings to Pure a Kubernetes data services platform for cloud-native applications running across container-based hybrid cloud environments. With Portworx and our existing Pure Service Orchestrator or PSO, we have expanded our industry-leading data services capabilities to both traditional and cloud-native applications and containers. We've made good progress with the integration, and the Portworx team continues to perform well, easily beating their pre-acquisition sales plan. Our strategy with Portworx is to continue their software-defined storage, container and Kubernetes-control roadmap, and layer in Pure's capabilities with VMs and bare metal workloads; all managed through our unique, SaaS-based, Pure1 management system. Customers are looking for more complete solutions for their digital transformation. They are not specifically looking to migrate to subscriptions. They are not specifically moving to SaaS and hyperscalers because it's \u201cthe cloud.\u201d Customers are moving to services and suppliers that provide the outcomes they desire, rather than just the means for customers to create those outcomes themselves. Pure's solutions continue to evolve to enable customers to automate their data storage and management, and to deliver data management as code to their developers. And importantly, like our Purity software, Portworx is just as comfortably deployed in-cloud as on-premises, supporting a new set of customers who are born in the cloud and may never consider on-prem infrastructure. This quarter, we saw strong momentum in both existing and new Portworx customers including Eurobank, Expedient and DataScan; and I'm pleased to share that we were just named a leader by GigaOm for Kubernetes Data Protection. Leading customers are choosing containers, Portworx and PSO to build and run their most strategic new initiatives. They are also choosing to use object storage for these same advanced systems, and we are benefiting from this demand in the continued strong momentum for FlashBlade. FlashBlade continues to be chosen by customers to consolidate and modernize their unstructured data across a number of uses including technical computing, analytics, and rapid recovery. Momentum with customers like First National Bankers Bank, the Louisiana Office of Technology Services, and Sinai Health System demonstrates that FlashBlade continues to be the leading choice to enable rapid recovery to defeat ransomware. We are also seeing strong interest and initial customer adoption for our recently released FlashRecover solution to modernize the entire data protection stack. This quarter, Cadence, a global leader in electronic design and computational software, selected Pure's fast file and object service through our Pure as-a-Service offering to accelerate their transition to a modern IT environment, and to automate their data services. FlashBlade's performance and ability to consolidate many workloads, combined with our consumption-based model and Service Level Guarantees, enables Cadence to increase developer productivity and accelerate their time to market. Customers like Cadence are looking to deliver outcomes to their developers. Pure's Subscription Services, which include our Evergreen and Pure as-a-Service offerings, had strong growth again this quarter. Selecting Pure as-a-Service in Q3, organizations such as ME Bank in Australia and The University of Texas Health Science Center recognize the flexibility and choice that these offerings provide. Our unified subscription in Pure-as-a-Service, which includes Cloud Block Store, enables customers to subscribe to storage both in their data center and in the cloud, paying for only what they consume, making migration to the public cloud possible at any time without worrying about stranded assets. The operational benefits of subscribing to a service managed by Pure makes their lives substantially easier. Today marks another milestone and industry first for our Pure as-a-Service offering with the announcement of the Pure Service Catalog. The new Service Catalog provides cloud-like transparency by publishing pricing for on-premises and hybrid cloud storage delivered as-a-Service \u2013 so customers can easily choose the right storage service level for each workload. Combined with Pure1's AI-driven workload planner, customers can place workloads on the right storage service tier based on intelligence derived from thousands of customer scenarios. FlashArray//C, well into its second generation, continues to grow at an accelerated pace. This month, FlashArray//C received the Best of Show Award at the Flash Memory Summit for Most Innovative Flash Memory Technology. The performance and financial efficiencies delivered by FlashArray//C enable customers to both consolidate workloads and reduce costs below that of hybrid disk arrays. The full FlashArray portfolio enables customers to address a wide range of price performance levels for both block and file workloads, all delivered by our single Purity code base. The services available under our unified subscription on prem and in the cloud are powered by the same Purity software, providing customers flexibility and consistency in how and where they want to place their applications and consume their data services. As we scale our company from a single product just four years ago, to a broad-based provider of data storage capabilities, we continue to scale our management team as well. Earlier this month, we announced Dominick Delfino as our new Chief Revenue Officer, reporting directly to me. Dominick brings fresh perspective and incredible expertise selling subscription- and consumption-based business models with software innovation at their core. He has a deep understanding for our customers' digital transformation strategies; and is well-versed in introducing new solutions into the market, working closely with customers to deliver solutions that improve their business outcomes. I'm excited to welcome him as we position Pure for its next stage of growth. Navigating the ebb and flow of the COVID crisis has certainly been an exercise in flexibility and resilience for all organizations and actually all individuals worldwide. As we have stated in prior earnings calls, after a rush to solve for new, urgent and immediate needs in Q1, companies reset in Q2 to replan their digital strategies given the new environment. This past Q3, we saw customers begin to re-engage with clearer plans to drive digital transformation. As part of these new initiatives, customers have largely done away with business as usual and are looking to simplify their operations, yet provide their developers with efficient and self-service infrastructure. Pure's offerings provide the efficiency, reliability, and automation these customers are craving. And with environmental impact concerns rising in importance, Pure makes it easy for organizations to improve their sustainability initiatives with the savings in power, cooling, and electronic waste we deliver across our portfolio. Pure has made fantastic progress over the last several years to position us well for the future. We have dramatically expanded our product portfolio. We have enabled our capabilities to be run and consumed as a service. We have created a true hybrid cloud environment for enterprise workloads. And now we deliver storage solutions for cloud-native application development and deployment. Even with the uncertainties which remain in the economy from the pandemic, we are confident in our vision, our strategy, and the ability of our team to grow and scale. With that, I'll turn it over to you Kevan. Thank you, Jason. Good to hear your voice. We're very pleased with what we saw in terms of pick up momentum in Q3, the improvement in visibility and the fact that our customers plans seem to solidify during the quarter. All the way through the end of the quarter is a very good reason for optimism as we go forward. I don't know that I can call it pent-up demand as much as I would call it, the new. They're planning for, you know, they're planning for digital transformation, if anything are accelerated. And that's, good news for the collection and storage of data, as well as managing that data and being able to take more out of it to improve their business. And I think that is going to be - that is going to continue even after the COVID is long forgotten. And so with all of the optimism around vaccines, I think we believe that comes spring or early summer, you know, we'll start to see, you know, new buying patterns and new acceleration emerge. You know, whether that's pent up demand or whether that's based on accelerated digital transformation trends, I'll leave that up to you. Absolutely, Alex. Indeed. You bet. And well, actually, I'm fully practiced because I addressed my entire sales force on this just a couple of weeks ago at our Global Leadership Summit. So, the world is changing and the world is changing from if you ask why are they going to SaaS, why are they going to the cloud? It's not because it's in the cloud, you know, it's because they're choosing to -- they were choosing services and vendors that provide them with outcomes -- better outcomes, rather than just the means for a customer to develop the outcome for themselves. You know, SaaS, if you will, if you go to a SaaS service, it actually provides a direct interface to their internal customers with a solution, rather than just providing, for example, software for the customer to implement themselves. And so, as we go forward, we are increasingly tailoring our solutions to provide those outcomes for customers. What our customers want is data management, not a device that for them to be able to create data management out of. And you see that in our Pure as-a-Service offering that we announced today, which is our Pure services catalog, where a customer now can go online, find all sorts of tools to measure and figure out what type of service categories and tiers they need for their workloads and then completely subscribe to it online. And whether it's on-prem or in the cloud, Pure takes the responsibility for delivering that to the customer, you know, as I said, of service level guarantees. So increasingly, you know, our approach is to provide customers what they need, both onprem and in the cloud, but to do so through a service offering. Now, that does generally mean migrating to more of a subscription style of sales, although the customers can get this even if they go with a CapEx purchase. But we've been signaling for quite a while that our expectations that subscriptions would be picking up, you know, as a percentage of our sales. That has largely come out to be true. As you can tell from our announcements this quarter about the improvement in overall subscription sales. And we expect that to continue to be true. But we will manage that. We're the - forecasting that we're providing to the Street takes that into account. And so, we feel comfortable with that. And of course, we think this is a better solution for our customers. And so increasingly, our sales team wants to go where the customers are going and they feel good about the changes we're making. Yeah, I'm going to underwhelm you here, Aaron. We're just not seeing power store. I mean, the little we're seeing of it is not being terribly successful. So if anything, when it's introduced to a customer, it gives us an opportunity to go in because it's always a disruptive upgrade to the customer, regardless of which of the products that they're attempting to sell or upgrade against. So, it's just not been - it's not been a big factor. Our win rates generally with Dell have been very consistent. You know, they're consistent quarter-by-quarter. I'd say no, not terribly different this quarter, if anything, a little bit better. So, the power store has been largely absent. I will say that most of the time, even if they go in with power store, they quickly change their bid to power max. And that's the more typical competition for us. Well, I think it's the beginning of a fundamental change. And again, I won't say, it's hardware buying behavior there. We're delivering this as a service. So, I really want to call attention to the fact that, you know, and especially with PaaS 2.0, but actually also when we first introduced PaaS, it was a lot more than just a financial construct for customers to acquire hardware. We're delivering it as a service. They have no commitment to long-term holding of the hardware. And it's a unified subscription with the same set of services, in fact, the same software in the cloud. And increasingly, every aspect of their usage, if you will, of the service will be service oriented. That is to say that, you know, it'll be fully managed. It'll scale up and scale down without disruption and without the customer getting involved in that at all. We take full responsibility for it. So, I just want to identify that it's not about acquiring hardware. It really is about subscribing to a service that just happens to be on their premises as well as in the cloud. And I do think that over time we'll see more and more of this. Absolutely. Nehal, really, I think this may be more of the fact that we did a large Pure as-a-Service deal this quarter and we're able to bill for the entire amount upfront. So that entire portion is actually in deferred revenue. So when we look at our Pure as-a-Service trends quarter over quarter. Actually they're very strong and we're quite pleased with those trends. What you're looking at between the unbilled portion versus deferred revenue, we do have some mix in there where we've got some PaaS deals that are being reflected in deferred revenue because we were fortunate to bill for those upfront. Thanks, Nehal. Yeah. So, interesting Karl. So, I think international really shows the effect of COVID on business in general. So, as you know, in Q2 we saw a real improvement in international overall as they came out of the crisis earlier than did the U.S. and we saw an uptick. In Q3 in contrast, we saw Europe in particular, but Asia -- but international in general start to go back into lockdown, you know, early late September, early October. And already we started right around the same time with little bit of latency we saw the effect on our business. So COVID really does have an effect on the local economies, whichever country it happens to hit. And it's why we're a little bit cautious for Q4. But we do believe at the same time that businesses now have become, let's say, more accustomed to operating in the COVID environment. And therefore, they're more robust in terms of pursuing their IT and digital transformation plans. So we don't expect the kind of turn down that we saw in Q2. Even with our cautious optimism, we feel that --we feel confident in what -- how we're looking at Q4 right now. But clearly, I think once, the same effect that we saw in Europe when they came out of the crisis in the spring gives us confidence for this spring, especially, let's say around the spring to summer of this year. And then with vaccines, we think that'll be a longer-term phenomenon. So we're very much looking forward to the future, but we do believe the next few months are reasons to be a bit more cautious. Well, let me also answer, in terms of the mix of new customers overall and as you point out, a decline in year-over-year. First of all, I have to say that given the COVID environment, we're pretty pleased with the number of new customers we've been able to gain because in the COVID environment, clearly, incumbents tend to have a bit of an advantage as new customers are just more -- as customers are more cautious about considering changes to their existing environment. That being said, if you were to break down the new customers or the net new logos, what you'd find out is, a good growth as a percentage in enterprise and of course, lower net new logos in commercial. And simply again, because commercial is under pressure worldwide much more so than enterprises, you know, in terms of numbers from the Corona environment. So, again, our expectation is that when the Corona pandemic abates, hopefully by spring, we should see a good pick up in this. Much more from the existing customer base. Yeah Yeah, let me take a try. I think it's a little bit early for us to be able to opine with great confidence on that. But I suppose my belief is that, we're utilizing QLC first and primarily to penetrate into new markets, you know, in the disk space and therefore, disk economics are the ones that were competing with in that environment. And as such, I would expect margins to be consistent with our overall company margins rather than to be used strictly as an enhancement. I think over the long term it may improve overall product margin. But in the short term, I expect that it will be utilizing it to penetrate into that market. Well, it's an interesting question. Look, we're not epidemiologists here, but I think it's fair to say that our expectation would be that COVID will be with us through the early spring and then hopefully start to abate at that point in time. And I would expect to see then, a return to growth economically across the world. That's what we're planning on right around that time and then get back to, you know, so that might suggest greater seasonality next year, simply because the beginning of the year might be a little bit more muted than the end of the year. But from that point going forward, I would expect to start to get back to, you know, our normal seasonality. Yeah, well, let me give it a shot. In terms of the -- let me start with the second one first, which is that commercial as we I think as other companies have identified as well, the mid-market and small medium have as a group have been harder hit by the COVID crisis than large enterprise. And perhaps because they were not quite as ready to operate entirely online as were many of the large enterprises that had already invested in it. So I think it's just a generally stronger economy overall will help that. As you can see, it's not completely disappeared. The net new logos indicates by us, you know, indicates that there is still a healthy commercial market, but it's far muted from, you know, from pre-COVID days overall. And I'm sorry, remind me the first part of the question. But I think the main thing is that with FlashArray//C, with its primary target being the secondary tier market and disk economics, the additional pricing flexibility that it gave us to go after the disk market when we were able to introduce true QLC, has made a big difference and allowed the very fast, early momentum allowed that to continue. You know, Eric, I would not call out any of the more affected verticals right now as -- from our point of view, showing green shoots. I would say that we were less exposed to those industries to begin with. But no, we've not. I can't say that. But we've seen some significant changes in the - in how they're faring at least from buying signals to us over the last couple of quarters. Correct. Thank you, Katy. Yeah, I want to thank Paul for his contributions to the company over the past year or so that he's been here. And he's really brought a lot of structure to our operations at the company and contributed a lot and also was part of recruiting Dominick to the company. In conversations with Paul as we were recruiting Dominick, Paul started to feel and I had to agree that Dominick was going to bring a lot of capabilities into the into the Chief Revenue Officer role that Paul had been handling. I and Paul felt that look, given Dominick coming on board and given the accession of, you know, Jason Rose as Chief Marketing Officer and so forth, that we really had, now a strong operating cadence. And that Paul's role as Chief Operating Officer was not really required at the company. And that he had a number of opportunities that he could go pursue. And so maybe it was better to make that change. And so, we agreed with that. Paul is going to continue with us through the end of the quarter to ensure a smooth acquisition with Dominick and then move on. I do want to thank Paul for what he has contributed. And while I have this moment, I want to thank Kady as well for his leadership of the salesforce over the last three years on a global basis. Kady has gotten us - he has over his period of time leading the salesforce we've doubled almost every aspect of our company, the revenue, the size of the company, the size of the salesforce, et cetera.

It's been a wild year and it's not over yet. I'm looking forward to working with all of you to build a much better 2021. Thank you for joining us today.

            "name": "Kevan Krysler",
            "content": "Thank you Charlie and good afternoon. We are pleased with our Q3 financial performance and execution as we continue to navigate headwinds caused by COVID-19. Our Q3 results demonstrate the value our product and subscription solutions provide to our customers. Strong sales and recurring revenue growth continues for both our Evergreen and unified Pure as-a-Service subscription offerings. Q3 total revenue was $410.6 million, down 4.2% year-over-year, slightly exceeding our expectations at the beginning of the quarter. Product revenue was $274.5 million down 15.1% year-over-year, and Subscription Services revenue totaled $136.1 million, growing 29.5% year-over-year. Subscription Services revenue during Q3 represents approximately 33% of total revenue, up from approximately 25% of total revenue during Q3 of the prior year. Subscription Services revenue includes Evergreen subscriptions, and our unified Pure as-a-Service subscription, which includes Cloud Block Store. We were pleased with the strong sales growth and demand for our Subscription Services, Flashblade and FlashArray//C offerings during the quarter. Our investments in innovation continue to drive results as both our FlashBlade platform and our second generation FlashArray//C offerings achieved their highest level of sales during the quarter. Customers, including large enterprise customers, continue to invest in our FlashBlade platform for their high-performance file and object needs, including data protection. Our remaining performance obligations, or RPO, which includes our committed and non-cancelable future revenue grew approximately 25% year-over-year, slightly exceeding $1 billion at the end of the quarter. Total deferred revenue which is included in RPO was $763 million growing 19% year-over-year. Bookings or sales during Q3, excluding cancelable orders, was generally flat declining less than 1% year-over-year. Total revenue in the United States during Q3 was $302.1 million, declining 4% year-over-year, and total international revenue was $108.5 million declining approximately 3% year-over-year. Across our full solution portfolio, we continue to acquire new customers despite the challenging environment created by COVID-19. We acquired over 316 new customers this quarter compared to 379 customers during Q3 of the prior year. Non-GAAP gross margins for product and subscription services during the quarter was 69.1% compared to 71.7% during the same quarter in the prior year. Non-GAAP product gross margin declined approximately three points year-over-year and one-half of a point sequentially. Non-GAAP product gross margins in the prior year benefited from both cost reductions caused by the unprecedented price reductions of NAND, as well as mix shift where we sold larger FlashArray systems. Non-GAAP Subscription Services gross margin increased approximately one-half of a point year-over-year and declined one point sequentially. Non-GAAP operating profit during the quarter was approximately $3.4 million, compared to $29.1 million during Q3 of the prior year. Operating expenses during the quarter have remained relatively flat year-over-year as we continue to invest in innovation and scale. Non-GAAP net income during Q3 was $1.8 million and non-GAAP net income per share was one penny. Non-GAAP net income in Q3 of the prior year was $34.2 million and non-GAAP net income per share was thirteen cents. Weighted-average shares used for the non-GAAP net earnings-per-share calculation was 284.8 million shares in Q3 and 272.2 million shares in the prior year. We are pleased to have completed the close of our acquisition of Portworx during the quarter. Our purchase of Portworx was funded through a combination of our revolving line of credit and cash. Total cash and investments at the end of Q3 is approximately $1.2 billion. During Q3 we returned $21.4 million to shareholders through share repurchases of 1.36 million shares. Approximately $23.6 million of our share repurchase authorization remains. Total headcount at the end of the quarter was approximately 3,860 employees. Now moving to our Q4 outlook. We remain confident in our strategy and execution as we navigate the impacts caused by COVID-19. Visibility of business conditions has improved, but uncertainty of the near term impacts the global resurgence of COVID may have on our business continues to exist. While we navigate the impacts of COVID we will continue to share internal expectations of our business performance, but not provide formal guidance. We are pleased to see strong sequential broad-based growth of our total product pipeline opportunity; however, we have not achieved the same levels as Q4 of the prior year. Our current internal view is that total revenues for the full fiscal year will be $1.66 billion representing approximately 1% of growth and total revenues for Q4 will be approximately $480 million, a decline of 2% year-over-year. We expect operating expenses during Q4 to increase slightly year-over-year, including a full quarter of investment for Portworx. With our current view of revenue we believe operating profit for the full year will be approximately $35 million and approximately $26 million in Q4. Overall, we are pleased with our Q3 financial performance and execution and resilience of our employees, partners, and customers. The performance, simplicity, and flexibility of our solutions are creating valuable outcomes for our customers which is further accentuated during the COVID-19 environment. Our rich portfolio of solutions including the addition of Portworx positions us for strong revenue growth, including growth of our recurring revenues. With that, we will now open the call for questions. No, I'll just add a little bit to that, Charlie. Look, you know, a third of our revenue is really coming from Subscription Services to begin with. So, we've got a great start to this transition.. Given that our Eevergreen subscription model is running at scale, the idea that we will have ramp of our Pure-as-a-Service unified subscription will have less of an impact in my mind on total revenue though there will be some impact. The other benefit that we'll see is obviously Portworx being part of our subscription revenue, and that would be incremental to our growth curve as it relates to our Subscription Services. Great question. And this is Kevan. Thank you, Aaron. In terms of the differential, when you look at it sequentially in the growth we're seeing sequentially between deferred revenue and RPO, that is really our Pure as-a-Service offering that's contributing to that build. And then Portworx would not have a significant contribution though there would be some contribution to RPO for Portworx. Yeah, great. Great question. And absolutely. You know, when we're looking at the pipeline composition, you are right in terms of the year-over-year compare. What we are pleased with is the strength we're seeing sequentially in our build from Q3 to Q4, which gives us some confidence in terms of our internal view of our Q4 outlook. And then when we actually peel that back a little bit, we are confident to see some evolution in terms of the aging of those pipeline opportunities. As you mentioned, when we are going into Q3, we saw that, we are getting some nice build, but those were earlier stage opportunities. And as we're looking at Q4, we see a much better balance between early stage opportunities as well as advanced stage. So nice evolution in terms of what we're seeing sequentially between our Q3 and Q4 pipeline. Yeah. Thanks Karl. When I think about our operating margin leverage potential, even with the transition to increasing Pure as-a-Service and our subscription offerings, both are very achievable and we're planning on that as we look out to next year. I think we're making some great efforts across the board to leverage our investments, especially this year as we kind of invested ahead of the growth curve, if you will, going into next year. So, I'm looking to actually improve operating margin and profitability even when considering growth in our subscription offerings. Well, I'll take that first, Charlie and then feel free to add on. I mean, when we think about our new customers, our new customers will either purchase our Pure as-a-Service offering, which would contribute to our subscription services, or they'll purchase our integrated appliance that comes with our Evergreen subscription. And so that will play into it as well. But we're also getting a significant amount of momentum with customers who are continuing to invest in the Evergreen subscriptions from a renewal standpoint. And that momentum is really coming from our existing customers. And so that hopefully would answer that question specific to the mix occurring. Yeah, thanks, Charlie. But the momentum when we think about recurring revenues will be driven probably more from our existing customer base as well. What I was pleased to see is a couple of things. I was pleased to see overperformance in Q3, followed by what we're seeing currently is sequential strength going from Q3 to Q4. And I think those are positive, actually, because I think the COVID resurgence. Back to your point, Simon, in terms of folks knowing how to sell in this new environment, customers being more comfortable purchasing, I think, will help mitigate this resurgence we're seeing globally. And then we just need to see how Q4 performance evolves throughout the quarter. But look, we're really confident in our growth drivers, especially with what we saw in Q3 in terms of our Subscription Services, FlashBlade performance and FlashArray//C. So, it's coming together for us. COVID certainly creates uncertainty. And to Charlie's point, we do expect that to continue in Q1. We're going in the right direction. Yeah, I would add on that. The enterprise strength, it was across many of our verticals and that was broad based and it was global. So that was kind of a new green shoot for us in terms of what we were looking at. We've had resilience across the board on Enterprise, but the broad-based growth we saw in Enterprise was actually pleasing for us. I'll hit the Portworx first, Katy. We're super excited with the strategic acquisition. Revenue is actually pretty small in terms of contribution as we look out into Q4. We'll probably see that start to build in RPO and deferred revenue before that starts making its way in any significant or meaningful way to revenue. Charlie, you want to hit, Paul?"

            "name": "Matt Kixmoeller",
            "content": "Yeah. Just to jump in for a second, I think Charlie is really hitting on one of the key differentiators of PaaS from our competition where we're really pursuing this like a product opportunity. You know, if you look at our competitors, their offerings tend to come from their financial services groups and they're just kind of dressed up leases in a different name. We have a business unit that has engineers as the GM who's running this program. And we're thinking about how we really change the entire customer experience around and as a service experience. And so hopefully what you've seen with the launch of the service catalog today is a good example where we're really rethinking what's the entire way a customer thinks about purchasing a service, looks at their existing workloads, and uses AI-driven modeling tools to understand the right service. And then just enjoys the same level of transparency that people have today in the public cloud around open service pricing, performance SLAs and then driving the process for getting procurement going. So really, it's the beginning of a whole new interaction with customers of Pure. And I'd also say that, your question somewhat implied that our QLC product was being limited by availability of NAND, and that's not the case. You know, we're in a second generation of that product being GI now. We've now shipped the largest QLC flash module in the industry, our 48-terabyte module. And so, we're in a really great place from a supply point of view to supply that product. And we believe it's really differentiated in the market. I'll take the first stab at that. Look, I guess the first thing here is, we're doing this because it's something customers demand and increasingly customers want to self-qualify research solutions on their own. Do someone understand relative pricing and then contact a sales rep or a channel partner when they're much further along in the buying process. And so, this is, from a Pure point of view, is all about really upping our digital go to market chops and being able to sell how customers want to buy much more in this cloud model. In the case of the service catalog, what we publish in there are MSRP prices. And so, customer can get a discount obviously by coming to Pure and working through our channel programs and that's not published. So, there's still some, you know, room for negotiation in there. But you know, what the service catalog does do is, it allows them to very openly see what the different services are or see what the performance levels are, so they can make a good choice around. Okay, is it worth a 2x increase in spend in order to get a certain amount of increase in performance? And indeed, if you look at the new service tiers that we've introduced, we now offer a 10x range in pricing for a 20x range of performance. And so, there's quite a range of services and customers have the right service level for every work load in their environment. Yeah, I guess selling of that is that it just hasn't been the type of product that's been very hard to sell in terms of going and finding very focused use cases. It turns out customers run disk-based arrays for a wide range of use cases. And so really the easiest way to go to market with it is just to go to a customer who's already bought in and understood the benefits of flash at the high end of their application space. And ask them are they still running disk array, and work with them to say, look, if we can actually sell you an old FlashArray that brings the simplicity and performance of flash, and it's actually 30% less expensive than a disk, why do we need disk still?"

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Nicole Noutsios, Investor Relations. Thank you. Please go ahead.\nNicole Noutsios: Thank you and good afternoon. Welcome to the Pure Storage second quarter fiscal 2021 earnings call. My name is Nicole Noutsios, Investor Relations at Pure. Joining me today are our CEO, Charlie Giancarlo; and our CFO, Kevan Krysler; and our VP of Strategy, Matt Kixmoeller. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that during this call, management will make forward-looking statements which are subject to various risks and uncertainties. These include statements regarding the COVID-19 pandemic and related disruptions, our growth in sales prospects, competitive industry and technology trends, our strategy and its advantages, our current and future product offerings and business and operations. Any forward-looking statements that we make are based on facts and assumptions as of today and we undertake no obligation to update them. Our actual results may differ materially from the results forecasted and reported results should not be considered as an indication of future performance. A discussion of some of the risks and uncertainties related to our business is contained in our filings with the SEC and we refer you to these public filings. During the call, we will discuss non-GAAP measures in talking about the company\u2019s performance and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures which are provided in our earnings press release and slides. This call is being broadcast live on the Pure Storage Investor Relations website is being recorded for playback purposes. An archive of the webcast will be available on the IR website and is the property of Pure Storage. With that, I will turn the call over to our CEO, Charlie.\nCharlie Giancarlo: Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us on today\u2019s earnings call. Let me start by extending my sincere wishes that you, your family, friends and colleagues are all healthy and staying well. The current environment continues to challenge us all, but I am proud of how Pure has risen to the occasion. We are helping our customers navigate the crisis and accelerate their digital transformation during this difficult time. The ease, flexibility, and economic security of our Evergreen model has never been more necessary or appreciated by our customers. Pure\u2019s core differentiators of unmatched technology leadership, simplicity of operation, high performance, and ultimate reliability makes Pure the right decision, especially at this time. These core tenets are also the foundation of our vision of the modern data experience: data storage that is entirely automated, fully dynamic, and provides a cloud-like experience in an as-a-service model with flexible on-demand consumption responsive to the needs of the application. This modern vision is taking hold in the market. The most important characteristic of any cloud infrastructure is reliability and customers become even more acutely aware of this in times of crisis. I am pleased to announce that in Q2, Pure\u2019s FlashArray product surpassed the full seven nines of total availability across our installed base of tens of thousands of arrays, including during all upgrade cycles, which is unprecedented in our industry. To put this in perspective, seven nines is the equivalent of only 3 seconds of downtime per year. Across our product portfolio, we are delivering savings in power, cooling, and floor space driving ecological advantages and contributing to the lowest total cost of ownership at a time when economic and environmental efficiency are on the minds of our customers. And with our renowned simplicity and cloud-based Pure1 management and support, we dramatically reduced employee time managing storage, freeing them to innovate in a landscape with new demands. I am pleased with our execution during this crisis and I continue to be very confident that we will exit this downturn in a position of strength supported by our innovative technology, subscription services and a long-term vision that is aligned with customer needs. In Q1, we saw a wave of customers, many of them critical and essential businesses, coming to us to expand their applications and replace their legacy infrastructure that just couldn\u2019t keep up with the new demands brought on by the pandemic. It was a quarter that was dominated by urgent and immediate needs and our customers\u2019 previously important plans were put on hold. In contrast, Q2 was a quarter of re-planning for many organizations. Companies paused to consider the future and reassess their technology direction aligning it to the new reality that their organizations face. Although the situation remains fluid, we believe the second half of the year will see businesses return to and even accelerate digital transformation. The growth and strength we saw from our international business in the quarter provides an early, but positive indication of increased demands for our solutions when crisis levels created by COVID-19 decline. We continue to dramatically outpace our industry and innovation, and I am excited to share several technology announcements, expanded partnerships, and portfolio and subscription services momentum with you. Today, we announced the second generation of FlashArray//C, the industry\u2019s first and still only all-QLC storage solution. This offering effectively renders hybrid storage obsolete by providing flash density, performance, and reliability at lower costs than legacy hybrid disk arrays. With FlashArray//C for capacity-oriented workloads, FlashArray//X for performance-centric workloads and Cloud Block Store in the cloud, all available under our unified subscription, customers are able to consolidate a broad set of workloads onto a single platform. Late last quarter, we expanded our file portfolio with the introduction of File Services on FlashArray//C, which allows customers to further simplify and consolidate their general purpose file needs on the same platform. The combination of file support and FlashArray//C enables customers to cost effectively consolidate and run their block-based applications like VMs, databases, and VDI alongside their general-purpose file systems and user shares on a unified FlashArray platform. We continue to see strength in our FlashBlade product for addressing high performance file and object needs with a single platform. FlashBlade continues to redefine what is possible for cutting-edge analytics, real-time data, AI, and scientific workloads. The wide array of software features we delivered earlier this year and in particular file and object replication are rapidly expanding FlashBlade into additional mainstream enterprise use cases. FlashBlade is helping customers drive unparalleled consolidation across multiple workloads so that they can both modernize file and introduce high-performance object in a single platform. For example, this quarter a large media and entertainment customer selected FlashBlade to consolidate their Splunk, ElasticSearch, and Rapid Restore environments onto a single unified fast file and object platform. This quarter, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children selected FlashBlade for its high performance replicated file storage to expand and enhance their analysis and machine-learning applications used in the fight against online child exploitation. In these very trying times, it is gratifying to see the ways in which our technology is being used to help those most in need. FlashBlade\u2019s adoption to power rapid recovery and protect against ransomware continues to grow. Two weeks ago, we announced a partnership with Cohesity to introduce Pure FlashRecover. This is the first fully integrated all-flash rapid recovery solution on the market and we are excited to deliver it in Q3 with streamlined support delivered through Pure. Customer demand has been strong for an integrated solution that not only restores data rapidly in the event of an attack, but also reduces complexity, while scaling both performance and capacity to meet even petabyte-level recovery requirements. Pure\u2019s Subscription Services continue to yield great results. These services include our Evergreen program and our unified subscription, which delivers our on-prem solutions and Pure\u2019s Cloud Block Store under a single consumption experience. Our unified subscription saw continued strong growth from both existing and new customers in both cloud and enterprise segments, including Telstra, Dizzion Managed Desktop as-a-Service, BidFX and Arrow Energy. These customers are choosing our unified subscription because it is a true enterprise class utility that delivers ultimate flexibility for storage consumption. It provides a cloud-like experience on-premise with the ability to move data to the cloud at any time and align spend with actual consumption. Cloud Block Store, which is part of our unified subscription, solves one of the biggest challenges for enterprises today, how to cost effectively bridge private and public clouds for Tier 1 applications. The unified software and unified subscription of Pure as-a-Service offer both compelling cost efficiencies and high performance both on-prem and in the cloud. We have also seen strong customer adoption of our Pure Service Orchestrator software, which enables automated, stateful container storage, creating a modern container environment for developers to build cloud-native apps on-prem. Pure Service Orchestrator, combined with Cloud Block Store create a hybrid container strategy that truly unlocks the potential of Kubernetes. We believe our modern data experience vision, unique unified subscription services and hybrid cloud and container strategy, all driven by our FlashArray and FlashBlade platforms, will enable us to continue to grow and take even more market share in the coming quarters and years. Looking forward, I am confident in our opportunity, our long-term strategy, and our ability to reaccelerate growth upon exiting the global crisis, all while continuing to focus on operating discipline. We are the one company driving change in this $50 billion industry, providing an unrivaled experience that customers simply love. In closing, I am truly thankful to our employees, customers, partners and the entire Pure community for their tenacity, due diligence and flexibility to adapt to and overcome the challenges of the current environment. With that, I will turn it over to you, Kevan.\nKevan Krysler: Thank you, Charlie and good afternoon everyone. Our Q2 financial results reflect solid execution during the headwinds of the macro environment caused by COVID-19. We are also pleased with the continued strength of our subscription services and the growth of our international business following a challenging Q1. Total revenue during Q2 grew 2% year-over-year to $403.7 million. Product revenue declined 9% year-over-year, while subscription services momentum continues as revenue grew 37% year-over-year and represented approximately 33% of total revenue, up from 24% of total revenue year-over-year. Subscription services revenue includes revenues from our Evergreen subscriptions and our unified subscription, which includes Pure as-a-Service and Cloud Block Store. We saw significant growth in our international business during Q2, while facing headwinds in the United States created by COVID-19. Total revenue in the United States during Q2 was $282 million, declining 4% year-over-year and total international revenue grew 20% year-over-year to $122 million during Q2. Given the ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty that persists I will continue to provide additional color around our sales performance. Total bookings, or sales, during the first 6 months of the year grew 8.3% year-over-year and during Q2, declined 3.3% year-over-year due to the headwinds we faced in the United States. Global channel sourced sales continued to represent a growing and meaningful percentage of our total sales. We are very pleased with the close partnership of our global channel. New customers are continuing to choose Pure. Both average deal size for new customers and FlashBlade new customers grew year-over-year. Sales to new customers choosing Pure during Q2 represent over 20% of our total sales. Across our full solution portfolio, we acquired over 350 new customers compared to over 450 customers during Q2 of the prior year. Non-GAAP gross margins for product and subscription services during Q2, was 69.8% representing a slight year-over-year increase of 0.4 points. Non-GAAP product gross margin in Q2 was 70.1%, generally consistent year-over-year and non-GAAP subscription services margin increased 1.8 points year-over-year to 69.2%. Total non-GAAP operating profit during Q2 was approximately $11 million compared to a non-GAAP operating loss of approximately $3 million during Q2 of the prior year. We continue to focus on strong operating discipline while investing thoughtfully. Non-GAAP net income during Q2 was $18 million and non-GAAP net income per share was $0.06. Non-GAAP net income in Q2 of the prior year was $3 million and non-GAAP net income per share was $0.01. Weighted average shares used for the non-GAAP net earnings per share calculation was 283 million shares in Q2 and 271 million shares in the prior year. We generated positive operating cash flows of $51 million for Q2 compared to $49 million in the prior year and free cash flows of $26 million compared to $20 million in the prior year. Total cash and investments at the end of Q2 remain very healthy at $1.29 billion. Total deferred revenue for Q2 was $725 million compared to $706 million at the end of Q1 and $607 million at the end of Q2 of the prior year. Our remaining performance obligations, or RPO, which includes our committed and non-cancelable future revenue for Q2 is nearing $1 billion at $956 million. This compares to $912 million at the end of Q1 and $770 million at the end of Q2 of the prior year. During Q2, we returned $20 million to shareholders through share repurchases of 1.18 million shares. Approximately $45 million remains for our share repurchase authorization. Total headcount at the end of the quarter was approximately 3,700 employees compared to approximately 3,500 employees at the end of Q1 and 3,300 employees at the end of Q2 of the prior year. Now moving to guidance, the growth we have achieved and our focus on operating discipline during the first half of the year is based on the core fundamentals of our business being strong despite the significant economic contraction caused by COVID-19. As we look to Q3, we expect recurring revenue and sales of our Evergreen and unified subscription services will continue to show strong growth though significant uncertainty due to COVID remains. Similar to last quarter, we believe it is still not prudent to provide formal guidance. We are pleased that our total pipeline opportunity for Q3 has increased meaningfully compared to the total pipeline opportunity we saw for Q2. However, a greater proportion of the opportunities in our Q3 pipeline are at earlier stages compared to Q2. And then although not considered formal guidance, our current internal view is that total revenues will be approximately flat sequentially. Moving to investments, we continue to exercise solid operating discipline throughout the organization, which has enabled us to invest in innovation and increased sales capacity during the first half of the year. We expect net incremental resource additions will slow during the second half of the year and will be concentrated on continued innovation. With our current views of Q3 revenue, we estimate that operating margin will be slightly below breakeven, near negative 2%. To summarize, we are continuing to innovate and successfully navigate the business during an unprecedented economic contraction, including strong growth in our Evergreen and unified subscription services. Our broad customer base, strong partnership and commitment to our channel and our strong growth in recurring revenues, positions us for long-term growth. With that, we will now open the call for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Pinjalim Bora from JPMorgan.\nPinjalim Bora: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Could you \u2013 can I double click on just the performance across the different segments? Could you maybe talk about in terms of the bookings growth, how did enterprise do, how did mid-market do, how did cloud and public sector?\nCharlie Giancarlo: You bet. Hi, Pinjalim, it\u2019s Charlie. Good to hear your voice. We had \u2013 as you heard in the prepared remarks really an excellent international quarter. And I think it reflects what happens when economies recover after a corona lockdown. So, that we felt very strong about that. And we also had very strong unified subscription and overall subscription revenues, very positive there. On a relative basis, cloud and enterprise were much stronger, but of course with the U.S. being down generally, especially in the area of commercial \u2013 right commercial and net new logos. Given that, that was down to that of course depressed overall revenues. But I wouldn\u2019t say that it was outside of commercial that it was centered on any particular area. It was really just the reduction in the U.S. overall. We did see overall across the portfolio, the kind of balance that we generally like to see in our products be it a strong FlashBlade, FlashBlade sales growth, both across the world, but again, especially in Europe and the new products are doing well. So, the balance is pretty much what we would expect, but we did see lackluster U.S.\nPinjalim Bora: Understood. And Kevan, on the guidance, it seems like a decline of about 6%, if my math is right, is that mainly on just the composition of the pipeline that you mentioned? Is there a factor of headwind from the subscription transition, anything to call out?\nKevan Krysler: No, I wouldn\u2019t call out a factor on the headwind from the subscription, I really would focus it on the pipeline, and the fact that we are actually quite pleased to see what pipeline has done. It\u2019s an early signal for us, but we did see some sequential improvement in pipeline build, which we actually hadn\u2019t seen for some time. And then just the fact that that\u2019s earlier stage for us really had us come in with some informal views of where we would land for Q3 revenue.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Simon Leopold from Raymond James.\nSimon Leopold: Great, thank you very much for taking the question. First, I wanted to see if maybe you could unpack the subscription business a little bit in terms of helping us understand the split and the trends of how much of your subscription business is on-prem and how much is in cloud? Is that something you can offer?\nCharlie Giancarlo: Yes, absolutely. The vast majority remains on-prem, because the cloud is a relatively new business, whereas Evergreen of course has been since our inception. And the way that a \u2013 the way that subscription operates as you build revenue, it takes time to actually build \u2013 to build revenue in it, but we are very pleased with the adoption of the cloud \u2013 of the cloud portion of the revenue. And of course, I will say that Pure as-a-Service, which includes both the ratable service-oriented sale of storage on-prem, which is combined with a subscription to Cloud Block Store has really unleashed a lot of opportunity for us and has really driven a lot of sales and in fact a lot of new customer sales. So we are very pleased with that. But there are lot of customers that certainly are planning for cloud that haven\u2019t yet made the jump, but want to make sure that the purchases that they make are both ratable that is subscription, but also transparent and allows them to move to the cloud at any time.\nSimon Leopold: Thanks. And then just as a follow-up, I wanted to see if you could talk a little bit about the linearity or the patterns you saw in the months of May, June and July versus what you have seen historically. Thank you.\nKevan Krysler: Yes, in terms of linearity, it probably was a little bit worse, as we saw it later in Q2, but nothing that I would view as out of the norms in terms of what we saw. Obviously with Q1, we saw some great tailwinds throughout the quarter, really driven by companies purchasing for mission-critical events and needs. And as a result of that tailwind dissipating in Q2, we saw more normalized linearity.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Ittai Kidron from Oppenheimer.\nIttai Kidron: Hey, guys. I guess, I want to drill into this last point of the guidance, and I guess the early cycle of the pipeline as it looks like right now versus previous periods. Charlie, is there a way to correlate this with execution quality on the sell side? Is there a thesis to be made that perhaps in the last quarter or two you over harvested the installed base, didn\u2019t pay perhaps enough attention into getting new customers and now you are just kind of left with not much to harvest and on the flip side, customers that have been squeezed already for what they need to buy?\nCharlie Giancarlo: Yes. Ittai, I don\u2019t believe so. That\u2019s the first time that I have heard that thesis to be direct. Our view is that we had seen, as Kevan mentioned, tailwinds in Q1. We did kind of expect them to continue through potentially May but that did not occur, to be clear. Also, you have to understand that, from a sales force perspective, they go from the way of selling that we and that everyone has been selling for years to where everybody is now inside sales. So it\u2019s a completely new way of selling and for customers, a new way of buying. But I think the majority, and I said this in my prepared remarks, the majority of the change was customers now living in a very new environment, both economically, but also are completely reconsidering their digital transformation and what\u2019s important to them and whenever you have a re-consideration or re-planning, you have some stasis. You have an interruption in buying patterns, and I think that\u2019s exactly what\u2019s taken place in Q2. The good news is we have seen it in Europe, that when countries come out of a \u2013 the recessionary environment, when they come out of the pandemic environment and the lockdown, then they start to reopen their purse strings and we saw a tremendous quarter in Europe. And I would expect that we would see the same country by country as they come out of the pandemic. Unfortunately in the U.S. we are going in and out repeatedly and it\u2019s almost state by state. And I think that it\u2019s certainly delayed the kind of recovery that we hope to see soon.\nIttai Kidron: Well, that\u2019s why it\u2019s hard for me to reconcile the comments. I mean if you saw what you saw in the second quarter international properties, why wouldn\u2019t we not see that in the U.S. kind of third quarter where all \u2013 a lot of the opening has happened already in the May-June timeframe. How much of a \u2013 in any given quarter how much of your business activity really comes from new customers versus existing ones expanding? I feel like new ones don\u2019t contribute that much for an in-quarter. It\u2019s a lot of existing in which case, again, why guide flat, why should that number not be higher?\nCharlie Giancarlo: Yes. Well, actually, let me just challenge you a little bit. I mean, we have not seen \u2013 we have seen reopening and then re-closing in the U.S. over the last couple of months. And if you just consider the infection rates and the amount of lockdown that\u2019s taken place, there is \u2013 it\u2019s a very different picture today in the U.S. than it is in Europe. And so we are still seeing the effects of a muted U.S. economic response currently. But I will let Kevan handle the second part of that question.\nKevan Krysler: For sure. And on net new logos for customers, as I said in my prepared remarks, it actually is quite substantial for us. And even in this quarter, the amount of bookings really generated from net new logos was over 20%, which we were quite pleased with. And just as a quick follow-on to Charlie\u2019s point, any upside that we get on the U.S. has not been considered in our Q3 and formal views, to Charlie\u2019s points that he laid out in terms of the uncertainty and timing and extent of the U.S. recovery. But if there is a significant recovery that we see in Q3, we would see that come through on our results as well.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Aaron Rakers from Wells Fargo.\nAaron Rakers: Yes, thanks for taking the question. I have two as well. The first question I just \u2013 I think it\u2019s the first time you have actually in the reported results disclosed the RPO balance. And when I look at that balance at $956 million, up about 24% year-over-year, what to me stands out actually is the expansion that you are seeing above the deferred line. And so that being up over 40%, can you just help us unpack what exactly sits in the RPO balance that\u2019s not in deferred? And how we should think about that kind of translating to revenue going forward?\nKevan Krysler: Yes, absolutely. When we think about the expansion over deferred, especially sequentially throughout the last several quarters that\u2019s really due to the momentum that we are seeing from a unified subscription business, that\u2019s really the primary driver of that. And then before that we may have some integrated sales of solutions that are unbilled that would be part of the RPO balance that would not be in deferred revenue, but as we see the sequential increases over the last several quarters that\u2019s really being driven by unified subscription momentum.\nAaron Rakers: Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then just as a second question, you talked a little bit about now that having the second generation of the C Series product with QLC in the market, I believe when that was launched, there is a lot of discussion about that being just a natural expansion of opportunity for you guys. So, can you talk a little bit about what you are seeing in terms of the C Series product and how you are seeing acquisitions or leverage relative to your traditional FlashArray systems and the TAM expansion that you are actually starting to see?\nCharlie Giancarlo: You bet. So FlashArray//C continues to be one of the fastest product launches we have ever had. And now the second generation is not 100% QLC, but even less expensive because of that. And so we believe it\u2019s actually less expensive than hybrid arrays. So now you get an all-flash array with all-flash performance at a lower price than hybrid arrays. So \u2013 and it\u2019s a unique product in the market not only has no other vendor come up with a competitive product, no other vendors come up with a competitive announcement, which after 9 months of the first generation being in the market is really quite remarkable.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Tim Long from Barclays.\nTim Long: Thank you. Just the first one if I could just talk a little bit about competition gross margins, any impacts there obviously still pretty strong product gross margin, but down a little bit from last quarter. So, just talk a little bit about that. It seems like in the guidance, it\u2019s kind of staying around these levels? And then I have a follow-up.\nCharlie Giancarlo: Yes. Thanks, Tim. I am going to start with the \u2013 on the first part of the question around competition and let Kevan handle the gross margin side. Our win rates have stayed about the same. That\u2019s pretty much where we would like \u2013 of course, we always like to see more, but about where we would like to see. So the competition, I would think \u2013 or sorry the competition, I would say is generally consistent with prior quarters. I will say that customers have been perhaps a bit more demanding in the COVID period. So we are seeing a little bit of that, but on the \u2013 I am going to let Kevan handle the gross margin question.\nKevan Krysler: Yes. Thanks, Charlie. And just to reiterate what Charlie indicated, our win rates have been solid and consistent even compared to pre-COVID. So that was a great signal for us as we look at it from the competitive landscape. Back to gross margins and product gross margins, we really do continue to be pleased with our gross margin performance, which is in line with our long-term view and really best in industry. Gross margins were year-over-year relatively consistent. We did see some movement as you suggested sequentially, Tim. I would attribute that to really kind of two factors, one is growth of our international business was representing a higher proportion of our sales and that was a factor in this quarter as our international business traditionally has a little bit lower product gross margins and there was also some larger opportunities we saw during this quarter, where we made an investment in terms of pricing. These are opportunities where we are very excited about the long-term opportunities, including follow-on purchases and commits from these customers.\nTim Long: Okay, great. Thanks. And then just follow-up, you talked about kind of the vertical mix with small commercial accounts being little bit more challenging. Just talk a little bit I think there has been a directive of the company to push more into the larger enterprise. Can you discuss a little bit how maybe this economic situation might accelerate that move and where is Pure with further penetrating the larger enterprise accounts? Thank you.\nCharlie Giancarlo: Yes, No, your question is right on. We did see obviously both at the beginning of the COVID period and continuing stronger results up in the enterprise accounts. It\u2019s been very \u2013 on the one hand, it\u2019s been very reassuring to us that not only has it been in existing enterprises where they have brought us in further into their infrastructure, but even winning new large enterprises with large first time sales into the large enterprise. So I believe we have now become the safe choice in many ways, even for large enterprise. But commercial is struggling as a \u2013 I think that\u2019s well known throughout all of the IT industry that commercial accounts are having a harder time in the COVID environment and that is, of course, causing us to shift how we focus our sales teams attention with putting more with shifting more resources into larger enterprise, and for the time being, managing commercial with the appropriate amount of sellers and support.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Karl Ackerman from Cowen.\nKarl Ackerman: Hey, good afternoon. And I hope you are healthy and avoiding the plume of wildfire smoke surrounding the Bay Area. Two questions, if I may. You did very well internationally this quarter I was hoping you could address the competitive environment and whether bids have become more competitive. I asked because while your, I guess, primary competitor EMC has introduced a Midrange Array, that is what we expected, but Huawei recently also introduced OceanStore arrays. But the U.S. Department of Commerce I think has severely restricted that company\u2019s access to silicon. So if you could address the puts and takes in your ability to perhaps gain share in Asia going forward, that would be helpful?\nCharlie Giancarlo: Sure. As you may know \u2013 our sales in India and China and even South America are relatively small portion of our overall sales, and that tends to be where Huawei has its greatest strength. We don\u2019t see \u2013 we do see Huawei, but we don\u2019t see them a lot in Western Europe. We \u2013 they have crept up a little bit more over the years, but still a relatively small amount of our engagement is with them. With \u2013 the majority of our engagement continues to be with Dell. And frankly our win rates against Dell continue to be very strong overall. You asked about their new PowerStore, honestly, I would have expect \u2013 I did expect to see them much more often or PowerStore much more often than we have. Honestly, we see PowerMax much more often than we see PowerStore, and PowerMax was brought in as a last gasp by Dell when they were losing the account to us on extra discount. So it\u2019s \u2013 PowerStore, we think, is actually continues to be a great opportunity for us because Dell has effectively said we have to replace four products in the field, need another forklift upgrade by them. It\u2019s not a good time to be introducing a 1.0 product, which is what it is. And whenever a customer now is running up against the end of sale of those other four products, we can claim to be and we are the safe bet for them. So with our Evergreen which we introduced with our first product six or seven years ago, customers know they will never have to do a forklift upgrade again and that\u2019s been proven over six generations. So, Dell is just \u2013 they are our biggest competitor, but we feel very confident in terms of our positioning against them.\nKarl Ackerman: That\u2019s very helpful. For my follow-up, if I may, there has been much discussion on the growth of how distributed storage architectures from edge computing should drive significant opportunity in object-based storage software and hardware development. How do you see your role evolving with object-based storage particularly in software and with your FlashBlade offering? As edge computing evolves over the next few years, I guess, how does that influence your strategic planning for augmenting your Pure as-a-Service offerings around software? Thank you.\nCharlie Giancarlo: Yes, it\u2019s \u2013 that\u2019s a really interesting area, and of course an up and coming one that\u2019s very important. First of all, we do believe in the container world and we believe that\u2019s going to be a very strong new set of implementations and changes that are going to be going into the entire virtualization environment. Of course, there are going to be applications that are developed directly on top of a container environment, and we feel like we are well placed with the FlashBlade to be able to support those very high-performance, very needy container environment with respect to being able to get high-speed of object in particular. But in addition to that, there will be many customers that want to transition their existing application environments over to containers to make them more portable, more resilient. And for them we have our Pure Service Orchestrator which is now in place with hundreds of customers. It enables those customers to use their existing storage environment with \u2013 in any one of our products and even with our Cloud Block Store with containerized applications that they create from their existing environments. And then again, it allows them to operate it on our Unified subscription and so forth. So we feel like we are \u2013 it\u2019s obviously a very new space, but we feel like we are \u2013 like we are innovating in the right path for those customers that are going to be increasingly developing our containers.\nMatt Kixmoeller: Yes, this is Kix. I mean, I will just add on specific to your question on the object part of it. When we developed FlashBlade 4 years plus ago now, we made a bet to make it a unified file and object platform. And frankly at the time, people looked at that and said, object, that\u2019s the protocol people usually use for low-end, low-performance, low-cost storage. What\u2019s there \u2013 what\u2019s the reason for an all-flash object store? But the reason has really been cloud-native and modern applications that are increasingly using object as their primary storage and so just a great part of our FlashBlade business has been the growth of object. And as you brought in the edge architectures, we very commonly see data created at the edge, but then centralized for an analytics and that ability to have an on-prem centralized really fast object store for analytics of data and IoT-type deployments is a key use case. And one we expect will keep growing.\nCharlie Giancarlo: And just to give you a sense of how far advanced we are, Pure Service Orchestrator just had a more recent release where we are actually the first to support the latest version of the CSI, Container Storage Interface put out by \u2013 in Kubernetes. So we are tracking this very closely. Both object and containers are a core area of focus for us.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Wamsi Mohan from Bank of America.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, thanks for taking my questions. It\u2019s [indiscernible] filling in for Wamsi today. I was just wondering if you can help us bridge the sequential \u2013 expected sequential decline in operating margins between fiscal 2Q and 3Q. What are the puts and takes there? It looks like it\u2019s about a 480 basis points decline. So any color there would be helpful.\nCharlie Giancarlo: Thank you. We are \u2013 we continue to invest \u2013 well, first of all, I will say that it is our intention and our expectation that the company will show an operating profit for the year. And so that\u2019s the focus that we are operating on. At the same time, as we have stated at the very beginning of the crisis, we intend to continue to invest in our customers, our support and most particularly in our innovation capability and in our products because I believe what Alan Greenspan once said which is that, the one thing you know about all recessions is that they all end. And we believe that we are going to exit this recession in a position to be able to reaccelerate once we come out of it. And we think it\u2019s going to be technology-led and customers will respond and respect those vendors that continue to invest during the downturn.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay, thanks for that, Charlie. And just for my follow-up, last quarter you launched Purity 3.0 for FlashBlade. I mean, how has the reception been, has that helped you get incremental customers? And if you can just comment on, how bookings are trending currently in the third quarter? Thanks.\nCharlie Giancarlo: Yes. So I will start with the FlashBlade 3.0. This is really \u2013 it\u2019s already deployed on literally hundreds of arrays. So it\u2019s been a very fast uptake of the 3.0 and it\u2019s been really notable how many customers have deployed the fast file and object replication. And they have done it for a number of different use cases, data protection, data \u2013 excuse me, disaster recovery, and they have done it between both on-prem and public cloud sites. So the \u2013 and I think illustrative is what we just did with Cohesity. We really have designed a system with them, but we have also added additional capabilities to our product to add additional security and features with respect to ransomware so that customers can not only detect ransomware and protect themselves against it, but recover very rapidly, such as within an hour after a ransomware attack. So what \u2013 the strength, of course, of FlashBlade and especially so with the 3.0 release is that it is unified for both our fast file and object the big use cases are big data analytics, log analytics, machine learning, as we have said in the past, but increasingly, especially with the new features, chip design, genomics, geophysical modeling. So all of the \u2013 as you might imagine the high-performance use cases and then lastly, what I will mention is it\u2019s being increasingly used for mixed-use cases, which is something very different than in the past. In other words, it could be \u2013 it will be used by some customers for analytics and at the same time rapid recovery and ransomware protection, as well as just large scale file repositories all at the same time. And it can do that just because of the performance and the scale of the product.\nKevan Krysler: And then in specific to Q3 in terms of current views, any of the views that we have seen early days really were part of what we have shared in our prepared remarks and how we\u2019re looking at Q3 in terms of our internal views and the informal guide. But that also plays into how \u2013 what we are seeing on pipeline in terms of increasing pipeline build sequentially from what we saw in Q2.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Nehal Chokshi from Northland.\nNehal Chokshi: Yes. Thank you. So, good to see you continue the traction with the overall bookings growth and looks like you had about $28 million in unbilled contract bookings so I think all that is associated with the Cloud Block Store and Pure as-a-Service. Can you give us a sense as to how it splits out between those two though?\nKevan Krysler: We really look at that, Nehal, as a Unified subscription, because that\u2019s how we sell it, that\u2019s how we go to market and so when we look at our subscription services as a category, you really have really two major categories, one being Evergreen, which has been out there for some time and is still growing at an accelerated rate, and the other one is our Unified subscription. But we don\u2019t track to \u2013 nor do we talk about it from a public standpoint, the breakout of our Unified subscription, given that our selling motion and how customers are utilizing at both on-prem and in the cloud, it doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense for us.\nNehal Chokshi: Right, okay. And then your current view basically implies that there is going to be a pretty significant step down in the year-over-year growth of product revenue. And if you look at \u2013 look out at various companies that have a hardware element, it doesn\u2019t, at least, come as a surprise to me, I guess \u2013 and thank you for providing that view, I think that\u2019s going to prove to be unique, but I am going to push you a little bit further here. Do you have a view on when on-premise hardware bottoms in terms of their year over year trajectory?\nCharlie Giancarlo: I \u2013 it\u2019s hard to say, but we do think that as the economy improves, you will see \u2013 let me phrase this another way. I think it\u2019s very clear now that the dominant view of our enterprise is that their future is hybrid, that is some combination of on-prem and in the cloud, and really what they want to do is to unify that to be able to create an environment where that choice for them is more economic than it is a decision about technologies, and where that they can negotiate both with on-prem vendors, as well as with cloud vendors to get the best possible economic and performance, as well as full application and services position that they can possibly be in. So we\u2019re seeing a very strong uptake of the hybrid cloud idea. So, what that really says is it\u2019s about \u2013 your question really goes to when those IT spending start to really recover. I think it depends a lot upon the trajectory of the pandemic in the U.S. and I would expect that when we see the \u2013 when we start to see the economy recover, that is GDP start to pick up and IT spending start to free up, that we will see a recovery and as you phrase it, a bottoming out of our on-prem equipment spend.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Erik Suppiger from JMP Securities.\nErik Suppiger: Yes, thanks for taking the question. First off, you had noted the commercial market soft. Can you just remind us how much contribution you have from commercial accounts and how you size commercial accounts? And then secondly, you have a number of new product cycles, I\u2019d be curious to know how you kind of size the opportunity for the unified services versus the size of the opportunity for your FlashArray//C. I know they are very different products, but how do you see those if you look out say, 3 to 5years?\nCharlie Giancarlo: Yes. Well, of course, one always expects the new products to grow faster than the company overall. As we mentioned, FlashArray//C has had a huge start to it. We expect that to continue to for some time, because it extends into a large market or because its part of a very large market that we didn\u2019t part to that no one has participated in before. If we look at FlashRecover, that\u2019s an \u2013 data protection is an $8 billion market and we are just getting started in that. And then if you look at our new release, which we just released in the last week of our last quarter, which is file services on FlashArray//C, standard general purpose file stores is a market that we haven\u2019t participated in at all and again is a multibillion dollar market. So, I think as we look forward 3 to 4 years if we have the kind of success in those products that we individually had in FlashBlade over the same 3 to 4-year period, we are talking well over $1 billion and close to $2 billion or more. So, it\u2019s a great \u2013 we just see great upside in the portfolio overall.\nMatt Kixmoeller: Yes. One other data point I might just add, if you look at the overall enterprise storage market, we are still in a zone where more disc is sold than flash and flash has obviously come in and eroded all of the high-end of the use cases. But there is still a lot of hybrid arrays that are sold out there that are a little bit of flash and a lot of disc on the back end. One of the unique things now with FlashArray//C, when we first launched it, we talked about how it got kind of in the neighborhood of hybrid arrays, we now believe it\u2019s substantially less expensive to deploy FlashArray//C than a hybrid array, about 30% cheaper. And so as we talk to our larger scale enterprise customers, it\u2019s just becoming a no-brainer to not to look beyond the Tier 1 and now look at their Tier 2 franchises that used to really have hybrid arrays to have the final transition to flash happen.\nCharlie Giancarlo: And then just to answer your question on enterprise and we talked about from a new customer, total customers \u2013 our total customer base about what 45% of those are Fortune 500. And I think that\u2019s a good way to look at it. Bookings as a total share for enterprise would be north of that, generally is a good way to think about that. And then obviously, you would still have commercial and in public sector with FED and SLED.\nKevan Krysler: And actually just to make sure there is no confusion, we are in about 45% of Fortune 500.\nCharlie Giancarlo: That\u2019s right.\nKevan Krysler: Yes, rather than it\u2019s \u2013 but then as a percentage of share of bookings, it\u2019s a good way to think about it north of 45%.\nMatt Kixmoeller: Maybe one final thing I will mention, I think often we are asked how big the flash market is and Pure from the early days has said look, don\u2019t define us in the all-flash market define us in the enterprise storage market as a whole. And we have now talked really about three key areas that I think when you ask most people in the market, they would say, no, that\u2019s still disk, where we have built substantial businesses in flash. One is in object storage, one is in backup and recovery and now Tier 2 applications. And so I think we are proving that we can really push flash into the broad part of the market that people assumed was really the disk market previously.\nErik Suppiger: Very good. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini from Susquehanna.\nMehdi Hosseini: Yes, thanks for taking my question. I actually have a follow-up to your very last statement. When I look at the backup recovery is about a $1 billion of business, 8% of external storage and then the hybrid is about half of the external storage market. And in that context, my question to you is when you announced the agreement with Cohesity, is that aimed at displacing the backup recovery with FlashArray or are you expecting incremental market opportunity? And then back to hybrid, if half of the external storage is hybrid, how quickly do you think we are going to get to a third or less, is that a matter of a year or two and an improvement in global economy or is this going to be a slow death? And I have a follow-up.\nCharlie Giancarlo: Yes, let me start with the discussion on the Cohesity partnership and then I will turn it over to Kix on the specific market sizes. So, on the Cohesity product that we are putting out, we see it as enabling \u2013 it\u2019s \u2013 think of it as an appliance that is pre-configured, easy to set up, our customers can install in less than a couple of hours and it immediately provides them with a rapid recovery solution to protect them from any data outage and in particular against ransomware attacks, etcetera. We really view that as perhaps the first in Pure of what we would call Pure-validated designs, where we simplify the task of a variety of different storage application environments for our customers, this one being ransomware attack and offered as a \u2013 in this case, as an appliance, but perhaps in the future with other partners and other solutions provided by the channel as an integrated solution.\nMatt Kixmoeller: And then just to put some numbers around that, because I am not sure I agree with the one you threw out there. The overall backup and recovery market is about $8 billion and that goes down to about half software and half hardware solutions. On the hardware side, that was traditionally just basic backup appliances historically like Data Domain. We are really going after that whole market with this partnership because we can present an opportunity to really modernize the entire backup and recovery spend to modernize the software and the hardware side of things. And so we believe it\u2019s a financial opportunity there to go after backup and recovery, and particularly drive faster recovery there. And regards to your question around the hybrid storage environment overall, look, the hybrid market for hybrid arrays is pretty broad from very large scale enterprises who deploy them in mass for their kind of Tier 2 franchises, all the way down to people who spend $5,000, $10,000, $15,000 for the only array they own. That\u2019s \u2013 latter part is not a market we\u2019re interested in going after. But we believe for large enterprises who historically used hybrid arrays as their Tier 2 platform, that\u2019s really the sweet spot for FlashArray//C and we think it\u2019s increasingly clear that when you are a large-scale enterprise, it\u2019s just too expensive to run disk anymore. And you just look at the operational pain and the overhead and the complexity and the reliability issues disk introduces, it\u2019s just time to go all-flash.\nMehdi Hosseini: Got it. Thanks for clarification. And just a quick follow-up, last quarter you highlighted FlashBlade and actually, to my surprise, you attached a $55 million of revenue you recognized in the April quarter. Anything you can share with us regarding July quarter?\nKevan Krysler: No, and actually that was a sizing we provided last quarter in connection with total sales, which is a little bit different than revenue, but we haven\u2019t updated that sizing. But we were very pleased with what we saw in terms of FlashBlade performance.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Eric Martinuzzi from Lake Street.\nEric Martinuzzi: Yes, I wanted to explicitly address the Q3 gross margin assumption, given roughly flat sequentially on the revs. You guys have talked about a long-term range between 65% and 70%, but I am wondering why Q3 gross margin would be substantially different from where we finished up Q2, given strength in international and continued growth in subscription.\nKevan Krysler: And so we did not give any formal views or informal views around gross margin. We are pleased, as you mentioned, with our performance on gross margin. I wouldn\u2019t see anything unusual as I think about our gross margin performance in Q3. I did talk about our views of operating margin for Q3 and that might be what you are referring to.\nEric Martinuzzi: Yes, I was just kind of back \u2013 you said the bulk of the delta between EBIT was on the OpEx side and I was trying to get you to explicitly talk about the GM but I got my question answered. The headcount that you saw increase there, roughly 200 between the end of Q1 and Q2, is the impact in the OpEx going to be a full quarter of the 3700 employees or do you plan to add additional heads in Q3?\nKevan Krysler: Yes, I think there will be a mix in terms of how those costs come through for Q3. And then in terms of our hiring in the second half, still looking to have some incremental hires, really focused on the innovation front and will be less so than what we saw in the first half in terms of total hiring \u2013 of net-net hiring in terms of increase of total headcount.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Katy Huberty from Morgan Stanley.\nKaty Huberty: Yes, thank you. Good afternoon. Sorry, I jumped on a little bit late. I know this has been asked a couple of times, but would love for you to double-click a bit more on the below-the-normal seasonality revenue trend in October. And specifically you have significant exposure to cloud customers, which is a great secular growth market. Do you feel like there were some pull forward of demand from those customers and so that pipeline is a little bit less mature, drier than it typically would be? Is there a lagged effect from the economic declines that we saw on the calendar second quarter? Just sort of some of the factors that you think are playing into the much weaker than seasonal outlook for the calendar of 3Q with October quarter.\nCharlie Giancarlo: Yes, Katy. Thank you. Much more of the second item that you mentioned we think, which is a delayed effect from the lowered Q2 performance by U.S. across the board, just kind of being reflected then in Q3 actual numbers. Actually, whatever acceleration we might have had from cloud in large enterprise in Q1, I don\u2019t feel that it was of such a substantial nature that it\u2019s really affecting a lot of quarters.\nKaty Huberty: Okay, thank you. And then just secondly, can you talk about the \u2013 is there any makeup of customers that are driving the really strong 37% subscription growth? Is it skewed to certain regions? Are there particular verticals that are early adopters? Like is there a trend in terms of customer size where you are seeing the demand or is it truly just broad-based across the customer set?\nCharlie Giancarlo: Well, the trend is that it actually is going to broad-based. It started out with being dominated by one or two customers a quarter, very large customers a quarter dominating the revenue that we would get in a pass deal. And now it is much more balanced across all million dollar plus customers, but just much larger numbers of them. And so that was \u2013 that\u2019s very good to see obviously, going to more broad-based and larger average customer size.\nKevan Krysler: Yes, I would actually split it out between broad-based both for the Evergreen, Charlie, which we are getting huge interest and continued interest in Evergreen. And so our strong renewal rates are definitely contributing to that. That\u2019s broad-based. And then what we are seeing on the Unified subscription is also broad-based with a lot of increase on net new logos.\nCharlie Giancarlo: Yes, yes.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Steven Fox from Fox Advisors.\nSteven Fox: Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Just on \u2013 one quick question on Slide 5. I am just trying to understand the discrepancy between how incremental purchases grow with your top-25 customers versus the overall number, which is only like $2 after the first 24 months. Is that macro related or is there some other trends in there that we should be aware of? Thank you very much.\nKevan Krysler: No, and this has been pretty consistent with what we have showed in the past, so nothing new to highlight on that front.\nSteven Fox: Okay, thank you. And then if I could just squeeze another since that one was, I guess, pretty obvious. Just on vendor discounting and vendor financing that\u2019s picked up, how is that impacting either closing deals or how you have to price deals overall? Thank you.\nCharlie Giancarlo: Yes. As you may well know, we don\u2019t provide ourselves vendor financing, instead we provide Pure as-a-service that provides pay-as-you-go consumption model, which in most cases is a less expensive and more resilient purchase capability or purchasing option for our customers because they only need to pay for what they use when they use it. And so, we have found that to be very competitive and in many ways a superior offering to vendor financing of our own gear. And it\u2019s why you see many of our competitors attempting to come up with consumption type of services on their own, but given the limitations of their products, they are rarely able to \u2013 be able to do anything similar.\nOperator: And that was our last question. At this time, I will turn the call back over to Charlie Giancarlo for closing remarks.\nCharlie Giancarlo: I want to thank you all for taking the time to join us today. Pure, like many companies, but we\u2019re very focused on how we can improve the experience of our customers and our employees. I do want to send my sympathies out to all of our West Coast employees, many of whom are not just sheltered in place, but in some cases packing up and ready to flee their homes from fires and smoke. And I want to send my thoughts and prayers out to all of them and everybody on the West Coast that are suffering from fires and frankly, also many of our suppliers that are in the eye or at least in the bull\u2019s eye of the upcoming hurricanes. So we continue to be there for you. We do believe \u2013 we continue and we believe that the investments that we make in our customers, our channels and our products in this extremely difficult period is going to truly allow us to accelerate our growth when the global economies, country by country, start to recover. So with that, let me ask you all to stay safe, stay socially connected, but physically distant, and we look forward to speaking with you next quarter. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Charlie Giancarlo",
            "content": "Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us on today's earnings call. Let me start by extending my sincere wishes that you, your family, friends and colleagues are all healthy and staying well. The current environment continues to challenge us all, but I am proud of how Pure has risen to the occasion. We are helping our customers navigate the crisis and accelerate their digital transformation during this difficult time. The ease, flexibility, and economic security of our Evergreen model has never been more necessary or appreciated by our customers. Pure's core differentiators of unmatched technology leadership, simplicity of operation, high performance, and ultimate reliability makes Pure the right decision, especially at this time. These core tenets are also the foundation of our vision of the modern data experience: data storage that is entirely automated, fully dynamic, and provides a cloud-like experience in an as-a-service model with flexible on-demand consumption responsive to the needs of the application. This modern vision is taking hold in the market. The most important characteristic of any cloud infrastructure is reliability and customers become even more acutely aware of this in times of crisis. I am pleased to announce that in Q2, Pure's FlashArray product surpassed the full seven nines of total availability across our installed base of tens of thousands of arrays, including during all upgrade cycles, which is unprecedented in our industry. To put this in perspective, seven nines is the equivalent of only 3 seconds of downtime per year. Across our product portfolio, we are delivering savings in power, cooling, and floor space driving ecological advantages and contributing to the lowest total cost of ownership at a time when economic and environmental efficiency are on the minds of our customers. And with our renowned simplicity and cloud-based Pure1 management and support, we dramatically reduced employee time managing storage, freeing them to innovate in a landscape with new demands. I am pleased with our execution during this crisis and I continue to be very confident that we will exit this downturn in a position of strength supported by our innovative technology, subscription services and a long-term vision that is aligned with customer needs. In Q1, we saw a wave of customers, many of them critical and essential businesses, coming to us to expand their applications and replace their legacy infrastructure that just couldn't keep up with the new demands brought on by the pandemic. It was a quarter that was dominated by urgent and immediate needs and our customers' previously important plans were put on hold. In contrast, Q2 was a quarter of re-planning for many organizations. Companies paused to consider the future and reassess their technology direction aligning it to the new reality that their organizations face. Although the situation remains fluid, we believe the second half of the year will see businesses return to and even accelerate digital transformation. The growth and strength we saw from our international business in the quarter provides an early, but positive indication of increased demands for our solutions when crisis levels created by COVID-19 decline. We continue to dramatically outpace our industry and innovation, and I am excited to share several technology announcements, expanded partnerships, and portfolio and subscription services momentum with you. Today, we announced the second generation of FlashArray//C, the industry's first and still only all-QLC storage solution. This offering effectively renders hybrid storage obsolete by providing flash density, performance, and reliability at lower costs than legacy hybrid disk arrays. With FlashArray//C for capacity-oriented workloads, FlashArray//X for performance-centric workloads and Cloud Block Store in the cloud, all available under our unified subscription, customers are able to consolidate a broad set of workloads onto a single platform. Late last quarter, we expanded our file portfolio with the introduction of File Services on FlashArray//C, which allows customers to further simplify and consolidate their general purpose file needs on the same platform. The combination of file support and FlashArray//C enables customers to cost effectively consolidate and run their block-based applications like VMs, databases, and VDI alongside their general-purpose file systems and user shares on a unified FlashArray platform. We continue to see strength in our FlashBlade product for addressing high performance file and object needs with a single platform. FlashBlade continues to redefine what is possible for cutting-edge analytics, real-time data, AI, and scientific workloads. The wide array of software features we delivered earlier this year and in particular file and object replication are rapidly expanding FlashBlade into additional mainstream enterprise use cases. FlashBlade is helping customers drive unparalleled consolidation across multiple workloads so that they can both modernize file and introduce high-performance object in a single platform. For example, this quarter a large media and entertainment customer selected FlashBlade to consolidate their Splunk, ElasticSearch, and Rapid Restore environments onto a single unified fast file and object platform. This quarter, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children selected FlashBlade for its high performance replicated file storage to expand and enhance their analysis and machine-learning applications used in the fight against online child exploitation. In these very trying times, it is gratifying to see the ways in which our technology is being used to help those most in need. FlashBlade's adoption to power rapid recovery and protect against ransomware continues to grow. Two weeks ago, we announced a partnership with Cohesity to introduce Pure FlashRecover. This is the first fully integrated all-flash rapid recovery solution on the market and we are excited to deliver it in Q3 with streamlined support delivered through Pure. Customer demand has been strong for an integrated solution that not only restores data rapidly in the event of an attack, but also reduces complexity, while scaling both performance and capacity to meet even petabyte-level recovery requirements. Pure's Subscription Services continue to yield great results. These services include our Evergreen program and our unified subscription, which delivers our on-prem solutions and Pure's Cloud Block Store under a single consumption experience. Our unified subscription saw continued strong growth from both existing and new customers in both cloud and enterprise segments, including Telstra, Dizzion Managed Desktop as-a-Service, BidFX and Arrow Energy. These customers are choosing our unified subscription because it is a true enterprise class utility that delivers ultimate flexibility for storage consumption. It provides a cloud-like experience on-premise with the ability to move data to the cloud at any time and align spend with actual consumption. Cloud Block Store, which is part of our unified subscription, solves one of the biggest challenges for enterprises today, how to cost effectively bridge private and public clouds for Tier 1 applications. The unified software and unified subscription of Pure as-a-Service offer both compelling cost efficiencies and high performance both on-prem and in the cloud. We have also seen strong customer adoption of our Pure Service Orchestrator software, which enables automated, stateful container storage, creating a modern container environment for developers to build cloud-native apps on-prem. Pure Service Orchestrator, combined with Cloud Block Store create a hybrid container strategy that truly unlocks the potential of Kubernetes. We believe our modern data experience vision, unique unified subscription services and hybrid cloud and container strategy, all driven by our FlashArray and FlashBlade platforms, will enable us to continue to grow and take even more market share in the coming quarters and years. Looking forward, I am confident in our opportunity, our long-term strategy, and our ability to reaccelerate growth upon exiting the global crisis, all while continuing to focus on operating discipline. We are the one company driving change in this $50 billion industry, providing an unrivaled experience that customers simply love. In closing, I am truly thankful to our employees, customers, partners and the entire Pure community for their tenacity, due diligence and flexibility to adapt to and overcome the challenges of the current environment. With that, I will turn it over to you, Kevan. You bet. Hi, Pinjalim, it's Charlie. Good to hear your voice. We had \u2013 as you heard in the prepared remarks really an excellent international quarter. And I think it reflects what happens when economies recover after a corona lockdown. So, that we felt very strong about that. And we also had very strong unified subscription and overall subscription revenues, very positive there. On a relative basis, cloud and enterprise were much stronger, but of course with the U.S. being down generally, especially in the area of commercial \u2013 right commercial and net new logos. Given that, that was down to that of course depressed overall revenues. But I wouldn't say that it was outside of commercial that it was centered on any particular area. It was really just the reduction in the U.S. overall. We did see overall across the portfolio, the kind of balance that we generally like to see in our products be it a strong FlashBlade, FlashBlade sales growth, both across the world, but again, especially in Europe and the new products are doing well. So, the balance is pretty much what we would expect, but we did see lackluster U.S. Yes, absolutely. The vast majority remains on-prem, because the cloud is a relatively new business, whereas Evergreen of course has been since our inception. And the way that a \u2013 the way that subscription operates as you build revenue, it takes time to actually build \u2013 to build revenue in it, but we are very pleased with the adoption of the cloud \u2013 of the cloud portion of the revenue. And of course, I will say that Pure as-a-Service, which includes both the ratable service-oriented sale of storage on-prem, which is combined with a subscription to Cloud Block Store has really unleashed a lot of opportunity for us and has really driven a lot of sales and in fact a lot of new customer sales. So we are very pleased with that. But there are lot of customers that certainly are planning for cloud that haven't yet made the jump, but want to make sure that the purchases that they make are both ratable that is subscription, but also transparent and allows them to move to the cloud at any time. Yes. Ittai, I don't believe so. That's the first time that I have heard that thesis to be direct. Our view is that we had seen, as Kevan mentioned, tailwinds in Q1. We did kind of expect them to continue through potentially May but that did not occur, to be clear. Also, you have to understand that, from a sales force perspective, they go from the way of selling that we and that everyone has been selling for years to where everybody is now inside sales. So it's a completely new way of selling and for customers, a new way of buying. But I think the majority, and I said this in my prepared remarks, the majority of the change was customers now living in a very new environment, both economically, but also are completely reconsidering their digital transformation and what's important to them and whenever you have a re-consideration or re-planning, you have some stasis. You have an interruption in buying patterns, and I think that's exactly what's taken place in Q2. The good news is we have seen it in Europe, that when countries come out of a \u2013 the recessionary environment, when they come out of the pandemic environment and the lockdown, then they start to reopen their purse strings and we saw a tremendous quarter in Europe. And I would expect that we would see the same country by country as they come out of the pandemic. Unfortunately in the U.S. we are going in and out repeatedly and it's almost state by state. And I think that it's certainly delayed the kind of recovery that we hope to see soon. Yes. Well, actually, let me just challenge you a little bit. I mean, we have not seen \u2013 we have seen reopening and then re-closing in the U.S. over the last couple of months. And if you just consider the infection rates and the amount of lockdown that's taken place, there is \u2013 it's a very different picture today in the U.S. than it is in Europe. And so we are still seeing the effects of a muted U.S. economic response currently. But I will let Kevan handle the second part of that question. You bet. So FlashArray//C continues to be one of the fastest product launches we have ever had. And now the second generation is not 100% QLC, but even less expensive because of that. And so we believe it's actually less expensive than hybrid arrays. So now you get an all-flash array with all-flash performance at a lower price than hybrid arrays. So \u2013 and it's a unique product in the market not only has no other vendor come up with a competitive product, no other vendors come up with a competitive announcement, which after 9 months of the first generation being in the market is really quite remarkable. Yes. Thanks, Tim. I am going to start with the \u2013 on the first part of the question around competition and let Kevan handle the gross margin side. Our win rates have stayed about the same. That's pretty much where we would like \u2013 of course, we always like to see more, but about where we would like to see. So the competition, I would think \u2013 or sorry the competition, I would say is generally consistent with prior quarters. I will say that customers have been perhaps a bit more demanding in the COVID period. So we are seeing a little bit of that, but on the \u2013 I am going to let Kevan handle the gross margin question. Yes, No, your question is right on. We did see obviously both at the beginning of the COVID period and continuing stronger results up in the enterprise accounts. It's been very \u2013 on the one hand, it's been very reassuring to us that not only has it been in existing enterprises where they have brought us in further into their infrastructure, but even winning new large enterprises with large first time sales into the large enterprise. So I believe we have now become the safe choice in many ways, even for large enterprise. But commercial is struggling as a \u2013 I think that's well known throughout all of the IT industry that commercial accounts are having a harder time in the COVID environment and that is, of course, causing us to shift how we focus our sales teams attention with putting more with shifting more resources into larger enterprise, and for the time being, managing commercial with the appropriate amount of sellers and support. Sure. As you may know \u2013 our sales in India and China and even South America are relatively small portion of our overall sales, and that tends to be where Huawei has its greatest strength. We don't see \u2013 we do see Huawei, but we don't see them a lot in Western Europe. We \u2013 they have crept up a little bit more over the years, but still a relatively small amount of our engagement is with them. With \u2013 the majority of our engagement continues to be with Dell. And frankly our win rates against Dell continue to be very strong overall. You asked about their new PowerStore, honestly, I would have expect \u2013 I did expect to see them much more often or PowerStore much more often than we have. Honestly, we see PowerMax much more often than we see PowerStore, and PowerMax was brought in as a last gasp by Dell when they were losing the account to us on extra discount. So it's \u2013 PowerStore, we think, is actually continues to be a great opportunity for us because Dell has effectively said we have to replace four products in the field, need another forklift upgrade by them. It's not a good time to be introducing a 1.0 product, which is what it is. And whenever a customer now is running up against the end of sale of those other four products, we can claim to be and we are the safe bet for them. So with our Evergreen which we introduced with our first product six or seven years ago, customers know they will never have to do a forklift upgrade again and that's been proven over six generations. So, Dell is just \u2013 they are our biggest competitor, but we feel very confident in terms of our positioning against them. Yes, it's \u2013 that's a really interesting area, and of course an up and coming one that's very important. First of all, we do believe in the container world and we believe that's going to be a very strong new set of implementations and changes that are going to be going into the entire virtualization environment. Of course, there are going to be applications that are developed directly on top of a container environment, and we feel like we are well placed with the FlashBlade to be able to support those very high-performance, very needy container environment with respect to being able to get high-speed of object in particular. But in addition to that, there will be many customers that want to transition their existing application environments over to containers to make them more portable, more resilient. And for them we have our Pure Service Orchestrator which is now in place with hundreds of customers. It enables those customers to use their existing storage environment with \u2013 in any one of our products and even with our Cloud Block Store with containerized applications that they create from their existing environments. And then again, it allows them to operate it on our Unified subscription and so forth. So we feel like we are \u2013 it's obviously a very new space, but we feel like we are \u2013 like we are innovating in the right path for those customers that are going to be increasingly developing our containers. And just to give you a sense of how far advanced we are, Pure Service Orchestrator just had a more recent release where we are actually the first to support the latest version of the CSI, Container Storage Interface put out by \u2013 in Kubernetes. So we are tracking this very closely. Both object and containers are a core area of focus for us. Thank you. We are \u2013 we continue to invest \u2013 well, first of all, I will say that it is our intention and our expectation that the company will show an operating profit for the year. And so that's the focus that we are operating on. At the same time, as we have stated at the very beginning of the crisis, we intend to continue to invest in our customers, our support and most particularly in our innovation capability and in our products because I believe what Alan Greenspan once said which is that, the one thing you know about all recessions is that they all end. And we believe that we are going to exit this recession in a position to be able to reaccelerate once we come out of it. And we think it's going to be technology-led and customers will respond and respect those vendors that continue to invest during the downturn. Yes. So I will start with the FlashBlade 3.0. This is really \u2013 it's already deployed on literally hundreds of arrays. So it's been a very fast uptake of the 3.0 and it's been really notable how many customers have deployed the fast file and object replication. And they have done it for a number of different use cases, data protection, data \u2013 excuse me, disaster recovery, and they have done it between both on-prem and public cloud sites. So the \u2013 and I think illustrative is what we just did with Cohesity. We really have designed a system with them, but we have also added additional capabilities to our product to add additional security and features with respect to ransomware so that customers can not only detect ransomware and protect themselves against it, but recover very rapidly, such as within an hour after a ransomware attack. So what \u2013 the strength, of course, of FlashBlade and especially so with the 3.0 release is that it is unified for both our fast file and object the big use cases are big data analytics, log analytics, machine learning, as we have said in the past, but increasingly, especially with the new features, chip design, genomics, geophysical modeling. So all of the \u2013 as you might imagine the high-performance use cases and then lastly, what I will mention is it's being increasingly used for mixed-use cases, which is something very different than in the past. In other words, it could be \u2013 it will be used by some customers for analytics and at the same time rapid recovery and ransomware protection, as well as just large scale file repositories all at the same time. And it can do that just because of the performance and the scale of the product. I \u2013 it's hard to say, but we do think that as the economy improves, you will see \u2013 let me phrase this another way. I think it's very clear now that the dominant view of our enterprise is that their future is hybrid, that is some combination of on-prem and in the cloud, and really what they want to do is to unify that to be able to create an environment where that choice for them is more economic than it is a decision about technologies, and where that they can negotiate both with on-prem vendors, as well as with cloud vendors to get the best possible economic and performance, as well as full application and services position that they can possibly be in. So we're seeing a very strong uptake of the hybrid cloud idea. So, what that really says is it's about \u2013 your question really goes to when those IT spending start to really recover. I think it depends a lot upon the trajectory of the pandemic in the U.S. and I would expect that when we see the \u2013 when we start to see the economy recover, that is GDP start to pick up and IT spending start to free up, that we will see a recovery and as you phrase it, a bottoming out of our on-prem equipment spend. Yes. Well, of course, one always expects the new products to grow faster than the company overall. As we mentioned, FlashArray//C has had a huge start to it. We expect that to continue to for some time, because it extends into a large market or because its part of a very large market that we didn't part to that no one has participated in before. If we look at FlashRecover, that's an \u2013 data protection is an $8 billion market and we are just getting started in that. And then if you look at our new release, which we just released in the last week of our last quarter, which is file services on FlashArray//C, standard general purpose file stores is a market that we haven't participated in at all and again is a multibillion dollar market. So, I think as we look forward 3 to 4 years if we have the kind of success in those products that we individually had in FlashBlade over the same 3 to 4-year period, we are talking well over $1 billion and close to $2 billion or more. So, it's a great \u2013 we just see great upside in the portfolio overall. And then just to answer your question on enterprise and we talked about from a new customer, total customers \u2013 our total customer base about what 45% of those are Fortune 500. And I think that's a good way to look at it. Bookings as a total share for enterprise would be north of that, generally is a good way to think about that. And then obviously, you would still have commercial and in public sector with FED and SLED. That's right. Yes, let me start with the discussion on the Cohesity partnership and then I will turn it over to Kix on the specific market sizes. So, on the Cohesity product that we are putting out, we see it as enabling \u2013 it's \u2013 think of it as an appliance that is pre-configured, easy to set up, our customers can install in less than a couple of hours and it immediately provides them with a rapid recovery solution to protect them from any data outage and in particular against ransomware attacks, etcetera. We really view that as perhaps the first in Pure of what we would call Pure-validated designs, where we simplify the task of a variety of different storage application environments for our customers, this one being ransomware attack and offered as a \u2013 in this case, as an appliance, but perhaps in the future with other partners and other solutions provided by the channel as an integrated solution. Yes, Katy. Thank you. Much more of the second item that you mentioned we think, which is a delayed effect from the lowered Q2 performance by U.S. across the board, just kind of being reflected then in Q3 actual numbers. Actually, whatever acceleration we might have had from cloud in large enterprise in Q1, I don't feel that it was of such a substantial nature that it's really affecting a lot of quarters. Well, the trend is that it actually is going to broad-based. It started out with being dominated by one or two customers a quarter, very large customers a quarter dominating the revenue that we would get in a pass deal. And now it is much more balanced across all million dollar plus customers, but just much larger numbers of them. And so that was \u2013 that's very good to see obviously, going to more broad-based and larger average customer size. Yes, yes. Yes. As you may well know, we don't provide ourselves vendor financing, instead we provide Pure as-a-service that provides pay-as-you-go consumption model, which in most cases is a less expensive and more resilient purchase capability or purchasing option for our customers because they only need to pay for what they use when they use it. And so, we have found that to be very competitive and in many ways a superior offering to vendor financing of our own gear. And it's why you see many of our competitors attempting to come up with consumption type of services on their own, but given the limitations of their products, they are rarely able to \u2013 be able to do anything similar. I want to thank you all for taking the time to join us today. Pure, like many companies, but we're very focused on how we can improve the experience of our customers and our employees. I do want to send my sympathies out to all of our West Coast employees, many of whom are not just sheltered in place, but in some cases packing up and ready to flee their homes from fires and smoke. And I want to send my thoughts and prayers out to all of them and everybody on the West Coast that are suffering from fires and frankly, also many of our suppliers that are in the eye or at least in the bull's eye of the upcoming hurricanes. So we continue to be there for you. We do believe \u2013 we continue and we believe that the investments that we make in our customers, our channels and our products in this extremely difficult period is going to truly allow us to accelerate our growth when the global economies, country by country, start to recover. So with that, let me ask you all to stay safe, stay socially connected, but physically distant, and we look forward to speaking with you next quarter. Thank you."

            "name": "Kevan Krysler",
            "content": "Thank you, Charlie and good afternoon everyone. Our Q2 financial results reflect solid execution during the headwinds of the macro environment caused by COVID-19. We are also pleased with the continued strength of our subscription services and the growth of our international business following a challenging Q1. Total revenue during Q2 grew 2% year-over-year to $403.7 million. Product revenue declined 9% year-over-year, while subscription services momentum continues as revenue grew 37% year-over-year and represented approximately 33% of total revenue, up from 24% of total revenue year-over-year. Subscription services revenue includes revenues from our Evergreen subscriptions and our unified subscription, which includes Pure as-a-Service and Cloud Block Store. We saw significant growth in our international business during Q2, while facing headwinds in the United States created by COVID-19. Total revenue in the United States during Q2 was $282 million, declining 4% year-over-year and total international revenue grew 20% year-over-year to $122 million during Q2. Given the ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty that persists I will continue to provide additional color around our sales performance. Total bookings, or sales, during the first 6 months of the year grew 8.3% year-over-year and during Q2, declined 3.3% year-over-year due to the headwinds we faced in the United States. Global channel sourced sales continued to represent a growing and meaningful percentage of our total sales. We are very pleased with the close partnership of our global channel. New customers are continuing to choose Pure. Both average deal size for new customers and FlashBlade new customers grew year-over-year. Sales to new customers choosing Pure during Q2 represent over 20% of our total sales. Across our full solution portfolio, we acquired over 350 new customers compared to over 450 customers during Q2 of the prior year. Non-GAAP gross margins for product and subscription services during Q2, was 69.8% representing a slight year-over-year increase of 0.4 points. Non-GAAP product gross margin in Q2 was 70.1%, generally consistent year-over-year and non-GAAP subscription services margin increased 1.8 points year-over-year to 69.2%. Total non-GAAP operating profit during Q2 was approximately $11 million compared to a non-GAAP operating loss of approximately $3 million during Q2 of the prior year. We continue to focus on strong operating discipline while investing thoughtfully. Non-GAAP net income during Q2 was $18 million and non-GAAP net income per share was $0.06. Non-GAAP net income in Q2 of the prior year was $3 million and non-GAAP net income per share was $0.01. Weighted average shares used for the non-GAAP net earnings per share calculation was 283 million shares in Q2 and 271 million shares in the prior year. We generated positive operating cash flows of $51 million for Q2 compared to $49 million in the prior year and free cash flows of $26 million compared to $20 million in the prior year. Total cash and investments at the end of Q2 remain very healthy at $1.29 billion. Total deferred revenue for Q2 was $725 million compared to $706 million at the end of Q1 and $607 million at the end of Q2 of the prior year. Our remaining performance obligations, or RPO, which includes our committed and non-cancelable future revenue for Q2 is nearing $1 billion at $956 million. This compares to $912 million at the end of Q1 and $770 million at the end of Q2 of the prior year. During Q2, we returned $20 million to shareholders through share repurchases of 1.18 million shares. Approximately $45 million remains for our share repurchase authorization. Total headcount at the end of the quarter was approximately 3,700 employees compared to approximately 3,500 employees at the end of Q1 and 3,300 employees at the end of Q2 of the prior year. Now moving to guidance, the growth we have achieved and our focus on operating discipline during the first half of the year is based on the core fundamentals of our business being strong despite the significant economic contraction caused by COVID-19. As we look to Q3, we expect recurring revenue and sales of our Evergreen and unified subscription services will continue to show strong growth though significant uncertainty due to COVID remains. Similar to last quarter, we believe it is still not prudent to provide formal guidance. We are pleased that our total pipeline opportunity for Q3 has increased meaningfully compared to the total pipeline opportunity we saw for Q2. However, a greater proportion of the opportunities in our Q3 pipeline are at earlier stages compared to Q2. And then although not considered formal guidance, our current internal view is that total revenues will be approximately flat sequentially. Moving to investments, we continue to exercise solid operating discipline throughout the organization, which has enabled us to invest in innovation and increased sales capacity during the first half of the year. We expect net incremental resource additions will slow during the second half of the year and will be concentrated on continued innovation. With our current views of Q3 revenue, we estimate that operating margin will be slightly below breakeven, near negative 2%. To summarize, we are continuing to innovate and successfully navigate the business during an unprecedented economic contraction, including strong growth in our Evergreen and unified subscription services. Our broad customer base, strong partnership and commitment to our channel and our strong growth in recurring revenues, positions us for long-term growth. With that, we will now open the call for questions. No, I wouldn't call out a factor on the headwind from the subscription, I really would focus it on the pipeline, and the fact that we are actually quite pleased to see what pipeline has done. It's an early signal for us, but we did see some sequential improvement in pipeline build, which we actually hadn't seen for some time. And then just the fact that that's earlier stage for us really had us come in with some informal views of where we would land for Q3 revenue. Yes, in terms of linearity, it probably was a little bit worse, as we saw it later in Q2, but nothing that I would view as out of the norms in terms of what we saw. Obviously with Q1, we saw some great tailwinds throughout the quarter, really driven by companies purchasing for mission-critical events and needs. And as a result of that tailwind dissipating in Q2, we saw more normalized linearity. For sure. And on net new logos for customers, as I said in my prepared remarks, it actually is quite substantial for us. And even in this quarter, the amount of bookings really generated from net new logos was over 20%, which we were quite pleased with. And just as a quick follow-on to Charlie's point, any upside that we get on the U.S. has not been considered in our Q3 and formal views, to Charlie's points that he laid out in terms of the uncertainty and timing and extent of the U.S. recovery. But if there is a significant recovery that we see in Q3, we would see that come through on our results as well. Yes, absolutely. When we think about the expansion over deferred, especially sequentially throughout the last several quarters that's really due to the momentum that we are seeing from a unified subscription business, that's really the primary driver of that. And then before that we may have some integrated sales of solutions that are unbilled that would be part of the RPO balance that would not be in deferred revenue, but as we see the sequential increases over the last several quarters that's really being driven by unified subscription momentum. Yes. Thanks, Charlie. And just to reiterate what Charlie indicated, our win rates have been solid and consistent even compared to pre-COVID. So that was a great signal for us as we look at it from the competitive landscape. Back to gross margins and product gross margins, we really do continue to be pleased with our gross margin performance, which is in line with our long-term view and really best in industry. Gross margins were year-over-year relatively consistent. We did see some movement as you suggested sequentially, Tim. I would attribute that to really kind of two factors, one is growth of our international business was representing a higher proportion of our sales and that was a factor in this quarter as our international business traditionally has a little bit lower product gross margins and there was also some larger opportunities we saw during this quarter, where we made an investment in terms of pricing. These are opportunities where we are very excited about the long-term opportunities, including follow-on purchases and commits from these customers. And then in specific to Q3 in terms of current views, any of the views that we have seen early days really were part of what we have shared in our prepared remarks and how we're looking at Q3 in terms of our internal views and the informal guide. But that also plays into how \u2013 what we are seeing on pipeline in terms of increasing pipeline build sequentially from what we saw in Q2. We really look at that, Nehal, as a Unified subscription, because that's how we sell it, that's how we go to market and so when we look at our subscription services as a category, you really have really two major categories, one being Evergreen, which has been out there for some time and is still growing at an accelerated rate, and the other one is our Unified subscription. But we don't track to \u2013 nor do we talk about it from a public standpoint, the breakout of our Unified subscription, given that our selling motion and how customers are utilizing at both on-prem and in the cloud, it doesn't make a lot of sense for us. And actually just to make sure there is no confusion, we are in about 45% of Fortune 500. Yes, rather than it's \u2013 but then as a percentage of share of bookings, it's a good way to think about it north of 45%. No, and actually that was a sizing we provided last quarter in connection with total sales, which is a little bit different than revenue, but we haven't updated that sizing. But we were very pleased with what we saw in terms of FlashBlade performance. And so we did not give any formal views or informal views around gross margin. We are pleased, as you mentioned, with our performance on gross margin. I wouldn't see anything unusual as I think about our gross margin performance in Q3. I did talk about our views of operating margin for Q3 and that might be what you are referring to. Yes, I think there will be a mix in terms of how those costs come through for Q3. And then in terms of our hiring in the second half, still looking to have some incremental hires, really focused on the innovation front and will be less so than what we saw in the first half in terms of total hiring \u2013 of net-net hiring in terms of increase of total headcount. Yes, I would actually split it out between broad-based both for the Evergreen, Charlie, which we are getting huge interest and continued interest in Evergreen. And so our strong renewal rates are definitely contributing to that. That's broad-based. And then what we are seeing on the Unified subscription is also broad-based with a lot of increase on net new logos. No, and this has been pretty consistent with what we have showed in the past, so nothing new to highlight on that front."

            "name": "Matt Kixmoeller",
            "content": "Yes, this is Kix. I mean, I will just add on specific to your question on the object part of it. When we developed FlashBlade 4 years plus ago now, we made a bet to make it a unified file and object platform. And frankly at the time, people looked at that and said, object, that's the protocol people usually use for low-end, low-performance, low-cost storage. What's there \u2013 what's the reason for an all-flash object store? But the reason has really been cloud-native and modern applications that are increasingly using object as their primary storage and so just a great part of our FlashBlade business has been the growth of object. And as you brought in the edge architectures, we very commonly see data created at the edge, but then centralized for an analytics and that ability to have an on-prem centralized really fast object store for analytics of data and IoT-type deployments is a key use case. And one we expect will keep growing. Yes. One other data point I might just add, if you look at the overall enterprise storage market, we are still in a zone where more disc is sold than flash and flash has obviously come in and eroded all of the high-end of the use cases. But there is still a lot of hybrid arrays that are sold out there that are a little bit of flash and a lot of disc on the back end. One of the unique things now with FlashArray//C, when we first launched it, we talked about how it got kind of in the neighborhood of hybrid arrays, we now believe it's substantially less expensive to deploy FlashArray//C than a hybrid array, about 30% cheaper. And so as we talk to our larger scale enterprise customers, it's just becoming a no-brainer to not to look beyond the Tier 1 and now look at their Tier 2 franchises that used to really have hybrid arrays to have the final transition to flash happen. Maybe one final thing I will mention, I think often we are asked how big the flash market is and Pure from the early days has said look, don't define us in the all-flash market define us in the enterprise storage market as a whole. And we have now talked really about three key areas that I think when you ask most people in the market, they would say, no, that's still disk, where we have built substantial businesses in flash. One is in object storage, one is in backup and recovery and now Tier 2 applications. And so I think we are proving that we can really push flash into the broad part of the market that people assumed was really the disk market previously. And then just to put some numbers around that, because I am not sure I agree with the one you threw out there. The overall backup and recovery market is about $8 billion and that goes down to about half software and half hardware solutions. On the hardware side, that was traditionally just basic backup appliances historically like Data Domain. We are really going after that whole market with this partnership because we can present an opportunity to really modernize the entire backup and recovery spend to modernize the software and the hardware side of things. And so we believe it's a financial opportunity there to go after backup and recovery, and particularly drive faster recovery there. And regards to your question around the hybrid storage environment overall, look, the hybrid market for hybrid arrays is pretty broad from very large scale enterprises who deploy them in mass for their kind of Tier 2 franchises, all the way down to people who spend $5,000, $10,000, $15,000 for the only array they own. That's \u2013 latter part is not a market we're interested in going after. But we believe for large enterprises who historically used hybrid arrays as their Tier 2 platform, that's really the sweet spot for FlashArray//C and we think it's increasingly clear that when you are a large-scale enterprise, it's just too expensive to run disk anymore. And you just look at the operational pain and the overhead and the complexity and the reliability issues disk introduces, it's just time to go all-flash."

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today [indiscernible], Investor Relations for Pure Storage. Thank you. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Company Speaker: Thank you and good afternoon. Welcome to the Pure Storage first quarter fiscal 2021 earnings call. My name is [indiscernible] Investor Relations at Puree Storage. Joining me today are our CEO, Charlie Giancarlo; and our CFO; Kevan Krysler; and our VP of Strategy, Matt Kixmoeller. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that during this call, management will make forward-looking statements which are subject to various risks and uncertainties. These include statements regarding the COVID-19 pandemic and related disruptions, our growth in sales prospects, competitive industry and technology trends; our strategy and its advantages, our current and future product offerings and business and operations including our operating model. Any forward-looking statements that we make are based on facts and assumptions as of today and we undertake no obligation to update them. Our actual results may differ materially from the results forecasted and reported results should not be considered as an indication of future performance. A discussion of some of the risks and uncertainties relating to our business is contained in our filings with the SEC and we refer you to these public filings. During the call, we will discuss non-GAAP measures in talking about the company's performance and reconciliations of the most directly comparable GAAP measures are provided in our earnings press release and slides. This call is being broadcast live on the Pure Storage IR Web site and is being recorded for playback purposes. An archive of the webcast will be available on the IR Web site and is the property of Pure Storage. With that I'll turn the call over to our CEO, Charlie Giancarlo.\nCharlie Giancarlo: Good afternoon everyone. Thank you for joining us on today's earnings call. I hope you, your family, friends, and colleagues are all healthy and staying well. As you will have noted at the beginning of this call, Matt Danziger, our Head of Investor Relations is no longer with us. Matt died unexpectedly last month from a non-COVID-related heart attack, due to an undiagnosed genetic cardiovascular disease. Matt was healthy, vital, and intelligent and always a joy to work with and spend time with. He touched the lives of everyone he met and his passing has saddened us all. Our hearts go out to his family and friends. I'd also like to take a moment to share my thoughts on the current health crisis that has affected everyone around the world. Some of you may know that I contracted COVID-19 in mid-March, and that experience has provided me with a deep personal appreciation for this virus and its impact. The changes in people's lives and livelihoods are truly extraordinary, and our expectations of what is or will be normal is forever changed. Every day, each new report on the crisis brings an uneasy mixture of anxiety, uncertainty, and hope about the future. The global Pure team has had the great fortune of being able to work virtually. So, we are inspired by and appreciative of the world's first responders and essential workers. We thank all those who have provided the services that have been critical to meeting our basic needs and tending to the well-being of others during this time. Within Pure, every group has handled this crisis with courage and responsibility, steadfast in their mission to help our customers and our company. We continue to demonstrate that Pure has best-in-class teams, and that our products and services are simple, reliable, and trusted. It is this potent combination that enables Pure to solve the critical and immediate needs of our current and new customers. This past quarter especially, we were proud to be relied on to deliver products and services to critical infrastructure on the front lines, including hospitals, labs, governments, schools, banks, communication systems, research institutions, and first responders. Our highly automated systems enabled customers and our partners to remotely install and manage our products and solutions within an hour or two rather than days. A major state government was hit with a ransomware attack in the early days of the crisis. Pure was able to rapidly deliver our ransomware solution providing protection against future attacks. A major collaboration network increased their pure footprint after a huge increase in traffic and demand from new customers due to COVID-19. The customer chose Pure because they experienced failures in their installed base of legacy solutions under the high load and were unable to obtain new product from those vendors to scale their systems. Pure was able to deliver and install Pure solutions into the customer\u2019s production network within 24 hours of our first call. A retail customer suddenly needed all of their employees to work from home when previously few did, rapidly increasing the load on their infrastructure. We've made this a smooth transition with robust remote capabilities and Pure as-a-Service, our true multi-cloud, consumption-based contract. In each case, Pure was able to deliver and install products expeditiously, enabling customers to be in full production within 72 hours and in some cases sooner from the first call. Our technology is also enabling those in search of a cure for this scourge or tracing the spread of the virus or in analyzing the structure and behavior of the disease. We have donated our products to companies involved in the fight against COVID-19 including shipping FlashBlades to Folding@home, an organization focused on simulating the dynamics of COVID-19 proteins to find new therapeutic solutions through crowd computing. I am proud of our supply chain and customer support performance and resiliency, which not only maintained the high level of service and support our customers demand, but went above those expectations to serve customers with critical needs. Pure\u2019s global supply chain strategy and our now fully tested business continuity plan prepared us well for this crisis. We continue to lead with innovation across all aspects of the business and our performance this past quarter was another validation of our modern data experience strategy, helping customers transform their storage operations to be simple, reliable, fast, and flexible. I was very pleased with our financial performance for this past very unique quarter as year-over-year revenues grew 12% to $367 million. Our revenue performance was broad based across all products and services, including the continuing strength in our FlashBlade offering and our subscription services. Sales of our portfolio solutions, including both FlashArray and FlashBlade together continued to grow and existing customers increased their footprint in the quarter. FlashBlade solution sales to both new and existing customers also grew year-over-year and now represent approximately 15% of our total sales. Earlier this month, we announced the release of Purity 3.0 on FlashBlade, which adds significant new features to the world's most performant file and object platform. In this latest release, we've added simple and efficient file and object replication for disaster recovery in hybrid cloud as well as Kerberos and NFS 4.1 support. These features expand FlashBlade\u2019s broad range of use cases including modern analytics, rapid restore, and ransomware. Customers have rewarded our leadership and innovation with nearly 100 organizations to date each spending more than $1 million in FlashBlade to consolidate their unstructured data for their growing list of modern, high-performance applications. Pure's subscription services had an outstanding quarter. Subscription services include our non-disruptive Evergreen services, Pure as-a-Service, and Cloud Block Store for multi-cloud environments. Evergreen reduces the risk and economics for customers by ensuring that Pure's on-premise systems never grow old. After seven years, competitors are still playing catch up to Pure's Evergreen program of continuous non-disruptive upgrades, providing customers a subscription to innovation rather than a contract for obsolescence. But Pure has leapfrogged yet again with our Pure as-a-Service offering, also reducing the risk and economics of storage in the multi-cloud age. Customers leveraging Pure as-a-Service have the flexibility to determine their cash and capital commitments in the short as well as the long term, the flexibility to own or to subscribe and the flexibility to change where they place their data at any time. They have the freedom of a multi-cloud contract for storage and to only pay for what they use, when they use it, regardless of where they place their data. Customer flexibility through Pure as-a-Service is the right option in this uncertain COVID environment, particularly in a period where it may be difficult to predict long-term requirements. In Q1, a large U.S. national bank as a net new logo made a multimillion dollar commitment to Pure's entire portfolio and specifically our Pure as-a-Service offering to transform their storage needs and move off of a legacy vendor\u2019s disruptive refresh storage model. This pandemic has changed the way we work with the speed far beyond any pundit\u2019s predictions for technology alone. There is an increased and likely permanent customer demand for greater hands-free management, automation, consolidation, and flexible consumption models. Pure has a great lead in these capabilities as I shared in the customer examples and demand and interest for Pure as-a-Service has increased dramatically. Moving on to Q2. It is now right to state that there are uncertainties in the global economy and unpredictability in the IT market as customers focus on the urgent push out the nearly important and reassess ongoing IT initiatives. Customers are reevaluating their spending in all areas as they navigate their own challenging environments. We have taken these dynamics and uncertainties into account with our measured Q2 expectations. Looking beyond the quarter, I am confident that we can navigate the choppy waters of our market. We remain committed to our long-term priorities while managing expenses prudently. We will continue to take market share with our superior and differentiated technology, services and customer first culture. And I am confident that we will lead the market exiting the recession. As we go forward and shelter in place orders are lifted around the world, Pure will continue to do its part to protect our people and guard against community spread of this virus. Our dedicated crisis planning team meets daily to manage our global response to the pandemic. We have regional phase plans based on local conditions to carefully reintegrate employees into the workplace, while planning for a large fraction to continue working from home for some time. We will do what's right for Pure, our customers, our teams around the world and each and every employee. Lastly, I'd like to take a moment to thank our global employees executing as one virtual team for their tenacity, focus and genuine enthusiasm to help our customers, our partners, their teammates and local communities throughout this crisis. If anything, our teams are more connected than ever. Personally, I have enjoyed our new routine of interacting with the entire company weekly through virtual all hands broadcasts. I look forward to connecting with all of you and the broader Pure community, our customers and partners at our Accelerate Digital and Pure Partner Digital events on June 9 and 10. And with that, I'll turn it over to Kevan.\nKevan Krysler: Thank you, Charlie. Financial performance during Q1 was solid, despite significant economic disruption during a difficult and constantly changing environment. Total Revenue during Q1 was $367 million growing 12% year-over-year, product revenue was $247 million growing 3% year-over-year and subscription services revenue was $120 million growing 37% year-over-year, which includes revenues from our Evergreen subscriptions, Pure as-a-Service and Cloud Block Store. Subscription services revenue represented approximately 33% of total revenue during Q1. Total revenue in the United States during Q1 was $264 million growing at 15% year-over-year and total international revenue in Q1 was $103 million growing 5% year-over-year. Given the current environment that we are navigating, I will provide some additional color around our sales performance during the quarter. Total bookings or sales during Q1 grew 24% year-over-year and is broadly diversified across industry verticals and customers. Sales during Q1 to our enterprise and government customers in the United States were solid and growing, while we saw overall weakness in our commercial business. We are pleased with our partnership and continued momentum from our channel partners worldwide. Global channel source sales continues to represent a growing and meaningful percentage of our total sales. New customers acquired during Q1 were approximately 300 customers compared to approximately 350 customers during Q1 of the prior year. Our business during Q1 benefited from increased demand of mission critical IT needs arising in response to the unprecedented pandemic. We fulfill these orders without significant delays and supply shortages based on the remarkable efforts and resilience of our global supply chain and manufacturing operations. Partially offsetting this tailwind, we saw an increase in opportunities in our pipeline that were expected to close during the quarter but did not close. Non-GAAP gross margins in the quarter for product and subscription services continue to be solid and are a result of our product solution differentiation in the market. Total non-GAAP gross margin in Q1 was 71.9% increasing 3.8 points year-over-year. Now non-GAAP product gross margin in Q1 was 73.3% increasing 4.6 points year-over-year and non-GAAP subscription services margin in Q1 was 68.9% increasing 2.6 points year-over-year. Total non-GAAP operating loss during Q1 was approximately $5 million compared to a non-GAAP operating loss of approximately $31 million during Q1 of the prior year. Reduced travel, marketing and depreciation expenses as well as slower than planned hiring contributed to lower non-GAAP operating losses. Non-GAAP net loss during Q1 was $4 million and non-GAAP net loss per share was $0.02. Non-GAAP net loss in Q1 of the prior year was $28 million and non-GAAP net loss per share was $0.11. Weighted average shares used for the non-GAAP net loss per share calculation was 263 million shares in Q1 and 245 million shares in Q1 of the prior year. Operating cash flow for Q1 was $35 million and was $7 million in Q1 of the prior year. Operating cash flows during Q1 benefited in part from strong collections of our receivables. Free cash flow for Q1 was $11 million and was a negative $18 million in the prior year. Total cash and investments at the end of Q1 was $1.27 billion compared to $1.3 billion at the end of fiscal 2020. We have a very strong balance sheet that provides us with flexibility to handle a wide range of scenarios. Total deferred revenue for Q1 was $706 million, compared to $697 million at the end of fiscal 2020 and $564 million at the end of Q1 of the prior year. We are pleased to see the continued growth in our multiple subscription service offerings. During Q1 we returned to $70 million to shareholders through share repurchases of 5.96 million shares approximately $65 million remains for a share repurchase authorization. Total headcount at the end of the quarter was approximately 3,500 employees, compared to approximately 3,400 employees at the end of fiscal 2020 and 3,150 employees at the end of Q1 of the prior year. Now moving to annual guidance, the core fundamentals of our business remains strong. However, we are withdrawing our annual guidance given significant uncertainty around demand for the remainder of the year due to the global economic contraction caused by COVID-19. As we progress through the year, we expect to continue to see strength in sales and adoption of our subscription services. Our Pure as-a-Service and Cloud Block Store unified subscription offerings also continue to gain momentum, offering increasing flexibility and how our technology is consumed, providing customers with a cloud like business model. Our pipeline generation for the second half of the year continues to grow, but it is unclear how and when these opportunities will convert given the current economic environment. Moving to investments, we continue to be disciplined on our spending levels and are focused on operating expense savings initiatives and tight capital spend oversight. Our investments in areas of innovation and quota carrying capacity will continue in a prudent manner with ongoing monitoring of our business plan and conditions. Now let's move to the second quarter. For similar reasons while we were pulling our annual guidance, we are also not providing guidance for Q2. We expect customers purchasing our solutions for their mission critical IT infrastructure and digital transformation needs will continue to provide a tailwind. However, we expect this benefit to be more than offset during Q2 by customers who decide to pause IT infrastructure projects. Our diverse customer base and our growing recurring revenue derived from our subscription services will provide a level of mitigation. However, the range of potential outcomes are many and widely distributed. Our current view of Q2 outcomes, which should not be viewed as guidance is that sales will be near flat year-over-year and our operating profit will be near breakeven. To summarize, our business priorities and long-term growth objectives have not changed as we've delivered solid financial results while navigating in a very challenging environment. With that, we will now open the call for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Pinjalim Bora from JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nPinjalim Bora: The booking number seems pretty good and seems like you're tracking above your -- at least the annual goal that you had given us last quarter. Can you talk about maybe the mix of use cases driving that? Is that primarily VDI related and how do you feel that tailwind of VDI and end user computing kind of falls off for the next part of the rest of the year? And secondly, when I look into your DR, deferred revenue sequential add, the sequential add seems pretty low versus historicals. So where can we see this -- have these bookings number, is that mainly going to be in the RPO? Where can we see that overall? Thank you.\nCharlie Giancarlo: Pinjalim, thank you for the question. And again, for everybody in the audience, I just want to say that I wish you all well, and I hope you're faring well during this crisis. We really saw Pinjalim a very balanced demand for product. Certainly, VDI was one of the major use cases out there, but there were many others as well. We saw positive buying for all sorts of infrastructure needs because of not just work from home, but the higher levels of, of Internet commerce that took place for many, many customers, not to mention a greater service provider needs, et cetera. So, I'll tell you, it was a very balanced quarter overall, all products doing very well. As we mentioned in our comments, we did see a good strong strength in U.S. enterprise, whereas we did see weakness in the commercial segment, which I don't think should surprise anybody on the call. And for the second question, I think I'll pass it over to Kevan.\nKevan Krysler: Thanks, Charlie. Yes. In specific to deferred revenue, we're pleased with really both our sequential and year-over-year deferred revenue growth. As a reminder, sequentially, we're coming off the seasonally highest quarter, which would be Q4. So that's going to have some impact when you're looking at deferred revenue sequentially, but you are correct, as well that as we're growing our subscription offerings, there's an off-balance-sheet component that\u2019s also growing that's included in RPO, and that's going to have an impact as well.\nOperator: Your next question comes from George Iwanyc from Oppenheimer.\nGeorge Iwanyc: Charlie, can you give us a sense of how the monthly trends have proceeded from April into May?\nCharlie Giancarlo: Yes. Well, May is very early. As you know, we do have -- quarters themselves build as we go along month by month as we go along the quarter, so it's still relatively early in May, and it's very hard, I would say for us to be able to project the quarter on May alone. We did see, I will say, and we don't generally comment on this, but we did see very good linearity overall in Q1. And again, it's hard to predict what Q2 looks like from what we have so far in May.\nGeorge Iwanyc: All right. And just following up on that, can you give us a sense of how your sales motion is going from the disruption and moving to work from home, have you been able to keep that pretty smooth through the transition?\nCharlie Giancarlo: George that is actually a great question. If anything, we've seen higher productivity in sales from the work-in-home environment. I have to tell you that I probably see -- I'm probably communicating with twice the number of customer executives now that I'm working from home, and the same is pretty much true with our sales team. It takes less than a week to get an appointment, people are available, the meetings themselves are very efficient, meetings that in person would take a month or two to set up, and then take hours to have the meeting and to convey everything you want to convey, probably get done in about two thirds of the time. And the meetings themselves are -- as I mentioned, it doesn't take much time to set up, and we're seeing that across our sales base. That is to say it's been easier to get access to higher levels in the customer base. And these have been very potent and very hard hitting meetings. So if anything, I expect that we're going to see sales in a B2B environment, permanently take on more of a virtual digital technique to them.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Wamsi Mohan from Bank of America.\nWamsi Mohan: Charlie, happy to hear of your recovery from COVID-19 and we all will miss Matt as well, thoughts with his family. Can you give us some more color on your comment about I know it's not explicit guidance but your expectation around the flattish performance year-on-year. What sort of assumptions are backing that expectation, I mean, we're not holding that as guidance. We understand that, but what are the puts and takes that sort of get you there, any color there would be helpful? And I'll follow up.\nCharlie Giancarlo: Sure. The puts and takes are that on the positive side, we do still expect some amount of the positive COVID influence that took place in Q1. That is some continued pull in and finishing of the urgent issues that that customers have either for work from home, school from home, higher web traffic, and transactions and so forth. So we're expecting some increase in that. But we're, let's not forget, in Q1, we had about half a quarter of a normal pre-COVID, which we are not going to have here. And then we're expecting on the takes the full impact of a lower global economy start to kick in as well, and it\u2019s -- the difficulty in projecting is the balance between those two things.\nKevan Krysler: I had a couple other points on that. Obviousl, we're staying really close to the field as we always do, and their inputs are really weighted pretty heavily for us as we're thinking about Q2. And when we think about the headwinds for Q2, really it's around the increased risk of how the opportunities in Q2 will convert and the timing of those conversions is really the big question mark for us. And then, looking at the commercial space in the middle market, obviously there was some softness there that we expect to be a continued headwind for us. But those were factors that we were thinking about on the tailwind side. And really, on the headwind, we're also looking at increased recurring revenue that we would expect over time to be a larger portion of our total revenue, which will be a mitigating factor for us as well.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Simon Leopold from Raymond James.\nSimon Leopold: Also extend my condolences on Matt, and Charlie glad you're feeling better as well. So certainly crazy environment for sure. One of the things I wanted to see if you could help us understand is the trending between new and existing customers in that, I would imagine it's harder to land new customers, and I think in the past, you've talked about your revenue split typically around 25% new and 75% existing. If we could get a sense of what your thoughts are on that trend given the current circumstances.\nCharlie Giancarlo: Yes. It's a great question Simon for a couple of reasons, and it's a somewhat complex makeup. So, you saw in our accompanying materials, you saw our new customer add this past quarter slightly lower than last year. It\u2019s made up of two things. One is yes, indeed, the commercial market slowing down and new customers a little bit harder to come by, given the risk aversion that's taking place in the market, given COVID again. But at the same time, we started transitioning as you may know more towards an enterprise orientation. And so the quality of -- we've been focusing our sales teams more and more on the quality of the net new logo, rather than just the number of net new logos, and we feel that's starting to kick in quite a bit, so the lower numbers a mix of those two things. Thirdly, what I would say is that there is a general risk aversion out there in the market, whether it's new products, new features, new vendors, and that's going to be with us for a quarter or two until I think the customers have started being able to feel comfortable in putting time into testing. It's really the fact that the urgency has been so high to do something that they've not wanted to take risk. Once they have time, once they've settled the urgency and they can then focus on the slightly longer term we think that the ability to convert new customers again will come back.\nKevan Krysler: I will just add a couple of notes to that in terms of the existing customers clearly we're seeing an expanding footprint as Charlie mentioned and what is interesting on the new customer front, is if we pull out the new customers from commercial or mid market, we actually have an increase year-over-year in sales, which was a significant positive, really going back to the strength we're seeing elsewhere, including enterprise, even for new customers.\nSimon Leopold: And I don't think you mentioned anything about supply chain constraints. And that had been a recurring theme from reports earlier in the quarter. Did you confront any issues in terms of just getting components or factory capacity?\nCharlie Giancarlo: Well, you need to look at it from two sides, as I've told my supply chain team, they looked as smooth as a duck on water, but of course, underneath the surface, their feet were paddling like crazy. From a customer standpoint, there was absolutely zero interruption of supply chain. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we were able to supply product within 24 hours of first call, and there were very few instances of delay and if there was, it was a delay of a day or two. So really, no supply chain interruptions and that was true on the subscription service chain as well. So, very, very proud of our supply chain and service, our operations and service people. It does reflect by the way as it wasn't just pure dumb luck. It reflects partially the design of our product which had very little dependence on China, just sub assemblies. But it also reflected the global nature -- distributed nature of our supply chain that didn't have a high concentration of supply in any one area.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Katy Huberty from Morgan Stanley.\nKaty Huberty: We were devastated by the news of Matt's passing but I know he'd be really proud of the operational execution this quarter. Had a couple of questions. First, Charlie, do you have a view at this point as to whether July will be the trough in demand, or is it just too early to tell? And then a follow up for Kevan's, what percentage of the subscription services today is Pure as-a-Service and Cloud Block Store versus traditional Evergreen maintenance?\nCharlie Giancarlo: Katy, thank you for all the support that you've provided to Matt and/or Matt's family, we really do very much appreciate that. It's very difficult to predict July because one might predict July, if one feels that the effects of COVID or moving beyond us or moving past us at this point. But if we've learned anything from these pandemics from the past is that they can come back and they can come back, as early as late summer. So I would tend to agree that if we continue to see the slowdown of COVID, that July might be the watermark. But I don't think we can say that, there's a lot of unknown, there are some true unknowns that we want to make sure that we're prepared for. And one of those is we don't really know what this virus will do later in the year.\nKevan Krysler: And then Katie, on your second question around breaking out Pure as-a-Service and Cloud Block Store, we aren't breaking out that specifically, a little bit of color though, especially on Pure as-a-Service. Very happy with the results and the momentum and the interest we're seeing, really around the unified subscription, both of Pure as-a-Service and in Cloud Block Store, such is the fact that we had a customer -- enterprise customer commit to an eight figure deal with us this quarter, which we're really excited to see. But look, our priority is really around providing customers with flexibility and how and where they're choosing to consume our technology whether that's on-prem, whether that's a multi-cloud environment or [indiscernible], which really all our subscription offerings are enabling. And so we're pretty excited about the momentum overall of all our subscription offerings, including a PaaS and Cloud Block Store.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Jason Ader from William Blair.\nJason Ader: Charlie, my question is on the whole potential acceleration of the shift to the cloud from COVID-19. Obviously, many people believe that's going to be happening here or has already happened? How do you think that affects your business? Does that create more headwinds for the on-prem storage part of your business in the near to medium term? Just maybe walk us through that how you're thinking about that?\nCharlie Giancarlo: Yes. I think it's very much summed up in the reasoning behind and the construction of our Pure as-a-Service offering. And what I mean by that is our view is that yes, there's going to be and there is increased demand for cloud-based solutions. But customers have to migrate from being on-prem to the cloud. What we saw in Q1 was that the urgency was to beef up what they currently had in and that was largely on-prem. But they wanted the option, they didn't want to sign-on to five years of more on-prem or anything along those lines. They wanted the option of being able to move to the cloud at any point in time. And that's exactly what our Pure as-a-Service is designed to do in several respects. Not only economically, that is to say it's a single unified contract, a single unified subscription that allows them to place their data wherever they want. But also in the sense that it's the same exact software and same interface to the application environment, in the cloud, as it is on-prem and that makes their ability to migrate their applications even easier. And so I think the answer is, yes. But with our unified subscription, it's equal to us. And we're very glad to have not just our unified subscription offering, but an account plan for our account reps that's equal to them, regardless of which way -- what they sell. And so, we were optimistic with respect to the offerings that we have out there. We're hopeful that in fact, more of it will move to pass and to cloud data services. And we think that, we're roughly in line with our customers in terms of the timing by which they'll do that.\nJason Ader: And quick one for you, Kevan. Did you quantify the subscription impact on Q1 in terms of revenue growth?\nKevan Krysler: Yes. We kind of laid out in our prepared remarks the subscription growth as well as what it represents in terms of total revenue, which is increasing. And so we have that in the prepared remarks.\nCharlie Giancarlo: But we did not just to be clear, we did not convert that to what it would have been had it been a perpetual, had it been an equipment capital sale.\nJason Ader: That's correct. That's correct. But you had 12% revenue growth, would that have been 14% or 15%? Did you say that in the performance? I didn't see that.\nKevan Krysler: Did not. And that's what Charlie was\u2026\nCharlie Giancarlo: We didn't make that conversion. And we were not -- it turns out, there's a lot of puts and takes and any conversion would be inaccurate. And so we've decided not to do it.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Tim Long from Barclays.\nTim Long: Also, condolences to Matt's family and thankfully you're feeling better Charlie. Two questions for me first. Just give us an update on FlashArray C sounds like FlashBlade is moving along well maybe just let us know how that rollout or that take for that has been? And then second, and the gross margin has been a really strong performance wanted to kind of ask about competition and pricing, but it doesn't seem like that's a problem. So maybe any comments on kind of sustainability of that strength that we're seeing in the gross margin line both product and overall? Thank you.\nCharlie Giancarlo: Absolutely. As far as [color on C] [ph], we're very pleased with its continued performance in our revenue base and with the customer acceptance. We've had several very large deployments of C. We've also had a good uptake of C, just individually by new customers. And it's been nine months roughly, since we introduced it. And of course, there's no competitive product out there that even that had been introduced or even comes close to see. So it's an open field for us right now. And we're seeing the power portfolio as well, because it's really allowing us now to go into customers. And I would say, as of two years ago, we were pretty much still a unique product offering with a great but niche product. And now customers are saying, gee, we can use Pure across a wide variety or even all of our storage needs and that's really been a great benefit to us as we've penetrated further and further into the enterprise.\nKevan Krysler: And then I'll hit gross margin, in terms of how we're thinking about gross margin and really, our long-term view of gross margin remains unchanged. We're very pleased with the performance both on product gross margin and on our subscription services gross margin. And it really is the product of the design of our product solutions, in particular, our software IP and development. And we say that each and every quarter and that continues to be true. And that's where the value is. That's where the customers are seeing the value. And that's really where the competitive differentiation is and while we're competing head to head on cost, the value of the software is really driving the results of what you're seeing on gross margin, but again, our long range view on gross margin hasn't changed.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Karl Ackerman from Cowen.\nKarl Ackerman: Charlie or Kevin, two questions, if I may. First, while you're not enacting any restructuring actions, like one of your peers, just kind of curious and how much room do you have to rein in on the OpEx side, if demand works remained subdued for next few quarters? And I guess on COGS, I understand that your software stack is the largest driver, but some component costs have risen in the first half a year. It really just kind of both off the shelf SSPs, but also flash controllers with some of these extended lead times. But you expect that to reverse. Where are these component cost can actually be a tailwind in the second half? Have a quick follow up.\nCharlie Giancarlo: Yes, terrific. Thank you so much, Karl. Look, it's really my personal goal that we not have any layoffs or furloughs this year. And every Puritan in the company is dedicated to put into the kind of performance that we need to make sure that's the case, to pick up market share to drive the company to support our customers. But, as we look at the both the quarter and the year and as we look going forward, we believe we're going to be able to perform in such a way that we will not have layoffs or furloughs. And as I said, it's my personal mission to make sure that's the case. We believe that we're going -- there are lots of activities that we can undertake to make the company more, both more productive, but also more efficient. And as you might imagine, we've been very busy identifying those and taking that, of course, we're saving a lot already on T&E and large events, which is very positive, but I feel that as long as we can operate the company at or near breakeven that and that we can do so this year. We will not need to have any restructuring actions associated with it. Now, I do to preempt perhaps a follow up question. We did have a restructuring early in the year that was planned last year even before any thoughts around COVID but that was really a rebalancing action inside the company. Because as like any company as you go forward, there are times when you deploy people and resources in areas and over time you want them to really to be in other areas that are more productive. And that's what we went through early in the year that resulted in a small number of people being displaced. But that was not an economic consideration. It was a rebalancing.\nKevan Krysler: And then just real quick on your question on -- really in particular probably NAND pricing is what you're getting at. We did see stabilization of pricing, including during Q1. In fact, we saw NAND pricing really rising modestly in Q1. As one might expect, the data is mixed for us when we're looking at the second half across the board. There are some indicators that pricing may decline later in the year. But when we take a step back, we're looking at a much more normalized pricing environment throughout the year compared to what we saw in the second half of last year.\nKarl Ackerman: Yes. Thanks for that. Just, I know you're not providing a full year quantitative outlook, which makes sense given just some limited demand visibility. But can you speak qualitatively of how you see the growth trajectory of your hardware business? I asked, because since you last reported, VMware added support of Rocky and professional network fabrics. Doesn't that eliminate one of the largest impediments to NVMe over fabric implementation? Given that you're more angrier than peers, how does that influence your view on the forward trajectory of your all flash array hardware? Thank you.\nMatt Kixmoeller: Just on the point around VMware support from NVMe over fabric, absolutely. So we're very excited to see support for NVMe over fabric from VMware also from Cisco as part of the UCS platform. And so we see, we were obviously out very, very early in that game. And we've seen some of the largest cloud providers we sell to already embraced that wholeheartedly. But we think this really opens it up to more broad enterprise usage. So something we're quite bullish on.\nCharlie Giancarlo: Yes. I'll just double down on that. Yes, we've seen a lot of enthusiasm, especially among our cloud customers and just a reminder, our cloud customers are now over a third of sales, but a lot of enthusiasm for the NVMe over fabric as a way to really consolidate to improve their rack structure because it brings the ability to have stateless servers into play and to consolidate all of their state into a single device that has been designed to maintain state. So it actually lowers the cost and increases the density and increases the reliability of large scale infrastructure. So the more NVMe support over fabric support that we see out there, the better frankly, that it is for us. I believe that being the first we still support probably more use cases than almost any other vendor out there and overall, I think it's good for us.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Alex Kurtz from KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nAlex Kurtz: Charlie, I just want to go back in time to a couple of previous quarters when Tim was still a CFO, and we had all this discussion about, one of the disconnect in pricing -- market pricing and kind of what was in your models. And, we had that kind of revenue reset last year around that. Is NAND pricing kind of stabilizes here and maybe goes up, you know, what actions have been taken to kind of get a better, street view to the model for Kevan that you guys feel more confident and kind of how that's being relayed back and forth between the teams?\nCharlie Giancarlo: Yes. Thanks, Alex. What was -- what really knocked us off our ability to project last year in an accurate way was not so much that NAND prices were falling because we're used to NAND, like any commodity NAND memory et cetera, we expect a decline over time. It was the precipitous rate that they declined over a two to three year -- two to three quarter period, which was two to three times normal and how that drops to the market, largely because of some disruptions on the demand side, how it dropped to the market so, so rapidly and it was something that we didn't predict. One could argue as to how, how one can predict that certainly, we are -- I now get weekly updates on NAND pricing. And what I'm looking for is not so much 3% to 5% quarter-over-quarter drops that one expects and of course, it's not steady, it'll go up and down in any one quarter. But what I'm looking for are the sudden changes, which are usually partially supply and partially demand that are well beyond what we normally see. So we're keeping our eyes out for that, if we will flag it, then we will address it earlier the next time around. So that's the way we're dealing with it now. It just had not been in our model before because it had always stayed within the normal range.\nAlex Kurtz: Okay. And just a follow-up on bookings for Kevan, a little bit late to the call here. So I just want to make sure I didn't miss this in the prepared remarks. But just the delta between bookings and revenue growth, like what drove that?\nKevan Krysler: Well, that's really going to be the primary driver really will be around our subscription offerings Alex. It's really what that's coming down to. In terms of either our Evergreen model or what we're doing on Pure as-a-Service or Cloud Block Store. Those would be the main drivers have that difference.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Rod Hall from Goldman Sachs.\nRaghunathan Kamesh: Hi. This is RK on behalf of Rod. Thanks for taking my question. Congrats on a nice quarter guys and my deepest condolences to Matt's family. Could you contrast your Pure as-a-Service offering with other competitor as a service offering? And I have a follow-up.\nCharlie Giancarlo: Yes. Let me start that. The first is that we really are as an a service offering because as an a service offering is not just an economic model, it's not just a warmed over lease. First of all, in terms of the way you buy our product, you buy it as a -- it's a cloud-based procurement model, based on an SLA. So it's not based on the hardware that gets put into place. We have a cloud operating and utility model that is true across clouds. That it's a unified subscription that works regardless of where you place your data, whether you place it in the cloud or on-premise of equipment. It's a common platform, it's the same software operating in both environments managed by the same management system. So that your applications can easily be placed either on-prem or in the cloud with minimal refactoring for that to be done. And we charge the customer basically, on the drip based on what they actually use. So not what they have to reserve, but rather what they actually use. So some of our competitors have -- put try to put together an economic model, which is effectively a lease, but it doesn't contain any of those other components.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Amit Daryanani from Evercore.\nMichael Fisher: This is Michael Fisher on for Amit. So appreciate the qualitative expectations for the July quarter. Just wondering if you could maybe touch on what's embedded as far as product revenue expectations? Should we be thinking down low single-digit year-over-year in July?\nKevan Krysler: Yes. So we're not giving specific guidance on that. But look, you saw how product revenue came out. And again, product revenue is just a derivation of the product portion of our capital sales. So anything we're selling on our subscription offerings did include our products solutions will be in subscription services. And so when I think about Q2, obviously, we see the growth and the momentum in subscription services. And we see overall, potentially at this point sales in total to be flattish year-over-year. So that'll be a headwind on product revenue.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini from SIG.\nMehdi Hosseini: I had a couple of follow ups. Want to thank you for providing the mix for the flash play, but I think you would put it in a better context if we could provide some competitive q-on-q or year-over-year, how should we compare this 55 million through prior quarters and I have a follow-up?\nCharlie Giancarlo: Yes. Thank you, Mehdi. Well, as you know, we don't want to be in a habit of providing product breakouts on a quarter-by-quarter basis, but we do -- we want to provide you color every now and then. I believe it was in our September accelerate, when we said we believed that we would be passing the 500 million cumulative sales mark for FlashBlade by the end of the year. And we usually don't make those projections without certainty that we will achieve them. And then, we provided you this color which is 15% of total sales. So that should give you another indication, but we don't want to be in the habit of doing it quarter-by-quarter. Appreciate it. But as you can see, we're so pleased with the growth of FlashBlade and Purity 3.0 in particular, it's just going to open up significant new market opportunity for that product both in existing accounts where they've been waiting for replication, but also in new accounts where they desperately need the Kerberos capability to get into government, for example. So it's going to open up new market opportunities. So we're very excited about the product going forward and expect continued growth.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Erik Suppiger from JMP Securities.\nErik Suppiger: And I do pass along my condolences to Matt's family as well as to the team there. Most my question were asked but on Flash Array C, can you comment as to whether that's still the fastest growing product in Pure's history?\nCharlie Giancarlo: Yes. Quite simply, yes.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Nehal Chokshi from Northland Capital.\nNehal Chokshi: And my condolences to Matt's family as well. Can you talk about what you see as a potential Achilles heels and power store [indiscernible] and then maybe also talk about when rates -- was that affected at all? Or did you actually see that improved now that's out color that would be great.\nCharlie Giancarlo: Thank you. Let me just answer the second part of the question first, which is we really didn't see it very much so far. It's very new out there. Obviously, there's a lot of buzz about and so forth. But frankly, our view very simply is it opens up opportunity to replace four products, whenever there's a disruptive upgrade and God loves them. Power store is another disruptive upgrade. Whenever there's a disruptive upgrade, it opens up the opportunity to all vendors, all new vendors, because the customer is going to go through that trouble. It's basically a brand new product. And in this case, it's a brand new 1.0 product. So we've just introduced XR3, which is our seventh generation of non-disruptive upgrade on a very mature product with very high reliability. And we've proven that we can do this over and over. And here we are seven years later from our first introduction and our competitors are still trying to catch up on an Evergreen type of program with non-disruptive upgrades. So it actually -- what they done is, they've effectively validated our program of seven years ago and now we're on to Pure as-a-Service, which if Evergreen was about protecting the economics and lowering the risk of on prem storage, Pure as-a-Service is about improving the economics and lowering the risk of a migration to the cloud. And there's no one else and power store does nothing for that. And lastly, I'll just say that this is a terrible time to come out with a new 1.0 product. Customers are risk adverse. So we really see this as a great opportunity for us.\nOperator: And your last question comes from Aaron Rakers from Wells Fargo.\nAaron Rakers: And also my condolences to you guys and Matt's family. He was great to work with. I guess most of my questions have been asked and answered, but I wanted to go back to kind of the channel engagement a little bit. Several quarters ago, you guys announced a partnership with a global systems integrator. Just curious of how you would characterize the current channel motion expansion. And whether or not you've seen additional GSI kind of come to Pure as clear opportunity? Thank you.\nCharlie Giancarlo: Yes. We have. What's been very interesting over the last, I would say over the last nine months to a year, but accelerated, frankly, in this last quarter is the degree to which both national and global VARs as well as system integrators have really embraced Pure more and more. Now I think, part of that were the aggressive growth programs that we put in place for these integrators, but frankly, the expansion of our product line, our ability now to address cloud needs and the fact that the product is not long line now really addresses a much wider variety of enterprise storage needs, has really convinced these integrators to throw in more and more of their lot with Pure. We've seen a significant increase in a partner what we call partner sourced, which is opportunities that are truly sourced by the partner and they may still require us to help them close but these were opportunities that they brought to us, rather than us bringing collectively to them. And we expect this to continue to grow. We're very pleased with --with what we're seeing from partner scale, both in terms of partner source generally, but in particular, the growth in what we're seeing in large enterprise partner activity.\nCharlie Giancarlo: Well, I think we're closing, we're at the end of the hour. I really appreciate very much all of the time and attention that you've provided us. While our projections for the near future are highly uncertain, we are extraordinarily optimistic about the opportunities ahead of us. And I have to say we are confident in our ability to continue to increase our market share, quarter-after-quarter a combination of our differentiation with our unmatched simplicity, the reliability, make Pure actually at this time the safe and easy choice for our customers. And I thank you again for joining us and look -- oh, by the way, please join us virtually for our upcoming Accelerate Digital event that we're going to have on June 9 and 10. We really look forward to seeing you there. There's going to be a lot of information, new things that will be -- new information that we'll be providing. Please stay well. Shelter in place is serious, it's a serious virus. We want you all safe and healthy next quarter and look forward to speaking to you then. Take care.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Charlie Giancarlo",
            "content": "Good afternoon everyone. Thank you for joining us on today's earnings call. I hope you, your family, friends, and colleagues are all healthy and staying well. As you will have noted at the beginning of this call, Matt Danziger, our Head of Investor Relations is no longer with us. Matt died unexpectedly last month from a non-COVID-related heart attack, due to an undiagnosed genetic cardiovascular disease. Matt was healthy, vital, and intelligent and always a joy to work with and spend time with. He touched the lives of everyone he met and his passing has saddened us all. Our hearts go out to his family and friends. I'd also like to take a moment to share my thoughts on the current health crisis that has affected everyone around the world. Some of you may know that I contracted COVID-19 in mid-March, and that experience has provided me with a deep personal appreciation for this virus and its impact. The changes in people's lives and livelihoods are truly extraordinary, and our expectations of what is or will be normal is forever changed. Every day, each new report on the crisis brings an uneasy mixture of anxiety, uncertainty, and hope about the future. The global Pure team has had the great fortune of being able to work virtually. So, we are inspired by and appreciative of the world's first responders and essential workers. We thank all those who have provided the services that have been critical to meeting our basic needs and tending to the well-being of others during this time. Within Pure, every group has handled this crisis with courage and responsibility, steadfast in their mission to help our customers and our company. We continue to demonstrate that Pure has best-in-class teams, and that our products and services are simple, reliable, and trusted. It is this potent combination that enables Pure to solve the critical and immediate needs of our current and new customers. This past quarter especially, we were proud to be relied on to deliver products and services to critical infrastructure on the front lines, including hospitals, labs, governments, schools, banks, communication systems, research institutions, and first responders. Our highly automated systems enabled customers and our partners to remotely install and manage our products and solutions within an hour or two rather than days. A major state government was hit with a ransomware attack in the early days of the crisis. Pure was able to rapidly deliver our ransomware solution providing protection against future attacks. A major collaboration network increased their pure footprint after a huge increase in traffic and demand from new customers due to COVID-19. The customer chose Pure because they experienced failures in their installed base of legacy solutions under the high load and were unable to obtain new product from those vendors to scale their systems. Pure was able to deliver and install Pure solutions into the customer's production network within 24 hours of our first call. A retail customer suddenly needed all of their employees to work from home when previously few did, rapidly increasing the load on their infrastructure. We've made this a smooth transition with robust remote capabilities and Pure as-a-Service, our true multi-cloud, consumption-based contract. In each case, Pure was able to deliver and install products expeditiously, enabling customers to be in full production within 72 hours and in some cases sooner from the first call. Our technology is also enabling those in search of a cure for this scourge or tracing the spread of the virus or in analyzing the structure and behavior of the disease. We have donated our products to companies involved in the fight against COVID-19 including shipping FlashBlades to Folding@home, an organization focused on simulating the dynamics of COVID-19 proteins to find new therapeutic solutions through crowd computing. I am proud of our supply chain and customer support performance and resiliency, which not only maintained the high level of service and support our customers demand, but went above those expectations to serve customers with critical needs. Pure's global supply chain strategy and our now fully tested business continuity plan prepared us well for this crisis. We continue to lead with innovation across all aspects of the business and our performance this past quarter was another validation of our modern data experience strategy, helping customers transform their storage operations to be simple, reliable, fast, and flexible. I was very pleased with our financial performance for this past very unique quarter as year-over-year revenues grew 12% to $367 million. Our revenue performance was broad based across all products and services, including the continuing strength in our FlashBlade offering and our subscription services. Sales of our portfolio solutions, including both FlashArray and FlashBlade together continued to grow and existing customers increased their footprint in the quarter. FlashBlade solution sales to both new and existing customers also grew year-over-year and now represent approximately 15% of our total sales. Earlier this month, we announced the release of Purity 3.0 on FlashBlade, which adds significant new features to the world's most performant file and object platform. In this latest release, we've added simple and efficient file and object replication for disaster recovery in hybrid cloud as well as Kerberos and NFS 4.1 support. These features expand FlashBlade's broad range of use cases including modern analytics, rapid restore, and ransomware. Customers have rewarded our leadership and innovation with nearly 100 organizations to date each spending more than $1 million in FlashBlade to consolidate their unstructured data for their growing list of modern, high-performance applications. Pure's subscription services had an outstanding quarter. Subscription services include our non-disruptive Evergreen services, Pure as-a-Service, and Cloud Block Store for multi-cloud environments. Evergreen reduces the risk and economics for customers by ensuring that Pure's on-premise systems never grow old. After seven years, competitors are still playing catch up to Pure's Evergreen program of continuous non-disruptive upgrades, providing customers a subscription to innovation rather than a contract for obsolescence. But Pure has leapfrogged yet again with our Pure as-a-Service offering, also reducing the risk and economics of storage in the multi-cloud age. Customers leveraging Pure as-a-Service have the flexibility to determine their cash and capital commitments in the short as well as the long term, the flexibility to own or to subscribe and the flexibility to change where they place their data at any time. They have the freedom of a multi-cloud contract for storage and to only pay for what they use, when they use it, regardless of where they place their data. Customer flexibility through Pure as-a-Service is the right option in this uncertain COVID environment, particularly in a period where it may be difficult to predict long-term requirements. In Q1, a large U.S. national bank as a net new logo made a multimillion dollar commitment to Pure's entire portfolio and specifically our Pure as-a-Service offering to transform their storage needs and move off of a legacy vendor's disruptive refresh storage model. This pandemic has changed the way we work with the speed far beyond any pundit's predictions for technology alone. There is an increased and likely permanent customer demand for greater hands-free management, automation, consolidation, and flexible consumption models. Pure has a great lead in these capabilities as I shared in the customer examples and demand and interest for Pure as-a-Service has increased dramatically. Moving on to Q2. It is now right to state that there are uncertainties in the global economy and unpredictability in the IT market as customers focus on the urgent push out the nearly important and reassess ongoing IT initiatives. Customers are reevaluating their spending in all areas as they navigate their own challenging environments. We have taken these dynamics and uncertainties into account with our measured Q2 expectations. Looking beyond the quarter, I am confident that we can navigate the choppy waters of our market. We remain committed to our long-term priorities while managing expenses prudently. We will continue to take market share with our superior and differentiated technology, services and customer first culture. And I am confident that we will lead the market exiting the recession. As we go forward and shelter in place orders are lifted around the world, Pure will continue to do its part to protect our people and guard against community spread of this virus. Our dedicated crisis planning team meets daily to manage our global response to the pandemic. We have regional phase plans based on local conditions to carefully reintegrate employees into the workplace, while planning for a large fraction to continue working from home for some time. We will do what's right for Pure, our customers, our teams around the world and each and every employee. Lastly, I'd like to take a moment to thank our global employees executing as one virtual team for their tenacity, focus and genuine enthusiasm to help our customers, our partners, their teammates and local communities throughout this crisis. If anything, our teams are more connected than ever. Personally, I have enjoyed our new routine of interacting with the entire company weekly through virtual all hands broadcasts. I look forward to connecting with all of you and the broader Pure community, our customers and partners at our Accelerate Digital and Pure Partner Digital events on June 9 and 10. And with that, I'll turn it over to Kevan. Pinjalim, thank you for the question. And again, for everybody in the audience, I just want to say that I wish you all well, and I hope you're faring well during this crisis. We really saw Pinjalim a very balanced demand for product. Certainly, VDI was one of the major use cases out there, but there were many others as well. We saw positive buying for all sorts of infrastructure needs because of not just work from home, but the higher levels of, of Internet commerce that took place for many, many customers, not to mention a greater service provider needs, et cetera. So, I'll tell you, it was a very balanced quarter overall, all products doing very well. As we mentioned in our comments, we did see a good strong strength in U.S. enterprise, whereas we did see weakness in the commercial segment, which I don't think should surprise anybody on the call. And for the second question, I think I'll pass it over to Kevan. Yes. Well, May is very early. As you know, we do have -- quarters themselves build as we go along month by month as we go along the quarter, so it's still relatively early in May, and it's very hard, I would say for us to be able to project the quarter on May alone. We did see, I will say, and we don't generally comment on this, but we did see very good linearity overall in Q1. And again, it's hard to predict what Q2 looks like from what we have so far in May. George that is actually a great question. If anything, we've seen higher productivity in sales from the work-in-home environment. I have to tell you that I probably see -- I'm probably communicating with twice the number of customer executives now that I'm working from home, and the same is pretty much true with our sales team. It takes less than a week to get an appointment, people are available, the meetings themselves are very efficient, meetings that in person would take a month or two to set up, and then take hours to have the meeting and to convey everything you want to convey, probably get done in about two thirds of the time. And the meetings themselves are -- as I mentioned, it doesn't take much time to set up, and we're seeing that across our sales base. That is to say it's been easier to get access to higher levels in the customer base. And these have been very potent and very hard hitting meetings. So if anything, I expect that we're going to see sales in a B2B environment, permanently take on more of a virtual digital technique to them. Sure. The puts and takes are that on the positive side, we do still expect some amount of the positive COVID influence that took place in Q1. That is some continued pull in and finishing of the urgent issues that that customers have either for work from home, school from home, higher web traffic, and transactions and so forth. So we're expecting some increase in that. But we're, let's not forget, in Q1, we had about half a quarter of a normal pre-COVID, which we are not going to have here. And then we're expecting on the takes the full impact of a lower global economy start to kick in as well, and it's -- the difficulty in projecting is the balance between those two things. Yes. It's a great question Simon for a couple of reasons, and it's a somewhat complex makeup. So, you saw in our accompanying materials, you saw our new customer add this past quarter slightly lower than last year. It's made up of two things. One is yes, indeed, the commercial market slowing down and new customers a little bit harder to come by, given the risk aversion that's taking place in the market, given COVID again. But at the same time, we started transitioning as you may know more towards an enterprise orientation. And so the quality of -- we've been focusing our sales teams more and more on the quality of the net new logo, rather than just the number of net new logos, and we feel that's starting to kick in quite a bit, so the lower numbers a mix of those two things. Thirdly, what I would say is that there is a general risk aversion out there in the market, whether it's new products, new features, new vendors, and that's going to be with us for a quarter or two until I think the customers have started being able to feel comfortable in putting time into testing. It's really the fact that the urgency has been so high to do something that they've not wanted to take risk. Once they have time, once they've settled the urgency and they can then focus on the slightly longer term we think that the ability to convert new customers again will come back. Well, you need to look at it from two sides, as I've told my supply chain team, they looked as smooth as a duck on water, but of course, underneath the surface, their feet were paddling like crazy. From a customer standpoint, there was absolutely zero interruption of supply chain. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we were able to supply product within 24 hours of first call, and there were very few instances of delay and if there was, it was a delay of a day or two. So really, no supply chain interruptions and that was true on the subscription service chain as well. So, very, very proud of our supply chain and service, our operations and service people. It does reflect by the way as it wasn't just pure dumb luck. It reflects partially the design of our product which had very little dependence on China, just sub assemblies. But it also reflected the global nature -- distributed nature of our supply chain that didn't have a high concentration of supply in any one area. Katy, thank you for all the support that you've provided to Matt and/or Matt's family, we really do very much appreciate that. It's very difficult to predict July because one might predict July, if one feels that the effects of COVID or moving beyond us or moving past us at this point. But if we've learned anything from these pandemics from the past is that they can come back and they can come back, as early as late summer. So I would tend to agree that if we continue to see the slowdown of COVID, that July might be the watermark. But I don't think we can say that, there's a lot of unknown, there are some true unknowns that we want to make sure that we're prepared for. And one of those is we don't really know what this virus will do later in the year. Yes. I think it's very much summed up in the reasoning behind and the construction of our Pure as-a-Service offering. And what I mean by that is our view is that yes, there's going to be and there is increased demand for cloud-based solutions. But customers have to migrate from being on-prem to the cloud. What we saw in Q1 was that the urgency was to beef up what they currently had in and that was largely on-prem. But they wanted the option, they didn't want to sign-on to five years of more on-prem or anything along those lines. They wanted the option of being able to move to the cloud at any point in time. And that's exactly what our Pure as-a-Service is designed to do in several respects. Not only economically, that is to say it's a single unified contract, a single unified subscription that allows them to place their data wherever they want. But also in the sense that it's the same exact software and same interface to the application environment, in the cloud, as it is on-prem and that makes their ability to migrate their applications even easier. And so I think the answer is, yes. But with our unified subscription, it's equal to us. And we're very glad to have not just our unified subscription offering, but an account plan for our account reps that's equal to them, regardless of which way -- what they sell. And so, we were optimistic with respect to the offerings that we have out there. We're hopeful that in fact, more of it will move to pass and to cloud data services. And we think that, we're roughly in line with our customers in terms of the timing by which they'll do that. But we did not just to be clear, we did not convert that to what it would have been had it been a perpetual, had it been an equipment capital sale. We didn't make that conversion. And we were not -- it turns out, there's a lot of puts and takes and any conversion would be inaccurate. And so we've decided not to do it. Absolutely. As far as [color on C] [ph], we're very pleased with its continued performance in our revenue base and with the customer acceptance. We've had several very large deployments of C. We've also had a good uptake of C, just individually by new customers. And it's been nine months roughly, since we introduced it. And of course, there's no competitive product out there that even that had been introduced or even comes close to see. So it's an open field for us right now. And we're seeing the power portfolio as well, because it's really allowing us now to go into customers. And I would say, as of two years ago, we were pretty much still a unique product offering with a great but niche product. And now customers are saying, gee, we can use Pure across a wide variety or even all of our storage needs and that's really been a great benefit to us as we've penetrated further and further into the enterprise. Yes, terrific. Thank you so much, Karl. Look, it's really my personal goal that we not have any layoffs or furloughs this year. And every Puritan in the company is dedicated to put into the kind of performance that we need to make sure that's the case, to pick up market share to drive the company to support our customers. But, as we look at the both the quarter and the year and as we look going forward, we believe we're going to be able to perform in such a way that we will not have layoffs or furloughs. And as I said, it's my personal mission to make sure that's the case. We believe that we're going -- there are lots of activities that we can undertake to make the company more, both more productive, but also more efficient. And as you might imagine, we've been very busy identifying those and taking that, of course, we're saving a lot already on T&E and large events, which is very positive, but I feel that as long as we can operate the company at or near breakeven that and that we can do so this year. We will not need to have any restructuring actions associated with it. Now, I do to preempt perhaps a follow up question. We did have a restructuring early in the year that was planned last year even before any thoughts around COVID but that was really a rebalancing action inside the company. Because as like any company as you go forward, there are times when you deploy people and resources in areas and over time you want them to really to be in other areas that are more productive. And that's what we went through early in the year that resulted in a small number of people being displaced. But that was not an economic consideration. It was a rebalancing. Yes. I'll just double down on that. Yes, we've seen a lot of enthusiasm, especially among our cloud customers and just a reminder, our cloud customers are now over a third of sales, but a lot of enthusiasm for the NVMe over fabric as a way to really consolidate to improve their rack structure because it brings the ability to have stateless servers into play and to consolidate all of their state into a single device that has been designed to maintain state. So it actually lowers the cost and increases the density and increases the reliability of large scale infrastructure. So the more NVMe support over fabric support that we see out there, the better frankly, that it is for us. I believe that being the first we still support probably more use cases than almost any other vendor out there and overall, I think it's good for us. Yes. Thanks, Alex. What was -- what really knocked us off our ability to project last year in an accurate way was not so much that NAND prices were falling because we're used to NAND, like any commodity NAND memory et cetera, we expect a decline over time. It was the precipitous rate that they declined over a two to three year -- two to three quarter period, which was two to three times normal and how that drops to the market, largely because of some disruptions on the demand side, how it dropped to the market so, so rapidly and it was something that we didn't predict. One could argue as to how, how one can predict that certainly, we are -- I now get weekly updates on NAND pricing. And what I'm looking for is not so much 3% to 5% quarter-over-quarter drops that one expects and of course, it's not steady, it'll go up and down in any one quarter. But what I'm looking for are the sudden changes, which are usually partially supply and partially demand that are well beyond what we normally see. So we're keeping our eyes out for that, if we will flag it, then we will address it earlier the next time around. So that's the way we're dealing with it now. It just had not been in our model before because it had always stayed within the normal range. Yes. Let me start that. The first is that we really are as an a service offering because as an a service offering is not just an economic model, it's not just a warmed over lease. First of all, in terms of the way you buy our product, you buy it as a -- it's a cloud-based procurement model, based on an SLA. So it's not based on the hardware that gets put into place. We have a cloud operating and utility model that is true across clouds. That it's a unified subscription that works regardless of where you place your data, whether you place it in the cloud or on-premise of equipment. It's a common platform, it's the same software operating in both environments managed by the same management system. So that your applications can easily be placed either on-prem or in the cloud with minimal refactoring for that to be done. And we charge the customer basically, on the drip based on what they actually use. So not what they have to reserve, but rather what they actually use. So some of our competitors have -- put try to put together an economic model, which is effectively a lease, but it doesn't contain any of those other components. Yes. Thank you, Mehdi. Well, as you know, we don't want to be in a habit of providing product breakouts on a quarter-by-quarter basis, but we do -- we want to provide you color every now and then. I believe it was in our September accelerate, when we said we believed that we would be passing the 500 million cumulative sales mark for FlashBlade by the end of the year. And we usually don't make those projections without certainty that we will achieve them. And then, we provided you this color which is 15% of total sales. So that should give you another indication, but we don't want to be in the habit of doing it quarter-by-quarter. Appreciate it. But as you can see, we're so pleased with the growth of FlashBlade and Purity 3.0 in particular, it's just going to open up significant new market opportunity for that product both in existing accounts where they've been waiting for replication, but also in new accounts where they desperately need the Kerberos capability to get into government, for example. So it's going to open up new market opportunities. So we're very excited about the product going forward and expect continued growth. Yes. Quite simply, yes. Thank you. Let me just answer the second part of the question first, which is we really didn't see it very much so far. It's very new out there. Obviously, there's a lot of buzz about and so forth. But frankly, our view very simply is it opens up opportunity to replace four products, whenever there's a disruptive upgrade and God loves them. Power store is another disruptive upgrade. Whenever there's a disruptive upgrade, it opens up the opportunity to all vendors, all new vendors, because the customer is going to go through that trouble. It's basically a brand new product. And in this case, it's a brand new 1.0 product. So we've just introduced XR3, which is our seventh generation of non-disruptive upgrade on a very mature product with very high reliability. And we've proven that we can do this over and over. And here we are seven years later from our first introduction and our competitors are still trying to catch up on an Evergreen type of program with non-disruptive upgrades. So it actually -- what they done is, they've effectively validated our program of seven years ago and now we're on to Pure as-a-Service, which if Evergreen was about protecting the economics and lowering the risk of on prem storage, Pure as-a-Service is about improving the economics and lowering the risk of a migration to the cloud. And there's no one else and power store does nothing for that. And lastly, I'll just say that this is a terrible time to come out with a new 1.0 product. Customers are risk adverse. So we really see this as a great opportunity for us. Yes. We have. What's been very interesting over the last, I would say over the last nine months to a year, but accelerated, frankly, in this last quarter is the degree to which both national and global VARs as well as system integrators have really embraced Pure more and more. Now I think, part of that were the aggressive growth programs that we put in place for these integrators, but frankly, the expansion of our product line, our ability now to address cloud needs and the fact that the product is not long line now really addresses a much wider variety of enterprise storage needs, has really convinced these integrators to throw in more and more of their lot with Pure. We've seen a significant increase in a partner what we call partner sourced, which is opportunities that are truly sourced by the partner and they may still require us to help them close but these were opportunities that they brought to us, rather than us bringing collectively to them. And we expect this to continue to grow. We're very pleased with --with what we're seeing from partner scale, both in terms of partner source generally, but in particular, the growth in what we're seeing in large enterprise partner activity. Well, I think we're closing, we're at the end of the hour. I really appreciate very much all of the time and attention that you've provided us. While our projections for the near future are highly uncertain, we are extraordinarily optimistic about the opportunities ahead of us. And I have to say we are confident in our ability to continue to increase our market share, quarter-after-quarter a combination of our differentiation with our unmatched simplicity, the reliability, make Pure actually at this time the safe and easy choice for our customers. And I thank you again for joining us and look -- oh, by the way, please join us virtually for our upcoming Accelerate Digital event that we're going to have on June 9 and 10. We really look forward to seeing you there. There's going to be a lot of information, new things that will be -- new information that we'll be providing. Please stay well. Shelter in place is serious, it's a serious virus. We want you all safe and healthy next quarter and look forward to speaking to you then. Take care."

            "content": "Thank you, Charlie. Financial performance during Q1 was solid, despite significant economic disruption during a difficult and constantly changing environment. Total Revenue during Q1 was $367 million growing 12% year-over-year, product revenue was $247 million growing 3% year-over-year and subscription services revenue was $120 million growing 37% year-over-year, which includes revenues from our Evergreen subscriptions, Pure as-a-Service and Cloud Block Store. Subscription services revenue represented approximately 33% of total revenue during Q1. Total revenue in the United States during Q1 was $264 million growing at 15% year-over-year and total international revenue in Q1 was $103 million growing 5% year-over-year. Given the current environment that we are navigating, I will provide some additional color around our sales performance during the quarter. Total bookings or sales during Q1 grew 24% year-over-year and is broadly diversified across industry verticals and customers. Sales during Q1 to our enterprise and government customers in the United States were solid and growing, while we saw overall weakness in our commercial business. We are pleased with our partnership and continued momentum from our channel partners worldwide. Global channel source sales continues to represent a growing and meaningful percentage of our total sales. New customers acquired during Q1 were approximately 300 customers compared to approximately 350 customers during Q1 of the prior year. Our business during Q1 benefited from increased demand of mission critical IT needs arising in response to the unprecedented pandemic. We fulfill these orders without significant delays and supply shortages based on the remarkable efforts and resilience of our global supply chain and manufacturing operations. Partially offsetting this tailwind, we saw an increase in opportunities in our pipeline that were expected to close during the quarter but did not close. Non-GAAP gross margins in the quarter for product and subscription services continue to be solid and are a result of our product solution differentiation in the market. Total non-GAAP gross margin in Q1 was 71.9% increasing 3.8 points year-over-year. Now non-GAAP product gross margin in Q1 was 73.3% increasing 4.6 points year-over-year and non-GAAP subscription services margin in Q1 was 68.9% increasing 2.6 points year-over-year. Total non-GAAP operating loss during Q1 was approximately $5 million compared to a non-GAAP operating loss of approximately $31 million during Q1 of the prior year. Reduced travel, marketing and depreciation expenses as well as slower than planned hiring contributed to lower non-GAAP operating losses. Non-GAAP net loss during Q1 was $4 million and non-GAAP net loss per share was $0.02. Non-GAAP net loss in Q1 of the prior year was $28 million and non-GAAP net loss per share was $0.11. Weighted average shares used for the non-GAAP net loss per share calculation was 263 million shares in Q1 and 245 million shares in Q1 of the prior year. Operating cash flow for Q1 was $35 million and was $7 million in Q1 of the prior year. Operating cash flows during Q1 benefited in part from strong collections of our receivables. Free cash flow for Q1 was $11 million and was a negative $18 million in the prior year. Total cash and investments at the end of Q1 was $1.27 billion compared to $1.3 billion at the end of fiscal 2020. We have a very strong balance sheet that provides us with flexibility to handle a wide range of scenarios. Total deferred revenue for Q1 was $706 million, compared to $697 million at the end of fiscal 2020 and $564 million at the end of Q1 of the prior year. We are pleased to see the continued growth in our multiple subscription service offerings. During Q1 we returned to $70 million to shareholders through share repurchases of 5.96 million shares approximately $65 million remains for a share repurchase authorization. Total headcount at the end of the quarter was approximately 3,500 employees, compared to approximately 3,400 employees at the end of fiscal 2020 and 3,150 employees at the end of Q1 of the prior year. Now moving to annual guidance, the core fundamentals of our business remains strong. However, we are withdrawing our annual guidance given significant uncertainty around demand for the remainder of the year due to the global economic contraction caused by COVID-19. As we progress through the year, we expect to continue to see strength in sales and adoption of our subscription services. Our Pure as-a-Service and Cloud Block Store unified subscription offerings also continue to gain momentum, offering increasing flexibility and how our technology is consumed, providing customers with a cloud like business model. Our pipeline generation for the second half of the year continues to grow, but it is unclear how and when these opportunities will convert given the current economic environment. Moving to investments, we continue to be disciplined on our spending levels and are focused on operating expense savings initiatives and tight capital spend oversight. Our investments in areas of innovation and quota carrying capacity will continue in a prudent manner with ongoing monitoring of our business plan and conditions. Now let's move to the second quarter. For similar reasons while we were pulling our annual guidance, we are also not providing guidance for Q2. We expect customers purchasing our solutions for their mission critical IT infrastructure and digital transformation needs will continue to provide a tailwind. However, we expect this benefit to be more than offset during Q2 by customers who decide to pause IT infrastructure projects. Our diverse customer base and our growing recurring revenue derived from our subscription services will provide a level of mitigation. However, the range of potential outcomes are many and widely distributed. Our current view of Q2 outcomes, which should not be viewed as guidance is that sales will be near flat year-over-year and our operating profit will be near breakeven. To summarize, our business priorities and long-term growth objectives have not changed as we've delivered solid financial results while navigating in a very challenging environment. With that, we will now open the call for questions. Thanks, Charlie. Yes. In specific to deferred revenue, we're pleased with really both our sequential and year-over-year deferred revenue growth. As a reminder, sequentially, we're coming off the seasonally highest quarter, which would be Q4. So that's going to have some impact when you're looking at deferred revenue sequentially, but you are correct, as well that as we're growing our subscription offerings, there's an off-balance-sheet component that's also growing that's included in RPO, and that's going to have an impact as well. I had a couple other points on that. Obviousl, we're staying really close to the field as we always do, and their inputs are really weighted pretty heavily for us as we're thinking about Q2. And when we think about the headwinds for Q2, really it's around the increased risk of how the opportunities in Q2 will convert and the timing of those conversions is really the big question mark for us. And then, looking at the commercial space in the middle market, obviously there was some softness there that we expect to be a continued headwind for us. But those were factors that we were thinking about on the tailwind side. And really, on the headwind, we're also looking at increased recurring revenue that we would expect over time to be a larger portion of our total revenue, which will be a mitigating factor for us as well. I will just add a couple of notes to that in terms of the existing customers clearly we're seeing an expanding footprint as Charlie mentioned and what is interesting on the new customer front, is if we pull out the new customers from commercial or mid market, we actually have an increase year-over-year in sales, which was a significant positive, really going back to the strength we're seeing elsewhere, including enterprise, even for new customers. And then Katie, on your second question around breaking out Pure as-a-Service and Cloud Block Store, we aren't breaking out that specifically, a little bit of color though, especially on Pure as-a-Service. Very happy with the results and the momentum and the interest we're seeing, really around the unified subscription, both of Pure as-a-Service and in Cloud Block Store, such is the fact that we had a customer -- enterprise customer commit to an eight figure deal with us this quarter, which we're really excited to see. But look, our priority is really around providing customers with flexibility and how and where they're choosing to consume our technology whether that's on-prem, whether that's a multi-cloud environment or [indiscernible], which really all our subscription offerings are enabling. And so we're pretty excited about the momentum overall of all our subscription offerings, including a PaaS and Cloud Block Store. Yes. We kind of laid out in our prepared remarks the subscription growth as well as what it represents in terms of total revenue, which is increasing. And so we have that in the prepared remarks. Did not. And that's what Charlie was... And then I'll hit gross margin, in terms of how we're thinking about gross margin and really, our long-term view of gross margin remains unchanged. We're very pleased with the performance both on product gross margin and on our subscription services gross margin. And it really is the product of the design of our product solutions, in particular, our software IP and development. And we say that each and every quarter and that continues to be true. And that's where the value is. That's where the customers are seeing the value. And that's really where the competitive differentiation is and while we're competing head to head on cost, the value of the software is really driving the results of what you're seeing on gross margin, but again, our long range view on gross margin hasn't changed. And then just real quick on your question on -- really in particular probably NAND pricing is what you're getting at. We did see stabilization of pricing, including during Q1. In fact, we saw NAND pricing really rising modestly in Q1. As one might expect, the data is mixed for us when we're looking at the second half across the board. There are some indicators that pricing may decline later in the year. But when we take a step back, we're looking at a much more normalized pricing environment throughout the year compared to what we saw in the second half of last year. Well, that's really going to be the primary driver really will be around our subscription offerings Alex. It's really what that's coming down to. In terms of either our Evergreen model or what we're doing on Pure as-a-Service or Cloud Block Store. Those would be the main drivers have that difference. Yes. So we're not giving specific guidance on that. But look, you saw how product revenue came out. And again, product revenue is just a derivation of the product portion of our capital sales. So anything we're selling on our subscription offerings did include our products solutions will be in subscription services. And so when I think about Q2, obviously, we see the growth and the momentum in subscription services. And we see overall, potentially at this point sales in total to be flattish year-over-year. So that'll be a headwind on product revenue."

With that, I'll turn the call over to our CEO, Charlie Giancarlo.\nCharlie Giancarlo: Hello, everyone, and welcome to our call. I hope you are healthy and faring well given the many challenges of the current environment. I'm very pleased to report that Pure delivered a fantastic Q4, capping off a great fiscal year. Our quarterly revenue grew 41% over last year's strong Q4. This past quarter, we again enjoyed strong growth, especially in the Americas, our largest theater and we grew across enterprise, commercial and public sectors. I'm especially pleased with our growth in both net new logos and subscription annual recurring revenue, indicating great progress against our long-term strategy. Full year revenue growth was 29% and the annual growth of our subscription revenue was 37%. Revenue growth and operational leverage drove strong profit and cash flow growth in fiscal '22. As we stated in our Financial Analyst Day presentation in September, our total addressable market of more than $60 billion across both storage and storage as a service continues to provide expansion opportunities for Pure. We believe that our strong performance is clear evidence of Pure's increasing strength. Three things are necessary for sustainable growth, which we have steadily developed within Pure: First, sustainable growth requires highly differentiated technology with sustainable competitive advantage. Pure's focus on developing purity software and our direct flash technology to maximize the many advantages of solid-state storage is unique in our industry and has taken many years to develop. Second, Sustainable growth requires a broad portfolio that addresses a full range of customer needs, a portfolio that we have steadily developed over the last several years. Third, sustainable growth requires the ability to support customers in all major market segments, commercial enterprise, public sector and cloud. Pure now has all 3 of these elements to drive our growth for many years to come. Pure's highly differentiated technology enjoys a strong sustainable competitive advantage. Many of Pure's advantages stem from core software architecture decisions that are practically impossible to retrofit into pre-existing software. Among our advantages are the simplicity in the design and use of our products, the ability to realize the best price performance from raw flash and the ability to perform nondisruptive upgrades for both hardware and software, which deliver a cloud-like experience. While some competitors make claims of nondisruptive upgrades in their marketing, they consistently failed to deliver.  Furthermore, Pure's proprietary hardware provides higher performance, reliability and longer lifetime while requiring less space, power and cooling than competitors' commodity-based systems, competitors would need entirely new designs and years of new software development to replicate Pure's advantages. Pure's growing portfolio of industry-leading storage and data management products has propelled the growth of our enterprise business to greater heights. Customers appreciate the simplicity of our portfolio which supports the majority of their traditional workloads with just 2 hardware architectures sharing a common software architecture. And their cloud native workloads with Portworx all integrated through Pure1 and all available as a service. They appreciate our ability to provide common interfaces and APIs between on-prem and the cloud. They have embraced our ability to support their development of cloud native applications with Portworx. They're excited by our vision to provide automated data management with Pure Fusion and Portworx data services. And they are overjoyed as we consistently deliver nondisruptive upgrades year after year and soon decade after decade with our Evergreen design, a model that has been claimed competitively but never replicated.  The effect of our portfolio is evident not only in our continuing penetration into large enterprise, but also in our recently announced collaboration with Meta. Meta chose Pure when it needed a storage partner to deliver powerful and scalable storage capabilities for their AI research supercluster. With FlashArray and FlashBlade, their AI supercomputer has unparalleled performance and benefits from a broad range of our technology\u2019s advantages, underpinned by Pure's foundation of simplicity, reliability and sustainability.  We announced a record number of new products and services this past fiscal year, including purity upgrades for ransomware and disaster recovery, additions to our FlashArray//C Series, FlashStack as a service, Pure Fusion, Portworx data services and major enhancements to our Pure1 digital experience. This past December, we announced FlashArray//XL, which delivers 5.5 petabytes of capacity in up to 80% less space and power than competitive all-flash solutions and it's off to a great start. Our product pipeline for FY '23 is no less ambitious, and I am incredibly excited about the year ahead. Our vision and technology to deliver a cloud operating model to our customers' multi-cloud data environment, spanning their private cloud and public cloud providers continues to resonate and grow. This vision is based on the concepts of first, providing common frameworks and APIs to both on-prem and hyperscaler environments; second, enabling fully automated data management to IT organizations through policy; and third, the abstraction of these IT created data classes for developers access through API. We are seeing strong interest in this transformational model built on Pure Fusion, Portworx and delivered by Pure1. We have enjoyed great success with our strategy of delivering a simple set of Evergreen data platforms that enables customers to focus more on leveraging their data than on managing their storage environment. Customers have rewarded us with market share gains and recognized us with the highest third-party certified Net Promoter Score in almost all industries of 85.2% for the calendar year 2021. From our primary focus on the commercial market just 5 years ago, we have expanded our skills and infrastructure to support all major markets. Today, our enterprise business model is fully capable of supporting the largest global organizations, both public and private, with a portfolio of products, subscription services, support and professional services. We do this with the help of a growing set of capable partners. We're now adding an ability to serve large hyperscalers and MSPs.  We are proud to partner with the world's largest global system integrators and managed service providers to make Pure a preferred part of their solutions. We recently announced a global partnership with Kyndryl, combining the power of Pure's offerings and Kyndryl expertise to deliver industry-leading solutions to customers' most complex challenges. Our joint customers are already benefiting from this partnership. One of the world's leading shipping and logistics companies chose Pure as-a-Service to build a secure data infrastructure for its new logistics offering for its clients. Being part of a major digital transformation to improve shipping and logistics worldwide, has special poignancy as we face supply chain challenges that continue to affect all companies.  I feel confident that we have one of the most robust supply chains in the business. Pure has invested in strong relationships with our supply partners and flexible multisource global operations over many years and we benefit from the architectural advantages of our integrated hardware designs. While there have been numerous supply chain challenges over the last year, and we are certainly not invulnerable to disruption in the future, we have navigated and managed them well and continue to meet our customers' demands.  Earlier, I had mentioned that Pure solutions are able to provide customers higher performance and reliability with significantly less space power and cooling than competitive all-flash products, in many cases, utilizing up to 80% less power in space. Lower energy use by our products will significantly reduce the environmental footprint of our customers' data centers. Third-party reviewed competitive comparisons will be 1 part of our full Environmental, Social and Governance, or ESG report, which we will publish later this month. In our first ever ESG report, we will identify our environmental achievements and future goals for improvement in our operations and downstream use of our products as well as our current state and future plans on talent recruitment and retention and diversity, equity and inclusion. And finally, our governance and business practices.  I would like to comment on 3 additional topics of broad current interest. First, the so-called great resignation, then inflation and then our response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. As is widely reported, employee attrition is elevated across all industries and especially in technology. However, the flip side of this coin is that there has never been a time in my memory when so much great talent was available all at 1 time. And we saw a strong traction in hiring during Q4. Our continuing success, large market opportunity and high employee satisfaction scores have made Pure a talent magnet. Inflation is also real, and there is no countervailing benefit. I believe this will be with us for some time, and we have assessed impacts to employee compensation and other operating expenses, which we have considered in our guidance.  We are carefully monitoring the situation in Ukraine. And I am dismayed by the want and disregard for both national sovereignty and human life currently on display. Our hearts go out to the people of Ukraine and all those affected by the conflict. We have ceased all shipments in support services in Russia and Belarus, which represents a small amount of business for the foreseeable future. We are providing support as appropriate to our employees and their families. In closing, I would like to thank our customers, partners and especially our employees for their trust and support of Pure this past year. Through all of the challenges over the last several years, Pure has thrived. We have been innovated, we've grown. We've battled competitors, large and small, and we've taken market share. Most importantly, we have delighted ever more customers by delivering solutions beyond their expectations. This simple formula will continue to fuel our growth for years to come. Over to you, Kevan.\nKevan Krysler: Thank you, Charlie, and good afternoon. We saw outstanding execution and performance across our entire company, achieving record revenue, operating income and cash flows. Demand continued to be very strong across our portfolio of solutions, services and geographies, especially in the U.S. and Canada. Although supply chain challenges continue to persist, we executed for our customers, delivering our solutions and minimizing delays.  Growth of our subscription business is robust as we continue to create value-based outcomes for our customers. Subscription annual recurring revenue, or ARR, grew 31% to nearly $850 million. Also, our subscription net dollar retention or NDR at the end of the year exceeded 120% compared to our long-term target of 115% as a result of expansion growth from existing customers. Remaining performance obligations, or RPO, which includes our committed and noncancelable future revenue, was over $1.4 billion, growing at 29%. We acquired 470 new customers, reflecting increasing strength. New customer acquisitions were balanced across geographies, market segments and our solutions portfolio. Our total customer count now exceeds 10,000 customers, which also includes over 50% of the U.S. Fortune 500 companies. Now turning to financial results for the quarter. Total revenue for the quarter grew 41% to approximately $709 million. Revenue in the United States grew 51% and international revenue grew 20% year-over-year. Subscription services revenue grew approximately 42%.  For the full fiscal year, total revenue grew 29% to nearly $2.2 billion. Our fiscal year includes 53 weeks contributing both additional revenue and costs. Excluding the revenue contribution arising from the additional week, total revenue for the quarter grew approximately 37% and 28% for the year.  Total non-GAAP gross margins were nearly 69% this quarter. Non-GAAP product gross margins of 67% were slightly impacted by higher supply chain-related costs. We were very pleased with how we actively managed our supply chain challenges in partnership with our suppliers. Our integrated software and hardware designs continue to be very valuable as we manage these challenges. As we continue to sell the value of our solutions, we expect product gross margins to be in the high 60s, consistent with our long-range expectations.  Non-GAAP subscription services gross margins were solid at 73% this quarter. We achieved record non-GAAP operating profits of nearly $119 million and non-GAAP operating margins of 16.8% this quarter while also continuing to make investments to drive growth. Increased operating costs included higher compensation due to our strong performance, increased hiring and an additional week of operating expenses of approximately $17 million. Non-GAAP operating profit for the year also achieved a record high of $235 million and 10.8% non-GAAP operating margins. As we have highlighted in previous quarters, the COVID environment was a tailwind to our operating profits, contributing approximately 2 to 3 points of benefit to our fiscal 2022 operating margin, slower than planned hiring, significantly reduced travel and the reduction of physical marketing events were the largest drivers. Now let's turn over to the balance sheet and cash flows. We ended the quarter with over $1.4 billion in cash and approximately 4,200 employees. Our strong overall financial performance was also reflected in our cash flow from operations of $138 million this quarter. Capital expenditures were approximately $21 million. For the year, we more than doubled our cash flow from operations to more than $400 million and generated more than $300 million of free cash flows. With our strong balance sheet and cash flow generation, we paid off our outstanding credit revolver balance of $250 million after the close of our fourth quarter. We continue to return capital to shareholders through share repurchases. We repurchased approximately 2.4 million shares during the quarter and approximately 8.5 million shares during the fiscal year. Our $200 million share repurchase program has been completed and we have also announced a new share repurchase program of $250 million. Now turning to guidance, which is based on a 52-week fiscal year. Our performance in fiscal 2022 set new records for revenue, operating profit and cash flows. Our strong revenue growth this year benefited from a substantial sale of FlashArray//C to Meta, includes an extra week in the fiscal year and reflects an easier compare to fiscal 2021, which was impacted by COVID-related headwinds. We see broad-based demand strength continuing this year for our solutions and subscription offerings and expect our Pure as-a-Service offering to grow at a much faster rate than our overall company growth rate. As we consider these factors, we expect revenue in fiscal 2023 will be approximately $2.6 billion, growing 19% to 20%. Revenue in Q1 will be approximately $520 million, growing 26%. Operating profit substantially expanded this year as a result of strong operating discipline and operating leverage. As we have previously highlighted, operating profits also benefited from slower-than-anticipated hiring, less travel and fewer physical marketing events due to the COVID environment. While we do not expect the majority of these COVID-related benefits to recur next year as business operations become more normalized, we anticipate operating margins to expand modestly through continued operating discipline and leverage. We remain committed to investing in innovation for growth, while also contemplating higher inflation next year. With these considerations, we expect to achieve non-GAAP operating margins of approximately 11.5% and non-GAAP operating profits of $300 million for the year. Non-GAAP operating profit in Q1 is expected to be $16 million.  In closing, I am very pleased with our execution and performance. our consistent commitment to innovation and creating best-in-class experiences for our customers are really the driving forces of our success as we have seen. And I want to thank our entire Pure team and our channel partners for their outstanding execution this year. With that, I will turn it over to the operator so we can get to your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Amit Daryanani from Evercore.\nAmit Daryanani: Congratulations on a great set of numbers here. My question really is you officially announced Meta as a customer and they had this white paper that outline the storage leader on the super AI clusters that they have. Can you talk about sort of the breadth of this engagement. And I think you all know the revenue contribution from back in October, but maybe to talk broadly, what led them to choose Pure Storage versus building their own? And then what does it mean from a revenue perspective, if this cluster gets to 1 exabyte that they've talked about in their white paper?\nCharlie Giancarlo: Amit, Charlie Giancarlo here. Thank you for opening up the questioning. So Meta, I think, is a great example of the power of our portfolio because we had started working with Meta, formerly Facebook, actually some years ago using the FlashBlade platform on some of their AI initiatives. But as they look to scale out that AI initiative, what they really needed behind it was a data lake, something that could hold data at the right performance, although not necessarily to directly feed the GPUs. But that would provide high performance, but frankly, at a price that would compete with disk. And in addition, they had other constraints in their environment, space, power and cooling being an important element.  Frankly, not only did they look at their own technology internally, but they looked at outside vendors as well. And at the end of the day, we were -- our FlashArray//C product which forms that data lake behind the AI cluster was the only product that could satisfy all of the requirements on it. But it really shows the power of portfolio that is, I think, driving our growth across enterprise and around the world. And we do believe that it's what's going to allow us to continue to expand our overall footprint.  Let me turn it over a little bit to Rob Lee here to perhaps give you a little bit more behind the super cluster and then Kevan, on the revenue.\nRob Lee: Yes, Amit, just to add on to what Charlie said. Again, I just highlight this is a great example of use case benefiting from the entire portfolio. As Charlie mentioned, we started working with Meta, formerly Facebook, over 5 years ago, first supporting, I would say, their AI research environment, directly supporting data scientists, doing ad hoc kind of AI model training against the FlashBlade. And as that environment grew and continues to grow, they built around at a larger production AI supercluster environment, which Meta has come out and described.  And now in that environment, what they look to Pure to provide with FlashArray//C is really what we have described as more of a general data storage, bulk data storage capability, right, something that provides a huge capacity, certainly high performance. And then meeting the balance of needs that Charlie called out in terms of a very efficient power cooling and footprint associated with it.  And so I think a couple of things of note here. One is, well: A, great validation of our technology and advantages, but B, I think it's a great sign that look, the transition from disk to flash is absolutely happening. We see it in the enterprise. We're now starting to see it in the hyperscale environment. And we believe to a degree, this is not only happening, but it's an inevitable.\nKevan Krysler: And I'll just close Amit, with some -- share some thoughts in terms of the revenue contributions. But without getting into specifics, obviously. Certainly, from a revenue outlook, we've built some revenue in for Meta. And I would say it's in line with our overall company growth rates for next year.\nAmit Daryanani: Perfect. That's really helpful. And if I could just follow up quickly on your commodity, I think, has been a big discussion, especially NAND pricing. I'd love to understand what are you seeing from a NAND pricing perspective? And then what are you embedding really in the fiscal year guide relative to commodity prices?\nCharlie Giancarlo: Yes. We're expecting that the constraints, let's say, in the NAND production over the next couple of quarters is going to put upward pressure on NAND pricing. We do expect that to flow through and eventually come back down in pricing later in the year. We're not expecting huge swings to be direct. But \u2013 so slight upward pressure in the early part of the year and then downward pressure later in the year. That's our expectation. Of course, events have a way of changing expectations pretty quickly these days. So -- but that's what we're currently going with.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Meta Marshall from Morgan Stanley.\nMeta Marshall: Great. Wanted to see clearly, you guys stated you were seeing traction across a lot of different customer types. But just any details on kind of the magnitude of the beat, particularly as we look at the guide and we get to more of a seasonal kind of downtick there. Just any context for just where all of the upside came from? And then you noted that you were saying maybe that all of the COVID savings or COVID tailwinds don't come back or on the OpEx side, but just what you're expecting in terms of how much of that 200, 300 basis points would come back in fiscal '23?\nCharlie Giancarlo: Meta, first of all, welcome to Pure. Thank you for joining us. Look forward to be working with you over the next -- for the foreseeable future. On your question, as mentioned, we really saw, from a product line perspective, broad-based strength and particular strength in the U.S. I'd have to call out -- I'd have to say, both commercial and enterprise were strong.  Commercial, over -- we've been commenting on these 2 markets consistently quarter by quarter. Commercial has been slower to come back during this latter COVID period, but we really are starting to see some real strength in commercial building, especially over this last quarter. But our ability to be penetrating deeper and deeper into enterprise, both new customers, but in particular, penetrating more deeply in existing customers has been very strong, and it was really broad-based in the Americas. Good strength internationally as well. But I'd say, this past quarter, the Americas really -- has really shown it's -- the power of the IT environment in the U.S. has been very strong.\nKevan Krysler: Yes, I'd agree with that, Charlie. I think the U.S., Meta just had an outstanding quarter for us. In addition to what Charlie was saying, I think what we're seeing in the U.S. is really leveraging our expanded product portfolio and technology and solutions. With FlashBlade, we're really seeing some good traction on that front. So it's a shout-out to our sellers and channel in terms of the performance there. I think your next question was in terms of contribution with the COVID tailwinds. I think it's probably fair to say around 2 points, Meta, in terms of how we're thinking about that.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jason Ader from William Blair.\nJason Ader: I guess -- I thought it was a typo when I saw the number for the quarter, the revenue. I mean that's just a monster beat. I guess relative to the guidance, can you guys help us just understand how much of the upside came from Meta and how much came from other sources?\nCharlie Giancarlo: Jason, no confidence, a typo, really. Look, Jason, I don't think we could have or would have guided a quarter that was strong. It was certainly a very strong quarter. But I think it really has to do with starting -- the company starting to hit on all cylinders as we identified a strong portfolio now. The brand, we are very strong now across the board in terms of major markets. Our ability to sell and support them now widely respected, and simple fact that we can cover more of the use cases that they have without a doubt of the industry-leading products. And I think we're just hitting on more and more cylinders.  In terms -- Kevan, do you want to cover the guide?\nKevan Krysler: Well, yes, and I'll just tack a little bit more on to that, right? So it's really interesting for us, right, because the linearity we saw was actually really strong all the way throughout the quarter. end to end, which was really impressive for us. Again, the U.S. and Canada, frankly, outdelivered for us. And it was across the board, as Charlie said; enterprise, strong; commercial, strong; public sector, strong. The other thing that was interesting is we did stress test a lot in terms of, hey, were we seeing a lot of pull-forward activity due to supply chain. And frankly, we didn't see anything abnormal to that front. So yes, really strong for us.\nJason Ader: Was Meta a 10% customer for the year?\nCharlie Giancarlo: No, I believe they were not --\nKevan Krysler: They were not.\nJason Ader: Okay. And then one quick follow-up. On the -- I may have missed this if you talked about this, so I apologize. But the -- one of your competitors talked about constraints on low-level components, not on NAND, but on low-level components in their arrays, which created some challenges in terms of shipments in overall in their guidance. Is that something that you guys saw? I think they talked about it happening kind of mid-December. And just curious as to whether you guys were impacted by that.\nCharlie Giancarlo: Absolutely. That's a big challenge across the industry. We've -- obviously, we sync up with other companies, other manufacturers and those low-level parts have been a consistent problem throughout the industry. So every -- almost every day, there's a new challenge that challenges the supply chain team. So yes, no, it's a -- just to give you a sort of a broader view of the supply chain, I anticipate a question that might be coming up. We had indicated last quarter that we thought it would bottom out in Q4. And it probably has, but it hasn't really improved. It's still bouncing along the bottom, I'd say. And you never know another day when there's a new challenge that comes up, I think we've managed it well, but it's -- we're still waiting to see signs that we're on the upswing.\nKevan Krysler: It's almost becoming a new normal for us because obviously, this is the same, very similar challenges we were working through last quarter that we're very successful in partnership with our suppliers and delivering for our customers. But I'll tell you, I think the real benefits we're seeing is the value of our integrated hardware and software solutions that we over and over again keep talking about, and it just keeps getting validated as we're working through these challenges that Charlie outlined.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Rod Hall from Goldman Sachs.\nRod Hall: Yes. I want to ask the first question with regards to OpEx and OpEx leverage. I was just kind of looking at Arista's OpEx, sales and marketing to sales costs about 8% and you guys are about 30%, and that's fair because you distribute to a bunch of enterprises and hyperscale is pretty new to you. But that's the sort of sales and marketing ratio that a company that distributes more to hyperscale is capable of. And I just wonder, do you think over time if hyperscale mix increases, the marginal OpEx related to that in either such a small number of customers, Charlie could start to approach that lower number. I'm just wondering how you think about that hyperscale mixing into that sales and marketing costs. And then I've got a follow follow-up.\nCharlie Giancarlo: Right. Absolutely. No, that is the right example, right? I mean if you look at Arista's numbers, they operate on somewhat lower gross margin and higher operating margin due to lower sales and marketing. And that's the business model for selling into hyperscalers. As we go down that path, the model for us will be mixed. That is to say that there'll be an enterprise business model that will have a higher gross margin, but higher sales and marketing expense and a cloud business model likely to have lower gross margin, but lower sales and marketing expense. Those are the trade-offs that are made. My view is both of which should improve over time to give us higher operating margin.\nKevan Krysler: Well, in our subscription businesses as well.\nCharlie Giancarlo: And the subscription -- well, I mean, at higher gross margin as well.\nRod Hall: Right. Yes. That's why I thought. Thanks, Charlie. That's helpful. And then my follow-up was the Meta revenue up, down or flat in Q4 on Q3.\nKevan Krysler: Far down. I mean we just had a little bit of revenue coming in from our hyperscalers. So the majority of that revenue we saw in Q3.\nCharlie Giancarlo: And we should remember that generally, that is the way with large -- whether hyperscalers or service providers, it can be quite lumpy on a -- for an individual player.\nRod Hall: That makes sense. And when you guys think about that revenue then, you talked about the growth of it being kind of in line with the company growth. I didn't know what you meant by that. Are you saying sort of prorate the revenue you got in the second half like multiply it by 2 and grow that at the company rate? Or are you saying look at the absolute total of revenue in the year.\nKevan Krysler: Yes, keep it pretty simple, right? So when you take the outlook for next year and our growth rate, applying that on top of it, it's a general good framework to start out with.\nRod Hall: But the question is on top of what?\nKevan Krysler: What we did this year, what we did this year.\nRod Hall: Okay. Just the absolute number, not prorated or anything.\nKevan Krysler: That's exactly right.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Pinjalim Bora from JPMorgan.\nPinjalim Bora : Great. Congrats on an absolutely great quarter, it seems like. Charlie, listing to your vision in the prepared remarks, it sounded like Portworx will play a bigger role in the future. First, is that right? And then what are you seeing or hearing from customers with respect to the need for persistent storage and containers and kind of the maturity of container-based environments. And do you expect Portworx to be an important component of the growth equation in 2022?\nCharlie Giancarlo: Well, first of all, we absolutely expect Portworx and are continuing development of Portworx and Portworx data services to be foundational for us, for the future in next generation, what they call cloud native developments based on Kubernetes and containers. It's a very different environment than traditional storage, traditional data environment and therefore required a new way and a new set of -- new software to be able to support that. And we have the industry-leading product in Portworx. We're getting very extraordinarily good traction with Portworx across a wide range and growing range of customers.  Now that being said, I would not call containers or Kubernetes mature by any means. We're still -- that is the industry and customers are still very early in their development of container-based applications, but it is a -- when I say that, it's because most of their new developments are in -- are on containers using Kubernetes, but they have -- very few of them have gone into production. And it will take, obviously, over time, years for those production workloads to reach full scale. But you always want to be on the leading edge of these very fundamental and foundational changes. Rob, do you want to add?\nRobert Lee : Yes, absolutely. Just to add to that, Pinjalim, you asked the question about the growth and realization around state versus stateless containers. I think it's a great example of the maturity curve that Charlie is talking about. I think as the technology around containers matures and the adoption increases in the enterprise, we're seeing a couple of things. One is a realization that state matters and being able to store data, get it back and have all the enterprise resilience around it, it really does matter. As well as the enterprise data management workflows that go around it, whether that's a backup, disaster recovery, security or migration needs.  And that's where we really see customers across the board, recognizing that Portworx is really the only solution out there that's able to solve the entire set of data challenges and needs around the container environment, whether that's the container storage infrastructure, the data management workflows or now with Portworx data services, providing the data service and application tool capabilities with the integrated and curated database deployments. So net-net, definitely earlier in the maturity curve, but we're seeing great adoption and great growth within Portworx, and we think that's going to be an increasingly important part of our strategy going forward.\nPinjalim Bora : Got it. And Kevan, just a follow-up on the RPO growth. It's a fantastic number, 29% at $1.4 billion scale is pretty impressive. Are you seeing any kind of an elongation of contract duration that might be positively impacting that growth rate? Or would you say it's more apples-to-apples in terms of contract duration year-over-year?\nKevan Krysler: Thanks for the question. And I think it's pretty consistent from a duration standpoint. And then again, I do point the analyst base to our subscription ARR because I really do think that's a really good measure of the health of our subscription businesses and obviously, NDR, which we published is greater than 120 exiting the year.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers from Wells Fargo.\nAaron Rakers: Yes. And I'll ask 2 as well since nobody stuck to the one. So I guess the first question I have is that in terms of the hyperscale cloud opportunity, we've talked a lot about Meta. But as we look out over the next 12 months, do you think we come out of that timeframe, saying, \"hey, it's more than just Meta? have you had engagements with other cloud hyperscale customers on their own AI projects?\" Do you expect that customer base to expand as you look forward?\nCharlie Giancarlo: Well, we're putting work and effort into it. So I certainly expect it to expand as we move forward. The exact timing of these things. This is -- as I'm sure you're familiar, I mean, these are like engineering designs. It's like engineering, it's like selling into a new rack design for each hyperscalers, which itself takes several years for the hyperscaler. So A, it's a little bit difficult to predict the exact timing, but we do have conversations ongoing. It's certainly my expectation, but I can't say that it's near term. It's -- but 12 months is a long time. I hope to have an update there. It's definitely a strategic importance to the company overall. Rob, do you want to add? I'm sorry, go ahead.\nRobert Lee : No, I think -- No, I think you hit it, Charlie.\nAaron Rakers: And then as a follow-up, I know it's probably too early to kind of update Analyst Day kind of comments that you provided back in September. But just thinking about the growth that you had outlined, that mid-teens CAGR of revenue for fiscal '22 through '25. Maybe you can help us like -- did that assume that you were going to see some of these hyperscale cloud opportunities come to fruition? Or was that not necessarily baked into that expectation at that point?\nCharlie Giancarlo: I think it basically it didn't assume like a huge -- some type of hockey stick growth from the hyperscale environment. It assumed a moderate -- at the time, we obviously had already talked about a hyperscaler, which was Meta, obviously, -- so we assumed we'd get some from that, but I can't say we assumed a lot of it.\nKevan Krysler: Yes, I think that's fair, Charlie. In addition to that, we are assuming obviously acceleration with our subscription businesses overall as well, which is part of our long-range expectations in model.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Simon Leopold from Raymond James.\nSimon Leopold : I hate to sort of focus on the negative with all the things you -- metrics you've beat on, but I want to make sure I understand what occurred in your gross margin, specifically, product gross margin in your January quarter in that? I was under the impression that October was depressed because of the customer mix. And I don't think you have the same customer mix with the Meta shift down. So I want to maybe unpack this a little bit and then see if we can get an understanding of what affects, what elements are continuing in the April quarter as well as the fiscal '23 outlook on product gross margin.\nKevan Krysler: Yes, it's a great question, Simon, and I'll take it. This is Kevan. First of all, we're quite pleased with the product gross margins, but I do understand the question. We certainly did see some impact with higher costs at the component level that Charlie talked about as well as indirect costs, including logistics that were impacting us, and we saw a little bit of that coming through this quarter.  But look, we're continuing to benefit from selling the value of the integrated hardware and software architecture that I've alluded to and Charlie's alluded to and expect our ASPs to really be healthy, especially as our competitors who really sell in a cost plus start increasing the pricing, and we've seen that in the marketplace. And so in my prepared remarks, I talked about the fact that we continue to expect product margins to be in the high 60s, and that's again, consistent with our long-term expectations and understanding the challenges we're working through on the supply chain. So thanks for the question.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Wamsi Mohan from Bank of America.\nWamsi Mohan: If I could just follow up on that prior question on product gross margins. If we go back to 2 quarters ago, we're talking about 330 basis points of margin compression. And clearly, the supply chain environment is quite challenged. So as you think about this high 60s gross margin going into next year, is the underlying assumption that we're not going to see supply chain improvement? Or is there -- embedded in there some -- a full year of hyperscale revenue that could play some depressing role in the gross margin mix at least.\nCharlie Giancarlo: Yes. Wamsi, I think it's -- you're asking a complex question. Let me give it a start. First of all, we do think that we had some timing-related issues associated with the gross margin in Q4. It was not the hyperscaler related when you have rapidly changing prices as we saw our costs rather. As we saw in Q4, you can't always adjust for them right away through ASPs. But we see very strong ASPs because of the value of our product. We expect that the -- unless we have new challenges, which we are -- which we're unaware in Q1 and Q2, we're expecting these temporary gross margin -- product gross margin costs to effectively pass through. And we've been guiding for high 60s in our gross margin for many years. That's -- and so that's not a change from the past.\nKevan Krysler: Maybe I can add just a little bit more to that in terms of specific questions. So to be clear, we did not build in degrading product gross margins due to hyperscaler transactions. So I want to be clear on that. We do expect supply chain challenges to continue. But to Charlie's point, we sell on value, always have, the value of our software both Purity and Pure1, the integrated architecture of the hardware and software. And that's what we've been doing even before, obviously, the supply chain challenges. And that's really the validation point that Charlie is alluding to on the ASPs and why we believe our ASPs will respond accordingly and why we continue to believe that our product gross margins will be in our long-term expectations in the high 60s.\nWamsi Mohan: Okay. That's helpful. And if I have a follow-up. When we think about this hyperscale revenue, I think, Charlie, you mentioned that you first engaged with Meta maybe 5 years ago. Obviously, it took a while to sort of get to a healthy revenue level there with that customer in this past fiscal year. So why should, now that the proof of concept is sort of behind you, a lot of the technological like heavy lifting is sort of behind you, why should we expect growth rate to be in line with your aggregate growth rate when it's coming off a much smaller base and sort of it seems like a lot of the heavy lifting and proof of concept is sort of behind you, why shouldn't we expect a much faster growth on that piece of the business?\nCharlie Giancarlo: Well, Wamsi, from your lips, the God hears, of course, it's certainly something that we hope to see. But of course, every new sale depends upon a new engineering engagement in a new data center or a rack design with each customer, right? I will point out that while it took -- your chronology is correct. We sold them FlashBlade, and we have been selling them FlashBlade for AI uses over the last 5 years.  But the reason why we got the -- really I would say, generational and/or hockey stick type of order with FlashArray//C had more to do with the fact that we -- that Pure finally cracked the price performance level of disk, of midrange disk in such a way that it became compelling for a more traditional use case, which was a data lake type of use case. That's only just beginning. That level of price performance is just beginning. So it's a new, if you will, concept for the hyperscalers, and they're just getting used to it now. And of course, now they have to design to it and so forth. So it's really a question of timing and the hyperscaler\u2019s now starting to realize the opportunity for a new technology. I will identify one additional thing, which is that the benefit of our FlashArray//C or a QLC in delivering against the traditional use case is not limited to the price performance. We're able to deliver now just incredible performance relative to the environmental footprint of the storage involved, environmental in the case of power and cooling, environmental in terms of space and environmental in terms of landfill footprint if you will, waste footprint at the end of the day, much far less waste. So we think these are going to make a larger -- are going to be of larger importance to both enterprise and hyperscalers going forward.\nRobert Lee : And Wamsi, this is Rob, if I could just add in. I think specific to your question, which was, \"hey, we've built this relationship with Meta. How do we see the growth there? And why isn't that perhaps inflecting faster\". I'll just go back to remind you that just like each hyperscaler firm an environment is different. And each environment within a particular firm is different as well. And so each one of those -- going back to Charlie's comments, each one of those necessitating an engineering-driven almost design win process.  Now, certainly being a partner for Meta in 1 part of their environment and making them successful there helps us versus being in a new account. But just like we're having discussions with other hyperscaler firms in early days there, this is a longer process, much more of an engineering-driven design process in sale. And so it's just going to take some time.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Sidney Ho from Deutsche Bank.\nSidney Ho: Congrats on a great quarter. My question is on the demand side. Clearly, your peers talk about constraints impacting the growth but you guys did a great job managing the supply chain and upsided your own expectations, do you think some customers are adopting our solutions because they couldn't get the hard drive-based products? What -- so the question is, what do you think the sustainability of these wins -- won supply constrained fees? And then kind of related to that, do you think your as a service offering is benefiting from these constraints? And even if you have -- if you are, do you have enough capacity to serve this upside.\nCharlie Giancarlo: So on average, I would say, we don't see a significant amount of business that -- there are a few anecdotal cases where we did get business because of supply constraints, but there are few and far in between. I think this is very fundamental demand based on the expansion of our portfolio and our -- and the number -- and the segments that we're able to go after right now.  And so we do believe it's sustainable for the 3 reasons that I identified in my opening remarks, which is that we now have a much broader product line than we had just a few years ago. We sell into more segments. And our technology is different -- it has sustainable differentiation, difficult for the competitors to be able to easy to claim but difficult to actually deliver. So I think for those reasons, we're on the early stages of sustainable demand growth.\nSidney Ho: Okay. And then my follow-up question is I want to ask about this Rule of 40. Clearly, fiscal '22 was a good year, I think it was up 44%. I guess, you benefit from some of the reduced expenses from COVID. How do you think about the Rule of 40 this year. Revenue growth is about 20%. So I guess, indirectly asking about your free cash flow of margins.\nKevan Krysler: It's a great question. And yes, we kind of outdid ourselves this year, didn't we, in terms of the rule of 40. It was outstanding. And any metric we look at including the Rule of 40 framework. But look, our FY '22 performance in of itself really doesn't change our long-term view that we've shared about sustainable improvement within the rule of 40 framework. And look, when we look at our FY '23 outlook, it's tracking well with the long-term expectations that we set and discussed on Financial Analyst Day with you guys a couple of months back.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Nehal Chokshi from Northland Capital Markets.\nNehal Chokshi: Yes. And stunning results, especially in the context that you accelerated a 41% year-over-year product revenue growth with virtually no help from Meta, so spectacular. So the question actually is, is that you're guiding to 20% year-over-year growth in the April quarter, and you talked about that the driver here is a renaissance of IT spending within the Americas. Why should this continue to -- into the April quarter and beyond?\nKevan Krysler: Yes, I'll start, and I'll let Charlie kind of hit it from a macro standpoint. But when we chatted about the secure mount, right? We're seeing strong demand across our portfolio, which is obviously have been expand it. We're seeing good success across our entire portfolio, including our subscription businesses, key markets, key geographies in key business no matter what we're looking at, we're seeing strength. So that's a plus for us in terms of the demand signal that we're seeing.  And I also think when you think about our FY '23 outlook for revenue growth, just a few reminders for you, right, in terms of the FY '23 compare. Obviously, we had the large opportunity with Meta that was helping us out in FY '22. You have an extra week revenue in '22. And again, without taking anything away from our outstanding performance in FY '22, our growth rate was simply an easier compare because obviously, fiscal '21 had some COVID-related headwinds that we're working through.  So and then when I complement later on, the Pure as-a-Service growth with Cloud Block Store that we \u2013 we expect that growth to significantly outpace our company revenue growth rate for next year. And as a reminder, with Pure as-a-Service, revenue is recognized over time. So obviously, there's an impact there. But hopefully, that's helpful for you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Tim Long from Barclays.\nTim Long: Just 1 follow-up and a question, and a follow-up. Just I\u2019d kill the hyperscale one more time here. I think from one of the answers, just curious when you think about some of the other large customers since you were in Facebook for a while, you had at least somewhat of an advantage. Was one of the answers implying that for the other large hyperscalers, you don't have that same level of relationship coming in, therefore, it's a little more challenging? And then the second question is if you could just talk a little bit about kind of deal size and particularly cross-selling across -- more broadly across the products, I think you talked about FlashArray//EX doing really well and obviously C has done well. So can you just give us some color around cross-sell and how that's impacting repeat sales and deal sizes?\nCharlie Giancarlo: You bet. Thanks, Tim. So regarding the hyperscaler, we're not necessarily strangers to hyperscalers, but if we are in them, we tend to be in their IT organization, lessen their production organization. And it's a different -- as you may know, those are different relationships. We do get -- we have high marks in their IT organizations, but it's still different.  And as I said, remember, it is a engineering design win that has to go in more like a chip sale, if you will, than like a traditional enterprise system sale. So they take a while highly integrated with their teams, and we are at earlier stages, no doubt, we were already engaged in a production environment in Facebook. So that's certainly part of it. In terms of the broader portfolio, what's really interesting here is just having the broader portfolio convince this customers to take us into more of their environment and greater amounts of their wallet spend. And so regardless -- and I don't mean to diminish, if you will, the portfolio sale that does take place. But even without a portfolio sale, it's opening up new opportunities for us.  A significant portion now of our deals are portfolio sales. That is more than 1 product going in at the same time in the transaction that takes place. So that's growing nicely as well. But it's really convince customers that we're a vendor that, frankly, any time that they're looking to put in a new storage capability or replacing the existing storage capability that they have to consider us.\nOperator: Your last question comes from the line of Krish Sankar from Cowen & Company.\nKrish Sankar: Congrats on the great results. I have 2 quick questions. One is on the profitability. What gives you the confidence on the profitability for the whole year? I understand you spoke about OpEx going up because of inflation and COVID cost are working, but like your inventory is also at the all-time low. So I'm just trying to trying to figure out, is there -- what is the level of confidence on profitability? And then I had like a big picture question for Charlie.\nKevan Krysler: Welcome, Krish. I know you're new to the community as well in Pure. So welcome to you. And yes, let's spend a little bit of time on profitability. And I think we spent a fair amount of time walking through our thoughts on the gross margin side for product. We haven't spent much time on the subscription gross margin, which as you saw, was quite solid for us both for the quarter and for the year. And we think that trajectory will continue.  And look, I just -- when you look at the operating leverage and discipline that we achieved this year in addition to the COVID tailwinds and primarily within go-to-market sales and marketing, although all areas really benefited this year. But we're just going to continue that momentum simply, right? So we're going to continue to invest in growth, which is an absolute priority for us. But with that discipline in growing our global workforce, we think we can continue on our journey of increased profitability and feel quite comfortable with our modest operating margin expansion.\nKrish Sankar: Great. Thank you for that, and thanks very much for the kind words. And then just as a quick follow-up for Charlie. You spoke about IT spending. I'm just kind of curious like, there are some views that IT spending growth was strong last year and like grow this year, but maybe the second derivative terms negative. So I'm kind of curious from your viewpoint, was there any budget flush-in before and its being normalized this year? Or is it -- how to think about IT spending as a whole relative to Q4 and into FY '23?\nCharlie Giancarlo: Yes. We had a very strong linearity throughout the quarter. So there was no specific budget flush, either through December, which would typically be when most companies have their fiscal year or to the end of our fiscal year, which was end of January, beginning of February. So no, I can't say budget flush was much of a consideration at all. It was really -- I'll go back and say, that was really based on the overall strength of our business and competitiveness of our portfolio. Looking forward, obviously, we have better insight into the first half of the year than the second. And as we look at both industry and economic watchers as well as other companies in the IT space. We seem to see a theme of believing that this first half -- or at least more confidence in the first half than the second half. So I think that's probably more of what goes into the thinking.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes the question-and-answer session. At this time, I will turn the call over back to Charlie Giancarlo for closing remarks.\nCharlie Giancarlo: I want to thank you all for joining us today and especially Mita and Kriss, who are with us for the first time. Certainly, here at Pure, we're looking forward to not only this quarter but to our sales kickoff, which starts next week, and I'm going to welcome all of our sellers. It's going to be virtual, hopefully for the last time this time around. But we are broadcasting to you for the first time legally maskless from our Mountain View headquarters, and we're hoping that's a sign of things to calm. Thank you all very much again for joining us and look forward to talking to you next quarter.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Robert Lee",
            "content": "Yes, absolutely. Just to add to that, Pinjalim, you asked the question about the growth and realization around state versus stateless containers. I think it's a great example of the maturity curve that Charlie is talking about. I think as the technology around containers matures and the adoption increases in the enterprise, we're seeing a couple of things. One is a realization that state matters and being able to store data, get it back and have all the enterprise resilience around it, it really does matter. As well as the enterprise data management workflows that go around it, whether that's a backup, disaster recovery, security or migration needs.  And that's where we really see customers across the board, recognizing that Portworx is really the only solution out there that's able to solve the entire set of data challenges and needs around the container environment, whether that's the container storage infrastructure, the data management workflows or now with Portworx data services, providing the data service and application tool capabilities with the integrated and curated database deployments. So net-net, definitely earlier in the maturity curve, but we're seeing great adoption and great growth within Portworx, and we think that's going to be an increasingly important part of our strategy going forward. No, I think -- No, I think you hit it, Charlie. And Wamsi, this is Rob, if I could just add in. I think specific to your question, which was, \"hey, we've built this relationship with Meta. How do we see the growth there? And why isn't that perhaps inflecting faster\". I'll just go back to remind you that just like each hyperscaler firm an environment is different.

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Charlie Giancarlo",
            "content": "Hello, everyone, and welcome to our call. I hope you are healthy and faring well given the many challenges of the current environment. I'm very pleased to report that Pure delivered a fantastic Q4, capping off a great fiscal year. Our quarterly revenue grew 41% over last year's strong Q4. This past quarter, we again enjoyed strong growth, especially in the Americas, our largest theater and we grew across enterprise, commercial and public sectors. I'm especially pleased with our growth in both net new logos and subscription annual recurring revenue, indicating great progress against our long-term strategy. Full year revenue growth was 29% and the annual growth of our subscription revenue was 37%. Revenue growth and operational leverage drove strong profit and cash flow growth in fiscal '22. As we stated in our Financial Analyst Day presentation in September, our total addressable market of more than $60 billion across both storage and storage as a service continues to provide expansion opportunities for Pure. We believe that our strong performance is clear evidence of Pure's increasing strength. Three things are necessary for sustainable growth, which we have steadily developed within Pure: First, sustainable growth requires highly differentiated technology with sustainable competitive advantage. Pure's focus on developing purity software and our direct flash technology to maximize the many advantages of solid-state storage is unique in our industry and has taken many years to develop. Second, Sustainable growth requires a broad portfolio that addresses a full range of customer needs, a portfolio that we have steadily developed over the last several years. Third, sustainable growth requires the ability to support customers in all major market segments, commercial enterprise, public sector and cloud. Pure now has all 3 of these elements to drive our growth for many years to come. Pure's highly differentiated technology enjoys a strong sustainable competitive advantage. Many of Pure's advantages stem from core software architecture decisions that are practically impossible to retrofit into pre-existing software. Among our advantages are the simplicity in the design and use of our products, the ability to realize the best price performance from raw flash and the ability to perform nondisruptive upgrades for both hardware and software, which deliver a cloud-like experience. While some competitors make claims of nondisruptive upgrades in their marketing, they consistently failed to deliver.  Furthermore, Pure's proprietary hardware provides higher performance, reliability and longer lifetime while requiring less space, power and cooling than competitors' commodity-based systems, competitors would need entirely new designs and years of new software development to replicate Pure's advantages. Pure's growing portfolio of industry-leading storage and data management products has propelled the growth of our enterprise business to greater heights. Customers appreciate the simplicity of our portfolio which supports the majority of their traditional workloads with just 2 hardware architectures sharing a common software architecture. And their cloud native workloads with Portworx all integrated through Pure1 and all available as a service. They appreciate our ability to provide common interfaces and APIs between on-prem and the cloud. They have embraced our ability to support their development of cloud native applications with Portworx. They're excited by our vision to provide automated data management with Pure Fusion and Portworx data services. And they are overjoyed as we consistently deliver nondisruptive upgrades year after year and soon decade after decade with our Evergreen design, a model that has been claimed competitively but never replicated.  The effect of our portfolio is evident not only in our continuing penetration into large enterprise, but also in our recently announced collaboration with Meta. Meta chose Pure when it needed a storage partner to deliver powerful and scalable storage capabilities for their AI research supercluster. With FlashArray and FlashBlade, their AI supercomputer has unparalleled performance and benefits from a broad range of our technology's advantages, underpinned by Pure's foundation of simplicity, reliability and sustainability.  We announced a record number of new products and services this past fiscal year, including purity upgrades for ransomware and disaster recovery, additions to our FlashArray//C Series, FlashStack as a service, Pure Fusion, Portworx data services and major enhancements to our Pure1 digital experience. This past December, we announced FlashArray//XL, which delivers 5.5 petabytes of capacity in up to 80% less space and power than competitive all-flash solutions and it's off to a great start. Our product pipeline for FY '23 is no less ambitious, and I am incredibly excited about the year ahead. Our vision and technology to deliver a cloud operating model to our customers' multi-cloud data environment, spanning their private cloud and public cloud providers continues to resonate and grow. This vision is based on the concepts of first, providing common frameworks and APIs to both on-prem and hyperscaler environments; second, enabling fully automated data management to IT organizations through policy; and third, the abstraction of these IT created data classes for developers access through API. We are seeing strong interest in this transformational model built on Pure Fusion, Portworx and delivered by Pure1. We have enjoyed great success with our strategy of delivering a simple set of Evergreen data platforms that enables customers to focus more on leveraging their data than on managing their storage environment. Customers have rewarded us with market share gains and recognized us with the highest third-party certified Net Promoter Score in almost all industries of 85.2% for the calendar year 2021. From our primary focus on the commercial market just 5 years ago, we have expanded our skills and infrastructure to support all major markets. Today, our enterprise business model is fully capable of supporting the largest global organizations, both public and private, with a portfolio of products, subscription services, support and professional services. We do this with the help of a growing set of capable partners. We're now adding an ability to serve large hyperscalers and MSPs.  We are proud to partner with the world's largest global system integrators and managed service providers to make Pure a preferred part of their solutions. We recently announced a global partnership with Kyndryl, combining the power of Pure's offerings and Kyndryl expertise to deliver industry-leading solutions to customers' most complex challenges. Our joint customers are already benefiting from this partnership. One of the world's leading shipping and logistics companies chose Pure as-a-Service to build a secure data infrastructure for its new logistics offering for its clients. Being part of a major digital transformation to improve shipping and logistics worldwide, has special poignancy as we face supply chain challenges that continue to affect all companies.  I feel confident that we have one of the most robust supply chains in the business. Pure has invested in strong relationships with our supply partners and flexible multisource global operations over many years and we benefit from the architectural advantages of our integrated hardware designs. While there have been numerous supply chain challenges over the last year, and we are certainly not invulnerable to disruption in the future, we have navigated and managed them well and continue to meet our customers' demands.  Earlier, I had mentioned that Pure solutions are able to provide customers higher performance and reliability with significantly less space power and cooling than competitive all-flash products, in many cases, utilizing up to 80% less power in space. Lower energy use by our products will significantly reduce the environmental footprint of our customers' data centers. Third-party reviewed competitive comparisons will be 1 part of our full Environmental, Social and Governance, or ESG report, which we will publish later this month. In our first ever ESG report, we will identify our environmental achievements and future goals for improvement in our operations and downstream use of our products as well as our current state and future plans on talent recruitment and retention and diversity, equity and inclusion. And finally, our governance and business practices.  I would like to comment on 3 additional topics of broad current interest. First, the so-called great resignation, then inflation and then our response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. As is widely reported, employee attrition is elevated across all industries and especially in technology. However, the flip side of this coin is that there has never been a time in my memory when so much great talent was available all at 1 time. And we saw a strong traction in hiring during Q4. Our continuing success, large market opportunity and high employee satisfaction scores have made Pure a talent magnet. Inflation is also real, and there is no countervailing benefit. I believe this will be with us for some time, and we have assessed impacts to employee compensation and other operating expenses, which we have considered in our guidance.  We are carefully monitoring the situation in Ukraine. And I am dismayed by the want and disregard for both national sovereignty and human life currently on display. Our hearts go out to the people of Ukraine and all those affected by the conflict. We have ceased all shipments in support services in Russia and Belarus, which represents a small amount of business for the foreseeable future. We are providing support as appropriate to our employees and their families. In closing, I would like to thank our customers, partners and especially our employees for their trust and support of Pure this past year. Through all of the challenges over the last several years, Pure has thrived. We have been innovated, we've grown. We've battled competitors, large and small, and we've taken market share. Most importantly, we have delighted ever more customers by delivering solutions beyond their expectations. This simple formula will continue to fuel our growth for years to come. Over to you, Kevan. Amit, Charlie Giancarlo here. Thank you for opening up the questioning. So Meta, I think, is a great example of the power of our portfolio because we had started working with Meta, formerly Facebook, actually some years ago using the FlashBlade platform on some of their AI initiatives. But as they look to scale out that AI initiative, what they really needed behind it was a data lake, something that could hold data at the right performance, although not necessarily to directly feed the GPUs. But that would provide high performance, but frankly, at a price that would compete with disk. And in addition, they had other constraints in their environment, space, power and cooling being an important element.  Frankly, not only did they look at their own technology internally, but they looked at outside vendors as well. And at the end of the day, we were -- our FlashArray//C product which forms that data lake behind the AI cluster was the only product that could satisfy all of the requirements on it. But it really shows the power of portfolio that is, I think, driving our growth across enterprise and around the world. And we do believe that it's what's going to allow us to continue to expand our overall footprint.  Let me turn it over a little bit to Rob Lee here to perhaps give you a little bit more behind the super cluster and then Kevan, on the revenue. Yes. We're expecting that the constraints, let's say, in the NAND production over the next couple of quarters is going to put upward pressure on NAND pricing. We do expect that to flow through and eventually come back down in pricing later in the year. We're not expecting huge swings to be direct. But \u2013 so slight upward pressure in the early part of the year and then downward pressure later in the year. That's our expectation. Of course, events have a way of changing expectations pretty quickly these days. So -- but that's what we're currently going with. Meta, first of all, welcome to Pure. Thank you for joining us. Look forward to be working with you over the next -- for the foreseeable future. On your question, as mentioned, we really saw, from a product line perspective, broad-based strength and particular strength in the U.S. I'd have to call out -- I'd have to say, both commercial and enterprise were strong.  Commercial, over -- we've been commenting on these 2 markets consistently quarter by quarter. Commercial has been slower to come back during this latter COVID period, but we really are starting to see some real strength in commercial building, especially over this last quarter. But our ability to be penetrating deeper and deeper into enterprise, both new customers, but in particular, penetrating more deeply in existing customers has been very strong, and it was really broad-based in the Americas. Good strength internationally as well. But I'd say, this past quarter, the Americas really -- has really shown it's -- the power of the IT environment in the U.S. has been very strong. Jason, no confidence, a typo, really. Look, Jason, I don't think we could have or would have guided a quarter that was strong. It was certainly a very strong quarter. But I think it really has to do with starting -- the company starting to hit on all cylinders as we identified a strong portfolio now. The brand, we are very strong now across the board in terms of major markets. Our ability to sell and support them now widely respected, and simple fact that we can cover more of the use cases that they have without a doubt of the industry-leading products. And I think we're just hitting on more and more cylinders.  In terms -- Kevan, do you want to cover the guide? No, I believe they were not -- Absolutely. That's a big challenge across the industry. We've -- obviously, we sync up with other companies, other manufacturers and those low-level parts have been a consistent problem throughout the industry. So every -- almost every day, there's a new challenge that challenges the supply chain team. So yes, no, it's a -- just to give you a sort of a broader view of the supply chain, I anticipate a question that might be coming up. We had indicated last quarter that we thought it would bottom out in Q4. And it probably has, but it hasn't really improved. It's still bouncing along the bottom, I'd say. And you never know another day when there's a new challenge that comes up, I think we've managed it well, but it's -- we're still waiting to see signs that we're on the upswing. Right. Absolutely. No, that is the right example, right? I mean if you look at Arista's numbers, they operate on somewhat lower gross margin and higher operating margin due to lower sales and marketing. And that's the business model for selling into hyperscalers. As we go down that path, the model for us will be mixed. That is to say that there'll be an enterprise business model that will have a higher gross margin, but higher sales and marketing expense and a cloud business model likely to have lower gross margin, but lower sales and marketing expense. Those are the trade-offs that are made. My view is both of which should improve over time to give us higher operating margin. And the subscription -- well, I mean, at higher gross margin as well. And we should remember that generally, that is the way with large -- whether hyperscalers or service providers, it can be quite lumpy on a -- for an individual player. Well, first of all, we absolutely expect Portworx and are continuing development of Portworx and Portworx data services to be foundational for us, for the future in next generation, what they call cloud native developments based on Kubernetes and containers. It's a very different environment than traditional storage, traditional data environment and therefore required a new way and a new set of -- new software to be able to support that. And we have the industry-leading product in Portworx. We're getting very extraordinarily good traction with Portworx across a wide range and growing range of customers.  Now that being said, I would not call containers or Kubernetes mature by any means. We're still -- that is the industry and customers are still very early in their development of container-based applications, but it is a -- when I say that, it's because most of their new developments are in -- are on containers using Kubernetes, but they have -- very few of them have gone into production. And it will take, obviously, over time, years for those production workloads to reach full scale. But you always want to be on the leading edge of these very fundamental and foundational changes. Rob, do you want to add? Well, we're putting work and effort into it. So I certainly expect it to expand as we move forward. The exact timing of these things. This is -- as I'm sure you're familiar, I mean, these are like engineering designs. It's like engineering, it's like selling into a new rack design for each hyperscalers, which itself takes several years for the hyperscaler. So A, it's a little bit difficult to predict the exact timing, but we do have conversations ongoing. It's certainly my expectation, but I can't say that it's near term. It's -- but 12 months is a long time. I hope to have an update there. It's definitely a strategic importance to the company overall. Rob, do you want to add? I'm sorry, go ahead. I think it basically it didn't assume like a huge -- some type of hockey stick growth from the hyperscale environment. It assumed a moderate -- at the time, we obviously had already talked about a hyperscaler, which was Meta, obviously, -- so we assumed we'd get some from that, but I can't say we assumed a lot of it. Yes. Wamsi, I think it's -- you're asking a complex question. Let me give it a start. First of all, we do think that we had some timing-related issues associated with the gross margin in Q4. It was not the hyperscaler related when you have rapidly changing prices as we saw our costs rather. As we saw in Q4, you can't always adjust for them right away through ASPs. But we see very strong ASPs because of the value of our product. We expect that the -- unless we have new challenges, which we are -- which we're unaware in Q1 and Q2, we're expecting these temporary gross margin -- product gross margin costs to effectively pass through. And we've been guiding for high 60s in our gross margin for many years. That's -- and so that's not a change from the past. Well, Wamsi, from your lips, the God hears, of course, it's certainly something that we hope to see. But of course, every new sale depends upon a new engineering engagement in a new data center or a rack design with each customer, right? I will point out that while it took -- your chronology is correct. We sold them FlashBlade, and we have been selling them FlashBlade for AI uses over the last 5 years.  But the reason why we got the -- really I would say, generational and/or hockey stick type of order with FlashArray//C had more to do with the fact that we -- that Pure finally cracked the price performance level of disk, of midrange disk in such a way that it became compelling for a more traditional use case, which was a data lake type of use case. That's only just beginning. That level of price performance is just beginning. So it's a new, if you will, concept for the hyperscalers, and they're just getting used to it now. And of course, now they have to design to it and so forth. So it's really a question of timing and the hyperscaler's now starting to realize the opportunity for a new technology. I will identify one additional thing, which is that the benefit of our FlashArray//C or a QLC in delivering against the traditional use case is not limited to the price performance. We're able to deliver now just incredible performance relative to the environmental footprint of the storage involved, environmental in the case of power and cooling, environmental in terms of space and environmental in terms of landfill footprint if you will, waste footprint at the end of the day, much far less waste. So we think these are going to make a larger -- are going to be of larger importance to both enterprise and hyperscalers going forward. So on average, I would say, we don't see a significant amount of business that -- there are a few anecdotal cases where we did get business because of supply constraints, but there are few and far in between. I think this is very fundamental demand based on the expansion of our portfolio and our -- and the number -- and the segments that we're able to go after right now.  And so we do believe it's sustainable for the 3 reasons that I identified in my opening remarks, which is that we now have a much broader product line than we had just a few years ago. We sell into more segments. And our technology is different -- it has sustainable differentiation, difficult for the competitors to be able to easy to claim but difficult to actually deliver. So I think for those reasons, we're on the early stages of sustainable demand growth. You bet. Thanks, Tim. So regarding the hyperscaler, we're not necessarily strangers to hyperscalers, but if we are in them, we tend to be in their IT organization, lessen their production organization. And it's a different -- as you may know, those are different relationships. We do get -- we have high marks in their IT organizations, but it's still different.  And as I said, remember, it is a engineering design win that has to go in more like a chip sale, if you will, than like a traditional enterprise system sale. So they take a while highly integrated with their teams, and we are at earlier stages, no doubt, we were already engaged in a production environment in Facebook. So that's certainly part of it. In terms of the broader portfolio, what's really interesting here is just having the broader portfolio convince this customers to take us into more of their environment and greater amounts of their wallet spend. And so regardless -- and I don't mean to diminish, if you will, the portfolio sale that does take place. But even without a portfolio sale, it's opening up new opportunities for us.  A significant portion now of our deals are portfolio sales. That is more than 1 product going in at the same time in the transaction that takes place. So that's growing nicely as well. But it's really convince customers that we're a vendor that, frankly, any time that they're looking to put in a new storage capability or replacing the existing storage capability that they have to consider us. Yes. We had a very strong linearity throughout the quarter. So there was no specific budget flush, either through December, which would typically be when most companies have their fiscal year or to the end of our fiscal year, which was end of January, beginning of February. So no, I can't say budget flush was much of a consideration at all. It was really -- I'll go back and say, that was really based on the overall strength of our business and competitiveness of our portfolio. Looking forward, obviously, we have better insight into the first half of the year than the second. And as we look at both industry and economic watchers as well as other companies in the IT space. We seem to see a theme of believing that this first half -- or at least more confidence in the first half than the second half. So I think that's probably more of what goes into the thinking. I want to thank you all for joining us today and especially Mita and Kriss, who are with us for the first time. Certainly, here at Pure, we're looking forward to not only this quarter but to our sales kickoff, which starts next week, and I'm going to welcome all of our sellers. It's going to be virtual, hopefully for the last time this time around. But we are broadcasting to you for the first time legally maskless from our Mountain View headquarters, and we're hoping that's a sign of things to calm. Thank you all very much again for joining us and look forward to talking to you next quarter."

            "content": "Thank you, Charlie, and good afternoon. We saw outstanding execution and performance across our entire company, achieving record revenue, operating income and cash flows. Demand continued to be very strong across our portfolio of solutions, services and geographies, especially in the U.S. and Canada. Although supply chain challenges continue to persist, we executed for our customers, delivering our solutions and minimizing delays.  Growth of our subscription business is robust as we continue to create value-based outcomes for our customers. Subscription annual recurring revenue, or ARR, grew 31% to nearly $850 million. Also, our subscription net dollar retention or NDR at the end of the year exceeded 120% compared to our long-term target of 115% as a result of expansion growth from existing customers. Remaining performance obligations, or RPO, which includes our committed and noncancelable future revenue, was over $1.4 billion, growing at 29%. We acquired 470 new customers, reflecting increasing strength. New customer acquisitions were balanced across geographies, market segments and our solutions portfolio. Our total customer count now exceeds 10,000 customers, which also includes over 50% of the U.S. Fortune 500 companies. Now turning to financial results for the quarter. Total revenue for the quarter grew 41% to approximately $709 million. Revenue in the United States grew 51% and international revenue grew 20% year-over-year. Subscription services revenue grew approximately 42%.  For the full fiscal year, total revenue grew 29% to nearly $2.2 billion. Our fiscal year includes 53 weeks contributing both additional revenue and costs. Excluding the revenue contribution arising from the additional week, total revenue for the quarter grew approximately 37% and 28% for the year.  Total non-GAAP gross margins were nearly 69% this quarter. Non-GAAP product gross margins of 67% were slightly impacted by higher supply chain-related costs. We were very pleased with how we actively managed our supply chain challenges in partnership with our suppliers. Our integrated software and hardware designs continue to be very valuable as we manage these challenges. As we continue to sell the value of our solutions, we expect product gross margins to be in the high 60s, consistent with our long-range expectations.  Non-GAAP subscription services gross margins were solid at 73% this quarter. We achieved record non-GAAP operating profits of nearly $119 million and non-GAAP operating margins of 16.8% this quarter while also continuing to make investments to drive growth. Increased operating costs included higher compensation due to our strong performance, increased hiring and an additional week of operating expenses of approximately $17 million. Non-GAAP operating profit for the year also achieved a record high of $235 million and 10.8% non-GAAP operating margins. As we have highlighted in previous quarters, the COVID environment was a tailwind to our operating profits, contributing approximately 2 to 3 points of benefit to our fiscal 2022 operating margin, slower than planned hiring, significantly reduced travel and the reduction of physical marketing events were the largest drivers. Now let's turn over to the balance sheet and cash flows. We ended the quarter with over $1.4 billion in cash and approximately 4,200 employees. Our strong overall financial performance was also reflected in our cash flow from operations of $138 million this quarter. Capital expenditures were approximately $21 million. For the year, we more than doubled our cash flow from operations to more than $400 million and generated more than $300 million of free cash flows. With our strong balance sheet and cash flow generation, we paid off our outstanding credit revolver balance of $250 million after the close of our fourth quarter. We continue to return capital to shareholders through share repurchases. We repurchased approximately 2.4 million shares during the quarter and approximately 8.5 million shares during the fiscal year. Our $200 million share repurchase program has been completed and we have also announced a new share repurchase program of $250 million. Now turning to guidance, which is based on a 52-week fiscal year. Our performance in fiscal 2022 set new records for revenue, operating profit and cash flows. Our strong revenue growth this year benefited from a substantial sale of FlashArray//C to Meta, includes an extra week in the fiscal year and reflects an easier compare to fiscal 2021, which was impacted by COVID-related headwinds. We see broad-based demand strength continuing this year for our solutions and subscription offerings and expect our Pure as-a-Service offering to grow at a much faster rate than our overall company growth rate. As we consider these factors, we expect revenue in fiscal 2023 will be approximately $2.6 billion, growing 19% to 20%. Revenue in Q1 will be approximately $520 million, growing 26%. Operating profit substantially expanded this year as a result of strong operating discipline and operating leverage. As we have previously highlighted, operating profits also benefited from slower-than-anticipated hiring, less travel and fewer physical marketing events due to the COVID environment. While we do not expect the majority of these COVID-related benefits to recur next year as business operations become more normalized, we anticipate operating margins to expand modestly through continued operating discipline and leverage. We remain committed to investing in innovation for growth, while also contemplating higher inflation next year. With these considerations, we expect to achieve non-GAAP operating margins of approximately 11.5% and non-GAAP operating profits of $300 million for the year. Non-GAAP operating profit in Q1 is expected to be $16 million.  In closing, I am very pleased with our execution and performance. our consistent commitment to innovation and creating best-in-class experiences for our customers are really the driving forces of our success as we have seen. And I want to thank our entire Pure team and our channel partners for their outstanding execution this year. With that, I will turn it over to the operator so we can get to your questions. And I'll just close Amit, with some -- share some thoughts in terms of the revenue contributions. But without getting into specifics, obviously. Certainly, from a revenue outlook, we've built some revenue in for Meta. And I would say it's in line with our overall company growth rates for next year. Yes, I'd agree with that, Charlie. I think the U.S., Meta just had an outstanding quarter for us. In addition to what Charlie was saying, I think what we're seeing in the U.S. is really leveraging our expanded product portfolio and technology and solutions. With FlashBlade, we're really seeing some good traction on that front. So it's a shout-out to our sellers and channel in terms of the performance there. I think your next question was in terms of contribution with the COVID tailwinds. I think it's probably fair to say around 2 points, Meta, in terms of how we're thinking about that. Well, yes, and I'll just tack a little bit more on to that, right? So it's really interesting for us, right, because the linearity we saw was actually really strong all the way throughout the quarter. end to end, which was really impressive for us. Again, the U.S. and Canada, frankly, outdelivered for us. And it was across the board, as Charlie said; enterprise, strong; commercial, strong; public sector, strong. The other thing that was interesting is we did stress test a lot in terms of, hey, were we seeing a lot of pull-forward activity due to supply chain. And frankly, we didn't see anything abnormal to that front. So yes, really strong for us. They were not. It's almost becoming a new normal for us because obviously, this is the same, very similar challenges we were working through last quarter that we're very successful in partnership with our suppliers and delivering for our customers. But I'll tell you, I think the real benefits we're seeing is the value of our integrated hardware and software solutions that we over and over again keep talking about, and it just keeps getting validated as we're working through these challenges that Charlie outlined. Well, in our subscription businesses as well. Far down. I mean we just had a little bit of revenue coming in from our hyperscalers. So the majority of that revenue we saw in Q3. Yes, keep it pretty simple, right? So when you take the outlook for next year and our growth rate, applying that on top of it, it's a general good framework to start out with. What we did this year, what we did this year. That's exactly right. Thanks for the question. And I think it's pretty consistent from a duration standpoint. And then again, I do point the analyst base to our subscription ARR because I really do think that's a really good measure of the health of our subscription businesses and obviously, NDR, which we published is greater than 120 exiting the year. Yes, I think that's fair, Charlie. In addition to that, we are assuming obviously acceleration with our subscription businesses overall as well, which is part of our long-range expectations in model. Yes, it's a great question, Simon, and I'll take it. This is Kevan. First of all, we're quite pleased with the product gross margins, but I do understand the question. We certainly did see some impact with higher costs at the component level that Charlie talked about as well as indirect costs, including logistics that were impacting us, and we saw a little bit of that coming through this quarter.  But look, we're continuing to benefit from selling the value of the integrated hardware and software architecture that I've alluded to and Charlie's alluded to and expect our ASPs to really be healthy, especially as our competitors who really sell in a cost plus start increasing the pricing, and we've seen that in the marketplace. And so in my prepared remarks, I talked about the fact that we continue to expect product margins to be in the high 60s, and that's again, consistent with our long-term expectations and understanding the challenges we're working through on the supply chain. So thanks for the question. Maybe I can add just a little bit more to that in terms of specific questions. So to be clear, we did not build in degrading product gross margins due to hyperscaler transactions. So I want to be clear on that. We do expect supply chain challenges to continue. But to Charlie's point, we sell on value, always have, the value of our software both Purity and Pure1, the integrated architecture of the hardware and software. And that's what we've been doing even before, obviously, the supply chain challenges. And that's really the validation point that Charlie is alluding to on the ASPs and why we believe our ASPs will respond accordingly and why we continue to believe that our product gross margins will be in our long-term expectations in the high 60s. It's a great question. And yes, we kind of outdid ourselves this year, didn't we, in terms of the rule of 40. It was outstanding. And any metric we look at including the Rule of 40 framework. But look, our FY '22 performance in of itself really doesn't change our long-term view that we've shared about sustainable improvement within the rule of 40 framework. And look, when we look at our FY '23 outlook, it's tracking well with the long-term expectations that we set and discussed on Financial Analyst Day with you guys a couple of months back. Yes, I'll start, and I'll let Charlie kind of hit it from a macro standpoint. But when we chatted about the secure mount, right? We're seeing strong demand across our portfolio, which is obviously have been expand it. We're seeing good success across our entire portfolio, including our subscription businesses, key markets, key geographies in key business no matter what we're looking at, we're seeing strength. So that's a plus for us in terms of the demand signal that we're seeing.  And I also think when you think about our FY '23 outlook for revenue growth, just a few reminders for you, right, in terms of the FY '23 compare. Obviously, we had the large opportunity with Meta that was helping us out in FY '22. You have an extra week revenue in '22. And again, without taking anything away from our outstanding performance in FY '22, our growth rate was simply an easier compare because obviously, fiscal '21 had some COVID-related headwinds that we're working through.  So and then when I complement later on, the Pure as-a-Service growth with Cloud Block Store that we \u2013 we expect that growth to significantly outpace our company revenue growth rate for next year. And as a reminder, with Pure as-a-Service, revenue is recognized over time. So obviously, there's an impact there. But hopefully, that's helpful for you. Welcome, Krish. I know you're new to the community as well in Pure. So welcome to you. And yes, let's spend a little bit of time on profitability. And I think we spent a fair amount of time walking through our thoughts on the gross margin side for product. We haven't spent much time on the subscription gross margin, which as you saw, was quite solid for us both for the quarter and for the year. And we think that trajectory will continue.  And look, I just -- when you look at the operating leverage and discipline that we achieved this year in addition to the COVID tailwinds and primarily within go-to-market sales and marketing, although all areas really benefited this year. But we're just going to continue that momentum simply, right? So we're going to continue to invest in growth, which is an absolute priority for us. But with that discipline in growing our global workforce, we think we can continue on our journey of increased profitability and feel quite comfortable with our modest operating margin expansion."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. At the conclusion of our prepared remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I\u2019d now like to introduce your host for today\u2019s conference call, Mr. Sanjot Khurana. Mr. Khurana, please go ahead.\nSanjot Khurana: Thank you, and good afternoon. Welcome to the Pure Storage third quarter fiscal 2022 earnings conference call. My name is Sanjot Khurana, Vice President of Investor Relations at Pure Storage. Joining me today are our CEO Charlie Giancarlo, our CFO Kevan Krysler and our CTO Rob Lee. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that during this call, management will make some forward-looking statements, which are subject to various risks and uncertainties. These include statements regarding the COVID-19 pandemic and related disruptions, our growth and sales prospects, competitive industry and technology trends, our strategy and its advantages, our current and future product offerings and our business and operations. Any forward-looking statements that we make are based on facts and assumptions as of today, and we undertake no obligation to update them. Our actual results may differ materially from the results forecasted, and reported results should not be considered as an indication of future performance. A discussion of some of the risks and uncertainties relating to our business is contained in our filings with the SEC, and we refer you to these public filing. During this call, we will discuss non-GAAP measures in talking about the company\u2019s performance and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are provided in our earnings press release and slides. Additionally, when we refer to the sales in our prepared remarks, we mean total bookings excluding cancelable orders. This call is being broadcast live on the Pure Storage Investor Relations website and is being recorded for playback purposes. An archive of the webcast will be available on the IR website and is the property of Pure Storage. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to our CEO, Charlie Giancarlo.\nCharlie Giancarlo: Welcome everyone. As American families and many of you get ready for Thanksgiving, all of us at Pure extend to you our Thanks for joining us today to discuss another terrific quarter. We are very pleased with our Q3 results, which demonstrate what can be achieved when great innovation and enthusiastic customer focus work together. Our Q3 revenue was up 37% year-over-year with double-digit quarter-over-quarter growth across all product lines and across both US and the international markets. We are also pleased with our strong profitability trend continuing through this fiscal year. With a sustained and steady growth across all key regions, products and customer segments, Pure continues to take share in this large and growing market. Our strategy to deliver a modern data experience to our customers and partners continues to lead the industry with new firsts almost every quarter as we deliver on all aspects of the modern data experience. Modernizing data infrastructure, operation and application, this quarter we announced the latest additions to our product portfolio that brings storage and applications even closer together Pure Fusion, our new software defined multi-cloud self-service storage environment is a major advance that will allow customers to better manage their data in a multi-cloud environment, while enabling developers to deploy sophisticated data storage services on demand. We also announced Portworx Data Services, which will further allow those self-same developers to quickly deploy production grade data services on Kubernetes, together with advances and our Pure1 digital experience, Pure is enabling a cloud operating model for enterprises everywhere and engagement has been strong. Our next announcement on December 8, will push infrastructure modernization even further and extend the breadth of our FlashArray platform. Today all of Pure\u2019s capabilities are available as a service, we continue to see strong growth across Evergreen, Pure as a service and Portworx, which together represent a third of our revenues, Gartner has once again validated Pure\u2019s leadership in both of their Storage Magic Quadrant, recognizing our execution and vision in primary storage and in the rapidly growing file and object market for unstructured data, given our speed and breadth of innovation, it should not be a surprise that more and more customers are purchasing the full Pure portfolio. This quarter, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts chose a full Pure as a service solution with FlashArray and FlashDeck for block performance and capacity. FlashBlade for unified fast file and object. And our Portworx suite to containerized and modernize applications. The Commonwealth of Massachusetts said that what put Pure ahead of the competition was our ability to provide them with what they describe as a data plane as a service offering that can work with any data type provide ransomware protection and rapid recovery and scale seamlessly all delivered through an SLAs for transparency, reliability and cost effectiveness. One of their first use cases will be to modernize an application for Massachusetts law enforcement using Pure and Portworx they will provide fast distributed access to criminal record information with no degradation even under heavy load, increasing the safety of their law enforcement personnel and the public. Pure continues to see strong adoption in the public sector, state and local governments and agencies have long been a strong segment for Pure. I am pleased that we are seeing steady progress and traction with US federal and international governmental agencies. For instance we now have deployments in all three branches of the US federal government and three branches of the US Department of Defense. Enterprise and commercial markets continued to experience strong growth. Pure is proud to deliver our modern data experience to now more than 50% of Fortune 500 companies and almost 50% of Fortune's Global 500 list companies, which speaks to the universal appeal of our portfolio. I will now turn briefly to two topics very much in the news and on the investor\u2019s minds. Our global customers and prospects are beginning to appreciate the power and green advantage of Pure and by power I am not referring to IOPS or throughput, and by green I am not referring to our evergreen subscription. Simply speaking, Pure\u2019s products use dramatically less energy and create far less waste than competitive offerings. We take this expanded scope and responsibility very seriously and look forward to publishing our first environmental, social and governance report early next calendar year, when customers learn how much our solutions reduce energy, space and waste in their environmental footprint. Pure becomes a true partner in helping them achieve their ESG objectives. Supply chains on everyone's mind, and no company is immune to this disruption. As we have reported in the past, Pure has built a very robust supply chain based on strong, open and trusted relationships with our partners. Our strategy incorporates manufacturing and operations in multiple sites and on multiple continents to enable flexibility, resilience and global responsiveness. This past quarter, global semiconductor availability was more challenging than last quarter, and we expect this environment to continue into next year. However, our operations team and the strong partnerships we've built with our suppliers have continued to work well, minimizing impacts to our customers and our business. Knowing that our products are helping people all over the world is incredibly motivating to our team. I am proud of how well Pure employees have innovated, executed, and delivered our modern data experience to customers, despite the continuing COVID environment and the many other challenges they may individually face. I'd like to give a special shout out and congratulations to our new Chief Revenue Officer, Dan FitzSimons, who in his six years at Pure has risen to every challenge we've thrown at him, most recently leading our America's business to increasing excellence. Dan salivation is indicative of the deep leadership and bench strength we have across the company. Given the effectiveness of our team, the quality of our products and the strength of our customer and partner relationships, the future remains bright for Pure. Kevan, over to you.\nKevan Krysler: Thank you, Charlie and good afternoon. We are very pleased with the continued robust demand across our entire portfolio, as well as our execution delivering both strong revenue growth and operating profit during the quarter. The high demand we saw this quarter was balanced across our portfolio, key geographies and market segments. It was evidenced by our sales growth of an incredibly strong 41%, excluding countable orders. Our sales growth this quarter also includes sales of FlashArray//C to one of the top 10 hyperscalers. Our supply chain team and suppliers continue to execute, minimizing disruptions for our customers, despite an increasingly supply constrained environment, that is dynamic. We are also pleased with the continued progress of our subscription business as subscription services revenue grew approximately 38% year-over-year. Subscription ARR or annual recurring revenue was $788 million at the end of Q3 growing at 30% compared to last year. Subscription ARR includes the annualized value of all active subscription contracts as of the last day of the quarter, plus annualized on-demand revenue. Remaining performance obligations or RPO, which includes our committed and noncancelable future revenue, was over $1.2 billion, growing at 27%. We saw an improvement in new customer acquisition with 345 new customers representing 12% year-over-year growth. New customer acquisitions were balanced across geography, market segments and our solutions portfolio. Our total customer count has exceeded 9,500 customers, which includes over 50% of Fortune 500 companies. Now turning to additional specific financial results for the quarter. Total revenue grew 37% to approximately $563 million. Revenue in the United States grew 35% and international revenue grew 42% compared to last year. With the strong demand this quarter, including the sale of FlashArray//C to one of the top 10 hyperscalers products, revenue was very strong, growing approximately 37%. Non-GAAP total gross margins were 68.5% this quarter. The decline in non-GAAP total gross margins, both sequentially and compared to the last year is driven by non-GAAP product gross margins, which were 66.7% in Q3. Our sales of FlashArray//C to one of the top 10 hyperscalers this quarter and to a lesser extent, increasing supply chain costs were the primary drivers we saw impacting product gross margins this quarter. Non-GAAP subscription services margins continued to trend favorably at 72.1% this quarter. We achieved nearly $70 million of non-GAAP operating profit and 12.3% of non-GAAP operating margin this quarter. Increasing revenue growth, sales efficiency and the effects of the COVID environment contributed to our increasing profitability. We estimate that the effects of the COVID environment are approximately two points of benefit to our operating margin this quarter. These reduced expenses generally relate to significantly reduced travel, physical marketing events and slower than planned hiring. We ended the quarter with over $1.36 billion in cash and approximately 4,000 employees. Cash flow from operations of $127 million, we're again very strong this quarter and capital expenditures were $25.7 million during the quarter. We returned approximately 56 million of capital to repurchase slightly over 2.3 million shares. At the end of the quarter we have approximately $70 million remaining from our $200 million share repurchase program. Now turning to Q4 guidance, we expect strong demand in Q4 with estimated revenue to be approximately $630 million, growing 25%. We also expect continued healthy profitability, with non-GAAP operating profit estimated to be approximately $90 million in Q4 representing approximately 14% non-GAAP operating margin. For the full fiscal year given the strong performance of our business in Q3 and outlook for Q4 we are also raising our annual guidance. We now expect that our revenue for FY 2022 will be $2.1 billion growing approximately 25%. Non-GAAP operating profit is estimated to be approximately $206 million representing approximately 10% non-GAAP operating margin. In closing, our highly differentiated and innovative portfolio and services is why our customers are choosing Pure. I want to thank our entire Pure team and channel partners for continuing to deliver terrific results while navigating a dynamic environment. With that, I will turn it over to the operator so we can get to your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Jason Ader from William Blair.\nJason Ader: I didn't know if you wanted me to do a dance or something.\nCharlie Giancarlo: Yeah.\nJason Ader: Okay. So, I guess my main question is, can you rank water the main factors to driving your outperformance, I mean, obviously, this is a bit of a weird year, given that the cops are pretty easy, but yeah you guys seem to be executing really well. So maybe just macro execution, new products and then maybe competitor weakness, because we know that some of your competitors are struggling with supply, and I don't know that you think that's factoring in as well to your performance?\nCharlie Giancarlo: Yeah. Jason, thank you for the question. And first of all, I'd say that we had a hard time describing this quarter only in the sense that everything went very, very well this past quarter. So calling any one thing out really seemed to only diminish everything else that was going very well. So very, as I mentioned, very balanced across new products to be a lot longer, the longer balanced and strong growth across from our sales force, so very balanced among the sales force pretty general terms. Obviously, as you point out, the comps are easier, but even if you were to comparison two year comps, the coming together of the investments that we've been making over the enterprise, the investments we've made in broadening out our product line to be a much to major enterprises. The fact that, we did invest in enterprise, which COVID environment, all of these have really contributed to our strength and the fact that we've continued to advance the technology contributed to our strength. And the fact that we\u2019ve continued to advance the technology to the extent that, even as we pointed out, hyperscalers looking to utilize us in their infrastructure, and of course, that will be lumpy business, which we saw this quarter that that added to this quarter. But, again, it's very promising for us in terms of we think all these investments will continue to pay dividends as we go forward. So does that does that?\nJason Ader: Yeah, that's great. And then that's perfect. And Kevin, is there any early look at fiscal 2023 and how we should be thinking about both top line? And then, the operating margin, obviously, you've got some serious outperformance this year that, you just mentioned 2 points coming from kind of COVID related benefits. And you kind of just broad strokes on fiscal 2023 for us?\nKevan Krysler: Yeah, Jason. And again, when we think about it from a demand lens continues to be robust. As we think about Q4, I wouldn't see a significant change in demand as we look beyond Q4. Now, with that being said, it's probably a bit early to get specific views, as you mentioned for next year, I would like to see how the remainder of this year plays out with our guide that is reflecting continued strength in Q4. A couple of call-outs when we do think about next year. Look, these terrific growth rates that Charlie mentioned for all the great reasons, but are also aided as well by the COVID environment, so we do need to take that into account. And then obviously, the hyperscalers opportunity that's being reflected in this quarter is a consideration as well when we think about when we think about next year. But hopefully that's helpful, Jason.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo.\nAaron Rakers: Yeah. Thanks for taking the question. I guess, I kind of build off that last point can you help us [indiscernible] how meaningful that cloud opportunity was this last quarter? I think last quarter you talked about an eight figure deal, did that all impact this last quarter, is there any expectation of a follow-on for cloud opportunities and you may be in that same vein, can you talk about, I think recently announced a relationship or a deal with Microsoft Azure for EDA, was that the cloud relationship or is that something separate from your opportunities and I have a follow-up.\nCharlie Giancarlo: Right okay Aaron, so first of all, no the EDA announcement was separate from the top 10 hyperscaler obviously if we felt we could have announced it, we certainly would have. But the customer is - wants to keep this confidential, so we certainly respect that on the hyperscaler. But the EDA one is one that \u2013 yes we work very closely with Microsoft to develop it where customers want it to have very high speed performance on EDA workloads that it's not necessarily restricted or we don't believe that the architecture is restricted to EDA workloads, but we think that it's something that's going to scale well for us. So we're looking forward to that but the hyperscaler was different. I'll let Kevin respond with how we've given you some insight into how the hyperscale affected the quarter.\nKevan Krysler: Yeah I mean it\u2019s not that different than how we were talking about it last quarter as part of our guide. But hey if you think about with the quarter being completed, if we were to exclude the hyperscaler opportunity that came through this quarter, our year-over-year growth would more likely be in the high 20s is a good way to be thinking about it.\nAaron Rakers: Okay. And that's helpful. And just so I understand there's nothing embedded in this quarter from a hyperscale top 10 win. We announced the wind last quarter, but we booked it and fulfilled it this quarter. So this \u2013 that is in Q3.\nCharlie Giancarlo: Yeah.\nAaron Rakers: Yeah. And then as the quick follow up, I'm just curious on gross margin. I know you talked about the hyperscale deal impacting gross margin, but product gross margin, cost headwinds and stuff, do we think that those, start to abate? Do you feel comfortable still that that 70% plus gross margin that you outlined at the Analyst Day is achievable and how should we think about that in the next couple of quarters? Thank you.\nCharlie Giancarlo: Yeah. That sounds great. In that gross margin, I think on the 70% was more akin to the subscription, our subscription business. But hey, when we think about it from a product gross margin or total perspective we look the largest driver really this quarter was the hyperscale or opportunity did have some headwinds, obviously with the increasing component, costs that we saw in the quarter, but that would be a much lower driver, if you will, in terms of what we saw in the sequential and year-over-year drop in the product gross margins. And hey, when I think about looking into the Q4, I do expect our product gross margins were normalize back to what we typically see in the high 60s is a good way to think about it. And that's even obviously considering the cost increases that we're contemplating.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Simon Leopold with Raymond James.\nSimon Leopold: Thanks. Appreciate you guys taking the question. I wanted to [indiscernible] where you are in terms of the [indiscernible] the field software product revenue or contribution within the mix, so I know Pure Fusion is new, but [indiscernible] has been around [indiscernible]\nCharlie Giancarlo: Well, Simon, as. As you probably know, especially on new products as they grow, not to break them out I find that new products go through their own cycles. They tend to be they tend to be lumpy. And then you have too much focus on the new on the total revenue line. But what I would say is that, we gave color last quarter, on Portworx as well as Pure as-a-Service. In the three digit percentage range on a year-over-year, I would say, in terms of a breakup [Technical Difficulty] in the future.\nKevan Krysler: Yeah, that's right, Simon. [indiscernible] Solutions that we're delivering [indiscernible] you with our software that's part of that, and that's reflected in the gross margins we're seeing both on subscription and out on subscription ARR year-over-year, so pleased with [indiscernible] the software is [indiscernible] as we look at our growth numbers.\nSimon Leopold: Thanks. So just as a follow-up, I wanted to see if maybe you could unpack a bit about the use case for this hyperscaler and what I'm really trying to get at in this question is an understanding of if this is a repeatable opportunity, a repeatable opportunity, either with this customer or other customers. I'm looking for an undertaking [indiscernible] we should think of this as a new to make it grow for\u2026\nCharlie Giancarlo: You're right. Thanks, Simon. So I mean I think also Erin might have referred to this early on, and\nKevan Krysler: Right. Thanks, Simon. I think also Aaron might have referred to this early on I \u2013 and we didn't respond to it specifically. So I just want to start off where with this particular hyperscaler, we do believe it's repeatable. No reason for us not to believe that it's repeatable and conversations continue. But let me let Rob weigh in on the general use case.\nCharlie Giancarlo: Yeah. So as far as the use case, this is part of their production environment. It's an environment that and they're using this environment to essentially do analysis and an understanding of how to better deliver the hyperscaler service. So it is part of the production environment. I think as far as repeatability and understanding, it\u2019s just the broad applicability of the use case. I think what's notable is the overall size and capacities that we're talking about here, the performance requirement. And the fact that this, is a very sophisticated customer evaluated all the options available to them. Obviously, cost was a part of the equation. And so obviously with a disk, but pretty quickly came to the conclusion that FlashArray//C was really the only option, but that was going to solve the balance of their needs, performance, price, footprints and so forth. And I think it's also worth noting that the overall footprint savings was a key part of winning the initial deal. But we're now also undergoing, work with this same customer to quantify the environmental savings and benefits that we're delivering to them with a FlashArray//C solution as part of their ESG analysis. The nice thing is that these are all benefits that we're able to deliver to each and every one of our customers. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs.\nRod Hall: Hey. Thanks for taking my [indiscernible] I just want a quick clarification that this campaign from probably this year seems to indicate that there could be an extra week in fiscal Q4 but I might be wrong, but I just wanted to double check.\nCharlie Giancarlo: Spot on yeah. For this -- for Q4 as we contemplate Q4 we do have an additional week with our fiscal year and that is contemplated both from a revenue side and an OpEx side. The revenue and OpEx is about equal so I view it as a bit of a headwind for us in terms of profitability. Probably around $14 million, $15 million, both on the revenue in the OpEx side is a good way to be thinking about it in terms of the additional week.\nRod Hall: Got you. Very helpful and then I have a follow-up. So I just want to double check on this chartered fee, hyperscale roadmap. Now [indiscernible] hyperscale of digital model is obviously but I just had one thing do you feel more potential hyperscale customers traction about going forward are we having more accommodation for the players or anyone who is actually might be evaluating asset fee any color on that roadmap there would be very helpful.\nCharlie Giancarlo: Yeah. Well, first of all, we believe very strongly that as flash continues to decline relatively to the declines in magnetic disk, that there's inevitably going to be a crossover point where every player everywhere including the hyperscalers will start switching from disk to flash. And it's just -- it's just a matter of time and their particular use case or instance before that happens. We do have the best technology in the business. We are having multiple conversations with multiple parties. I think it's too early to -- the issue with these large environments is that they're lumpy, uncertain when they do come they're big, when they don't come you're waiting. So I think it's a little too early for us to speculate on it. But there are conversations and it is and we believe that is just a matter of time before flash is used in a more substantial way. All right. Let's say in a mainstream way in the hyperscale environment.\nRod Hall: Thank you, Charlie. And I think [indiscernible] revenues are finally assuming any revenues in fiscal Q4 from that hyperscale?\nCharlie Giancarlo: We are not expecting revenues from that particular hyperscale in Q4. We shifted all at that point. Well, I'm sorry. Okay. There's some residual revenue for it in Q4, but for the most part, no.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Steve Enders with KeyBanc.\nSteve Enders: Okay. Great. Thanks for taking the question. I just want to talk a little bit more on the guide pretty strong revenue that you're expecting to see there. But just kind of wondering kind of what's built into the assumptions within that guide and how should we be thinking about kind of how the macro environment has played out over the past 90 days? That's leading to the ways [indiscernible] guide here?\nCharlie Giancarlo: Well, let me start and then I'll let Kevin go into it. It's based on what we see in the market today in the performance that we had in Q3. We're certainly not \u2013 we're not contemplating any major changes to the current direction of the world economy. So the expectation is generally more of the same in terms of macroeconomic forces. We're expecting COVID to continue probably if you've been watching the news and watching the figures, it's having a seasonal effect. So seasonally it will get a bit worse, but we're not expecting that to make have a major change to in our expectations what business will - how business will perform this coming quarter, what we see is the strong demand and we believe that strong demand is based on fundamentals - fundamental demand, we don't think it's - we don't think that at least for our market, there's a lot of [indiscernible] demand out there and our lead times have stayed relatively low, our customers know that so they can order when they need it, not when not to gain the system.\nKevan Krysler: Yeah and Steve I probably wouldn't have much more to add on that, I think as we've got good visibility in terms of how we're looking at Q4 to Charlie's point, demand still is robust in terms of what we're looking at. No, no real change in the trajectory understanding that there's a little bit more in terms of what we're seeing on a wave of COVID on the European front. But again, I don't think those will be meaningful drivers as we think about Q4.\nSteve Enders: Okay great, that's helpful, and then just on just on the hiring environment, it seems like, it might have been a little bit behind plan in the quarter. But is there kind of anything to call out there in terms of where the biggest challenges are and when you kind of see that - see that beginning to reverse?\nCharlie Giancarlo: Yeah, I would say that the - being a bit behind in hiring is across the board, there's no one - let's say, function that stands out to put some context on it, we're seeing somewhat slightly higher attrition than average years, certainly a lot more than last year, last year was very low by comparison to an average year, this this year is a bit higher I would say that recruiting, interestingly is the quality - the quality of resumes that one can bring on for interviews now lot of lots of blocks that we need to fill. But we\u2019re confident we\u2019ll be able to catch up?\nKevan Krysler: Yeah. And I would just add on to that, that we are seeing a nice pick-up in terms of a hiring cadence. Thanks to our talent acquisition team, doing a nice job on that front. And that's been contemplated obviously in the Q4 guide as you'll see a pick-up in OpEx sequentially. And that's not only the additional week, but also contemplates the pick-up and pace that we're seeing and hiring talent as well.\nSteve Enders: Okay. Perfect. Thanks. Thanks for taking the questions.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi. Thank you for taking my question. This is John on behalf of Wamsi. My first question. So you've mentioned about the supply chain constraint headwind face the quarter. I was just wondering if you could maybe quantify the impact from a hospital revenue standpoint\u2026\nCharlie Giancarlo: Yes.\nUnidentified Analyst: \u2026as I just wanted to confirmed the guide reflects the supply chain uncertainty. Thanks.\nCharlie Giancarlo: Yeah. Maybe what I'll do is talk just more tactically in terms of the impact for the quarter and then maybe have Charlie just talk about it more from, from a holistic standpoint. Because I think the operations team and our engineering team as well as our suppliers continue to do a terrific job. And look, when I look at it for the quarter, obviously you saw a drop in product gross margins both sequentially and year-over-year. As I mentioned, a smaller piece of that is really due to the component cost increases that we saw during the quarter. That was moderated slightly by the fact that, that our ASPs are still quite stable and were quite competitive in the marketplace. So with that, I'll turn it over to Charlie to give some more a holistic macro comments.\nKevan Krysler: On the macro side, yeah, we see all, all costs associated with the supply chain. So all costs associated with the supply chain, so component transformation and logistics costs all have increased on an annual basis we think on the order of approximately 10%. So that's a significant cost increase and in what is traditionally a deflationary market for technology products. So quite significant. Our expectation at this point is that while supply chains will remain tight we're expecting to not see the same kind of increases in costs going into next year. Now it is as Kevin said a very dynamic market on a quarter-by-quarter basis things can change dramatically because both supply and demand are a little bit difficult to predict and that causes swings in pricing. So as Kevin mentioned it's a very dynamic market and it's hard to get a complete story or it's hard to have complete confidence in exactly where it will go.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great. Got it. Thank you. And as a quick follow-up I was just wondering how the broader IT spending environment is tracking, particularly in storage? And if you have any trends that you would call out? Thank you.\nCharlie Giancarlo: Yeah. On the enterprise side it's been quite robust. So we think quite good, a lot of demand, a lot more data processing are taking place and upgrading. So we've seen it a quite strong commercial. Wallace recovering is recovering slowly. I would say that in general that's probably still down from where it might have been without COVID. And we're looking forward to continue a recovery there. But I would think overall the demand for enterprise storage actually has been quite good.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Tim Long with Barclays.\nTim Long: Thank you. Maybe Charlie if you can talk a little bit or Kevin if you want to chime in, just obviously a good margin performance in the quarter. Just curious how I know you don\u2019t want to get into too much of next year but going to be a lot of moving parts, I guess, with some of the benefits becoming offsets with return to work and things like that. So kind of how are we thinking about leverage over the next year or two in the model? And then second, I wanted to just go back to the sort the hyperscale and FlashArray//C if I could, it looks like the pricing resulted in a much lower gross margin for that business. Just curious, how is that pricing said? Is it somewhat that you had to get close to disk? Is that kind of what the bogey is going to be for all hyperscale deals or will that be different and -- or potentially is it, maybe a tougher margin up front and then on repeat business, it's a little bit better. So if you can just talk about kind of the dynamics around pricing and potential movements there. Thank you.\nCharlie Giancarlo: Yeah. I don't want to get too far ahead of next year and we'll certainly have a better view of this as we -- when we get into our Q4 earnings call and projection for next year. What I would say is we're planning that we'll still be under COVID rules through certainly Q1 and probably most of Q2 and then as we get into the summer that's when we think we will start seeing customers being open to visits and therefore open up more travel and normal expense type category in-person meetings for some of the things we do as well. So that's -- we'll see about a half a year of a return to more investment and so I think what you're going to see is a gradual gradual easing into those additional expenses, at the same time, we expect there to be, as you saw during this, even the Coventry or more didn't really change all that all that much. But we have been improving our execution in terms of productivity. Certainly in our sales and marketing organization and we think increasingly over time in our engineering organization and so we\u2019re expecting to see more leverage really on a continuous basis as we go forward based on - based on greater productivity in the organization and that's largely based on scale.\nKevan Krysler: Yeah and I'll just chime in a little bit more on that and then we can move to the hyperscaler topic. But the when we think about the full fiscal year with our guide for Q4 which puts us around 10% non-GAAP operating margin, we're thinking about two to three points of that is tailwind from some COVID related aspects, whether that's less travel, whether that's less physical events from a marketing standpoint or from a hiring standpoint and obviously we're seeing a nice pace, an uptick on hiring. We expect that to continue and so when I think about next year and it's still too early to get too specific. But I would expect this to continue to gain more leverage, when you kind of exclude the tailwinds we're seeing from COVID [indiscernible] some nice roadmap in terms of how we're thinking about that.\nCharlie Giancarlo: Right on fee, I\u2019ll go back to that. On fee, we expect that a large portion of C sales to this hyperscaler, but also potentially others will be replacing if not replacing, usually it goes into new builds, but the new builds would be for them to look at flash rather than disk and so they'll be comparing the price to their existing disk design And as such, the early wins will probably be, lower margin but will improve over time both as flash costs improve, but frankly as they gain more experience with Pure as a provider.\nOperator: Your last question comes from the line of Karl Ackerman with Cowen.\nKarl Ackerman: Yes. Thank you. Good afternoon, gentlemen. Kevin, I \u2013 two questions, please. First one for Kevin. Mostly upside this quarter came from product revenue. That's quite impressive given the ongoing supply chain constraints you\u2019ve mentioned. I'm curious whether the upper the revised outlook for January is also driven primarily by product revenue, particularly given your planned expansion of your FlashArray platform that you highlighted in your prepared remarks. If you could comment on that would be helpful?\nCharlie Giancarlo: Yeah. And I guess my view on this, and I'll let Charlie and Rob add some, some commentary as well, as yeah, absolutely. We've gotten great momentum fueled by high demand across our portfolio, which is that translates to the growth rates you're seeing in product revenue. But obviously, we're also seeing good traction with our subscription business, 30% growth in our subscription ARR and obviously that's going to have a lag before that works its way to the P&L. But this comes back to how balanced the demand and strength is that we're seeing across the board, whether that's specific to our subscription business or whether that's specific to sales of our solution. So that that's really the storyline here is the balance strength that we're seeing across the board. Charlie or Rob any other points you'd add on that front.\nKevan Krysler: I think that answers that. Kevin, I think what you're seeing is strong demand for our products regardless of strong demand for our products, regardless of capital and/or subscription base. Of course, we always want to allow the customer to buy in the way in which they want to provide or want to buy rather. But we're expecting \u2013 I would say we're expecting this quarter and this Q4 to be balanced as well. So we are seeing just to be clear, we're seeing good growth in terms of service and obviously the way that works from given that\u2019s ratable, that starts off slow. So you don't see it, quite as readily. But again, I expect it to be balanced going into this quarter.\nKarl Ackerman: That's helpful. Thank you. I guess as my follow up, do you want to touch on margins a little bit. It seems that the entire upside in your revenue outlook for January is falling directly to operating income, which is quite impressive. Now that is quite impressive in now operating margins are in line with your long term outlook. On one hand, it seems you're benefiting from volume leverage and the other release offsetting these rising input costs through pricing actions. So in that vein, could you discuss the ability to perhaps further pass on rising input costs as they happen? And secondarily, how you see margins improving or may improve as subscription revenue becomes a larger piece of revenue next year? Thank you.\nCharlie Giancarlo: Yeah. Well, as we've said in the past, we don't specifically \u2013 we don't price on a cost plus basis. We price based on competition in the market. One of the unique things about this market is that nearly every new opportunity, even in an existing customer is newly negotiated with other with competitors. And as such, we're responding primarily to the pricing of our competitors rather than let's say a standardized discount for that customer. Many of our competitors do operate on a cost plus basis. And so with the rising costs that exists in the market that finds its way into the price negotiation. So because of that we do expect that for the most part ASPs and costs we expect relatively stable margins. It'll vary based on mix obviously the hyperscaler deal. But for the most part we think it'll stay relatively stable regardless of costs. Now part of the mix as well is in fact as you point out the subscription offerings. We expect long-term that those subscription offerings because they will have higher value we\u2019ll be providing more services in the subscription offerings than we do in the straightforward capital sale. And as such we expect those margins to be significantly over time to be above ours are reported our standard reported margins.\nKevan Krysler: Yeah. And just to be clear Karl D. here our view on the subscription margins it really hasn't changed since our Analyst Day and our communication and expectations on that. But to the Charlie's point with the growth of Portworx and then as we scale our Pure as-a-Service offering with cloud block store that clearly is going to give us some tailwinds as we think about it longer term for a subscription at our gross margins. Shorter term to your point \u2013 yeah we are very much pleased with what we're seeing in terms of increased profitability even considering the tailwind from COVID. So we like what we're seeing we'll definitely still trade and prioritize growth but we very much of have the belief that we can drive that growth and increase the operating leverage as well.\nOperator: This concludes the question-and-answer session. At this time, I'll turn the call back over to Charlie Giancarlo for closing remarks.\nCharlie Giancarlo: Thank you, operator. Pure has been preparing for this next phase of our growth for several years, building breadth in our product line, developing operational excellence in our functions, industry partnerships and vendor relationships, and most importantly, building trust and excitement with our customers. I want to thank our investors and our employees for their trust and their patience. I'm grateful for all the effort and creativity of our Pure team. And as I sit down to my own family's meal on Thursday, I'll certainly offer gratitude and thanks for everyone past and present that is nature what it is today. Thank you all for your attention and your questions, and I wish you all a happy Thanksgiving.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Charlie Giancarlo",
            "content": "Welcome everyone. As American families and many of you get ready for Thanksgiving, all of us at Pure extend to you our Thanks for joining us today to discuss another terrific quarter. We are very pleased with our Q3 results, which demonstrate what can be achieved when great innovation and enthusiastic customer focus work together. Our Q3 revenue was up 37% year-over-year with double-digit quarter-over-quarter growth across all product lines and across both US and the international markets. We are also pleased with our strong profitability trend continuing through this fiscal year. With a sustained and steady growth across all key regions, products and customer segments, Pure continues to take share in this large and growing market. Our strategy to deliver a modern data experience to our customers and partners continues to lead the industry with new firsts almost every quarter as we deliver on all aspects of the modern data experience. Modernizing data infrastructure, operation and application, this quarter we announced the latest additions to our product portfolio that brings storage and applications even closer together Pure Fusion, our new software defined multi-cloud self-service storage environment is a major advance that will allow customers to better manage their data in a multi-cloud environment, while enabling developers to deploy sophisticated data storage services on demand. We also announced Portworx Data Services, which will further allow those self-same developers to quickly deploy production grade data services on Kubernetes, together with advances and our Pure1 digital experience, Pure is enabling a cloud operating model for enterprises everywhere and engagement has been strong. Our next announcement on December 8, will push infrastructure modernization even further and extend the breadth of our FlashArray platform. Today all of Pure's capabilities are available as a service, we continue to see strong growth across Evergreen, Pure as a service and Portworx, which together represent a third of our revenues, Gartner has once again validated Pure's leadership in both of their Storage Magic Quadrant, recognizing our execution and vision in primary storage and in the rapidly growing file and object market for unstructured data, given our speed and breadth of innovation, it should not be a surprise that more and more customers are purchasing the full Pure portfolio. This quarter, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts chose a full Pure as a service solution with FlashArray and FlashDeck for block performance and capacity. FlashBlade for unified fast file and object. And our Portworx suite to containerized and modernize applications. The Commonwealth of Massachusetts said that what put Pure ahead of the competition was our ability to provide them with what they describe as a data plane as a service offering that can work with any data type provide ransomware protection and rapid recovery and scale seamlessly all delivered through an SLAs for transparency, reliability and cost effectiveness. One of their first use cases will be to modernize an application for Massachusetts law enforcement using Pure and Portworx they will provide fast distributed access to criminal record information with no degradation even under heavy load, increasing the safety of their law enforcement personnel and the public. Pure continues to see strong adoption in the public sector, state and local governments and agencies have long been a strong segment for Pure. I am pleased that we are seeing steady progress and traction with US federal and international governmental agencies. For instance we now have deployments in all three branches of the US federal government and three branches of the US Department of Defense. Enterprise and commercial markets continued to experience strong growth. Pure is proud to deliver our modern data experience to now more than 50% of Fortune 500 companies and almost 50% of Fortune's Global 500 list companies, which speaks to the universal appeal of our portfolio. I will now turn briefly to two topics very much in the news and on the investor's minds. Our global customers and prospects are beginning to appreciate the power and green advantage of Pure and by power I am not referring to IOPS or throughput, and by green I am not referring to our evergreen subscription. Simply speaking, Pure's products use dramatically less energy and create far less waste than competitive offerings. We take this expanded scope and responsibility very seriously and look forward to publishing our first environmental, social and governance report early next calendar year, when customers learn how much our solutions reduce energy, space and waste in their environmental footprint. Pure becomes a true partner in helping them achieve their ESG objectives. Supply chains on everyone's mind, and no company is immune to this disruption. As we have reported in the past, Pure has built a very robust supply chain based on strong, open and trusted relationships with our partners. Our strategy incorporates manufacturing and operations in multiple sites and on multiple continents to enable flexibility, resilience and global responsiveness. This past quarter, global semiconductor availability was more challenging than last quarter, and we expect this environment to continue into next year. However, our operations team and the strong partnerships we've built with our suppliers have continued to work well, minimizing impacts to our customers and our business. Knowing that our products are helping people all over the world is incredibly motivating to our team. I am proud of how well Pure employees have innovated, executed, and delivered our modern data experience to customers, despite the continuing COVID environment and the many other challenges they may individually face. I'd like to give a special shout out and congratulations to our new Chief Revenue Officer, Dan FitzSimons, who in his six years at Pure has risen to every challenge we've thrown at him, most recently leading our America's business to increasing excellence. Dan salivation is indicative of the deep leadership and bench strength we have across the company. Given the effectiveness of our team, the quality of our products and the strength of our customer and partner relationships, the future remains bright for Pure. Kevan, over to you. Yeah. Yeah. Jason, thank you for the question. And first of all, I'd say that we had a hard time describing this quarter only in the sense that everything went very, very well this past quarter. So calling any one thing out really seemed to only diminish everything else that was going very well. So very, as I mentioned, very balanced across new products to be a lot longer, the longer balanced and strong growth across from our sales force, so very balanced among the sales force pretty general terms. Obviously, as you point out, the comps are easier, but even if you were to comparison two year comps, the coming together of the investments that we've been making over the enterprise, the investments we've made in broadening out our product line to be a much to major enterprises. The fact that, we did invest in enterprise, which COVID environment, all of these have really contributed to our strength and the fact that we've continued to advance the technology contributed to our strength. And the fact that we've continued to advance the technology to the extent that, even as we pointed out, hyperscalers looking to utilize us in their infrastructure, and of course, that will be lumpy business, which we saw this quarter that that added to this quarter. But, again, it's very promising for us in terms of we think all these investments will continue to pay dividends as we go forward. So does that does that? Right okay Aaron, so first of all, no the EDA announcement was separate from the top 10 hyperscaler obviously if we felt we could have announced it, we certainly would have. But the customer is - wants to keep this confidential, so we certainly respect that on the hyperscaler. But the EDA one is one that \u2013 yes we work very closely with Microsoft to develop it where customers want it to have very high speed performance on EDA workloads that it's not necessarily restricted or we don't believe that the architecture is restricted to EDA workloads, but we think that it's something that's going to scale well for us. So we're looking forward to that but the hyperscaler was different. I'll let Kevin respond with how we've given you some insight into how the hyperscale affected the quarter. Yeah. Yeah. That sounds great. In that gross margin, I think on the 70% was more akin to the subscription, our subscription business. But hey, when we think about it from a product gross margin or total perspective we look the largest driver really this quarter was the hyperscale or opportunity did have some headwinds, obviously with the increasing component, costs that we saw in the quarter, but that would be a much lower driver, if you will, in terms of what we saw in the sequential and year-over-year drop in the product gross margins. And hey, when I think about looking into the Q4, I do expect our product gross margins were normalize back to what we typically see in the high 60s is a good way to think about it. And that's even obviously considering the cost increases that we're contemplating. Well, Simon, as. As you probably know, especially on new products as they grow, not to break them out I find that new products go through their own cycles. They tend to be they tend to be lumpy. And then you have too much focus on the new on the total revenue line. But what I would say is that, we gave color last quarter, on Portworx as well as Pure as-a-Service. In the three digit percentage range on a year-over-year, I would say, in terms of a breakup [Technical Difficulty] in the future. You're right. Thanks, Simon. So I mean I think also Erin might have referred to this early on, and Yeah. So as far as the use case, this is part of their production environment. It's an environment that and they're using this environment to essentially do analysis and an understanding of how to better deliver the hyperscaler service. So it is part of the production environment. I think as far as repeatability and understanding, it's just the broad applicability of the use case. I think what's notable is the overall size and capacities that we're talking about here, the performance requirement. And the fact that this, is a very sophisticated customer evaluated all the options available to them. Obviously, cost was a part of the equation. And so obviously with a disk, but pretty quickly came to the conclusion that FlashArray//C was really the only option, but that was going to solve the balance of their needs, performance, price, footprints and so forth. And I think it's also worth noting that the overall footprint savings was a key part of winning the initial deal. But we're now also undergoing, work with this same customer to quantify the environmental savings and benefits that we're delivering to them with a FlashArray//C solution as part of their ESG analysis. The nice thing is that these are all benefits that we're able to deliver to each and every one of our customers. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs. Spot on yeah. For this -- for Q4 as we contemplate Q4 we do have an additional week with our fiscal year and that is contemplated both from a revenue side and an OpEx side. The revenue and OpEx is about equal so I view it as a bit of a headwind for us in terms of profitability. Probably around $14 million, $15 million, both on the revenue in the OpEx side is a good way to be thinking about it in terms of the additional week. Yeah. Well, first of all, we believe very strongly that as flash continues to decline relatively to the declines in magnetic disk, that there's inevitably going to be a crossover point where every player everywhere including the hyperscalers will start switching from disk to flash. And it's just -- it's just a matter of time and their particular use case or instance before that happens. We do have the best technology in the business. We are having multiple conversations with multiple parties. I think it's too early to -- the issue with these large environments is that they're lumpy, uncertain when they do come they're big, when they don't come you're waiting. So I think it's a little too early for us to speculate on it. But there are conversations and it is and we believe that is just a matter of time before flash is used in a more substantial way. All right. Let's say in a mainstream way in the hyperscale environment. We are not expecting revenues from that particular hyperscale in Q4. We shifted all at that point. Well, I'm sorry. Okay. There's some residual revenue for it in Q4, but for the most part, no. Well, let me start and then I'll let Kevin go into it. It's based on what we see in the market today in the performance that we had in Q3. We're certainly not \u2013 we're not contemplating any major changes to the current direction of the world economy. So the expectation is generally more of the same in terms of macroeconomic forces. We're expecting COVID to continue probably if you've been watching the news and watching the figures, it's having a seasonal effect. So seasonally it will get a bit worse, but we're not expecting that to make have a major change to in our expectations what business will - how business will perform this coming quarter, what we see is the strong demand and we believe that strong demand is based on fundamentals - fundamental demand, we don't think it's - we don't think that at least for our market, there's a lot of [indiscernible] demand out there and our lead times have stayed relatively low, our customers know that so they can order when they need it, not when not to gain the system. Yeah, I would say that the - being a bit behind in hiring is across the board, there's no one - let's say, function that stands out to put some context on it, we're seeing somewhat slightly higher attrition than average years, certainly a lot more than last year, last year was very low by comparison to an average year, this this year is a bit higher I would say that recruiting, interestingly is the quality - the quality of resumes that one can bring on for interviews now lot of lots of blocks that we need to fill. But we're confident we'll be able to catch up? Yes. Yeah. Maybe what I'll do is talk just more tactically in terms of the impact for the quarter and then maybe have Charlie just talk about it more from, from a holistic standpoint. Because I think the operations team and our engineering team as well as our suppliers continue to do a terrific job. And look, when I look at it for the quarter, obviously you saw a drop in product gross margins both sequentially and year-over-year. As I mentioned, a smaller piece of that is really due to the component cost increases that we saw during the quarter. That was moderated slightly by the fact that, that our ASPs are still quite stable and were quite competitive in the marketplace. So with that, I'll turn it over to Charlie to give some more a holistic macro comments. Yeah. On the enterprise side it's been quite robust. So we think quite good, a lot of demand, a lot more data processing are taking place and upgrading. So we've seen it a quite strong commercial. Wallace recovering is recovering slowly. I would say that in general that's probably still down from where it might have been without COVID. And we're looking forward to continue a recovery there. But I would think overall the demand for enterprise storage actually has been quite good. Yeah. I don't want to get too far ahead of next year and we'll certainly have a better view of this as we -- when we get into our Q4 earnings call and projection for next year. What I would say is we're planning that we'll still be under COVID rules through certainly Q1 and probably most of Q2 and then as we get into the summer that's when we think we will start seeing customers being open to visits and therefore open up more travel and normal expense type category in-person meetings for some of the things we do as well. So that's -- we'll see about a half a year of a return to more investment and so I think what you're going to see is a gradual gradual easing into those additional expenses, at the same time, we expect there to be, as you saw during this, even the Coventry or more didn't really change all that all that much. But we have been improving our execution in terms of productivity. Certainly in our sales and marketing organization and we think increasingly over time in our engineering organization and so we're expecting to see more leverage really on a continuous basis as we go forward based on - based on greater productivity in the organization and that's largely based on scale. Right on fee, I'll go back to that. On fee, we expect that a large portion of C sales to this hyperscaler, but also potentially others will be replacing if not replacing, usually it goes into new builds, but the new builds would be for them to look at flash rather than disk and so they'll be comparing the price to their existing disk design And as such, the early wins will probably be, lower margin but will improve over time both as flash costs improve, but frankly as they gain more experience with Pure as a provider. Yeah. And I guess my view on this, and I'll let Charlie and Rob add some, some commentary as well, as yeah, absolutely. We've gotten great momentum fueled by high demand across our portfolio, which is that translates to the growth rates you're seeing in product revenue. But obviously, we're also seeing good traction with our subscription business, 30% growth in our subscription ARR and obviously that's going to have a lag before that works its way to the P&L. But this comes back to how balanced the demand and strength is that we're seeing across the board, whether that's specific to our subscription business or whether that's specific to sales of our solution. So that that's really the storyline here is the balance strength that we're seeing across the board. Charlie or Rob any other points you'd add on that front. Yeah. Well, as we've said in the past, we don't specifically \u2013 we don't price on a cost plus basis. We price based on competition in the market. One of the unique things about this market is that nearly every new opportunity, even in an existing customer is newly negotiated with other with competitors. And as such, we're responding primarily to the pricing of our competitors rather than let's say a standardized discount for that customer. Many of our competitors do operate on a cost plus basis. And so with the rising costs that exists in the market that finds its way into the price negotiation. So because of that we do expect that for the most part ASPs and costs we expect relatively stable margins. It'll vary based on mix obviously the hyperscaler deal. But for the most part we think it'll stay relatively stable regardless of costs. Now part of the mix as well is in fact as you point out the subscription offerings. We expect long-term that those subscription offerings because they will have higher value we'll be providing more services in the subscription offerings than we do in the straightforward capital sale. And as such we expect those margins to be significantly over time to be above ours are reported our standard reported margins. Thank you, operator. Pure has been preparing for this next phase of our growth for several years, building breadth in our product line, developing operational excellence in our functions, industry partnerships and vendor relationships, and most importantly, building trust and excitement with our customers. I want to thank our investors and our employees for their trust and their patience. I'm grateful for all the effort and creativity of our Pure team. And as I sit down to my own family's meal on Thursday, I'll certainly offer gratitude and thanks for everyone past and present that is nature what it is today. Thank you all for your attention and your questions, and I wish you all a happy Thanksgiving."

            "content": "Thank you, Charlie and good afternoon. We are very pleased with the continued robust demand across our entire portfolio, as well as our execution delivering both strong revenue growth and operating profit during the quarter. The high demand we saw this quarter was balanced across our portfolio, key geographies and market segments. It was evidenced by our sales growth of an incredibly strong 41%, excluding countable orders. Our sales growth this quarter also includes sales of FlashArray//C to one of the top 10 hyperscalers. Our supply chain team and suppliers continue to execute, minimizing disruptions for our customers, despite an increasingly supply constrained environment, that is dynamic. We are also pleased with the continued progress of our subscription business as subscription services revenue grew approximately 38% year-over-year. Subscription ARR or annual recurring revenue was $788 million at the end of Q3 growing at 30% compared to last year. Subscription ARR includes the annualized value of all active subscription contracts as of the last day of the quarter, plus annualized on-demand revenue. Remaining performance obligations or RPO, which includes our committed and noncancelable future revenue, was over $1.2 billion, growing at 27%. We saw an improvement in new customer acquisition with 345 new customers representing 12% year-over-year growth. New customer acquisitions were balanced across geography, market segments and our solutions portfolio. Our total customer count has exceeded 9,500 customers, which includes over 50% of Fortune 500 companies. Now turning to additional specific financial results for the quarter. Total revenue grew 37% to approximately $563 million. Revenue in the United States grew 35% and international revenue grew 42% compared to last year. With the strong demand this quarter, including the sale of FlashArray//C to one of the top 10 hyperscalers products, revenue was very strong, growing approximately 37%. Non-GAAP total gross margins were 68.5% this quarter. The decline in non-GAAP total gross margins, both sequentially and compared to the last year is driven by non-GAAP product gross margins, which were 66.7% in Q3. Our sales of FlashArray//C to one of the top 10 hyperscalers this quarter and to a lesser extent, increasing supply chain costs were the primary drivers we saw impacting product gross margins this quarter. Non-GAAP subscription services margins continued to trend favorably at 72.1% this quarter. We achieved nearly $70 million of non-GAAP operating profit and 12.3% of non-GAAP operating margin this quarter. Increasing revenue growth, sales efficiency and the effects of the COVID environment contributed to our increasing profitability. We estimate that the effects of the COVID environment are approximately two points of benefit to our operating margin this quarter. These reduced expenses generally relate to significantly reduced travel, physical marketing events and slower than planned hiring. We ended the quarter with over $1.36 billion in cash and approximately 4,000 employees. Cash flow from operations of $127 million, we're again very strong this quarter and capital expenditures were $25.7 million during the quarter. We returned approximately 56 million of capital to repurchase slightly over 2.3 million shares. At the end of the quarter we have approximately $70 million remaining from our $200 million share repurchase program. Now turning to Q4 guidance, we expect strong demand in Q4 with estimated revenue to be approximately $630 million, growing 25%. We also expect continued healthy profitability, with non-GAAP operating profit estimated to be approximately $90 million in Q4 representing approximately 14% non-GAAP operating margin. For the full fiscal year given the strong performance of our business in Q3 and outlook for Q4 we are also raising our annual guidance. We now expect that our revenue for FY 2022 will be $2.1 billion growing approximately 25%. Non-GAAP operating profit is estimated to be approximately $206 million representing approximately 10% non-GAAP operating margin. In closing, our highly differentiated and innovative portfolio and services is why our customers are choosing Pure. I want to thank our entire Pure team and channel partners for continuing to deliver terrific results while navigating a dynamic environment. With that, I will turn it over to the operator so we can get to your questions. Yeah, Jason. And again, when we think about it from a demand lens continues to be robust. As we think about Q4, I wouldn't see a significant change in demand as we look beyond Q4. Now, with that being said, it's probably a bit early to get specific views, as you mentioned for next year, I would like to see how the remainder of this year plays out with our guide that is reflecting continued strength in Q4. A couple of call-outs when we do think about next year. Look, these terrific growth rates that Charlie mentioned for all the great reasons, but are also aided as well by the COVID environment, so we do need to take that into account. And then obviously, the hyperscalers opportunity that's being reflected in this quarter is a consideration as well when we think about when we think about next year. But hopefully that's helpful, Jason. Yeah I mean it's not that different than how we were talking about it last quarter as part of our guide. But hey if you think about with the quarter being completed, if we were to exclude the hyperscaler opportunity that came through this quarter, our year-over-year growth would more likely be in the high 20s is a good way to be thinking about it. Yeah, that's right, Simon. [indiscernible] Solutions that we're delivering [indiscernible] you with our software that's part of that, and that's reflected in the gross margins we're seeing both on subscription and out on subscription ARR year-over-year, so pleased with [indiscernible] the software is [indiscernible] as we look at our growth numbers. Right. Thanks, Simon. I think also Aaron might have referred to this early on I \u2013 and we didn't respond to it specifically. So I just want to start off where with this particular hyperscaler, we do believe it's repeatable. No reason for us not to believe that it's repeatable and conversations continue. But let me let Rob weigh in on the general use case. Yeah and Steve I probably wouldn't have much more to add on that, I think as we've got good visibility in terms of how we're looking at Q4 to Charlie's point, demand still is robust in terms of what we're looking at. No, no real change in the trajectory understanding that there's a little bit more in terms of what we're seeing on a wave of COVID on the European front. But again, I don't think those will be meaningful drivers as we think about Q4. Yeah. And I would just add on to that, that we are seeing a nice pick-up in terms of a hiring cadence. Thanks to our talent acquisition team, doing a nice job on that front. And that's been contemplated obviously in the Q4 guide as you'll see a pick-up in OpEx sequentially. And that's not only the additional week, but also contemplates the pick-up and pace that we're seeing and hiring talent as well. On the macro side, yeah, we see all, all costs associated with the supply chain. So all costs associated with the supply chain, so component transformation and logistics costs all have increased on an annual basis we think on the order of approximately 10%. So that's a significant cost increase and in what is traditionally a deflationary market for technology products. So quite significant. Our expectation at this point is that while supply chains will remain tight we're expecting to not see the same kind of increases in costs going into next year. Now it is as Kevin said a very dynamic market on a quarter-by-quarter basis things can change dramatically because both supply and demand are a little bit difficult to predict and that causes swings in pricing. So as Kevin mentioned it's a very dynamic market and it's hard to get a complete story or it's hard to have complete confidence in exactly where it will go. Yeah and I'll just chime in a little bit more on that and then we can move to the hyperscaler topic. But the when we think about the full fiscal year with our guide for Q4 which puts us around 10% non-GAAP operating margin, we're thinking about two to three points of that is tailwind from some COVID related aspects, whether that's less travel, whether that's less physical events from a marketing standpoint or from a hiring standpoint and obviously we're seeing a nice pace, an uptick on hiring. We expect that to continue and so when I think about next year and it's still too early to get too specific. But I would expect this to continue to gain more leverage, when you kind of exclude the tailwinds we're seeing from COVID [indiscernible] some nice roadmap in terms of how we're thinking about that. I think that answers that. Kevin, I think what you're seeing is strong demand for our products regardless of strong demand for our products, regardless of capital and/or subscription base. Of course, we always want to allow the customer to buy in the way in which they want to provide or want to buy rather. But we're expecting \u2013 I would say we're expecting this quarter and this Q4 to be balanced as well. So we are seeing just to be clear, we're seeing good growth in terms of service and obviously the way that works from given that's ratable, that starts off slow. So you don't see it, quite as readily. But again, I expect it to be balanced going into this quarter. Yeah. And just to be clear Karl D. here our view on the subscription margins it really hasn't changed since our Analyst Day and our communication and expectations on that. But to the Charlie's point with the growth of Portworx and then as we scale our Pure as-a-Service offering with cloud block store that clearly is going to give us some tailwinds as we think about it longer term for a subscription at our gross margins. Shorter term to your point \u2013 yeah we are very much pleased with what we're seeing in terms of increased profitability even considering the tailwind from COVID. So we like what we're seeing we'll definitely still trade and prioritize growth but we very much of have the belief that we can drive that growth and increase the operating leverage as well."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. At the conclusion of our prepared remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference call, Mr. Sanjot Khurana. Mr. Khurana, please go ahead.\nSanjot Khurana: Thank you, and good afternoon. Welcome to the Pure Storage second quarter fiscal 2022 earnings conference call. My name is Sanjot Khurana, Vice President of Investor Relations at Pure Storage. Joining me today are our CEO, Charlie Giancarlo; our CFO, Kevan Krysler; and our CTO, Rob Lee. Before we begin, I would like to remind you all that during this call management will make some forward-looking statements, which are subject to various risks and uncertainties. These include statements regarding: the COVID-19 pandemic and related disruptions, our growth and sales prospects, competitive, industry and technology trends, our strategy and its advantages, our current and future product offerings, and our business and operations. Any forward-looking statements that we make are based on facts and assumptions as of today, and we undertake no obligation to update them. Our actual results may differ materially from the results forecasted and reported results should not be considered as an indication of future performance. A discussion of some of the risks and uncertainties relating to our business is contained in our filings with the SEC, and we refer you to these public filings. During this call, we will discuss non-GAAP measures in talking about the company's performance, and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are provided in our earnings press release and slides. Additionally, when we refer to sales in our prepared remarks, we mean total bookings exclude cancelable orders. This call is being broadcast live on the Pure Storage Investor Relations website and is being recorded for playback purposes. An archive of the webcast will be available on the IR website and is a property of Pure Storage. With that, I'll turn the call over to our CEO, Charlie Giancarlo.\nCharlie Giancarlo: Hello everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Pure had an outstanding Q2! As a growing, share-taking company, we expect every quarter to be record breaking, but this quarter was extraordinary. Sales, revenue and profitability were well above expectations. Revenue growth this quarter exceeded 23%, and we had the highest Q2 operating profit in our history. I was especially pleased with the growth of both our new and existing products, the balance of performance geographically, and our continuing penetration of cloud and large enterprise. These are all key parts of our long-term strategy that we\u2019ve shared over the past several years. These results also show that our strategy of investing into the pandemic, and specifically investing in our enterprise sales capability and expanding our product line, was the right one. As we discussed in past calls, we predicted that Pure\u2019s growth would accelerate as businesses adjusted to the COVID environment. We believe that our growth will be even stronger as businesses return to an in-office environment. We estimated that this would start this past Q2, and we are obviously very pleased with the results. Looking ahead, we expect that businesses will continue to adjust to the effects of the pandemic while driving digital transformation. We believe that the Delta variant has slowed a return to the office environment only temporarily, and that large-scale global vaccinations will do much to enable a full return to normal by spring of next year. As we indicated last quarter, we believe that the current environment enables us to return to our historical double digit growth rates, with increasing profitability. Our leadership and innovation of the data storage and management market continues to grow. Our strategy is focused on: delivering a unified cloud operating and procurement model, across all data storage use-cases and environments; enabling modern cloud-native applications built on containers; and driving the modernization of today\u2019s infrastructure with a focus on the all-flash future that modern applications will demand. Let\u2019s take a quick look at the results. This past quarter provided many areas of outstanding performance, highlighted by the highest total sales for any second quarter in the history of the company, growing more than 30% year over year; continued strength and momentum in Subscription Services revenue, up 31% year-over-year with strong growth in Pure as-a-Service, which almost doubled revenues compared to the prior year; and, our success in large enterprise continues to grow, comprising over 50% of our sales, with our top 10 customers spending more than $100 million in total. As I mentioned, both our new and existing products achieved new sales milestones. Frankly, the superlatives from this quarter are too numerous to fully enumerate, but here are a few highlights: Growth of our subscription businesses were very strong this past quarter with sales of both Pure as-a-Service and Portworx approximately tripling year over year. All subscription sales taken together, including Portworx, Pure as-a-Service and Evergreen, increased almost 50% year over year in Q2, and is approaching one-half of Pure\u2019s total sales. These results show both the continued attractiveness of our Evergreen model, and the market\u2019s excitement for our new subscription offerings.  It has been nearly a year since we announced the acquisition of Portworx. Every quarter as part of Pure, Portworx has beaten their targets. This past quarter, Portworx sales tripled year-over-year and continued to gain many new customers both large and small. Financial services and service providers are particularly interested in the ability to easily scale container-based workflows with Portworx. FlashArray//C continues to deliver tremendous growth, with sales tripling over last year. It remains the fastest growing new product in Pure\u2019s history and is enabling customers to transition to an all-flash data center. Cloud customers, in particular are making use of FlashArray//C to improve their reliability, to reduce their environmental footprint, and to lower their operational costs.  For instance, a recent eight-figure win with a top 10 hyper-scaler which will begin to ship this Q3 was won against traditional magnetic disk based on our high performance, small space and power footprint, and superior total cost of ownership. SafeMode is another compelling reason why ever more customers are turning to Pure. This high-performance ransomware protection solution for both FlashArray and FlashBlade takes less than a millisecond to create an immutable copy of data for fast recovery. And customers can send these snapshots to a variety of destinations such as FlashArray//C, FlashBlade, or AWS, Microsoft Azure, and NFS shares. Only 6 months after introduction, over 500 customers have enabled SafeMode.  These examples demonstrate the success of our strategy to provide organizations with the modern data services they need to modernize their data infrastructure, to take advantage of modern applications, and to manage their data and infrastructure through code, in a multi-cloud environment. Our focus on these goals has been rewarded with new and expanding customer relationships.  For example, one of our enterprise customers, a Global Fortune 500 financial services firm, recently chose a Pure as-a-Service subscription to fuel the expansion of their core operating applications in a virtual Hub. While increasing the performance, flexibility and scale of this global platform, they were able to reduce their physical footprint by nearly 80%, contributing significantly to their environmental sustainability goals. They estimate that this will reduce their total cost of ownership by nearly 70% while providing significant performance increases.  And with growing global concerns about ransomware attacks, a UK-based securities firm with sub-millisecond performance requirements found performance, simplicity, and safety in Pure\u2019s recovery capabilities. Using FlashArray SafeMode with our FlashBlade FlashRecover solution on an Evergreen Gold subscription, they now have the data protection and unified fast file and object platform they need to scale safely.  Our strategy since our founding is to focus on doing the right things for our customers and on doing things right. Our environmental goals dovetail with our customer-first values. Part of ensuring that our products and services have the lowest total cost of ownership means designing products that use less energy, require less cooling, need less maintenance, take up less space and produce less waste.  With our customers\u2019 increasing focus on their own environmental footprint, we will be providing more quantitative measures and sustainability programs going forward. Pure Storage is advantaged by the major trends in our industry: we enable companies around the world to shift to a cloud-operating model for their private and hybrid cloud infrastructure; we lead in driving the all-flash data center; and we have the most advanced services and tools to automate data management for our modern cloud-native applications.  As we entered the year, we stated that our customers would accelerate their investment in digital transformation with renewed confidence in economic recovery this year. This was clearly evident in our performance in the first half and especially this past Q2. In the current environment, we are confident that the momentum of our first half will continue into Q3 as evidenced by our Q3 guide and raised annual outlook. I want to thank our employees and our partners who have worked tirelessly to support our customers with great products and great service, throughout the uncertainty of COVID-19, and who have created our sustainable momentum. Everyone at Pure deserves to feel proud of the advancements we have made through this difficult period.  One last note that I would like to add before I turn the call over to our CFO Kevan Krysler. I am very pleased to announce that Rob Lee, whom many of you know, has just been promoted and will serve as Pure\u2019s Chief Technology Officer. Congratulations, Rob. John Colgrove, a.k.a. Coz, who in addition to his title as founder also served as CTO, will now take the title of Chief Visionary Officer. Rob will continue to report to him, and Coz will continue to serve Pure full time. Congratulations, Rob and Coz.  Kevan, over to you.\nKevan Krysler: Thank you Charlie and good afternoon. We could not be more pleased with the strength of our business, our execution and Q2 financial results. We saw strong sales execution across the globe which is reflected in our sales growth of 32%, excluding cancelable orders. Similar to what we saw last quarter our entire portfolio, including our subscription services, contributed to our performance. Our core business of FlashArray//X gained significant strength across our Enterprise, Commercial and Public Sector customers, FlashArray//C sales more than tripled year over year, and FlashBlade sales established a new record high for Q2. Our revenue growth was 23% this quarter, and product revenue had its highest year-over-year growth rate compared to the previous seven quarters. Remaining performance obligations, or RPO, which includes our committed and non-cancelable future revenue was $1.2 billion, growing 25%. RPO growth reflects the continued strength of our Subscription Services, including record sales this quarter of our unified subscription, Pure as-a-Service. We acquired 380 new customers representing 10% year-over-year growth, and we saw particular strength with new enterprise customers this quarter.  Now turning to specific financial results for the quarter. Total revenue grew 23% to approximately $497 million. Revenue in the United States grew 25% and International revenue grew 18% compared to last year. Subscription Services revenue grew approximately 31% year over year, and represents approximately 35% of total revenue. Product revenue was very strong during the quarter growing 19%. The differentiated value of our software and solutions continue to be reflected in our non-GAAP total gross margins of 70.5% this quarter. Non-GAAP product gross margins continue to be on the high end of our long term expectations at 70.3%. We expect that product margins will fluctuate depending on product mix as our newer offerings continue to scale.  Non-GAAP subscription services margins were 70.7%. Revenue and gross margin outperformance and improving sales efficiency contributed to delivering strong non-GAAP operating profits of $46.6 million. Continued reduced travel due to the on-going COVID environment and slower-than-planned hiring also contributed to lower operating expenses during the quarter. We ended the quarter with over $1.29 billion in cash and approximately 3,900 employees. Cash flow from operations achieved a record high this quarter of $123 million, resulting from improved linearity and strong collections as well as increasing operating leverage. Capital expenditures were $28 million during the quarter. We returned approximately $44 million of capital to repurchase slightly over 2.3 million shares as part of our $200 million share repurchase program.  Now turning to guidance. We are very pleased with our sustained momentum and improving operational efficiencies. We expect Q3 revenue to be approximately $530 million, growing almost 30%. Our revenue guide for Q3 includes revenue we expect to recognize in connection with the sale of FlashArray//C to one of the top 10 hyper-scalers. We also expect non-GAAP operating profit will be approximately $40 million.  I have mentioned in previous quarters that we would not be updating our annual view. However, given the strong performance of our business over the last several quarters, including our strong financial outlook for Q3, we have also updated our annual view. We now expect that revenue for the year will surpass $2 billion, growing approximately 21% to $2.04 billion. We also expect that operating income will be approximately $150 million.  This is an exciting time at Pure. Our strategy, innovation and service is compelling for our customers and we are executing with a focus on accelerating revenue growth and increasing profitability. Thank you to all of our employees and partners. I am also really looking forward to having you join us at our virtual Analyst Day on September 28.  With that, I will turn it over to the operator so we can get to your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from line of Pinjalim with JP Morgan.\nPinjalimBora: Seems like a super solid quarter here. Probably one of the highest beats I think if I was just looking at it going backward. Charlie maybe at a high level, did anything surprise you in the quarter when we were doing checks? A lot of partners can have highlighted that Pure continues to be -- continues to see relatively short lead times, while competitors tend to struggle with the longer lead times. Do you think that is helping you to gain share? Anything that surprised you in the quarter would love to know?\nCharlieGiancarlo: I think the reason why we continue to gain share and why the quarter was so good is that we've been preparing a portfolio of products that are really second to none. And while that was being done during the beginning of the COVID crisis, of course, there's a lot of disruption in our customer base. But as the customers have become accustomed to operating within the COVID environment, that portfolio and our focus on developing a set of enterprise capabilities, both in sales support as well as with our products, it's finally all coming together and hitting stride. And so no, we expect this to be the beginning, if you will, of very evident growth for the company as we go forward.\nPinjalimBora: Strong comments. Thank you for that. One follow-up for Kevan. It seems like you were able to maintain the gross margin sequentially, if I did my math correctly, quickly. Despite the inflationary pressures that have been creeping up, is it fair to say that you saw kind of a better pricing environment maybe as the component price inflation presumably made the competitors do less discounting in the field?\nKevanKrysler: Well, hey, Pinjalim. One is, I think the -- your math is right. So absolutely, we held on gross margins. And I really think that's a testament to a couple of things. I think our operations team continues to do an outstanding job. Our suppliers are continuing to work very closely with us. And yes, to answer your question, specifically, discounting did hold and I really attribute a lot of that to our sales team, and the discipline and execution in terms of why we saw the gross margin performance that we saw.\nOperator: Your next question comes from line of Aaron Rakers of Wells Fargo.\nAaronRakers: Yes. Thanks for taking the question. Also congrats on the solid results and guide. Throughout today's call, you referenced the fact that you've now got a -- top 10 hyperscale customer, it sounds like for the FlashArray//C product. I guess the question on that is that, is that tied to their cloud offerings or is that for internal usage? And do you expect this to kind of be the beginning of more potential hyperscale customer traction for the company going forward? And I have a follow-up. \nCharlieGiancarlo: Yes, it\u2019s a part of their overall operations. So I think the answer is affirmative from the question that you asked. And, we do feel that this is sustainable both in the sense of continuing with this customer, as well as we think it's the beginning of seeing other similarly situated hyperscale customers starting to look at flash as a real alternative.  As you may know, most of the hyperscalars, the vast majority of what they store, they store on disk. They may have a little bit of flash in their servers, but for the most part, all storage is on disk. And we think this is the beginning of breaking that structure. We finally have the kind of price performance that can really compete within the disk market.\nAaronRakers: Very helpful. I wanted to -- the follow-up question is on actually the subscription revenue, you referenced the subscription revenue up 31%. And then I think you mentioned that on a combined basis, Pure as-a-Service, Portworx and I believe Evergreen was up close to 50% year-over-year if I correctly got that. So, I guess, I'm curious of what is other -- what is in that other Subscription Services line that maybe wasn't growing as fast as the three combined that you mentioned? \nKevanKrysler: Hey, Aaron, this is Kevan. And this is just a clarification. I think the 50% reference is really towards sales and bookings and then obviously the revenue and there's a lag with the revenue. So, two different metrics here that we're referring to. \nAaronRakers: Okay, so just to be clear, Evergreen, Portworx and Pure as-a-Service basically are the majority, if not all of the services line in the P&L? \nKevanKrysler: That's correct.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank.\nJeffRand: Hi, this is Jeff Rand on for Sidney. I just wanted to kind of follow-up on the FlashArray//C into the hyperscalers, can you give us an idea of how close the pricing has gotten compared to HDDs? Or is this more about the need for better performance by the cloud providers? \nRobLee: This is Rob. I will jump in, and take that one first. So, when we look at FlashArray//C relative to the hybrid disk systems its competing with, generally speaking, we're seeing FlashArray//C being very price competitive, and actually price have been -- up to 30% price advantage in some cases. But I think what we're seeing, especially with this large hyperscaler deal is that, price is one element of the equation but all of the other attributes and benefits we are able to bring from flash, such as the performance, such as power, cooling savings, footprint savings, those are all very meaningful across the board. But at the hyperscale, they become super, super meaningful, right? And so, as we look at, for example, this customer, FlashArray//C was the only product that can meet their needs, without them having to go build new data centers.\nJeffRand: Great, thank you. And then just as my follow up, you didn't mention anything on supply chain in your prepared remarks, can you give us an update on that, if you're missing out on any revenue new to supply chain constraints? \nCharlieGiancarlo: Yes, no, again, I think we're doing a great job with our operations team, in partnership with our suppliers. Obviously, the environment, from our perspective hasn't changed much from what we saw last quarter. We just continue to be focused on it. And obviously, you see the results in our print. And so this will be an area that we will continue to focus on through second half. We'll manage that. But again, a testament to our sales team to continue selling the value, especially the software value associated with our solutions.\nOperator: Your next question comes from one of Wamsi Mohan of Bank of America.\nWamsiMohan: Yes, thank you. Your guidance for next quarter calls for close to 30% growth. But all that can be explained from sort of that acceleration from 22 to 30 can be explained really to easier compares. On the one hand, you're seeing, very good traction, Charlie you spoke about share gains. You essentially are reiterating sort of this better outlook for the full-year as well. Just trying to reconcile why wouldn't you see a further organic acceleration on top? I'm not saying 30%, 30% is really good, but why aren\u2019t we seeing a further acceleration, especially when you think about the comments around the backdrop of Delta being maybe somewhat transitory? \nKevanKrysler: Wamsi, I'm not sure I would follow your math in terms of 30% being entirely explained by the easier compare last year, it does represent a significant growth rate not just over last year, but frankly over the -- if we take -- and as a company we are looking at not just at year-over-year growth rate but year over two year growth rate because of obviously the anomalous compares with last year, and it's a substantial gain even over a two year compare rate. So, we think it's a suitably appropriate guide for this coming quarter, given the entire environment. And it is of course a raise, both from our annual look forward as well as to what was consensus. So, we do feel that it's an appropriate raise. \nCharlieGiancarlo: We are very pleased with what we're seeing in terms of the Q3 outlook and the idea that, we're driving almost 30% growth next year, with the opportunity we highlighted on FlashArray//C. So, I think the guide that we've come out with Q3 is actually quite strong. We're very pleased with that.\nWamsiMohan: Okay, great. If I could, I think I heard you Kevan maybe say that, some of the operating margin improvement, the operating profit dollar improvement was a function of not able to hire as fast as maybe you would have liked to. Can you just elaborate a little bit on that? How much behind are you versus target in terms of hiring? How should we think about the trajectory of that for the next few quarters? Thank you.\nKevanKrysler: Yes, absolutely. And again, what I really was pleased with, with the quarter was not only the top-line growth that we're driving, but the operating leverage that's coming with it. And really that's coming really from the sales organization. We are seeing really strong productivity and sales efficiency and discipline, and we're seeing that come through primarily on the operating leverage that we saw for Q2 and frankly the increased outlook for the remainder of the year. And so, when I think about the increasing operating leverage, I would look at first what we're doing in terms of outperforming on sales, as well as the gross margin performance, execution of the sales team. And then, yes, we've got a little bit of tailwind from the COVID environment. As I look at Q2, I would kind of view that between 1 to 2 points of the 9 points that we saw this quarter. So not a significant tailwind, but there is a bit of a tailwind that we saw for Q2. And, yes, we're managing that quite well.  Obviously on the sales side, even though we're got some more hiring to do on the sales side. They are just doing such a great job in terms of productivity. Participation rates are tremendous. We're seeing a great growth in participation rates, both on individual contributors, as well as the first line managers. So, like what we see there.\nOperator: Your next question comes from on for Steven Enders of Keybanc.\nUnidentifiedAnalyst: Hi, this is George on for Steven. Thanks for taking the question and reiterate my congrats on the quarter. I just wanted to ask if you could give us an update on your ability to close new logos. And then in the past, you've mentioned out COVID as a bit of a constraint from that, but then we've seen things sort of open up and then the Delta variant coming back. So, just an update on where you stand from that perspective. Thank you.\nCharlieGiancarlo: Yes. We do feel that, people working at home, offices not really being open is a bit of a constraint on net new logo growth. Despite that, of course we were pleased with the 10% growth we saw year-over-year, but in past years, of course, we saw more. We believe that as things opened up more, obviously that's been delayed a bit because of the Delta variant, but as things opened up more late this year, early next, we expect that to actually just improve our net new logo gains. But, in the meantime, our continuation to penetrate deeper and deeper into existing accounts, to penetrate deeper and deeper into the enterprise, and I might point out as well that our net new logo gains in enterprise was actually quite a bit strong. So as you might imagine, the commercial logo gains swamp because there were so many more commercial accounts. In terms of net new logos, net new logos tend to be dominated by commercial, but actually our gain of enterprise net new logos this past quarter was actually quite healthy. \nUnidentifiedAnalyst: Great. Thank you. That's very helpful. A quick follow-up. Obviously, it's a nice bottom line outperformance this quarter. Can you give us an update on how you're thinking about driving growth versus operating leverage over the long term? Thank you. \nCharlieGiancarlo: Yes, we feel like at this point in time, given our product portfolio and given the productivity that we're seeing from the sales force, we're going to be able to deliver both. We're going to be able to deliver both continued double digit growth as well as continued improvements quarter by quarter in our operating profit margins. So, yes, no, we're quite confident in that. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Simon Leopold of Raymond James.\nSimonLeopold: Thank you for taking the question. I first wanted to sort of check on how you're thinking about the longer term growth trajectory? Because in the past, Charlie, you've mentioned growth exceeding 20% and now you put up 23% and you're guiding for 29%, which maybe there's some easy comp to it. But if you could just sort of update us on how you feel about the overall trajectory relative to your prior comments about exceeding 20%? \nCharlieGiancarlo: Yes. No, we've made that commentary in the past because we feel quite comfortable that we will be exceeding 20% for the foreseeable future. I think we're going to stick to that point right now, which is exceeding 20%. I do think that we have room to grow beyond that again, as COVID wanes. But predicting that right now is probably not a fool's errand for all of us. But we do feel comfortable that in this type of COVID environment that we can continue to grow at over 20%. \nKevanKrysler: And Simon, we'll provide some more color on that as well on our virtual Analyst Day. So we look forward in terms of our longer term growth rate. So look forward to having those conversations as well. \nSimonLeopold: Great. And then just as a follow-up. You were helpful in terms of talking about bucketing revenue recurring, but maybe another way to segment your contribution. If you could talk a little bit about what portion of revenue and what's the trajectory for revenue that you would consider off premise? So what you're doing with hybrid cloud and things like the Cloud Block storage with Azure, what you're doing with AWS? Could you help us get a better assessment of how that fits into the model? \nCharlieGiancarlo: Yes, very much. So first of all, we've stated in the past that, cloud revenues has been about 30% plus. We haven't really calculated it for this quarter to be talking about. But it's trending generally the same. Of course, cloud is an area that we're very focused on and it's an area that we hope can actually continue to increase for us, especially as more and more customers and workloads go to either SaaS environments, cloud environments and as the consumer cloud continues to scale. And we feel as you're seeing with the FlashArray//C that over time we -- because our belief in the all-flash data center, the last bastion of mostly disk data center right now is actually in the cloud. And so it represents a great opportunity for us. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Shannon Cross of Cross Research. \nShannonCross: Just a couple of questions. The first, strength in cash flow, free cash flow. Obviously, you're buying back stock. Curious how you're thinking about acquisitions and other uses, you were about a year off when you announced Portworx. Then I have a follow-up. \nCharlieGiancarlo: Yes, thank you, Shannon, we continue to be investigating opportunities for M&A. We believe that M&A that really enhances our ability to provide a cloud operating model for our customers is the right way for us to be focused. And there isn't a quarter or even a week that goes by where we're not investigating potential combinations for the company. So M&A continues to be an active area of investigation for us. \nKevanKrysler: And I just -- I do want to comment on the strong operating cash flows, which I think were tremendous for the company. And again, I think there were kind of three areas that I would attribute that to this quarter. One was really that the great linearity that the sales team drove this quarter, which really improves collection efforts. And we saw that come through with the record operating cash flows that we saw this quarter. And the other thing, obviously, is the continued focus as a company we have on operating leverage, and we're seeing some good benefits from that as well. \nShannonCross: Okay, thanks. And then I'm just curious, given the inflationary environment, how are you thinking about component costs longer term and also just, some of the increased headcount, et cetera, costs that you're seeing? I know you're managing things well, and part of the pricing environment remains fairly positive. But how are you thinking about this, given what we're at least seeing coming from an inflationary perspective? Thank you. \nCharlieGiancarlo: Yes, it's a great question. Let me start, Kevan, you might have more. I would really separate it into the two items that you mentioned. One is component costs, which we have seen an increase, on average, about probably about 10% this year in increased component costs. But of course, we live in a -- on a longer term deflationary environment on component costs. So, we really view that as a temporary phenomenon having to do with supply chain shortages, and that should come back in the next year or so, to where to the standard long-term price reduction curve that exists in that environment.  On the flip side, absolutely, there's going to be -- and we're already starting to see the signs of an inflationary environment around wages. Our forecast and guides take that into account, but certainly, what you speak of is becoming evident. \nKevanKrysler: And one of the things I would just make sure to highlight too, back to the component cost is, look our approach to sourcing raw NAND really continues to be an advantage for us, really, when we look at some of other folks who are leveraging sourced SSDs and leveraging our software capabilities to enable NAND management is really beneficial for us in this time as well. So I think that\u2019s an important comment.\nOperator: Your next question comes from line of Karl Ackerman with Cowen and Company. \nKarlAckerman: Yes, good afternoon, gentlemen. With Portworx tripling revenue year-over-year, is it now accretive to operating income? And then second, you're exiting the fiscal year in the low double digit EBIT range that's in line with record quarterly results exiting 2019. That\u2019s certainly, really good. The question is, while some skeptics may suggest that's the -- maybe the best you can do, can you discuss the operational improvement since the beginning of 2020 that would argue operating profit improvement is sustainable and able to grow? Thank you. \nCharlieGiancarlo: Yes. Well, thanks for the question Karl, that's been on people's minds. Focusing on operational improvement, productivity enhancement across the board of the company has been something we've been very focused on over the last several years. COVID obviously set us back a bit, because obviously we plan to grow into productivity, and with COVID, we decided to continue to invest in areas that were we felt very important to our long-term growth, in particular, investing in our ability to penetrate large enterprise, which by the way, is part of productivity improvement; and two, was to invest in broad scale portfolio of products, again to help us to be able to penetrate and achieve much greater wallet share in our customer base. It was only a few years ago where we could only address maybe 10% of their storage needs, and today it's much wider than that.  So, as we look forward over the next several quarters with the anticipation for the top-line change that we've already discussed, we know quite strongly what our productivity gains are going to be in the different parts of our organization. And these are productivity gains that we're going to be able to continue to maintain inside the company. Again, last year was the anomaly, as it was for many companies, but in different ways. For us, it meant that our continued investment that we wouldn't see the productivity or the sales return on that until the economy started to improve. And now we're starting to see that.\nKevanKrysler: Yes, let me just add onto that a little bit, if you don't mind. Look, I think we've made -- none of this is surprise for us in terms of the increasing operating leverage. We're driving for this -- all due to the points that Charlie is making. And you actually see the great strides at go-to-markets making in terms of their costs and expenses as a percentage of revenue. I think that's going to continue. I think we'll see over time, we'll get some benefits on R&D as well. And obviously on our gross margins, continue to be strong. We've seen that on the product gross margin side, and also believe we can get more scale and improvement on subscription gross margins over time, as our unified subscription Pure as-a-Service scales. So, I absolutely believe there is upward trajectory to our operating leverage.\nOperator: Your next question comes from a line of Rod Hall of Goldman Sachs.\nRodHall: Yes. Thanks for the question. I guess I wanted to start Charlie with this FlashArray//C sale to the hyperscaler. I'm really intrigued by that as an opportunity. And I wonder if, maybe you can give us any more color on what that use case looks like, and are there other hyperscalers in your pipeline with very similar use cases? Just how big is that opportunity for you and what does that pipeline look like with those types of customers? And then I've got a follow-up.\nCharlieGiancarlo: Yes. So first of all, the individual opportunity itself is a very large opportunity. It's not a one-off, it's something that will continue as we go forward, as we understand it. It is a -- you can think of it as a general purpose implementation for one of their key application environments inside the organization. So, I really can't go much, much further than that. But it's not something that is unusual or extraordinary in a hyperscale environment. So, it is something that's easily transferable to other hyperscalers. It's not the -- by the way, it's not the first of the top 10 hyperscalers that we've sold FlashArray//C into. It's just one that is significant for a single quarter and we do believe that this is something that we can continue to expand to other hyperscalers as well.\nKevanKrysler: And just to be clear too, in terms of the strength we're seeing in our Q3 guide. Look, when we exclude this great opportunity that we're seeing with FlashArray//C in a top 10 hyperscaler, we're still in our comfortable 20%, plus 20% year-over-year growth rate, excluding that opportunity. So I think that's important to note as well in terms of the strength, is across the business and is across the portfolio. We're really excited about the FlashArray//C opportunity, but it's really incremental to the strength we're seeing. \nRodHall: Okay, great. That's helpful. Thanks for that. And then I was also interested in this comment you made on wage inflation. I guess it's tough to know kind of how that might play out over the next 18, 24 months. So just curious if you guys have any thoughts on what sort of inflation we'd be talking about? Are we talking about few percentage points you think you might incur? Or any kind of thoughts on quantification there? \nKevanKrysler: I don't want to go over -- I don't want to overestimate what it might be. But our thinking is it's going to be a few percentage points. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Amit Daryanani with Evercore. \nAmitDaryanani: I have two. First one, looking at the subscription growth metrics of 31%, which is obviously fairly impressive. And I think investors are going to just struggle with that number a bit. So I am wondering, is there a way to think about how much of this growth is coming from existing customers versus new customers? And then could you also quantify the size of some of the components that are well in the subscription line? \nKevanKrysler: Yes. We're not going to get into a whole lot of detail on that. Now, obviously on virtual financial Analyst Day, we'll provide some color that hopefully you'll find helpful in terms of our subscription momentum. And look, nothing's changed significantly. We've got great momentum on our unified subscription with Pure as-a-Service that we've highlighted. Portworx, still very important from us from a strategic perspective, but the performance is excellent. And obviously, our Evergreen is our bread and butter, it's our baseline, largest piece, continues to be so for the -- in terms of what we're looking at for this year. So we'll get to more details on that as we look out to the Analyst Day. But that would be all for now. \nAmitDaryanani: Fair enough. And then if I could just follow up, if I'm looking at the growth guide that you're providing for October quarter and the full year, the implication is obviously that October will be up 29%, 30% year-over-year. You've touched on that a bit. But then I think your implications for Jan quarter, it\u2019s going to decelerate to like 19%, 20%. I mean, that's sort of a really good number, but I would love to understand why the deceleration, are you seeing a bit of a pull in or are you just being conservative at the [implied] Jan quarter numbers? That'd be helpful. \nKevanKrysler: Well, I think it's important that we've been talking about the large hyperscaler, with the top 10 hyperscaler on the FlashArray//C that's putting some more strength on our Q3 guide. But look, sequentially, it's -- even sequentially Q3 to Q4, I'm pleased with what we're seeing year-over-year close to 20% for the annual outlook exceeding 20%. So overall, quite pleased with it. Don't really view it as a decel, especially when I think about our larger opportunity that we're digesting or expect to digest in Q3 with the FlashArray//C opportunity. \nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Kathy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. \nKathyHuberty: Kevan, just a comeback to the third quarter contribution from the Hyperscaler account, was that -- was the revenue contribution from that customer baked into the original for your revenue outlook? And are you expecting any contribution from that customer that would be material in the fourth quarter? \nKevanKrysler: That's a great question. Look, when we were looking at the annual guide at the beginning, no, it's fair to say that we wouldn't have contemplated. So it's part of our beat, both from an annual perspective and how we're looking at it for Q3. And we're not expecting a significant amount to come through in Q4. We'd expect the larger piece in Q3. \nKathyHuberty: Okay, thank you. And then just a follow-up, maybe for Charlie, if we step away from the slower hiring in 2Q, which I assume is more a function of the tight labor market, how are you thinking about hiring in the coming quarters to support the stronger demand you're seeing, and the intention to sustain growth rates north of 20% for the foreseeable future? \nCharlieGiancarlo: It's a great question, Kathy. Obviously, we want to sustain the strength and momentum of our sales capability. So, a high degree of focus on sales teams, both U.S. and internationally, and then continuing to develop -- further develop our infrastructure to being able to support sales. So, I would say largely, the areas of IT, other areas that supports sales growth, but the large -- the largest focus is going to be on sustaining sales momentum.\nOperator: Your next question comes from line of the Nehal Chokshi with Northland Capital.\nNehalChokshi: Yes. So just to be clear, this top 10 hyper scalar revenue contribution for Q3, very clear now, what was going to, but how much did it contribute during Q2 though? \nKevanKrysler: We didn't have an impact for Q2, Nehal. \nNehalChokshi: No impact for Q2. Okay. Great. And then you said that PaaS doubled in revenue year-over-year, but what about Paas bookings?\nKevanKrysler: So PaaS bookings almost tripled, almost tripled year-over-year. Yes. \nNehalChokshi: Wow. Okay. That's very impressive then. And then finally, you have your long-term model listed in your presentation for a couple of quarters now. Presumably, that's because you hope to update at the upcoming Investor Day. Is that correct? \nKevanKrysler: That's correct.\nOperator: Your next question comes from line of Matt Cabralwith Credit Suisse.\nMatthewCabral: Yes, thank you very much. I want to dig a little bit more into the Cloud Block Store. I think it's five, six months since you guys went GA on Azure. Just curious what the ramp has been there so far? And there's any way to compare and contrast what the ramp on Azure has looked like compared to what you saw on AWS the first time around? \nCharlieGiancarlo: Yes, absolutely. Well as we've said, in the past Cloud Block Store, fundamental part of our overall Pure as-a-Service subscription. And no doubt, it was very critical in driving part of that growth of the Pure as-a-Service, as many customers already determine which of the hyperscalers they want to use. And it's been instrumental in several of our Pure as-a-Service deals, some with some very large, certainly Fortune 50 companies that had set their sights on Azure. So, from that standpoint, very strong. And then, with respect to actual deployment on Cloud Blocks, actually I'm going to let Rob take that because he's the one that's been most tied into it.\nRobLee: Yes. So, on the deployments, Azure has come on really strong, right? So we've seen -- we see customers now deploying across AWS and Azure, I would say demand for Azure tends to be a little bit stronger. But if we step back from it, I think we look at Cloud Block Store and Portworx as a combination, really as forming the backbone of our cloud portfolio and we're seeing strength across the board there, really both from customers that are deploying in cloud day one with both Portworx and Cloud Blocks are now available in multiple cloud providers, but as well customers that are starting with Pure-as-a-Service with the unified subscription on-premise, and then later on growing and transitioning into Azure or AWS over time. And so, we see both of those motions and I think that's just validates our strategy as well as thesis that customers continue to value the flexibility and uniformity that we're able to deliver across the prem, hybrid, cloud and multi-cloud environments.\nCharlieGiancarlo: I will say, just to finalize our thoughts on Cloud Block Store that, it is a fundamental part of the unified subscription. We rarely see -- although we do see some customers that will just go to Cloud Block Store without having arrays on-prem. But far more customers are using it as a way for them to be able to transition from on-prem into the cloud. And therefore the -- it starts off as a unified subscription. And then they start to migrate whether it's for disaster recovery or other capabilities, they have test into their cloud environment using Cloud Block Store. So it tends to be, first of all, an attractive element to the unified subscription. But secondly, taken advantage of subsequent to the engagement on the Pure as-a-Service.\nMatthewCabral: Got it. All that's really helpful. And then just a quick follow-up, you called out enterprise momentum several times in the prepared remarks and a couple of times in the Q&A. But just wondering, if you can you spend a little bit more on just biggest contributors or drivers to that strength. And I'm curious if there is any way to think about how much of that momentum is just bigger footprint within existing customers versus getting into some net new wins versus the competitive landscape, and maybe those being a little bit bigger than they were in the past?\nCharlieGiancarlo: Yes. It's actually all of the above. First of all, having a broader portfolio gets you more respect within an enterprise customer, whether that's a new customer or an existing customer. We had enterprise customers four years ago when I first joined and their first response to me is, \u201cPure you're great, but we can only use you for this specialized environment. Why can't you build products that cover the rest of our storage footprint?\u201d And so having a broad portfolio is necessary to be a good partner to an enterprise customer. It also allows you to compete for larger deals inside those customers. And then for a number of customers, this was certainly true with a lot of banking customers. Until we can reach a certain scale and address a certain percentage of their footprint, they actually didn't even want to talk to us, because they want to have, what are very significant relationships.  So really -- so then going back to the beginning of your question, it's been because of the investment that we've made into enterprise capabilities, both sales, as well as support. It's been investment in the breadth -- the broadening of the product line, and it's been about maturing our own organization in terms of how to work with enterprise customers. So, all of those have contributed to our ability to -- and our success that we've seen in expanding our enterprise business.\nKevanKrysler: Just to add onto that, I think one of the areas that we haven't talked too much about today, in the portfolio is FlashBlade. And I think that's a great example of where we've invested in broadening the portfolio, broadening our enterprise capabilities and feature sets. And that's reflective in the strength we saw, FlashBlade did extremely well in terms of large deals. And just getting back to Charlie's point, having the breadth of enterprise capabilities in the portfolio, whether it's FlashArray//C, which we talked quite a bit about, FlashArray//X or FlashBlade. Having all of that together really just helps us go and prosecute these opportunities. \nOperator: And your last question comes from the line of Matt Sheerin with Stifel. \nMattSheerin: Charlie, in your opening remarks you talked about seeing somewhat of a slowdown in return to office on-prem as customers -- and certainly we've heard that from other companies as well. Your guidance for the quarter is strong even without that hyperscaler deal. So could you give us more color on what you're hearing from customers and partners about timing of projects? And in your visibility, is it better or perhaps weaker because of that? \nCharlieGiancarlo: No, I think our visibility into their build-outs has been excellent. It really has. So they share a very -- they share openly with us. Obviously, planning of build outs take some time, so they do want to share openly. I would say that the returns -- we've been -- remember, there's only about a couple of months when there was people returning to the office and then it got slowed down right away. So most of the improvement we're seeing is from the improvement of working in a COVID environment, not because things freed up tremendously over the summer. So our guide just -- as I mentioned before, just reflects the way the world is as we see it today, not based on any further opening up. We do think that when the world does open up, we'll see even better performance to be clear.  I would say that, if anything, on a very small basis what we did see was some projects move out, not because of COVID, it was all because of customers' ability to get other products for their build-out with servers, networking, sheet metals, power supplies, whatever it might be, we definitely saw expected timelines push out a bit on -- in some customer environments. So -- but all that I think bodes well for us in the future as things improve. \nMattSheerin: Okay. Thank you. And you talked a lot about the strengths you're seeing from the enterprise customer base. Again, last quarter you called out commercial as finally picking up. Is that continuing to hold up? Are you seeing any other signs there? \nCharlieGiancarlo: It did hold up, but it didn't improve any more than it did last time. So that's what we're waiting for. As COVID improves, we think commercial will pick up even more. But it did hold up certainly through this last quarter and we expect it to hold up through this quarter. \nKevanKrysler: Yes. I think the commercial business did really well. I mean, obviously coming off such a fantastic quarter last quarter and then holding on to that strength, I think is pretty impressive. So we were impressed with both enterprise and commercial. \nOperator: And this concludes the question-and-answer session. At this time, I'll turn the call back over to Charlie Giancarlo for closing remarks. \nCharlie Giancarlo: Thank you, operator. Well, Q2 has really been a fantastic quarter for Pure as our strategy and our execution have become evident this quarter. Pure is being chosen because we deliver a leading and highly differentiated technology with also best-in-class customer experience. It's a very exciting time at Pure and we're in a great innovation cycle with our portfolio and our sales momentum and our execution has never been stronger. I do want to recognize again, the hard work of all of our employees at Pure, and the strong collaboration that we've had from our business partners, everyone's singularly focused on delivering strong results for our customers. Thank you all and have a good evening. \nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "This is Rob. I will jump in, and take that one first. So, when we look at FlashArray//C relative to the hybrid disk systems its competing with, generally speaking, we're seeing FlashArray//C being very price competitive, and actually price have been -- up to 30% price advantage in some cases. But I think what we're seeing, especially with this large hyperscaler deal is that, price is one element of the equation but all of the other attributes and benefits we are able to bring from flash, such as the performance, such as power, cooling savings, footprint savings, those are all very meaningful across the board. But at the hyperscale, they become super, super meaningful, right? And so, as we look at, for example, this customer, FlashArray//C was the only product that can meet their needs, without them having to go build new data centers. Yes. So, on the deployments, Azure has come on really strong, right? So we've seen -- we see customers now deploying across AWS and Azure, I would say demand for Azure tends to be a little bit stronger. But if we step back from it, I think we look at Cloud Block Store and Portworx as a combination, really as forming the backbone of our cloud portfolio and we're seeing strength across the board there, really both from customers that are deploying in cloud day one with both Portworx and Cloud Blocks are now available in multiple cloud providers, but as well customers that are starting with Pure-as-a-Service with the unified subscription on-premise, and then later on growing and transitioning into Azure or AWS over time. And so, we see both of those motions and I think that's just validates our strategy as well as thesis that customers continue to value the flexibility and uniformity that we're able to deliver across the prem, hybrid, cloud and multi-cloud environments."

            "name": "Charlie Giancarlo",
            "content": "Hello everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Pure had an outstanding Q2! As a growing, share-taking company, we expect every quarter to be record breaking, but this quarter was extraordinary. Sales, revenue and profitability were well above expectations. Revenue growth this quarter exceeded 23%, and we had the highest Q2 operating profit in our history. I was especially pleased with the growth of both our new and existing products, the balance of performance geographically, and our continuing penetration of cloud and large enterprise. These are all key parts of our long-term strategy that we've shared over the past several years. These results also show that our strategy of investing into the pandemic, and specifically investing in our enterprise sales capability and expanding our product line, was the right one. As we discussed in past calls, we predicted that Pure's growth would accelerate as businesses adjusted to the COVID environment. We believe that our growth will be even stronger as businesses return to an in-office environment. We estimated that this would start this past Q2, and we are obviously very pleased with the results. Looking ahead, we expect that businesses will continue to adjust to the effects of the pandemic while driving digital transformation. We believe that the Delta variant has slowed a return to the office environment only temporarily, and that large-scale global vaccinations will do much to enable a full return to normal by spring of next year. As we indicated last quarter, we believe that the current environment enables us to return to our historical double digit growth rates, with increasing profitability. Our leadership and innovation of the data storage and management market continues to grow. Our strategy is focused on: delivering a unified cloud operating and procurement model, across all data storage use-cases and environments; enabling modern cloud-native applications built on containers; and driving the modernization of today's infrastructure with a focus on the all-flash future that modern applications will demand. Let's take a quick look at the results. This past quarter provided many areas of outstanding performance, highlighted by the highest total sales for any second quarter in the history of the company, growing more than 30% year over year; continued strength and momentum in Subscription Services revenue, up 31% year-over-year with strong growth in Pure as-a-Service, which almost doubled revenues compared to the prior year; and, our success in large enterprise continues to grow, comprising over 50% of our sales, with our top 10 customers spending more than $100 million in total. As I mentioned, both our new and existing products achieved new sales milestones. Frankly, the superlatives from this quarter are too numerous to fully enumerate, but here are a few highlights: Growth of our subscription businesses were very strong this past quarter with sales of both Pure as-a-Service and Portworx approximately tripling year over year. All subscription sales taken together, including Portworx, Pure as-a-Service and Evergreen, increased almost 50% year over year in Q2, and is approaching one-half of Pure's total sales. These results show both the continued attractiveness of our Evergreen model, and the market's excitement for our new subscription offerings.  It has been nearly a year since we announced the acquisition of Portworx. Every quarter as part of Pure, Portworx has beaten their targets. This past quarter, Portworx sales tripled year-over-year and continued to gain many new customers both large and small. Financial services and service providers are particularly interested in the ability to easily scale container-based workflows with Portworx. FlashArray//C continues to deliver tremendous growth, with sales tripling over last year. It remains the fastest growing new product in Pure's history and is enabling customers to transition to an all-flash data center. Cloud customers, in particular are making use of FlashArray//C to improve their reliability, to reduce their environmental footprint, and to lower their operational costs.  For instance, a recent eight-figure win with a top 10 hyper-scaler which will begin to ship this Q3 was won against traditional magnetic disk based on our high performance, small space and power footprint, and superior total cost of ownership. SafeMode is another compelling reason why ever more customers are turning to Pure. This high-performance ransomware protection solution for both FlashArray and FlashBlade takes less than a millisecond to create an immutable copy of data for fast recovery. And customers can send these snapshots to a variety of destinations such as FlashArray//C, FlashBlade, or AWS, Microsoft Azure, and NFS shares. Only 6 months after introduction, over 500 customers have enabled SafeMode.  These examples demonstrate the success of our strategy to provide organizations with the modern data services they need to modernize their data infrastructure, to take advantage of modern applications, and to manage their data and infrastructure through code, in a multi-cloud environment. Our focus on these goals has been rewarded with new and expanding customer relationships.  For example, one of our enterprise customers, a Global Fortune 500 financial services firm, recently chose a Pure as-a-Service subscription to fuel the expansion of their core operating applications in a virtual Hub. While increasing the performance, flexibility and scale of this global platform, they were able to reduce their physical footprint by nearly 80%, contributing significantly to their environmental sustainability goals. They estimate that this will reduce their total cost of ownership by nearly 70% while providing significant performance increases.  And with growing global concerns about ransomware attacks, a UK-based securities firm with sub-millisecond performance requirements found performance, simplicity, and safety in Pure's recovery capabilities. Using FlashArray SafeMode with our FlashBlade FlashRecover solution on an Evergreen Gold subscription, they now have the data protection and unified fast file and object platform they need to scale safely.  Our strategy since our founding is to focus on doing the right things for our customers and on doing things right. Our environmental goals dovetail with our customer-first values. Part of ensuring that our products and services have the lowest total cost of ownership means designing products that use less energy, require less cooling, need less maintenance, take up less space and produce less waste.  With our customers' increasing focus on their own environmental footprint, we will be providing more quantitative measures and sustainability programs going forward. Pure Storage is advantaged by the major trends in our industry: we enable companies around the world to shift to a cloud-operating model for their private and hybrid cloud infrastructure; we lead in driving the all-flash data center; and we have the most advanced services and tools to automate data management for our modern cloud-native applications.  As we entered the year, we stated that our customers would accelerate their investment in digital transformation with renewed confidence in economic recovery this year. This was clearly evident in our performance in the first half and especially this past Q2. In the current environment, we are confident that the momentum of our first half will continue into Q3 as evidenced by our Q3 guide and raised annual outlook. I want to thank our employees and our partners who have worked tirelessly to support our customers with great products and great service, throughout the uncertainty of COVID-19, and who have created our sustainable momentum. Everyone at Pure deserves to feel proud of the advancements we have made through this difficult period.  One last note that I would like to add before I turn the call over to our CFO Kevan Krysler. I am very pleased to announce that Rob Lee, whom many of you know, has just been promoted and will serve as Pure's Chief Technology Officer. Congratulations, Rob. John Colgrove, a.k.a. Coz, who in addition to his title as founder also served as CTO, will now take the title of Chief Visionary Officer. Rob will continue to report to him, and Coz will continue to serve Pure full time. Congratulations, Rob and Coz.  Kevan, over to you. I think the reason why we continue to gain share and why the quarter was so good is that we've been preparing a portfolio of products that are really second to none. And while that was being done during the beginning of the COVID crisis, of course, there's a lot of disruption in our customer base. But as the customers have become accustomed to operating within the COVID environment, that portfolio and our focus on developing a set of enterprise capabilities, both in sales support as well as with our products, it's finally all coming together and hitting stride. And so no, we expect this to be the beginning, if you will, of very evident growth for the company as we go forward. Yes, it's a part of their overall operations. So I think the answer is affirmative from the question that you asked. And, we do feel that this is sustainable both in the sense of continuing with this customer, as well as we think it's the beginning of seeing other similarly situated hyperscale customers starting to look at flash as a real alternative.  As you may know, most of the hyperscalars, the vast majority of what they store, they store on disk. They may have a little bit of flash in their servers, but for the most part, all storage is on disk. And we think this is the beginning of breaking that structure. We finally have the kind of price performance that can really compete within the disk market. Yes, no, again, I think we're doing a great job with our operations team, in partnership with our suppliers. Obviously, the environment, from our perspective hasn't changed much from what we saw last quarter. We just continue to be focused on it. And obviously, you see the results in our print. And so this will be an area that we will continue to focus on through second half. We'll manage that. But again, a testament to our sales team to continue selling the value, especially the software value associated with our solutions. We are very pleased with what we're seeing in terms of the Q3 outlook and the idea that, we're driving almost 30% growth next year, with the opportunity we highlighted on FlashArray//C. So, I think the guide that we've come out with Q3 is actually quite strong. We're very pleased with that. Yes. We do feel that, people working at home, offices not really being open is a bit of a constraint on net new logo growth. Despite that, of course we were pleased with the 10% growth we saw year-over-year, but in past years, of course, we saw more. We believe that as things opened up more, obviously that's been delayed a bit because of the Delta variant, but as things opened up more late this year, early next, we expect that to actually just improve our net new logo gains. But, in the meantime, our continuation to penetrate deeper and deeper into existing accounts, to penetrate deeper and deeper into the enterprise, and I might point out as well that our net new logo gains in enterprise was actually quite a bit strong. So as you might imagine, the commercial logo gains swamp because there were so many more commercial accounts. In terms of net new logos, net new logos tend to be dominated by commercial, but actually our gain of enterprise net new logos this past quarter was actually quite healthy. Yes, we feel like at this point in time, given our product portfolio and given the productivity that we're seeing from the sales force, we're going to be able to deliver both. We're going to be able to deliver both continued double digit growth as well as continued improvements quarter by quarter in our operating profit margins. So, yes, no, we're quite confident in that. Yes. No, we've made that commentary in the past because we feel quite comfortable that we will be exceeding 20% for the foreseeable future. I think we're going to stick to that point right now, which is exceeding 20%. I do think that we have room to grow beyond that again, as COVID wanes. But predicting that right now is probably not a fool's errand for all of us. But we do feel comfortable that in this type of COVID environment that we can continue to grow at over 20%. Yes, very much. So first of all, we've stated in the past that, cloud revenues has been about 30% plus. We haven't really calculated it for this quarter to be talking about. But it's trending generally the same. Of course, cloud is an area that we're very focused on and it's an area that we hope can actually continue to increase for us, especially as more and more customers and workloads go to either SaaS environments, cloud environments and as the consumer cloud continues to scale. And we feel as you're seeing with the FlashArray//C that over time we -- because our belief in the all-flash data center, the last bastion of mostly disk data center right now is actually in the cloud. And so it represents a great opportunity for us. Yes, thank you, Shannon, we continue to be investigating opportunities for M&A. We believe that M&A that really enhances our ability to provide a cloud operating model for our customers is the right way for us to be focused. And there isn't a quarter or even a week that goes by where we're not investigating potential combinations for the company. So M&A continues to be an active area of investigation for us. Yes, it's a great question. Let me start, Kevan, you might have more. I would really separate it into the two items that you mentioned. One is component costs, which we have seen an increase, on average, about probably about 10% this year in increased component costs. But of course, we live in a -- on a longer term deflationary environment on component costs. So, we really view that as a temporary phenomenon having to do with supply chain shortages, and that should come back in the next year or so, to where to the standard long-term price reduction curve that exists in that environment.  On the flip side, absolutely, there's going to be -- and we're already starting to see the signs of an inflationary environment around wages. Our forecast and guides take that into account, but certainly, what you speak of is becoming evident. Yes. Well, thanks for the question Karl, that's been on people's minds. Focusing on operational improvement, productivity enhancement across the board of the company has been something we've been very focused on over the last several years. COVID obviously set us back a bit, because obviously we plan to grow into productivity, and with COVID, we decided to continue to invest in areas that were we felt very important to our long-term growth, in particular, investing in our ability to penetrate large enterprise, which by the way, is part of productivity improvement; and two, was to invest in broad scale portfolio of products, again to help us to be able to penetrate and achieve much greater wallet share in our customer base. It was only a few years ago where we could only address maybe 10% of their storage needs, and today it's much wider than that.  So, as we look forward over the next several quarters with the anticipation for the top-line change that we've already discussed, we know quite strongly what our productivity gains are going to be in the different parts of our organization. And these are productivity gains that we're going to be able to continue to maintain inside the company. Again, last year was the anomaly, as it was for many companies, but in different ways. For us, it meant that our continued investment that we wouldn't see the productivity or the sales return on that until the economy started to improve. And now we're starting to see that. Yes. So first of all, the individual opportunity itself is a very large opportunity. It's not a one-off, it's something that will continue as we go forward, as we understand it. It is a -- you can think of it as a general purpose implementation for one of their key application environments inside the organization. So, I really can't go much, much further than that. But it's not something that is unusual or extraordinary in a hyperscale environment. So, it is something that's easily transferable to other hyperscalers. It's not the -- by the way, it's not the first of the top 10 hyperscalers that we've sold FlashArray//C into. It's just one that is significant for a single quarter and we do believe that this is something that we can continue to expand to other hyperscalers as well. It's a great question, Kathy. Obviously, we want to sustain the strength and momentum of our sales capability. So, a high degree of focus on sales teams, both U.S. and internationally, and then continuing to develop -- further develop our infrastructure to being able to support sales. So, I would say largely, the areas of IT, other areas that supports sales growth, but the large -- the largest focus is going to be on sustaining sales momentum. Yes, absolutely. Well as we've said, in the past Cloud Block Store, fundamental part of our overall Pure as-a-Service subscription. And no doubt, it was very critical in driving part of that growth of the Pure as-a-Service, as many customers already determine which of the hyperscalers they want to use. And it's been instrumental in several of our Pure as-a-Service deals, some with some very large, certainly Fortune 50 companies that had set their sights on Azure. So, from that standpoint, very strong. And then, with respect to actual deployment on Cloud Blocks, actually I'm going to let Rob take that because he's the one that's been most tied into it. I will say, just to finalize our thoughts on Cloud Block Store that, it is a fundamental part of the unified subscription. We rarely see -- although we do see some customers that will just go to Cloud Block Store without having arrays on-prem. But far more customers are using it as a way for them to be able to transition from on-prem into the cloud. And therefore the -- it starts off as a unified subscription. And then they start to migrate whether it's for disaster recovery or other capabilities, they have test into their cloud environment using Cloud Block Store. So it tends to be, first of all, an attractive element to the unified subscription. But secondly, taken advantage of subsequent to the engagement on the Pure as-a-Service. Yes. It's actually all of the above. First of all, having a broader portfolio gets you more respect within an enterprise customer, whether that's a new customer or an existing customer. We had enterprise customers four years ago when I first joined and their first response to me is, \u201cPure you're great, but we can only use you for this specialized environment. Why can't you build products that cover the rest of our storage footprint?\u201d And so having a broad portfolio is necessary to be a good partner to an enterprise customer. It also allows you to compete for larger deals inside those customers. And then for a number of customers, this was certainly true with a lot of banking customers. Until we can reach a certain scale and address a certain percentage of their footprint, they actually didn't even want to talk to us, because they want to have, what are very significant relationships.  So really -- so then going back to the beginning of your question, it's been because of the investment that we've made into enterprise capabilities, both sales, as well as support. It's been investment in the breadth -- the broadening of the product line, and it's been about maturing our own organization in terms of how to work with enterprise customers. So, all of those have contributed to our ability to -- and our success that we've seen in expanding our enterprise business. No, I think our visibility into their build-outs has been excellent. It really has. So they share a very -- they share openly with us. Obviously, planning of build outs take some time, so they do want to share openly. I would say that the returns -- we've been -- remember, there's only about a couple of months when there was people returning to the office and then it got slowed down right away. So most of the improvement we're seeing is from the improvement of working in a COVID environment, not because things freed up tremendously over the summer. So our guide just -- as I mentioned before, just reflects the way the world is as we see it today, not based on any further opening up. We do think that when the world does open up, we'll see even better performance to be clear.  I would say that, if anything, on a very small basis what we did see was some projects move out, not because of COVID, it was all because of customers' ability to get other products for their build-out with servers, networking, sheet metals, power supplies, whatever it might be, we definitely saw expected timelines push out a bit on -- in some customer environments. So -- but all that I think bodes well for us in the future as things improve. It did hold up, but it didn't improve any more than it did last time. So that's what we're waiting for. As COVID improves, we think commercial will pick up even more. But it did hold up certainly through this last quarter and we expect it to hold up through this quarter. Thank you, operator. Well, Q2 has really been a fantastic quarter for Pure as our strategy and our execution have become evident this quarter. Pure is being chosen because we deliver a leading and highly differentiated technology with also best-in-class customer experience. It's a very exciting time at Pure and we're in a great innovation cycle with our portfolio and our sales momentum and our execution has never been stronger.

            "name": "Kevan Krysler",
            "content": "Thank you Charlie and good afternoon. We could not be more pleased with the strength of our business, our execution and Q2 financial results. We saw strong sales execution across the globe which is reflected in our sales growth of 32%, excluding cancelable orders. Similar to what we saw last quarter our entire portfolio, including our subscription services, contributed to our performance. Our core business of FlashArray//X gained significant strength across our Enterprise, Commercial and Public Sector customers, FlashArray//C sales more than tripled year over year, and FlashBlade sales established a new record high for Q2. Our revenue growth was 23% this quarter, and product revenue had its highest year-over-year growth rate compared to the previous seven quarters. Remaining performance obligations, or RPO, which includes our committed and non-cancelable future revenue was $1.2 billion, growing 25%. RPO growth reflects the continued strength of our Subscription Services, including record sales this quarter of our unified subscription, Pure as-a-Service. We acquired 380 new customers representing 10% year-over-year growth, and we saw particular strength with new enterprise customers this quarter.  Now turning to specific financial results for the quarter. Total revenue grew 23% to approximately $497 million. Revenue in the United States grew 25% and International revenue grew 18% compared to last year. Subscription Services revenue grew approximately 31% year over year, and represents approximately 35% of total revenue. Product revenue was very strong during the quarter growing 19%. The differentiated value of our software and solutions continue to be reflected in our non-GAAP total gross margins of 70.5% this quarter. Non-GAAP product gross margins continue to be on the high end of our long term expectations at 70.3%. We expect that product margins will fluctuate depending on product mix as our newer offerings continue to scale.  Non-GAAP subscription services margins were 70.7%. Revenue and gross margin outperformance and improving sales efficiency contributed to delivering strong non-GAAP operating profits of $46.6 million. Continued reduced travel due to the on-going COVID environment and slower-than-planned hiring also contributed to lower operating expenses during the quarter. We ended the quarter with over $1.29 billion in cash and approximately 3,900 employees. Cash flow from operations achieved a record high this quarter of $123 million, resulting from improved linearity and strong collections as well as increasing operating leverage. Capital expenditures were $28 million during the quarter. We returned approximately $44 million of capital to repurchase slightly over 2.3 million shares as part of our $200 million share repurchase program.  Now turning to guidance. We are very pleased with our sustained momentum and improving operational efficiencies. We expect Q3 revenue to be approximately $530 million, growing almost 30%. Our revenue guide for Q3 includes revenue we expect to recognize in connection with the sale of FlashArray//C to one of the top 10 hyper-scalers. We also expect non-GAAP operating profit will be approximately $40 million.  I have mentioned in previous quarters that we would not be updating our annual view. However, given the strong performance of our business over the last several quarters, including our strong financial outlook for Q3, we have also updated our annual view. We now expect that revenue for the year will surpass $2 billion, growing approximately 21% to $2.04 billion. We also expect that operating income will be approximately $150 million.  This is an exciting time at Pure. Our strategy, innovation and service is compelling for our customers and we are executing with a focus on accelerating revenue growth and increasing profitability. Thank you to all of our employees and partners. I am also really looking forward to having you join us at our virtual Analyst Day on September 28.  With that, I will turn it over to the operator so we can get to your questions. Well, hey, Pinjalim. One is, I think the -- your math is right. So absolutely, we held on gross margins. And I really think that's a testament to a couple of things. I think our operations team continues to do an outstanding job. Our suppliers are continuing to work very closely with us. And yes, to answer your question, specifically, discounting did hold and I really attribute a lot of that to our sales team, and the discipline and execution in terms of why we saw the gross margin performance that we saw. Hey, Aaron, this is Kevan. And this is just a clarification. I think the 50% reference is really towards sales and bookings and then obviously the revenue and there's a lag with the revenue. So, two different metrics here that we're referring to. That's correct. Wamsi, I'm not sure I would follow your math in terms of 30% being entirely explained by the easier compare last year, it does represent a significant growth rate not just over last year, but frankly over the -- if we take -- and as a company we are looking at not just at year-over-year growth rate but year over two year growth rate because of obviously the anomalous compares with last year, and it's a substantial gain even over a two year compare rate. So, we think it's a suitably appropriate guide for this coming quarter, given the entire environment. And it is of course a raise, both from our annual look forward as well as to what was consensus. So, we do feel that it's an appropriate raise. Yes, absolutely. And again, what I really was pleased with, with the quarter was not only the top-line growth that we're driving, but the operating leverage that's coming with it. And really that's coming really from the sales organization. We are seeing really strong productivity and sales efficiency and discipline, and we're seeing that come through primarily on the operating leverage that we saw for Q2 and frankly the increased outlook for the remainder of the year. And so, when I think about the increasing operating leverage, I would look at first what we're doing in terms of outperforming on sales, as well as the gross margin performance, execution of the sales team. And then, yes, we've got a little bit of tailwind from the COVID environment. As I look at Q2, I would kind of view that between 1 to 2 points of the 9 points that we saw this quarter. So not a significant tailwind, but there is a bit of a tailwind that we saw for Q2. And, yes, we're managing that quite well.  Obviously on the sales side, even though we're got some more hiring to do on the sales side. They are just doing such a great job in terms of productivity. Participation rates are tremendous. We're seeing a great growth in participation rates, both on individual contributors, as well as the first line managers. So, like what we see there. And Simon, we'll provide some more color on that as well on our virtual Analyst Day. So we look forward in terms of our longer term growth rate. So look forward to having those conversations as well. And I just -- I do want to comment on the strong operating cash flows, which I think were tremendous for the company. And again, I think there were kind of three areas that I would attribute that to this quarter. One was really that the great linearity that the sales team drove this quarter, which really improves collection efforts. And we saw that come through with the record operating cash flows that we saw this quarter. And the other thing, obviously, is the continued focus as a company we have on operating leverage, and we're seeing some good benefits from that as well. And one of the things I would just make sure to highlight too, back to the component cost is, look our approach to sourcing raw NAND really continues to be an advantage for us, really, when we look at some of other folks who are leveraging sourced SSDs and leveraging our software capabilities to enable NAND management is really beneficial for us in this time as well. So I think that's an important comment. Yes, let me just add onto that a little bit, if you don't mind. Look, I think we've made -- none of this is surprise for us in terms of the increasing operating leverage. We're driving for this -- all due to the points that Charlie is making. And you actually see the great strides at go-to-markets making in terms of their costs and expenses as a percentage of revenue. I think that's going to continue. I think we'll see over time, we'll get some benefits on R&D as well. And obviously on our gross margins, continue to be strong. We've seen that on the product gross margin side, and also believe we can get more scale and improvement on subscription gross margins over time, as our unified subscription Pure as-a-Service scales. So, I absolutely believe there is upward trajectory to our operating leverage. And just to be clear too, in terms of the strength we're seeing in our Q3 guide. Look, when we exclude this great opportunity that we're seeing with FlashArray//C in a top 10 hyperscaler, we're still in our comfortable 20%, plus 20% year-over-year growth rate, excluding that opportunity. So I think that's important to note as well in terms of the strength, is across the business and is across the portfolio. We're really excited about the FlashArray//C opportunity, but it's really incremental to the strength we're seeing. I don't want to go over -- I don't want to overestimate what it might be. But our thinking is it's going to be a few percentage points. Yes. We're not going to get into a whole lot of detail on that. Now, obviously on virtual financial Analyst Day, we'll provide some color that hopefully you'll find helpful in terms of our subscription momentum. And look, nothing's changed significantly. We've got great momentum on our unified subscription with Pure as-a-Service that we've highlighted. Portworx, still very important from us from a strategic perspective, but the performance is excellent. And obviously, our Evergreen is our bread and butter, it's our baseline, largest piece, continues to be so for the -- in terms of what we're looking at for this year. So we'll get to more details on that as we look out to the Analyst Day. But that would be all for now. Well, I think it's important that we've been talking about the large hyperscaler, with the top 10 hyperscaler on the FlashArray//C that's putting some more strength on our Q3 guide. But look, sequentially, it's -- even sequentially Q3 to Q4, I'm pleased with what we're seeing year-over-year close to 20% for the annual outlook exceeding 20%. So overall, quite pleased with it. Don't really view it as a decel, especially when I think about our larger opportunity that we're digesting or expect to digest in Q3 with the FlashArray//C opportunity. That's a great question. Look, when we were looking at the annual guide at the beginning, no, it's fair to say that we wouldn't have contemplated. So it's part of our beat, both from an annual perspective and how we're looking at it for Q3. And we're not expecting a significant amount to come through in Q4. We'd expect the larger piece in Q3. We didn't have an impact for Q2, Nehal. So PaaS bookings almost tripled, almost tripled year-over-year. Yes. That's correct. Just to add onto that, I think one of the areas that we haven't talked too much about today, in the portfolio is FlashBlade. And I think that's a great example of where we've invested in broadening the portfolio, broadening our enterprise capabilities and feature sets. And that's reflective in the strength we saw, FlashBlade did extremely well in terms of large deals. And just getting back to Charlie's point, having the breadth of enterprise capabilities in the portfolio, whether it's FlashArray//C, which we talked quite a bit about, FlashArray//X or FlashBlade. Having all of that together really just helps us go and prosecute these opportunities. Yes. I think the commercial business did really well. I mean, obviously coming off such a fantastic quarter last quarter and then holding on to that strength, I think is pretty impressive. So we were impressed with both enterprise and commercial."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. At the conclusion of our prepared remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference call, Mr. Sanjot Khurana. Please go ahead.\nSanjot Khurana: Thank you, and good afternoon. Welcome to the Pure Storage first quarter fiscal 2022 earnings conference call. My name is Sanjot Khurana, Vice President of Investor Relations at Pure Storage. Joining me today are our CEO, Charlie Giancarlo; our CFO, Kevan Krysler; and our Vice President & Chief Architect, Rob Lee. Before we begin, I would like to remind you all that during this call, management will make some forward-looking statements, which are subject to various risks and uncertainties. These include statements regarding: the COVID-19 pandemic and related disruptions, our growth and sales prospects, competitive, industry and technology trends, our strategy and its advantages, our current and future product offerings, and our business and operations.

This call is being broadcast live on the Pure Storage Investor Relations website and is being recorded for playback purposes. An archive of the webcast will be available on the IR website and is the property of Pure Storage. With that, I'll turn the call over to our CEO, Charlie Giancarlo.\nCharlie Giancarlo: Hello everyone and thank you for joining us today. I hope you and your loved ones are healthy and looking forward to better days ahead as summer begins, vaccination rates increase, and the beginning of the end of COVID restrictions in many parts of the world comes into view. Our hearts go out to our friends in India and other countries still suffering from this scourge and we pray that they will soon recover. Pure delivered very strong results in Q1. We drove double-digit growth against a strong comparison with Q1 of last year. I\u2019m also happy to report that our strong quarter was broad based with balanced contributions across every aspect of our business. We continue to see enterprise expansion, validating our investment in world-class enterprise products, services and our go-to-market teams over the past two years. In this quarter, we also saw our commercial segment strengthen its contribution, particularly in customer acquisition, where we increased net new customer\u2019s year-over-year. Our U.S. and our International teams both achieved double-digit year-over-year growth this quarter and our new products again saw significant annual growth. Our industry leading subscription business saw fantastic growth, up 35% over the same quarter last year. Pure\u2019s unique Evergreen and as-a-service models continue to resonate strongly with customers and differentiate us from the rest of the industry. Competitors are attempting to recreate our capabilities through financing, marketing and professional services, but cannot change their legacy systems to match our non-disruptive upgrades, API management, or remote operations and support. Pure has doubled the number of partners selling Pure-as-a-Service year-over-year and our channel partner bookings are growing nicely. And we recently announced new incentives and offerings to enhance subscription sales through our channel partners to build on this momentum. Our operating profit exceeded expectations this quarter, reflecting our revenue overperformance paired with prudent expense management. The strong growth this quarter was achieved during continued COVID restrictions and is based mostly on improvements in our operations and our customers\u2019 increasing confidence in our brand. We have been reasonably accurate in our predictions of our business environment since the pandemic started. I feel confident that as vaccination rates increase globally, and our markets return to some semblance of normal office culture, that our business momentum will increase even further. This month, we kicked off our Annual Accelerate Digital event, and so far, we have connected with more than 17,000 attendees, a new record for attendance, 60% higher than last year. The significant annual increase in customer, prospect and partner participation at our Accelerate conference is an indicator of how strongly our Modern Data Experience strategy is resonating in the market. We re-iterated our vision of Pure\u2019s Modern Data Experience and showed how leading organizations like Aegis Sciences, NASA, and Roblox are using Pure\u2019s data platform to modernize their infrastructure, modernize their operations and modernize their business applications. We announced updates to the Pure1 Digital Experience, our cloud-based management platform for all of Pure\u2019s products and services, and we released the latest version of Portworx Enterprise. We also provided greater details on our Bare Metal as a Service solution with Equinix and newest Purity software enhancements. All of these new capabilities and more will continue to be featured in workshops throughout the entire, month-long Accelerate event. Customers have shown excitement for our promise of leading edge, automated infrastructure that is continually improving without disruption. Pure\u2019s Modern Data Experience delivers modern infrastructure that enables modern operations supporting the needs of modern business applications. We believe that these three steps are fundamental in every company\u2019s digital transformation journey and are made possible by Pure\u2019s Modern Data Experience. The first component of our Modern Data Experience is enabling our customers to modernize their infrastructure. A modern data infrastructure provides easy-to-deploy, reliable services, manageable by IT and developers alike, through APIs and code. We provide common services, interfaces and management across on-prem and cloud. And with Pure as a Service, we provide customers a single unified contract across clouds. Customers can operate both existing business critical applications and next generation cloud-native applications in a hybrid cloud environment. Our founding vision of the All-Flash data center is being further realized with Pure\u2019s FlashArray//C, the first all-QLC FlashArray that pushes flash to a new tier of workloads, where our competitors are stuck competing with disk. FlashArray//C saw double-digit growth this quarter and continues to be our fastest growing new product ever. Just last week, Pure\u2019s FlashArray family was recognized as a Gartner Peer Insights Customers' Choice. You don\u2019t need to be in technology to know that data insecurity is not only a nuisance, but a matter of national security. In the last few years, we brought industry-leading data protection to our entire portfolio, allowing enterprises to protect their data from Ransomware with the ability to restore from protected copies within hours of a breach. Customers like Be The Match, which is operated by the National Bone Marrow Donor Program, have chosen Pure FlashArray//X and FlashBlade platforms, with SafeMode Data Protection and rapid restore capabilities, to protect their mission critical data in the event of a breach. Meadville Medical Center in Pennsylvania is another customer who subscribes to Pure as-a-Service with SafeMode, so that if they ever need a SafeMode Snapshot to recover their data, they know that they can be back online within hours. We launched a new SafeMode Dashboard in Pure1 this quarter, which provides a consolidated view of the Ransomware protection of all Pure arrays in a customer\u2019s fleet, delivering peace-of-mind that an organization\u2019s data franchise is protected by this extra layer of Ransomware protection. Pure\u2019s unique Evergreen capability is the cornerstone of a modern infrastructure, with the ability to continually update technology and services, without disruption to a customer\u2019s environment. In fact, 98% of our arrays that were deployed over 5 years ago are not only still in use, but have been modernized in many cases to our most recent models. Our systems, like most cloud services, are upgraded to the most modern technology, consistently, non-disruptively and transparently to the application. Our Purity software, Evergreen model, and Pure1 management system uniquely position Pure to deliver a true as-a-Service, modern infrastructure experience to our customers. The second component of our Modern Data Experience is modernizing operations. After all, the value of modern infrastructure is deeply diminished if you operate it with yesterday\u2019s manual processes. Modern Ops means standardizing service offerings and making them available to the organization via a service catalog and APIs. Doing that delivers DevOps, data science teams, and application developers the storage-as-code experience they have come to expect. Pure as-a-Service is a key element of our strategy for Modern Ops. Pure as-a-Service continues to be the industry\u2019s storage-as-a-service benchmark and we\u2019re very pleased with its growth this quarter. Launched in 2018, it unifies block, file, and object storage across all tiers of performance, and private and public clouds into a unified data-storage subscription and is the foundation of a true hybrid-cloud experience. Customers such as the City of Denver use Pure as-a-Service to automate data management. They use Pure to monitor and deliver performance, upgrades, and even variable capacity for seasonal events like elections. With the flexibility of Pure\u2019s Cloud Block Store for both AWS and Azure as an option in their Pure as-a-Service subscription, we are seeing strong interest from companies who want to simplify their data architecture with a proven solution while reaping the benefits of both private and hyper-scaler clouds. Pure as-a-Service is differentiated not only by the inherent agility of the Evergreen architecture, but also by the as-a-Service user experience we deliver via Pure1, our META AI engine, and our proactive support experience. Pure1 has now broadened its predictive fault analysis and resolution using telemetry gathered from across Pure's ecosystem, including bare metal, VMs, and containers. Our expanded AI-driven workload planner can now suggest the right service tier for Pure as-a-Service subscriptions or infrastructure purchases. The Pure1 service catalog was expanded this quarter, so customers can easily add, upgrade, suspend, resume, limit, and renew Pure as-a-Service capabilities as needed. These SaaS tools work together to give customers the insight and intelligence they need to confidently make storage subscription decisions. The investments we\u2019ve made to modernize infrastructure and operations supports our customers\u2019 desire to develop truly modern applications, which is the third pillar of the Modern Data Experience. Modernizing applications leverages cloud-native architectures, specifically containers and Kubernetes, to take advantage of more efficient computing, new programming models, hybrid-cloud architectures and new capabilities like real-time analytics and data streaming. The latest version of Portworx Enterprise, announced at //Accelerate, gives customers an automated, Kubernetes-native storage experience for container-based applications wherever they live. Portworx Enterprise now delivers deeper integration across the Pure family, fully enabling both FlashArray and FlashBlade for enterprise scale and resiliency in production environments. It utilizes Pure1 for enhanced observability and proactive support, and complete provisioning automation on all Pure systems. Customers are using Portworx to enable containerized workloads to run seamlessly across the cloud, including Pure Storage arrays, bare metal infrastructure, and even third-party storage solutions. Just three quarters since acquisition, we have fully combined Portworx and Pure products into the integrated, simple and Evergreen platform that Pure is known for. As the number and range of modern applications increases, and the volume of unstructured data increases, organizations are reducing the complexity of their data architecture with fast object storage, where Pure\u2019s FlashBlade remains the market leader. At nearly $1 billion in cumulative sales, it is the preferred choice for customers needing a unified fast file and object platform for their modern business applications. In fact, FlashBlade is the leader in GigaOm\u2019s new Radar for High-Performance Object Storage, validating Pure as the pioneer in the fast object space. Overall, our product and market leadership is expanding. We continue to deliver the industry\u2019s most advanced platforms, greatest reliability and total cost of ownership, with the most innovative service models. All together, we are well on our way to delivering a complete Modern Data Experience to customers worldwide. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to our CFO, Kevan Krysler for a deeper look at the numbers.\nKevan Krysler: Thank you, Charlie, and good afternoon. We are very pleased with the broad-based strength of our Q1 results and continued momentum. We delivered double-digit revenue growth despite both a tough compare, as well as continued uncertainty of COVID-19 and its influence on markets across the globe. Our sales growth, excluding cancelable orders, also reflected strength growing 13%, compared to last year. Our remaining performance obligations, or RPO, which includes our committed and non-cancelable future revenue is slightly over $1.1 billion, growing sequentially 24% year-over-year. In particular, what was most impressive about our performance this quarter was the strength across our entire business. Double digit sales growth from our key geos; strong contribution from our channel partners; performance across our entire product and solution portfolio, including FlashArray//C; and growth from both our existing and new customers, including our commercial business. We were very pleased with the strength we saw in new customer acquisition, which grew 15% year-over-year also driven in part by our commercial business. Now turning to specific financial results for the quarter. Total revenue grew 12% to approximately 413 million. International revenue grew 14%, while revenue in the United States grew 12%, compared to last year. Again, consistent with what we saw throughout last year, sales of our subscription services continue to reflect momentum. Subscription services revenue grew approximately 35% year-over-year and represents approximately 39% of total revenue. Non-GAAP total gross margins continue to reflect the differentiated value of our software and solutions, improving sequentially to 70.5% in the quarter and continues to be on the high-end of our long-term expectations. Non-GAAP product gross margins were 70.2% and non-GAAP subscription services margins were 71.1%. Subscription services margins improved both sequentially and year-over-year. Product gross margins improved slightly sequentially and were 73.3% in Q1 of last year. Product gross margins this quarter reflect both accelerated growth of our FlashArray//C and increasing supply chain costs required to secure product for our customers. We achieved slightly positive non-GAAP operating profit during the quarter, which outperformed our expectation. Contributing factors include revenue outperformance, lower expenses due to the COVID environment, including less travel and physical marketing events, as well as slower-than-planned hiring. We ended the quarter with over $1.23 billion in cash and approximately 3,800 employees. Cash flow from operations was 21 million and capital expenditures were 28 million during the quarter. Capital expenditures during the quarter included a higher mix invested in our Pure-as-a-Service infrastructure. We returned approximately 30 million of capital to repurchase slightly over 1.38 million shares as part of our 200 million share repurchase program. Now, turning to guidance. As previously mentioned, we are very pleased with our steadily increasing momentum over the last two quarters, while continuing to navigate the various challenges created by COVID-19. We expect the challenges created by COVID-19 will continue to recede as we progress throughout the year, and that our momentum will continue.  Q2 revenue is expected to be approximately 470 million, representing double-digit growth of 16%. We also expect non-GAAP operating profit will be approximately 15 million. As I mentioned last quarter, we will be guiding one quarter at a time and will not be updating our annual view, but we will provide some additional color on how we are thinking about the impact of our Q1 over-achievement for both revenue and operating income. We expect that revenue over-achievement will be accretive to our annual view. Primarily due to increasing supply chain related costs that we anticipate, we expect that approximately half of our operating income over-achievement during the quarter will be accretive to our annual view. We are excited to build upon our broad-based momentum in Q1 by continuing to create best-in-class outcomes, services and experiences for our partners and customers. With that, I will turn it over to the operator so we can get to your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Karl Ackerman with Cowen.\nKarl Ackerman: Yes, thank you. Good afternoon. Two questions if I may? With regard to your current outlook, Kevan, I was hoping maybe you can tell us regarding [Exabyte growth], I guess what could you tell us regarding [exabyte growth per box] from your hardware business? I ask because in the context of a NAND market that is seeing big growth increase at a roughly 30% clip, you know, the all FlashArray revenue is flattish on a year-over-year basis, but, you know, component pricing seems to have bottomed. And I'm wondering whether maybe some of the deflationary pressures from on-prem enterprise spend still recovering abates, going into the second half of the year. And then if you could speak to anything regarding the capacity points per array, as we think about that growth in Exabyte\u2019s in the second half of the year, as well?\nCharlie Giancarlo: Yeah, Karl, this is Charlie, let me start on that wall. Kevan, I think pulls together some of the stats on that. You know, overall, I would say, you know, that our overall \u2013 there's been overall growth in our FlashArray product line counting both FlashArray//X and FlashArray//C, you know, and we were really pleased to see that, you know, that growth for that product line continue. And I have to say that, that I remain very bullish that we'll continue to see growth in that product line, in addition, of course, to FlashBlade and Portworx, all of which are seeing, you know, strong growth overall. So, and then if you count in along with that, the growth that we're seeing in subscriptions and pass in particular, you know, which does not show up immediately on the top line because of the accounting for subscription basis. Yeah, we are seeing good growth overall. And I\u2019ll just comment for a moment on the supply chain side on the NAND. First is, you're correct, we probably will not see, although we entered the year that is the calendar year with some deflationary pressure initially, through the remainder of the year, you're exactly correct. It's unlikely to see any downward pricing in NAND and actually likely to see some upward pricing on the raw NAND as we go forward. You know, and that'll be overall industry affecting. And of course, because most of our sales are very competitive in nature, we also saw a slight increase in ASPs and I would expect ASPs to hold, you know, reasonably steady plus or minus through the year overall. So, I think you're correct. We're not going to see a lot of deflationary pressure this year.\nKevan Krysler: Yeah, and I agree Charlie, and I think one other thing I would add is the inflationary pressure is just broader than NAND as well. So, we're seeing it across the supply chain, but again, that's been you know, considered in terms of how we're thinking about our Q2 guide, and that's why in the prepared remarks, I commented that about half of our overachievement for operating profit would be incremental, viewed as incremental to our annual guide. \nCharlie Giancarlo: And then finally, on the, you know, Exabyte, you know, we will definitely ship more Exabyte\u2019s this year than we did last year for sure. You know, in terms of average, I think we're cautiously optimistic that the average will go up. But you know, spending tends to, you know, and I'm expecting that overall spending for data storage this year will also increase for the market as a whole. So, I hope that provides you some indication.\nKarl Ackerman: That does, and I appreciate that, gentlemen. For my follow up, you know, in your prepared remarks, you spoke about how Pure Cloud Block Store is now GA at AWS and Azure, and so I'm curious, whether you'll be breaking out this business like you're \u2013 one of our primary peers, and, you know, maybe jumping the gun a little bit, but any thoughts on when this may reach $100 million annual run rate? Thank you.\nKevan Krysler: Yeah, Karl, let me just hit the first point on Cloud Block Store and how that combines really nicely with our unified subscription of here's a service. And that's really why I think we're seeing a lot of continued demand and momentum with Pure as-a-Service. And we're quite excited about cloud block store on Azure and Rob, do you have some comments on that? It'd be great to share some thoughts on Cloud Block Store with Azure?\nRob Lee: Yeah, absolutely. You know, we're super excited, just to see the continued growth in the overall cloud portfolio, Cloud Block Store key component for, you know, the modern app, sorry the traditional applications, and now expanding from AWS to Azure, we see that as adding just a ton of value to the unified subscription. You know, as an example, with a large FSI customer this quarter, you know, who was undergoing a tremendous growth in their business, struggling to keep up on their legacy gear brought Pure in under the unified subscription, and was able to get immediate performance capacity and elasticity benefits on prem, as well as utilize Cloud Block Store on Azure to move their Disaster Recovery Environment over to the cloud. And so, I think that flexibility, and last, we were able to deliver just goes to speak to the benefits of the software subscription, the software approach and just the overall unified subscription through which we deliver the cloud products.\nKarl Ackerman: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Sidney Ho of Deutsche Bank.\nSidney Ho: Thanks for taking my questions. My first question is on the gross margin. Clearly, you guys are doing very well there over 70% to continue to be higher than the high-end of the target range. Should we expect gross margins to stay at these higher levels considering subscription services revenue will likely grow faster than product revenue? I think you guys talk about some inflationary pressure there or really does it depends on what type of services is driving the growth? Are there other considerations to think about?\nKevan Krysler: No, I think that's a great question. I think the pressure, the inflationary pressure we're seeing really more lends itself to product gross margins. But again, we're very pleased with what we saw coming out of the quarter, really, with strong gross margins, throughout both on the product and subscription side, and to your point, above, kind of a high-end of our expectations. And as we progress through the year, on the product, gross margin side, you know, we would expect to see some pressure on product gross margins due to what we're seeing on the supply chain. But again, we've accounted for that in terms of our Q2 guide in my prepared remarks around the annual view.\nSidney Ho: Got it. Maybe a follow-up question is on the enterprise side of things, you guys have been highlighting the strength in your enterprise business last quarter this quarter. But the data points in general in the market hasn't been, it's \u2013 I would say is kind of mixed \u2013 some semiconductor companies would say it's still kind of weak, maybe just starting to get better. Can you talk about why you are seeing things differently? And if the overall market does start to improve in the second half, do you think your enterprise business will also accelerate along with the market just of a higher starting point?\nCharlie Giancarlo: The answer to both is yes. The reason why we're seeing such good overall expansion of our enterprise business is because of the investments we made as a company. Remember, just two or three years ago, we were largely a commercial company with some deployments in enterprise. We made major investments both in products as well as our go to market team to really become a brand that would be respected by a broader set, and really by the enterprise customer environment at large. And I think we've achieved that from a brand perspective. But we're still early, in many ways in our expansion into enterprise. So, I expect that expansion, which is not, you know, secular specific to the investments that we made to continue. So, really, for us, it's about penetration into what was for us a new market. And I think you're comparing us perhaps to companies that had a mature market in enterprise, and therefore are not, you know, probably are still waiting to see the secular growth in the enterprise segment. Secular growth in enterprise can only help us as we continue to expand in that space.\nSidney Ho: Okay, great. Thank you.\nCharlie Giancarlo: Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Jason Ader of William Blair.\nJason Ader: Yeah, thank you. Hey, Charlie, we've definitely heard in the last, let's say, 12 months to 18 months, there's been an inflection point in demand for microservices and Kubernetes technology, and I was just wondering, obviously you guys saw that, and that's why you bought Portworx, but how is this manifesting? I guess, in terms of activity pipeline, demand for Portworx? And then maybe, can you give us a sense of when do you think it's going to start to be more material for your business?\nCharlie Giancarlo: Yeah, well, as you know, it is a subscription based business and therefore, you know, it's a ratable \u2013 it takes a while for ratable products to make a big difference, you know, to the top line, but I have to say that, you know, both revenue growth is, you know, we're talking, you know, in and around, you know, doubling of revenue growth, and we've seen a much even larger expansion of pipeline. So, I'm been going out a little bit on the [limb] here, but it's, it's going very well. And the strategy of aligning, and having, you know, single management and single, you know, layer that is the Kubernetes layer, for customers to be able to manage both their traditional applications, as well as their modern applications, so-called cloud native applications, you're under one umbrella supported by everything from you know, a startup environment for or, you know, a new development environment, you know, with a small amount of storage under the original Portworx SDS layer. And then expanding into a full, you know, multi-petabyte production environment, you know, using a highly reliable arrays, either FlashArray or FlashBlade. And to have that all done non-disruptively, you know, it's a very powerful promise that we're able to deliver to our customers. So, you know, so far, so good, we're seeing a lot of interest, we're seeing, as I say, you know very fast expanding demand. But as we mentioned, in our last call or two, you know, it's probably going to be a year or two before it really becomes truly, you know, noticeable on a top line that's growing, even outside of Portworx.\nKevan Krysler: Yeah, and Charlie, maybe just add on to that, you know, we're quite pleased with the integration that's going on there, right. We've got a new version of Portworx Enterprise that we're quite excited about. And, you know, the synergy that we're now seeing with our existing peer customers is pretty strong as well. And I don't know if you are Rob wanted to give a little color on that.\nCharlie Giancarlo: I'll talk a little bit about it. You know, just eight months, roughly after the close of the transaction, we've integrated all of our products now with, you know, with more to come. The customers, what we've seen in customers, and we've indicated this, but it bears repeating. You know, about half the customers are Pure customers that is the buyers are people that we've been talking to for years. And the other half of the buyers are new buyers for us, sometimes in the same account, sometimes new accounts, but on the development side. And it's a one, two punch of us being able to leverage what we already do and learn about a new area that makes you know, makes the acquisition a really compelling one, I think.\nRob Lee: I\u2019ll just jump in there. Part of what makes that one, two punch particularly powerful is, and this is a fast growing space. This is a significant and secular transition and how applications are built. Frankly, this is how most modern applications are being built today. And so we've really taken the strategy of investing in a full suite of data management capabilities, to be able to help a customer deploy, build, deploy and get to production in multiple environments, whether that's on-prem, in the cloud, hybrid cloud or multi-cloud and you know, across the whole spectrum of development lifecycle, whether they\u2019re just getting started, you know, getting the staging or going to global production scale. So, early days, but really exciting. \nJason Ader: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Rod Hall of Goldman Sachs.\nRod Hall: Yeah, thanks for the question, guys. I guess I wanted to come back to the question of cost, not so much NAND, because I think that's fairly \u2013 seems like it's relatively predictable, but I'm wondering, Charlie, what are you guys seeing in other cost lines, like freight and things like that we hear a lot of people talking about various different upward pressure on, you know, cost into their businesses. And then, as a kind of add on to that, what do you think your pricing power is? If you were to continue to see upward pressure on, you know, on cost across the board? Thanks.\nCharlie Giancarlo: Yeah. Great question. Look, we're seeing, you know, there is pricing pressure on the supply side, you know, across the board, I'd say it's more acute on some of the component area, you know, NAND is seeing some, but it's true on all of the different components. You know, freight, you know, a bit, I can't say that that's been a tremendous driver for us, but I'm going to take your guidance, and I'll look at it, but it's, you know, the costs are going up.  At the same time, as you probably know, Rod, a lot of our, most of our sales are competitive in nature. And so, our pricing is determined much more by the competitive environment in a particular deal than it is by our costs. And so, you know, there will be some balancing with ASPs, I'm sure. Exactly how much that is, we can't be, you know, 100% confident, but as Kevan mentioned, we've incorporated our best guess into the guide. So, we feel fairly good about it. It may have, there may be some effect on our margins. I don't expect it to be severe. You know, because again, we operate 100% of the time in a generally a competitive environment.\nKevan Krysler: And then Rod, maybe I'll just add on a little bit more to that. So specific to what we saw in Q1, on the ASP front, we actually did see some improvement on ASPs, and, you know, I attribute that really to two factors. I think we're doing a really nice job continuing to sell the value of our solutions. But I also think the general inflationary issues we're seeing around the supply chain is playing into that. And so, we'll just have to see how that plays out for the remainder of the year. But I think broader as well, when we get back to the supply chain issues, look, you know, we've got very strong relationships with our suppliers.  And so, we're very confident in terms of working with our suppliers in terms of making sure we can meet our customer\u2019s needs. And, you know, we're just being very cautious and monitoring very actively, I think our supply chain team is doing a tremendous job navigating us through this, no different than what they did in the COVID environment. So, we're quite pleased with how things are progressing, but, you know, I think the themes are yet general inflationary concerns across the board, especially with some of the smaller componentry. And then we did see some improvement in ASPs.\nCharlie Giancarlo: Yeah, I do want to just underline that. Really, our suppliers have been wonderful to work with. You know, it's a tough environment out there. They're under a lot of pressure, but a, we have good relationships with them. But b, they've been \u2013 they've worked with us really well. And I couldn't be more pleased with the suppliers that that we work with.\nRod Hall: Okay. Do you guys mind if I sneak another one in? I know it was a long answer, but \u2026\nKevan Krysler: Not at all, please.\nRod Hall: Okay. The other one is just on, you know, your product revenue was clearly, you know, negatively impacted through COVID. I'm assuming that you've got exposures to some of these industries that were affected that I don't remember exactly what you said about that. I'm just curious, what you think your exposure to the reopening benefited industries are, travel, leisure, all that kind of stuff? You know, what sort of industrial exposure you think you have to reopening? Thanks.\nKevan Krysler: Thanks, Rod. You know, in the past, when we talked about, you know, the COVID exposure, it had more to do with the fact that as a relatively new vendor, and one that was focused on growth, it was customers concern not being able to be in the office, and their lesser willingness to try new things, whether that's new products, new vendors, or new used cases for existing products. And so, the way we look at this is that as we return to, you know, an environment where customers are more willing to try new things, including, you know, maybe a new vendor, but it may just be one of our new products or maybe one of our existing products in a used case that where they currently use competitors\u2019 products or it's a new used case entirely. They're going to be much more willing to do something new and different. And so that's what we're looking forward to. It was less about us being exposed to highly exposed segments and much more about reluctance to engage in new activities by our customers.\nRod Hall: Great. All right. Thanks a lot, Charlie. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Your next call comes from the line of Wamsi Mohan of Bank of America.\nWamsi Mohan: Yes. Thank you. Sorry to get back on this inflationary topic. But can you be more specific on whether how much of that potentially is logistics versus procurement versus increased pricing from your suppliers? And do you see that impacting revenue at all? It sounded like, you know, you guys alluded to sort of the cost impact of not all the upside flowing through in the back half, but what about revenue? And I have a follow-up.\nCharlie Giancarlo: Thank you, Wamsi. Well, Wamsi, look, in the context of it being a, you know, there being a lot of uncertainty in the supply chain. That being said, we feel reasonably confident about Q2. We feel reasonably good about Q2. It's very difficult to talk about Q3 and Q4 with high levels of confidence, but you know, we have a high degree of confidence in both our own operations team that have really performed from, you know, from a customer standpoint, flawlessly, you know, throughout COVID. And up until this day, and with our suppliers who we work with very closely. We think it's been, you know, there are situations where, you know, every day where components that one thought were available, suddenly become unavailable. Also component availability, you know changes every week. And then one is looking for those components elsewhere. So, it's both a supply issue as well as a cost issue, as we identified costs are going up largely on the supply side. I think less so on the logistic side, at least for us. And as I said, it's a bit of an uncertain world, but that being said, we feel reasonably confident on Q2 that it won't affect revenue on Q2. And I would just want to put that caveat there, reasonably confident. And Q3, and Q4, we're just going to keep, we'll update you, you know, every quarter and as to how we feel about this.\nKevan Krysler: Yeah. And maybe I can go into a little bit more detail in terms of what we saw, specifically in Q1. So, we actually did see improvement in ASPs, as I mentioned previously. You know, that was more favorable in terms of what we were doing on discounting. And again, I think that's both what we saw with the supply chain, but I also think the \u2013 our field is doing a really nice job and selling the value of our products. And frankly, what we saw with product gross margin this quarter, I viewed as very favorable. Again, on the high-end of our expectations, despite kind of navigating through what we're seeing on the supply chain side, and then obviously, we had some really great traction, as we mentioned with FlashArray//C. And given that that's a newer product for us, you know, we had some gross margin pressure with FlashArray//C as well, which, you know, when you then look at the total gross margin profile is very positive for us. So, hopefully that is helpful for you.\nWamsi Mohan: Yeah, no, it is. Thank you for that. And if I could follow-up, you know, we're seeing an increased proliferation in competitive offerings of as-a-service on-prem as-a-service, [indiscernible] I think, Charlie, in your opening comments, you referred to some competitor offerings that are largely financing not necessarily technology enhancements. I was wondering how you would characterize, you know, the competitive landscape through the lens of these offerings? Thank you.\nCharlie Giancarlo : Yeah. Thanks. Thanks, Wamsi. So, largely, as you describe it, I'll put some additional detail behind that. You know, as you could tell from both the prepared remarks, I know that some of you perhaps have been attending our Accelerate conferences well. What you see us are delivering is a true as-a-service experience from a technology perspective. The way that customers interact with it, the way that they're able to manipulate it, you know, through code and API. The fact that it is continually improving without disruption, very similar to any type of SaaS offering. You know, these are all service qualities. Whereas most of our competitors are very much focused on financial constructs to make it look like a service. And a [big tell tale], in my point of view, from my point of view is that when we provide Pure as-a-Service we're actually selling to our customer, an SLA, it's not an array, it doesn't have a product name, we are providing them a service level agreement that actually has [teeth to the agreement]. You know, we have to deliver the service level that we otherwise there are financial penalties to us. Our competitors tend to provide an objective with no teeth in it whatsoever, and there are named products in it. So, it really is a financing construct that they put together. You know, for us, the fact that its subscription, basically, is the fact that what we're all offering is a service. And so naturally it becomes a subscription. The last thing I'll mention is that it exists both on-prem and across the Cloud with CBS. The subscription \u2013 it doesn't matter where the customer puts their data. And they manage it all through the same management system. So, really is a pan Cloud true technical service, and therefore of course, a unified subscription very different than just the financial construct.\nWamsi Mohan : Thanks Charlie.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Amit Daryanani with Evercore.\nAmit Daryanani: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. I have two as well. I guess first off, if I take your July quarter guide, the first half of the year, we're going to do, you know, 14.5% growth give or take. And you compare that to get fairly easy in the back half. And very simplistically, my tendency would be to say, simpler \u2013 easier compared with such as growth accelerates in the back half versus the first half. I would love to understand so what are the factors we should consider as we go into the back half because the compares would suggest we should see an acceleration, just what factors should we think about in the back half would be helpful?\nKevan Krysler: Yeah, I'll start it more tactically. And Charlie, you know feel free to jump on in. And obviously, we are expecting some acceleration in second half, you know, with our \u2013 where we landed for Q1 in our guide for Q2, and then looking at what that plays out to for second half, we get some ramp on that. And obviously, just to highlight as well, that Q4 is generally our seasonally highest quarter in terms of sales, which is beneficial. But, you know, early signs of FlashArray//C, you know, I think that's going to parlay itself throughout the year. You know, and I think in particular, what was exciting across the board for us is what we saw from a broad based perspective. I mean, we saw really kind of everything driving with strength, whether that's enterprise, you know, commercial, you know, this is the first time we were really seeing some strength on commercial. And I think it's important to highlight that, we were very pleased to see that strength coming through this quarter, despite still being in a COVID environment. So that was great to see, obviously Pure as-a-Service and what we're seeing across the board with Portworx. So, it's really this balanced strength that we've seen in Q1 that we really do think that momentum, which really started in Q4 will continue throughout the year. But Charlie anything else you'd want to add to that?\nCharlie Giancarlo: Yeah, you know, I would say that, as we look at the year, Q1 was still \u2013 the quarter we've just had, a 100% under COVID rules. We're still, you know, while we might be kind of seeing maybe some green shoots come up, mostly around the promise of people getting back to the office, you know, we\u2019re just three weeks into Q2, you know, we've yet to see any real pickup due to that phenomenon, where we believe we may see that in Q2, and then we'll be in a better position, you know, once we have our next quarter\u2019s earnings of being able to say what the rest of the year, you know, might look like, but given that your all the experience we've had to date this year have been 100% under COVID rules, it a little bit hard to speculate as to the second half of the year.\nAmit Daryanani: Fair enough. Hopefully we don't have a third wave and [exploration sustains] for you folks. If I could follow-up on the commercial segment, I know you talked about seeing better momentum over there, can you just a bit what is driving the momentum here, is it just a better engagement with the channel or the sales [indiscernible] something different? And then are the commercial customers now engaging with the different product set with PR versus what's your traditional enterprise customers have done?\nCharlie Giancarlo: I'd say there are a number of phenomenon\u2019s that we're seeing at work. There's no question. I think we might have mentioned this in the prepared remarks that we're seeing increased \u2013 what we call partner sourced deals, and a large part of that is commercial. So, we will, we believe that that is going to only continue. We're really seeing good pickup by the partners overall. Second, we do think there's a bit of a resurgence of commercial that, you know, a number of them have gotten their feet underneath them, if you will, on this COVID environment, and are back in the market. We think that's just beginning, by the way. I don't think that's a big phenomena, but I think that was a large part of it. And I do think that, you know, our FlashArray//C, you know, is in fact selling not just into the enterprise, but into the commercial market as well. And so I think that also opens up a bit of that. So, I think it's a little bit of the three of those things, but I think a lot more to come.\nKevan Krysler: Yeah. And I just had Pure as-a-Service too Charlie.\nCharlie Giancarlo: You know, that's right. I think the thought many may think that Pure as-a-Service largely appeals to large enterprise customers, but we have, you know, a set of programs for Pure as-a-Service specifically in the commercial market and it's doing very well there.\nAmit Daryanani: Perfect. Thank you very much.\nCharlie Giancarlo: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Simon Leopold of Raymond James.\nSimon Leopold: Thanks for taking the question. I'm going to ask maybe a little bit of an odd one, but my perception on this call was that, Charlie, you sounded more upbeat on the FlashArray//C and my recollection is that on the prior call, you sounded more upbeat on FlashBlade, and I could be reading too much into it. But I guess I want to get a sense of whether that was intentional, and maybe how you think about, sort of the new product cycles here? Is something shifted in your thinking or how do we kind of separate these two trends? Thank you.\nCharlie Giancarlo: Yeah, yeah, no, we just like to share the wealth. And sometimes we'll spend a little bit more time on one than the other. So, you shouldn't take any, and I started to get \u2013 I was getting tired of hearing myself talk. So, I, you know, I didn't want to bore you all to death with, you know adding on even more. No, both products, we\u2019re very excited about. They both fill different niches. The FlashBlade product, you know, a very highly scalable product, a scale out product, capable of supporting multiple, simultaneous workloads at unbelievable speed, you know, really good for scale out environments for AI, machine learning, analytics, you know, and rapid recovery all-in-one platform all at the same time. FlashArray//C, now, you know, with file. You know, a great what's called scale up platform now competitive with, you know, from a pricing level, with hybrid disk for that secondary tier. So, no. We're very proud of both platforms, you know, from quarter-to-quarter, you may hear us spend a little bit more time on, you know, with different products, you know, including Portworx rather, and FlashArray//X. So, you may hear us just spend different amounts of time, each quarter for color on each product.\nKevan Krysler: And Simon, I'll just add that this was a quarter where we had strength across our business. And, you know, we had a plethora of options to choose from in terms of what we wanted to emphasize. And so the first thing is, is we just had strength across the board. And then, you know, obviously, see, we're very impressed with what's going on with C. And also say that, you know, flash player, acquired, you know, new unstructured data scale up customers at a much faster rate this quarter, that what we saw in the previous year-over-year quarter. So, good stuff happening all the way around in not meaning to ignore anyone in particular. \nSimon Leopold: Right. No, I appreciate it. And then follow ups, hopefully pretty easy, but where are you when you're thinking on your own organization, maybe returning to, sort of pre-COVID expense levels in the sense of reintroducing travel and items like that? How should we think about your own internal planning for those kinds of activity? Thanks.\nCharlie Giancarlo: Yeah, you can imagine that we are putting a lot of work and focus on that, you know, as we've discussed last quarter, we plan on adding to the bottom line of this year and years ahead. So, as we start to reintroduce some of those other expenses, obviously we\u2019ll slow down other expenses. We do expect to grow into this. But I think you know, the annual guide we provided last quarter, you know, for modest bottom line growth, you know, and Kevan's addition to that commentary on this call, you should expect us to continue down that path. So, we expect overall that the percentage of your expenses to total will come down so that we add more to the bottom line.\nSimon Leopold: Thanks for taking the questions.\nCharlie Giancarlo: Thanks Simon.\nOperator: Your question comes from Tim Long of Barclays.\nTim Long: Thank you. Tow if I could as well. First, can you talk a little bit about, kind of deal sizes and win rates, and you know, kind of some of those metrics? And if there's anything that's, kind of different when we're looking at, you know, the commercial side and the larger enterprise in those metrics view or any trends worth highlighting? And then second, I just wanted to dig into FlashArray//C a little bit more, it sounded pretty good in the quarter, double-digit, but overall was double-digits. So given as such a huge TAM, when we're thinking about this, as we go through the year and into next year, what's going to accelerate the growth rate there? Is it new used cases or, you know, pieces of your customer base that you got to penetrate further. So, what is it that kind of allows that product to really take on that much larger TAM? Thank you.\nCharlie Giancarlo: Sure, thanks. Win rates have stayed, you know, this is something we analyze all the time, win rates have stayed roughly steady. You know, it's very much in-line. You know, whenever our win rates get a bit too high, we worry, we're not in fights, and we did expand the number of fights that we\u2019re in this quarter and win rates have held pretty steady and no big changes, vis-a-vis any one of our competitors. So, the win rate ones remains, you know, pretty much at historical rates. Kevan, do have any comment on deal size? I don't have that offhand. I think it's roughly the same, but I don't have any.\nKevan Krysler: Yeah, overall deal size, where we were very pleased with what we saw on deal size now. Obviously, Q1 of last year, we were fortunate to get some really large deals, in part due to folks working on mission critical and addressing their needs on that front in terms of work for home. So, I would say that the significant larger deals were a little bit less this quarter, but I was really pleased with the balance we saw, you know, multitude of deals over a million dollars. So, nothing to highlight, you know, in terms of significance, other than it was broad based across the board. And in terms of what we saw in lesser larger deals that we saw.\nCharlie Giancarlo: C growth was, you\u2019re right, double-digits is a very wide, wide range, but we also gave you a commentary that C has been and continues to be our fastest new product from a growth perspective. So, you can assume that it's a higher number \u2013 significantly higher number than our average than our growth overall as a company. It does open up that second tier market for us, both on the block side, but also somewhat on the file side. And as we add more and more features, we think is going to add even more market opportunity for us on the file side. So, it's still, you know, while on the block side, it's mature product. On the file side, it's still early days. And so, you know, we're going to see, I think we're going to see continued expansion of our opportunity there.\nSimon Leopold: Thank you.\nCharlie Giancarlo: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Matt Sheerin of Stifel.\nMatt Sheerin: Yes. Thank you. I just wanted to ask regarding your commentary about the growth in the channel partners in the contribution to new customers, as well as the commercial market. What's behind that? I know that you put some new channel programs in place in the last couple of years, but what accounts for that traction? And do you see that that roster expanding further, particularly given the rollout of Azure where there\u2019s some very strong support base in the channel?\nCharlie Giancarlo: Yeah. Thanks, Matt. We do. I think there's several reasons for it. One is, you know, we're a 100% partner model, meaning that we don't go direct. So, you know, one of the things that partners really like about us is that they know that we're fair and that we'll work with them and that when the going gets tough, you know, in a competitive environment, we're not going to just take it away from them. So, that loyalty is reciprocated by the partners themselves. I think we've continued to make it easier and easier for the partners to sell our product. First of all, the product itself is very straightforward, very simple requires relatively, you know, little busy work by the partners to set up and to be able to operate and to be able to service Of course, it's highly, highly reliable. And that also makes for a better customer experience, which, you know, partners care about the customer experience, because that's what gets the customer, the partner, more business from that same customer. So I think, you know, the values of the company itself that we represent high NPS, high reliability, the fact that we don't stray to a direct model when the going gets tough. And you're right, you know, we've worked a lot and will continue to work on our partner programs, especially aggressive growth programs, you know, in specialized expertise, programs with our partners to enable them to evolve as companies and enable them to, you know, provide a better experience overall for our customers.\nMatt Sheerin : Okay, thanks very much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Shannon Cross of Cross Research.\nShannon Cross: Thank you very much. Just one for me, actually, and it's a little bit big picture. I'm curious, when you think about recurring revenue, which I believe is now at about 39% of revenue, and obviously growing given the mix shift that's going on, where do you see that topping out or how do you see the migration continuing? I'm just curious if we get to a certain point where customers would rather, you know, more of a CapEx kind of model or, you know, do you think this is something where eventually the entire model shifts there? Thank you.\nKevan Krysler: It's a great question, Shannon and I'll start off. Look, our first big milestone that we're looking at is 50% of our revenue. It would be the big next milestone for us. And look, at the end of the day, though, it's still customer first in terms of what they prefer, with flexibility. So, we won't force a particular model on them in terms of how they want to consume our technology and drive their outcomes.  But I do think 50% is a good target for us to have longer-term in terms of recurring revenue, especially with what we're seeing with the momentum around evergreen and Pure as-a-Service with our unified subscription coming on board, as we've talked about, with Cloud Block Store, both AWS and Azure I really will complement that, and then following that, and we've talked about that as well, which is Portworx, and our solutions around modern apps. Anything else you'd want to add, Charlie?\nCharlie Giancarlo: No. I think that covers it.\nKevan Krysler: Okay.\nShannon Cross: Curious what long-term sort of refers to? I mean, are you talking to a couple of years out or for\u2026? Thank you.\nKevan Krysler: Definitely. Yeah, that'd be a couple years out and how we're looking at that. And we'll give some more details on that in our Analyst Day, which we're contemplating in the month of September.\nShannon Cross: Great, thank you.\nKevan Krysler: Thank you, Shannon.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Kathryn Huberty with Morgan Stanley.\nKathryn Huberty: Thank you. Charlie, can you talk about some of the metrics that underscore your confidence in the second quarter? You know, for instance, what did pipeline growth look like? Where was backlog versus normal seasonality? What sort of linearity did you see in the quarter? Did some of those metrics and leading indicators that drive the confidence? And then I have a follow up?\nCharlie Giancarlo : Sure. Thank you, Katie. Great to speak to you. So, we saw a number of things. One is, you know, good linearity, but, frankly, improving, you know, through the quarter, so definitely seeing, you know, signs, as I said, green shoots and improvement, you know, as we went through the quarter, you know, we don't give specific details on pipeline, but, you know, pipeline that supports, you know, the Q2 guide that we've provided, you know, based on, you know, the kind of have metrics and analysis that we've done in the past, you know, and a hard look at that.  We're not basing it tremendously on, you know, any kind of hope or dramatic improvement, you know, in the whole COVID situation in Q2. We think it's fairly balanced from the standpoint of, you know, not a lot of wishes, you know, or hopes, you know, for change to the positive. So, we think it's a, you know, sort of a prudent and a balanced guide. You know, good support from, you know, things that are, you know, near term deals, near term pipeline. So, you know, not nothing magic, I would say in the guide. You know, we believe we can get there with business as what we've seen over the last couple of quarters.\nKathryn Huberty: Great, that's helpful. And then just a follow up, Kevan. As I think about NAND price inflation, in the past the industry and Pure in particular has been able to pass through the higher costs, you know, such that it's somewhat neutral to profit dollars, maybe some pressure on gross margin percentage, but it is typically fairly neutral. Is there a reason that you would expect it to play out differently this time? Or is it just a function that this is just getting started, and there's a lot of moving pieces within different cost buckets, and so you want to be conservative and assume that some of the upside you saw in the first quarter gets offset by this dynamic as you move through the year?\nKevan Krysler: Katie, it's really much more of the latter that you articulated. And really, if this was just a NAND that we were looking at, I think we would follow that thesis perfectly in terms of how we think about NAND pricing be able to pass that off. But look, I think the issues we're seeing around the supply chain are much broader. And there's really, you know, broader, general inflationary concerns that we've talked about at a component level. I mean, the smallest components are driving, you know, our supply chain team, with a lot of work. And we do have inflation there. Now, the interesting thing in Q1 is we were successful, generally around increasing our ASPs. And I do think in part that's due to the inflation that we were seeing. The question is, can we maintain that with the broader supply chain constraints that we're seeing, and that remains to be seen. You know, obviously, we're confident in terms of our Q2 outlook, but that is the reason why we were only, you know, talking about taking half of our over achievement for operating profit for the annual view.\nCharlie Giancarlo: And if I might just insert, because I don't want there to be a confusion Katie, I know you're aware of this. But it's not as if we pass higher costs along, we've never raised prices. But what does happen is, because our deals are competitive, you know, we're competing every day against competition. And, you know, when their costs are higher like ours, you know, all the vendors become more cautious in terms of their discounting. And that's why the ASPs tend to float a little bit with cost, but it's never quite one for one and timing, you know, this quarter versus next quarter, you know, how long is people's supply contracts are in place for and so forth plays a role. So, there's always a little bit of movement because of timing.\nKathryn Huberty: That makes perfect sense. Thank you.\nKevan Krysler: Thank you, Katie.\nOperator: This concludes the question-and-answer session. At this time, I will turn the call back over to Charlie Giancarlo for closing remarks.\nCharlie Giancarlo: Thank you, operator. I want to thank everyone on the call again. I want to put out thanks to all of our customers and our prospects for the trust that they've put in the company and to our partners and suppliers for their really strong collaboration and their support. And also to all of our employees for the innovation hard work over the past many, many quarters and throughout the COVID period. We're excited to ourselves to be getting back to work later this summer. And we wish all of you on the call a very happy summer. Take care.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Rob Lee",
            "content": "Yeah, absolutely. You know, we're super excited, just to see the continued growth in the overall cloud portfolio, Cloud Block Store key component for, you know, the modern app, sorry the traditional applications, and now expanding from AWS to Azure, we see that as adding just a ton of value to the unified subscription. You know, as an example, with a large FSI customer this quarter, you know, who was undergoing a tremendous growth in their business, struggling to keep up on their legacy gear brought Pure in under the unified subscription, and was able to get immediate performance capacity and elasticity benefits on prem, as well as utilize Cloud Block Store on Azure to move their Disaster Recovery Environment over to the cloud. And so, I think that flexibility, and last, we were able to deliver just goes to speak to the benefits of the software subscription, the software approach and just the overall unified subscription through which we deliver the cloud products. I'll just jump in there. Part of what makes that one, two punch particularly powerful is, and this is a fast growing space. This is a significant and secular transition and how applications are built. Frankly, this is how most modern applications are being built today. And so we've really taken the strategy of investing in a full suite of data management capabilities, to be able to help a customer deploy, build, deploy and get to production in multiple environments, whether that's on-prem, in the cloud, hybrid cloud or multi-cloud and you know, across the whole spectrum of development lifecycle, whether they're just getting started, you know, getting the staging or going to global production scale. So, early days, but really exciting."

            "content": "Hello everyone and thank you for joining us today. I hope you and your loved ones are healthy and looking forward to better days ahead as summer begins, vaccination rates increase, and the beginning of the end of COVID restrictions in many parts of the world comes into view. Our hearts go out to our friends in India and other countries still suffering from this scourge and we pray that they will soon recover. Pure delivered very strong results in Q1. We drove double-digit growth against a strong comparison with Q1 of last year. I'm also happy to report that our strong quarter was broad based with balanced contributions across every aspect of our business. We continue to see enterprise expansion, validating our investment in world-class enterprise products, services and our go-to-market teams over the past two years. In this quarter, we also saw our commercial segment strengthen its contribution, particularly in customer acquisition, where we increased net new customer's year-over-year. Our U.S. and our International teams both achieved double-digit year-over-year growth this quarter and our new products again saw significant annual growth. Our industry leading subscription business saw fantastic growth, up 35% over the same quarter last year. Pure's unique Evergreen and as-a-service models continue to resonate strongly with customers and differentiate us from the rest of the industry. Competitors are attempting to recreate our capabilities through financing, marketing and professional services, but cannot change their legacy systems to match our non-disruptive upgrades, API management, or remote operations and support. Pure has doubled the number of partners selling Pure-as-a-Service year-over-year and our channel partner bookings are growing nicely. And we recently announced new incentives and offerings to enhance subscription sales through our channel partners to build on this momentum. Our operating profit exceeded expectations this quarter, reflecting our revenue overperformance paired with prudent expense management. The strong growth this quarter was achieved during continued COVID restrictions and is based mostly on improvements in our operations and our customers' increasing confidence in our brand. We have been reasonably accurate in our predictions of our business environment since the pandemic started. I feel confident that as vaccination rates increase globally, and our markets return to some semblance of normal office culture, that our business momentum will increase even further. This month, we kicked off our Annual Accelerate Digital event, and so far, we have connected with more than 17,000 attendees, a new record for attendance, 60% higher than last year. The significant annual increase in customer, prospect and partner participation at our Accelerate conference is an indicator of how strongly our Modern Data Experience strategy is resonating in the market. We re-iterated our vision of Pure's Modern Data Experience and showed how leading organizations like Aegis Sciences, NASA, and Roblox are using Pure's data platform to modernize their infrastructure, modernize their operations and modernize their business applications. We announced updates to the Pure1 Digital Experience, our cloud-based management platform for all of Pure's products and services, and we released the latest version of Portworx Enterprise. We also provided greater details on our Bare Metal as a Service solution with Equinix and newest Purity software enhancements. All of these new capabilities and more will continue to be featured in workshops throughout the entire, month-long Accelerate event. Customers have shown excitement for our promise of leading edge, automated infrastructure that is continually improving without disruption. Pure's Modern Data Experience delivers modern infrastructure that enables modern operations supporting the needs of modern business applications. We believe that these three steps are fundamental in every company's digital transformation journey and are made possible by Pure's Modern Data Experience. The first component of our Modern Data Experience is enabling our customers to modernize their infrastructure. A modern data infrastructure provides easy-to-deploy, reliable services, manageable by IT and developers alike, through APIs and code. We provide common services, interfaces and management across on-prem and cloud. And with Pure as a Service, we provide customers a single unified contract across clouds. Customers can operate both existing business critical applications and next generation cloud-native applications in a hybrid cloud environment. Our founding vision of the All-Flash data center is being further realized with Pure's FlashArray//C, the first all-QLC FlashArray that pushes flash to a new tier of workloads, where our competitors are stuck competing with disk. FlashArray//C saw double-digit growth this quarter and continues to be our fastest growing new product ever. Just last week, Pure's FlashArray family was recognized as a Gartner Peer Insights Customers' Choice. You don't need to be in technology to know that data insecurity is not only a nuisance, but a matter of national security. In the last few years, we brought industry-leading data protection to our entire portfolio, allowing enterprises to protect their data from Ransomware with the ability to restore from protected copies within hours of a breach. Customers like Be The Match, which is operated by the National Bone Marrow Donor Program, have chosen Pure FlashArray//X and FlashBlade platforms, with SafeMode Data Protection and rapid restore capabilities, to protect their mission critical data in the event of a breach. Meadville Medical Center in Pennsylvania is another customer who subscribes to Pure as-a-Service with SafeMode, so that if they ever need a SafeMode Snapshot to recover their data, they know that they can be back online within hours. We launched a new SafeMode Dashboard in Pure1 this quarter, which provides a consolidated view of the Ransomware protection of all Pure arrays in a customer's fleet, delivering peace-of-mind that an organization's data franchise is protected by this extra layer of Ransomware protection. Pure's unique Evergreen capability is the cornerstone of a modern infrastructure, with the ability to continually update technology and services, without disruption to a customer's environment. In fact, 98% of our arrays that were deployed over 5 years ago are not only still in use, but have been modernized in many cases to our most recent models. Our systems, like most cloud services, are upgraded to the most modern technology, consistently, non-disruptively and transparently to the application. Our Purity software, Evergreen model, and Pure1 management system uniquely position Pure to deliver a true as-a-Service, modern infrastructure experience to our customers. The second component of our Modern Data Experience is modernizing operations. After all, the value of modern infrastructure is deeply diminished if you operate it with yesterday's manual processes. Modern Ops means standardizing service offerings and making them available to the organization via a service catalog and APIs. Doing that delivers DevOps, data science teams, and application developers the storage-as-code experience they have come to expect. Pure as-a-Service is a key element of our strategy for Modern Ops. Pure as-a-Service continues to be the industry's storage-as-a-service benchmark and we're very pleased with its growth this quarter. Launched in 2018, it unifies block, file, and object storage across all tiers of performance, and private and public clouds into a unified data-storage subscription and is the foundation of a true hybrid-cloud experience. Customers such as the City of Denver use Pure as-a-Service to automate data management. They use Pure to monitor and deliver performance, upgrades, and even variable capacity for seasonal events like elections. With the flexibility of Pure's Cloud Block Store for both AWS and Azure as an option in their Pure as-a-Service subscription, we are seeing strong interest from companies who want to simplify their data architecture with a proven solution while reaping the benefits of both private and hyper-scaler clouds. Pure as-a-Service is differentiated not only by the inherent agility of the Evergreen architecture, but also by the as-a-Service user experience we deliver via Pure1, our META AI engine, and our proactive support experience. Pure1 has now broadened its predictive fault analysis and resolution using telemetry gathered from across Pure's ecosystem, including bare metal, VMs, and containers. Our expanded AI-driven workload planner can now suggest the right service tier for Pure as-a-Service subscriptions or infrastructure purchases. The Pure1 service catalog was expanded this quarter, so customers can easily add, upgrade, suspend, resume, limit, and renew Pure as-a-Service capabilities as needed. These SaaS tools work together to give customers the insight and intelligence they need to confidently make storage subscription decisions. The investments we've made to modernize infrastructure and operations supports our customers' desire to develop truly modern applications, which is the third pillar of the Modern Data Experience. Modernizing applications leverages cloud-native architectures, specifically containers and Kubernetes, to take advantage of more efficient computing, new programming models, hybrid-cloud architectures and new capabilities like real-time analytics and data streaming. The latest version of Portworx Enterprise, announced at //Accelerate, gives customers an automated, Kubernetes-native storage experience for container-based applications wherever they live. Portworx Enterprise now delivers deeper integration across the Pure family, fully enabling both FlashArray and FlashBlade for enterprise scale and resiliency in production environments. It utilizes Pure1 for enhanced observability and proactive support, and complete provisioning automation on all Pure systems. Customers are using Portworx to enable containerized workloads to run seamlessly across the cloud, including Pure Storage arrays, bare metal infrastructure, and even third-party storage solutions. Just three quarters since acquisition, we have fully combined Portworx and Pure products into the integrated, simple and Evergreen platform that Pure is known for. As the number and range of modern applications increases, and the volume of unstructured data increases, organizations are reducing the complexity of their data architecture with fast object storage, where Pure's FlashBlade remains the market leader. At nearly $1 billion in cumulative sales, it is the preferred choice for customers needing a unified fast file and object platform for their modern business applications. In fact, FlashBlade is the leader in GigaOm's new Radar for High-Performance Object Storage, validating Pure as the pioneer in the fast object space. Overall, our product and market leadership is expanding. We continue to deliver the industry's most advanced platforms, greatest reliability and total cost of ownership, with the most innovative service models. All together, we are well on our way to delivering a complete Modern Data Experience to customers worldwide. I'll now turn the call over to our CFO, Kevan Krysler for a deeper look at the numbers. Yeah, Karl, this is Charlie, let me start on that wall. Kevan, I think pulls together some of the stats on that. You know, overall, I would say, you know, that our overall \u2013 there's been overall growth in our FlashArray product line counting both FlashArray//X and FlashArray//C, you know, and we were really pleased to see that, you know, that growth for that product line continue. And I have to say that, that I remain very bullish that we'll continue to see growth in that product line, in addition, of course, to FlashBlade and Portworx, all of which are seeing, you know, strong growth overall. So, and then if you count in along with that, the growth that we're seeing in subscriptions and pass in particular, you know, which does not show up immediately on the top line because of the accounting for subscription basis. Yeah, we are seeing good growth overall. And I'll just comment for a moment on the supply chain side on the NAND. First is, you're correct, we probably will not see, although we entered the year that is the calendar year with some deflationary pressure initially, through the remainder of the year, you're exactly correct. It's unlikely to see any downward pricing in NAND and actually likely to see some upward pricing on the raw NAND as we go forward. You know, and that'll be overall industry affecting. And of course, because most of our sales are very competitive in nature, we also saw a slight increase in ASPs and I would expect ASPs to hold, you know, reasonably steady plus or minus through the year overall. So, I think you're correct. We're not going to see a lot of deflationary pressure this year. And then finally, on the, you know, Exabyte, you know, we will definitely ship more Exabyte's this year than we did last year for sure. You know, in terms of average, I think we're cautiously optimistic that the average will go up. But you know, spending tends to, you know, and I'm expecting that overall spending for data storage this year will also increase for the market as a whole. So, I hope that provides you some indication. The answer to both is yes. The reason why we're seeing such good overall expansion of our enterprise business is because of the investments we made as a company. Remember, just two or three years ago, we were largely a commercial company with some deployments in enterprise. We made major investments both in products as well as our go to market team to really become a brand that would be respected by a broader set, and really by the enterprise customer environment at large. And I think we've achieved that from a brand perspective. But we're still early, in many ways in our expansion into enterprise. So, I expect that expansion, which is not, you know, secular specific to the investments that we made to continue. So, really, for us, it's about penetration into what was for us a new market. And I think you're comparing us perhaps to companies that had a mature market in enterprise, and therefore are not, you know, probably are still waiting to see the secular growth in the enterprise segment. Secular growth in enterprise can only help us as we continue to expand in that space. Thanks. Yeah, well, as you know, it is a subscription based business and therefore, you know, it's a ratable \u2013 it takes a while for ratable products to make a big difference, you know, to the top line, but I have to say that, you know, both revenue growth is, you know, we're talking, you know, in and around, you know, doubling of revenue growth, and we've seen a much even larger expansion of pipeline. So, I'm been going out a little bit on the [limb] here, but it's, it's going very well. And the strategy of aligning, and having, you know, single management and single, you know, layer that is the Kubernetes layer, for customers to be able to manage both their traditional applications, as well as their modern applications, so-called cloud native applications, you're under one umbrella supported by everything from you know, a startup environment for or, you know, a new development environment, you know, with a small amount of storage under the original Portworx SDS layer. And then expanding into a full, you know, multi-petabyte production environment, you know, using a highly reliable arrays, either FlashArray or FlashBlade. And to have that all done non-disruptively, you know, it's a very powerful promise that we're able to deliver to our customers. So, you know, so far, so good, we're seeing a lot of interest, we're seeing, as I say, you know very fast expanding demand. But as we mentioned, in our last call or two, you know, it's probably going to be a year or two before it really becomes truly, you know, noticeable on a top line that's growing, even outside of Portworx. I'll talk a little bit about it. You know, just eight months, roughly after the close of the transaction, we've integrated all of our products now with, you know, with more to come. The customers, what we've seen in customers, and we've indicated this, but it bears repeating. You know, about half the customers are Pure customers that is the buyers are people that we've been talking to for years. And the other half of the buyers are new buyers for us, sometimes in the same account, sometimes new accounts, but on the development side. And it's a one, two punch of us being able to leverage what we already do and learn about a new area that makes you know, makes the acquisition a really compelling one, I think. Yeah. Great question. Look, we're seeing, you know, there is pricing pressure on the supply side, you know, across the board, I'd say it's more acute on some of the component area, you know, NAND is seeing some, but it's true on all of the different components. You know, freight, you know, a bit, I can't say that that's been a tremendous driver for us, but I'm going to take your guidance, and I'll look at it, but it's, you know, the costs are going up.  At the same time, as you probably know, Rod, a lot of our, most of our sales are competitive in nature. And so, our pricing is determined much more by the competitive environment in a particular deal than it is by our costs. And so, you know, there will be some balancing with ASPs, I'm sure. Exactly how much that is, we can't be, you know, 100% confident, but as Kevan mentioned, we've incorporated our best guess into the guide. So, we feel fairly good about it. It may have, there may be some effect on our margins. I don't expect it to be severe. You know, because again, we operate 100% of the time in a generally a competitive environment. Yeah, I do want to just underline that. Really, our suppliers have been wonderful to work with. You know, it's a tough environment out there. They're under a lot of pressure, but a, we have good relationships with them. But b, they've been \u2013 they've worked with us really well. And I couldn't be more pleased with the suppliers that that we work with. Thank you, Wamsi. Well, Wamsi, look, in the context of it being a, you know, there being a lot of uncertainty in the supply chain. That being said, we feel reasonably confident about Q2. We feel reasonably good about Q2. It's very difficult to talk about Q3 and Q4 with high levels of confidence, but you know, we have a high degree of confidence in both our own operations team that have really performed from, you know, from a customer standpoint, flawlessly, you know, throughout COVID. And up until this day, and with our suppliers who we work with very closely. We think it's been, you know, there are situations where, you know, every day where components that one thought were available, suddenly become unavailable. Also component availability, you know changes every week. And then one is looking for those components elsewhere. So, it's both a supply issue as well as a cost issue, as we identified costs are going up largely on the supply side. I think less so on the logistic side, at least for us. And as I said, it's a bit of an uncertain world, but that being said, we feel reasonably confident on Q2 that it won't affect revenue on Q2. And I would just want to put that caveat there, reasonably confident. And Q3, and Q4, we're just going to keep, we'll update you, you know, every quarter and as to how we feel about this. Yeah. Thanks. Thanks, Wamsi. So, largely, as you describe it, I'll put some additional detail behind that. You know, as you could tell from both the prepared remarks, I know that some of you perhaps have been attending our Accelerate conferences well. What you see us are delivering is a true as-a-service experience from a technology perspective. The way that customers interact with it, the way that they're able to manipulate it, you know, through code and API. The fact that it is continually improving without disruption, very similar to any type of SaaS offering. You know, these are all service qualities. Whereas most of our competitors are very much focused on financial constructs to make it look like a service. And a [big tell tale], in my point of view, from my point of view is that when we provide Pure as-a-Service we're actually selling to our customer, an SLA, it's not an array, it doesn't have a product name, we are providing them a service level agreement that actually has [teeth to the agreement]. You know, we have to deliver the service level that we otherwise there are financial penalties to us. Our competitors tend to provide an objective with no teeth in it whatsoever, and there are named products in it. So, it really is a financing construct that they put together. You know, for us, the fact that its subscription, basically, is the fact that what we're all offering is a service. And so naturally it becomes a subscription. The last thing I'll mention is that it exists both on-prem and across the Cloud with CBS. The subscription \u2013 it doesn't matter where the customer puts their data. And they manage it all through the same management system. So, really is a pan Cloud true technical service, and therefore of course, a unified subscription very different than just the financial construct. Yeah, you know, I would say that, as we look at the year, Q1 was still \u2013 the quarter we've just had, a 100% under COVID rules. We're still, you know, while we might be kind of seeing maybe some green shoots come up, mostly around the promise of people getting back to the office, you know, we're just three weeks into Q2, you know, we've yet to see any real pickup due to that phenomenon, where we believe we may see that in Q2, and then we'll be in a better position, you know, once we have our next quarter's earnings of being able to say what the rest of the year, you know, might look like, but given that your all the experience we've had to date this year have been 100% under COVID rules, it a little bit hard to speculate as to the second half of the year. I'd say there are a number of phenomenon's that we're seeing at work. There's no question. I think we might have mentioned this in the prepared remarks that we're seeing increased \u2013 what we call partner sourced deals, and a large part of that is commercial. So, we will, we believe that that is going to only continue. We're really seeing good pickup by the partners overall. Second, we do think there's a bit of a resurgence of commercial that, you know, a number of them have gotten their feet underneath them, if you will, on this COVID environment, and are back in the market. We think that's just beginning, by the way. I don't think that's a big phenomena, but I think that was a large part of it. And I do think that, you know, our FlashArray//C, you know, is in fact selling not just into the enterprise, but into the commercial market as well. And so I think that also opens up a bit of that. So, I think it's a little bit of the three of those things, but I think a lot more to come. You know, that's right. I think the thought many may think that Pure as-a-Service largely appeals to large enterprise customers, but we have, you know, a set of programs for Pure as-a-Service specifically in the commercial market and it's doing very well there. Thank you. Yeah, yeah, no, we just like to share the wealth. And sometimes we'll spend a little bit more time on one than the other. So, you shouldn't take any, and I started to get \u2013 I was getting tired of hearing myself talk. So, I, you know, I didn't want to bore you all to death with, you know adding on even more. No, both products, we're very excited about. They both fill different niches. The FlashBlade product, you know, a very highly scalable product, a scale out product, capable of supporting multiple, simultaneous workloads at unbelievable speed, you know, really good for scale out environments for AI, machine learning, analytics, you know, and rapid recovery all-in-one platform all at the same time. FlashArray//C, now, you know, with file. You know, a great what's called scale up platform now competitive with, you know, from a pricing level, with hybrid disk for that secondary tier. So, no. We're very proud of both platforms, you know, from quarter-to-quarter, you may hear us spend a little bit more time on, you know, with different products, you know, including Portworx rather, and FlashArray//X. So, you may hear us just spend different amounts of time, each quarter for color on each product. Yeah, you can imagine that we are putting a lot of work and focus on that, you know, as we've discussed last quarter, we plan on adding to the bottom line of this year and years ahead. So, as we start to reintroduce some of those other expenses, obviously we'll slow down other expenses. We do expect to grow into this. But I think you know, the annual guide we provided last quarter, you know, for modest bottom line growth, you know, and Kevan's addition to that commentary on this call, you should expect us to continue down that path. So, we expect overall that the percentage of your expenses to total will come down so that we add more to the bottom line. Thanks Simon. Sure, thanks. Win rates have stayed, you know, this is something we analyze all the time, win rates have stayed roughly steady. You know, it's very much in-line. You know, whenever our win rates get a bit too high, we worry, we're not in fights, and we did expand the number of fights that we're in this quarter and win rates have held pretty steady and no big changes, vis-a-vis any one of our competitors. So, the win rate ones remains, you know, pretty much at historical rates. Kevan, do have any comment on deal size? I don't have that offhand. I think it's roughly the same, but I don't have any. C growth was, you're right, double-digits is a very wide, wide range, but we also gave you a commentary that C has been and continues to be our fastest new product from a growth perspective. So, you can assume that it's a higher number \u2013 significantly higher number than our average than our growth overall as a company. It does open up that second tier market for us, both on the block side, but also somewhat on the file side. And as we add more and more features, we think is going to add even more market opportunity for us on the file side. So, it's still, you know, while on the block side, it's mature product. On the file side, it's still early days. And so, you know, we're going to see, I think we're going to see continued expansion of our opportunity there. Thank you. Yeah. Thanks, Matt. We do. I think there's several reasons for it. One is, you know, we're a 100% partner model, meaning that we don't go direct. So, you know, one of the things that partners really like about us is that they know that we're fair and that we'll work with them and that when the going gets tough, you know, in a competitive environment, we're not going to just take it away from them. So, that loyalty is reciprocated by the partners themselves. I think we've continued to make it easier and easier for the partners to sell our product. First of all, the product itself is very straightforward, very simple requires relatively, you know, little busy work by the partners to set up and to be able to operate and to be able to service Of course, it's highly, highly reliable. And that also makes for a better customer experience, which, you know, partners care about the customer experience, because that's what gets the customer, the partner, more business from that same customer. So I think, you know, the values of the company itself that we represent high NPS, high reliability, the fact that we don't stray to a direct model when the going gets tough. And you're right, you know, we've worked a lot and will continue to work on our partner programs, especially aggressive growth programs, you know, in specialized expertise, programs with our partners to enable them to evolve as companies and enable them to, you know, provide a better experience overall for our customers. No. I think that covers it. Sure. Thank you, Katie. Great to speak to you. So, we saw a number of things. One is, you know, good linearity, but, frankly, improving, you know, through the quarter, so definitely seeing, you know, signs, as I said, green shoots and improvement, you know, as we went through the quarter, you know, we don't give specific details on pipeline, but, you know, pipeline that supports, you know, the Q2 guide that we've provided, you know, based on, you know, the kind of have metrics and analysis that we've done in the past, you know, and a hard look at that.  We're not basing it tremendously on, you know, any kind of hope or dramatic improvement, you know, in the whole COVID situation in Q2. We think it's fairly balanced from the standpoint of, you know, not a lot of wishes, you know, or hopes, you know, for change to the positive. So, we think it's a, you know, sort of a prudent and a balanced guide. You know, good support from, you know, things that are, you know, near term deals, near term pipeline. So, you know, not nothing magic, I would say in the guide. You know, we believe we can get there with business as what we've seen over the last couple of quarters. And if I might just insert, because I don't want there to be a confusion Katie, I know you're aware of this. But it's not as if we pass higher costs along, we've never raised prices. But what does happen is, because our deals are competitive, you know, we're competing every day against competition. And, you know, when their costs are higher like ours, you know, all the vendors become more cautious in terms of their discounting. And that's why the ASPs tend to float a little bit with cost, but it's never quite one for one and timing, you know, this quarter versus next quarter, you know, how long is people's supply contracts are in place for and so forth plays a role. So, there's always a little bit of movement because of timing. Thank you, operator. I want to thank everyone on the call again. I want to put out thanks to all of our customers and our prospects for the trust that they've put in the company and to our partners and suppliers for their really strong collaboration and their support. And also to all of our employees for the innovation hard work over the past many, many quarters and throughout the COVID period. We're excited to ourselves to be getting back to work later this summer. And we wish all of you on the call a very happy summer. Take care."

            "name": "Kevan Krysler",
            "content": "Thank you, Charlie, and good afternoon. We are very pleased with the broad-based strength of our Q1 results and continued momentum. We delivered double-digit revenue growth despite both a tough compare, as well as continued uncertainty of COVID-19 and its influence on markets across the globe. Our sales growth, excluding cancelable orders, also reflected strength growing 13%, compared to last year. Our remaining performance obligations, or RPO, which includes our committed and non-cancelable future revenue is slightly over $1.1 billion, growing sequentially 24% year-over-year. In particular, what was most impressive about our performance this quarter was the strength across our entire business. Double digit sales growth from our key geos; strong contribution from our channel partners; performance across our entire product and solution portfolio, including FlashArray//C; and growth from both our existing and new customers, including our commercial business. We were very pleased with the strength we saw in new customer acquisition, which grew 15% year-over-year also driven in part by our commercial business. Now turning to specific financial results for the quarter. Total revenue grew 12% to approximately 413 million. International revenue grew 14%, while revenue in the United States grew 12%, compared to last year. Again, consistent with what we saw throughout last year, sales of our subscription services continue to reflect momentum. Subscription services revenue grew approximately 35% year-over-year and represents approximately 39% of total revenue. Non-GAAP total gross margins continue to reflect the differentiated value of our software and solutions, improving sequentially to 70.5% in the quarter and continues to be on the high-end of our long-term expectations. Non-GAAP product gross margins were 70.2% and non-GAAP subscription services margins were 71.1%. Subscription services margins improved both sequentially and year-over-year. Product gross margins improved slightly sequentially and were 73.3% in Q1 of last year. Product gross margins this quarter reflect both accelerated growth of our FlashArray//C and increasing supply chain costs required to secure product for our customers. We achieved slightly positive non-GAAP operating profit during the quarter, which outperformed our expectation. Contributing factors include revenue outperformance, lower expenses due to the COVID environment, including less travel and physical marketing events, as well as slower-than-planned hiring. We ended the quarter with over $1.23 billion in cash and approximately 3,800 employees. Cash flow from operations was 21 million and capital expenditures were 28 million during the quarter. Capital expenditures during the quarter included a higher mix invested in our Pure-as-a-Service infrastructure. We returned approximately 30 million of capital to repurchase slightly over 1.38 million shares as part of our 200 million share repurchase program. Now, turning to guidance. As previously mentioned, we are very pleased with our steadily increasing momentum over the last two quarters, while continuing to navigate the various challenges created by COVID-19. We expect the challenges created by COVID-19 will continue to recede as we progress throughout the year, and that our momentum will continue.  Q2 revenue is expected to be approximately 470 million, representing double-digit growth of 16%. We also expect non-GAAP operating profit will be approximately 15 million. As I mentioned last quarter, we will be guiding one quarter at a time and will not be updating our annual view, but we will provide some additional color on how we are thinking about the impact of our Q1 over-achievement for both revenue and operating income. We expect that revenue over-achievement will be accretive to our annual view. Primarily due to increasing supply chain related costs that we anticipate, we expect that approximately half of our operating income over-achievement during the quarter will be accretive to our annual view. We are excited to build upon our broad-based momentum in Q1 by continuing to create best-in-class outcomes, services and experiences for our partners and customers. With that, I will turn it over to the operator so we can get to your questions. Yeah, and I agree Charlie, and I think one other thing I would add is the inflationary pressure is just broader than NAND as well. So, we're seeing it across the supply chain, but again, that's been you know, considered in terms of how we're thinking about our Q2 guide, and that's why in the prepared remarks, I commented that about half of our overachievement for operating profit would be incremental, viewed as incremental to our annual guide. Yeah, Karl, let me just hit the first point on Cloud Block Store and how that combines really nicely with our unified subscription of here's a service. And that's really why I think we're seeing a lot of continued demand and momentum with Pure as-a-Service. And we're quite excited about cloud block store on Azure and Rob, do you have some comments on that? It'd be great to share some thoughts on Cloud Block Store with Azure? No, I think that's a great question. I think the pressure, the inflationary pressure we're seeing really more lends itself to product gross margins. But again, we're very pleased with what we saw coming out of the quarter, really, with strong gross margins, throughout both on the product and subscription side, and to your point, above, kind of a high-end of our expectations. And as we progress through the year, on the product, gross margin side, you know, we would expect to see some pressure on product gross margins due to what we're seeing on the supply chain. But again, we've accounted for that in terms of our Q2 guide in my prepared remarks around the annual view. Yeah, and Charlie, maybe just add on to that, you know, we're quite pleased with the integration that's going on there, right. We've got a new version of Portworx Enterprise that we're quite excited about. And, you know, the synergy that we're now seeing with our existing peer customers is pretty strong as well. And I don't know if you are Rob wanted to give a little color on that. And then Rod, maybe I'll just add on a little bit more to that. So specific to what we saw in Q1, on the ASP front, we actually did see some improvement on ASPs, and, you know, I attribute that really to two factors. I think we're doing a really nice job continuing to sell the value of our solutions. But I also think the general inflationary issues we're seeing around the supply chain is playing into that. And so, we'll just have to see how that plays out for the remainder of the year. But I think broader as well, when we get back to the supply chain issues, look, you know, we've got very strong relationships with our suppliers.  And so, we're very confident in terms of working with our suppliers in terms of making sure we can meet our customer's needs. And, you know, we're just being very cautious and monitoring very actively, I think our supply chain team is doing a tremendous job navigating us through this, no different than what they did in the COVID environment. So, we're quite pleased with how things are progressing, but, you know, I think the themes are yet general inflationary concerns across the board, especially with some of the smaller componentry. And then we did see some improvement in ASPs. Not at all, please. Thanks, Rod. You know, in the past, when we talked about, you know, the COVID exposure, it had more to do with the fact that as a relatively new vendor, and one that was focused on growth, it was customers concern not being able to be in the office, and their lesser willingness to try new things, whether that's new products, new vendors, or new used cases for existing products. And so, the way we look at this is that as we return to, you know, an environment where customers are more willing to try new things, including, you know, maybe a new vendor, but it may just be one of our new products or maybe one of our existing products in a used case that where they currently use competitors' products or it's a new used case entirely. They're going to be much more willing to do something new and different. And so that's what we're looking forward to. It was less about us being exposed to highly exposed segments and much more about reluctance to engage in new activities by our customers. Yeah. And maybe I can go into a little bit more detail in terms of what we saw, specifically in Q1. So, we actually did see improvement in ASPs, as I mentioned previously. You know, that was more favorable in terms of what we were doing on discounting. And again, I think that's both what we saw with the supply chain, but I also think the \u2013 our field is doing a really nice job and selling the value of our products. And frankly, what we saw with product gross margin this quarter, I viewed as very favorable. Again, on the high-end of our expectations, despite kind of navigating through what we're seeing on the supply chain side, and then obviously, we had some really great traction, as we mentioned with FlashArray//C. And given that that's a newer product for us, you know, we had some gross margin pressure with FlashArray//C as well, which, you know, when you then look at the total gross margin profile is very positive for us. So, hopefully that is helpful for you. Yeah, I'll start it more tactically. And Charlie, you know feel free to jump on in. And obviously, we are expecting some acceleration in second half, you know, with our \u2013 where we landed for Q1 in our guide for Q2, and then looking at what that plays out to for second half, we get some ramp on that. And obviously, just to highlight as well, that Q4 is generally our seasonally highest quarter in terms of sales, which is beneficial. But, you know, early signs of FlashArray//C, you know, I think that's going to parlay itself throughout the year. You know, and I think in particular, what was exciting across the board for us is what we saw from a broad based perspective. I mean, we saw really kind of everything driving with strength, whether that's enterprise, you know, commercial, you know, this is the first time we were really seeing some strength on commercial. And I think it's important to highlight that, we were very pleased to see that strength coming through this quarter, despite still being in a COVID environment. So that was great to see, obviously Pure as-a-Service and what we're seeing across the board with Portworx. So, it's really this balanced strength that we've seen in Q1 that we really do think that momentum, which really started in Q4 will continue throughout the year. But Charlie anything else you'd want to add to that? Yeah. And I just had Pure as-a-Service too Charlie. And Simon, I'll just add that this was a quarter where we had strength across our business. And, you know, we had a plethora of options to choose from in terms of what we wanted to emphasize. And so the first thing is, is we just had strength across the board. And then, you know, obviously, see, we're very impressed with what's going on with C. And also say that, you know, flash player, acquired, you know, new unstructured data scale up customers at a much faster rate this quarter, that what we saw in the previous year-over-year quarter. So, good stuff happening all the way around in not meaning to ignore anyone in particular. Yeah, overall deal size, where we were very pleased with what we saw on deal size now. Obviously, Q1 of last year, we were fortunate to get some really large deals, in part due to folks working on mission critical and addressing their needs on that front in terms of work for home. So, I would say that the significant larger deals were a little bit less this quarter, but I was really pleased with the balance we saw, you know, multitude of deals over a million dollars. So, nothing to highlight, you know, in terms of significance, other than it was broad based across the board. And in terms of what we saw in lesser larger deals that we saw. It's a great question, Shannon and I'll start off. Look, our first big milestone that we're looking at is 50% of our revenue. It would be the big next milestone for us. And look, at the end of the day, though, it's still customer first in terms of what they prefer, with flexibility. So, we won't force a particular model on them in terms of how they want to consume our technology and drive their outcomes.  But I do think 50% is a good target for us to have longer-term in terms of recurring revenue, especially with what we're seeing with the momentum around evergreen and Pure as-a-Service with our unified subscription coming on board, as we've talked about, with Cloud Block Store, both AWS and Azure I really will complement that, and then following that, and we've talked about that as well, which is Portworx, and our solutions around modern apps. Anything else you'd want to add, Charlie? Okay. Definitely. Yeah, that'd be a couple years out and how we're looking at that. And we'll give some more details on that in our Analyst Day, which we're contemplating in the month of September. Thank you, Shannon. Katie, it's really much more of the latter that you articulated. And really, if this was just a NAND that we were looking at, I think we would follow that thesis perfectly in terms of how we think about NAND pricing be able to pass that off. But look, I think the issues we're seeing around the supply chain are much broader. And there's really, you know, broader, general inflationary concerns that we've talked about at a component level. I mean, the smallest components are driving, you know, our supply chain team, with a lot of work. And we do have inflation there. Now, the interesting thing in Q1 is we were successful, generally around increasing our ASPs. And I do think in part that's due to the inflation that we were seeing. The question is, can we maintain that with the broader supply chain constraints that we're seeing, and that remains to be seen. You know, obviously, we're confident in terms of our Q2 outlook, but that is the reason why we were only, you know, talking about taking half of our over achievement for operating profit for the annual view. Thank you, Katie."

With that, I'll turn it over to Charlie.\nCharlie Giancarlo: Thank you, Paul. Hello, everyone, and welcome to our Q4 and fiscal year 2023 call. We were pleased with our Q4 year-over-year revenue growth of 14% and we're very pleased with our annual revenue growth of 26% and annual subscription ARR growth of 30%, especially considering the challenges of the steadily increasing global economic slowdown. Revenue growth, operating leverage and operating discipline helped drive strong annual profit and cash flow in FY 2023, with operating cash flow up over 85%, and non-GAAP operating income up almost 100% for the full year. We achieved solid growth as we continue to take share driven by our best-in-class portfolio of products and services, our innovative Evergreen business model and leading customer centricity proven by our industry-leading Net Promoter Score. In FY 2023, we expanded our core product offerings with the new FlashBlade//S through our Fusion and Portworx Data Services offerings. We also expanded our as-a-service offerings, adding more service tiers and SLA guarantees to Evergreen//One and extending our as-a-Service model across the full suite of Portworx solutions. Pure's sustainable competitive advantage lies in our highly consistent product lines, all based on our Purity operating system, direct flash modules, Pure1 cloud management and Evergreen subscription model. Competitors have tried for years to imitate our differentiated Evergreen business model, but have been unable to deliver the combined benefits of continual non-disruptive upgrades and forever flash through a transparent and flat and fair subscription agreement. Pure, for the first time, had a presence at the World Economic Forum in Davos this past January. The largest topics at Davos this year were the war over Ukraine, digital currencies and sustainability. Our participation focused on promoting the important role that Pure will play in reducing technologies and IT's demand for energy and its production of e-waste. Just prior to the event, the World Economic Forum produced a study stating that digital electronics of all types contribute 4% to 5% of all carbon emissions. Other studies identify that data center is used between 1% and 2% of all electrical power generated in the world. It is further estimated that data storage accounts for 20% to 25% of data center power usage, increasing to as much as 40% by the end of the decade. The vast majority of data centers over 80% remains trapped on magnetic hard disks. As we have stated for the past year, Pure's flash-optimized systems generally use between 2x and 5x less power than competitive SSD-based systems and between 5x and 10x less power than the hard disk systems we replace. Simple math then shows that replacing that 80% of hard disk storage and data centers with Pure's flash-based storage can reduce total data center power utilization by approximately 20%. That same math shows that both data center space and e-waste would also be reduced by similar amounts with reduced labor costs and increased reliability as additional benefits. Reducing the world's data center power, space and e-waste by 20% is a very significant reduction in the world of sustainability and needs to be recognized and amplified. This opportunity is resonating not only within the highly specialized field of IT data storage teams, but now also with the entire C-suite, including CIOs, CFOs and even CEOs. While our product and technology leadership remains the primary reason by which customers select Pure, the competitive sustainability of our products continues to grow in importance with customers. In Q4, we saw more customers citing energy efficiency as a reason they chose Pure than in any previous quarter-to-date. Beyond just the environmental benefits we provide, customers are increasingly compelled by their ability to get more out of their storage at a lower total cost of ownership, given the backdrop of increasing energy prices. This simple step of replacing hard disk with Pure's flash-optimized storage has significant benefits to any organization but has been out of reach economically for the majority of secondary tier data because of the higher cost of solid-state flash technology compared to the lowest cost hard disk drives. Large, unstructured data repositories continue to be dominated by 7,200 RPM disks, despite their difficulty to manage, relatively low reliability and their substantial power, space and cooling needs, because superior all-flash systems were too expensive. Well, I'm pleased to announce that our founders' vision of the all-flash data center is finally here. And the days of hard disk dominance of data are coming to a close. Today, Pure announced FlashBlade//E, a scale-out, unstructured data repository built for large capacity data stores, which provides a lower total operating costs compared to secondary tier disk. FlashBlade//E will ship late this quarter. FlashBlade//E will be priced under $0.20 per gigabyte at a system level and costs even less when measured on effective capacity. Let me repeat that. FlashBlade//E will be priced under $0.20 per gigabyte at a system level, inclusive of the first three years of subscription, which directly competes with lower performance all hard disk systems. And operating costs for FlashBlade//E are significantly lower than the hard disk systems that it will replaced with its 5x to 10x reduction in cost for power, space, cooling and labor. FlashBlade//E, the second in our series of cost-optimized products after FlashArray//C opens up a massive new opportunity for us and allows us to expand further into our total available market. FlashBlade//E enables Pure to significantly penetrate many segments of the storage market currently dominated by disc, which has been inaccessible to Pure until now. FlashBlade//E is a perfect example of how we are investing our R&D dollars in a focused and strategic manner to maximize long-term growth opportunities in one of the world's largest IT categories. We are extremely excited about how this new product complements our innovative portfolio and strengthens our opportunity to drive Pure's growth over the long-term. While we are excited about the prospects for our products and the competitiveness of our organization, we are also well aware of the challenges of the current economic environment and the strains that it places on our customers. Since our Q2 earnings call, we have discussed seeing instances of longer sales cycles and caution with large purchases, especially in the enterprise segment. As expected, these conditions continued through Q4 and close rates of our advanced stage deals continue to be consistent with the earlier quarters. While we were able to generate considerable new opportunities and pipeline during Q4, the development and progression of these new opportunities slowed substantially, especially in our enterprise segment. This recent slowdown in customers' purchasing expectations in conjunction with heightened concerns around further tightening monetary actions by the Fed and other central banks and governments, has impacted our growth outlook for the coming year. We also believe that our successful sales motion over the last few years will need to adapt to the additional scrutiny that customers are now placing on purchases. We are, therefore, adjusting our sales motion for the additional economic analysis that customers need to justify purchases with tightened budgets. In particular, focusing our efforts on steps our customers can take to reduce their costs, both capital as well as operational while improving their human productivity. Evergreen One, FlashBlade//E and FlashArray//C will all play a large role in this new economy. We have high confidence in our long-term growth and strategy but have made operational changes for what we believe will be near-term economic headwinds. We have already taken action to reduce spending across the company and have reduced our spending in budgetary growth plans for FY2024 until we see improvements in the environment. As Kevin will cover in a few moments, we are maintaining our operating margin guidance for FY2024 even after taking into account lower revenue growth expectations than previously anticipated. We are very excited about the innovations we delivered in the year and are particularly excited about the introduction of FlashBlade//E, which will further fuel our ability to make the all-flash data center a reality, a benefit for both our customers and our planet. We expect to continue to be share takers in FY2024. What we provide in terms of energy efficiency, total cost of ownership and best-in-class technology strongly resonates with our customers, especially in the current environment where organizations need to do more with less. Despite the lower-than-anticipated revenue guide for fiscal year 2024, we are confident that we will continue to grow faster than the overall storage market and continue to take share from our key competitors. We will continue to lead the market in meaningful innovation in data storage and management. We will increase our relevance and opportunities with the world's largest technology companies, and we will further leverage our leadership position to accelerate the drive to the all-flash data center. I'll now turn it over to Kevan to cover our financial performance and outlook in more detail.\nKevan Krysler: Thank you, Charlie, and good afternoon. We delivered strong financial results in Q4, with revenue growing 14% and operating margin of 19.6% while navigating the increased challenges of the macroeconomic environment. Also as a reminder for comparability, our Q4 last year included an additional week of revenue and expenses. For the year, we grew revenue 26% to $2.8 billion and substantially expanded our operating margins from 10.8% to 16.6%. Subscription annual recurring revenue or subscription ARR continues to be strong, exceeding $1.1 billion, up 30% year-over-year. Evergreen//One once again represented a key driver of our subscription ARR growth in Q4 and resonate strongly with customers as they navigate tighter IT budgets without having to compromise performance and value. Also consistent with last year, our subscription net dollar retention or NDR at the end of the year exceeded 120% compared to our long-term target of 15% as a result of expansion from existing customers. Remaining performance obligations, or RPO, grew 24% to $1.8 billion. Similar to the remarks we've made in previous quarters, our RPO growth is impacted by product shipments for an outstanding commitment with one of our global system integrators. Excluding these product shipments, RPO grew 28% year-over-year. Our headcount increased to approximately 5,100 employees. As the macro backdrop persists, our investment in incremental headcount next year will be focused on quota-carrying and critical business hires. International revenue in Q4 grew 39% to $258 million and U.S. revenue of $552 million grew 6% year-over-year. U.S. revenue growth reflects caution in IT spending that customers are exercising most notably in the Enterprise segment. Q4 product revenue grew 11% and subscription services revenue increased 23% year-over-year and comprised approximately one-third of total revenue for the quarter. Adjusting for the extra week in Q4 last year, subscription services revenue would have grown 31% year-over-year. We acquired approximately 490 new customers during the quarter, which was strong despite the challenges of the macro backdrop. Contributions from both product and subscription services gross margins continued to be strong as total gross margins were nearly 71% in Q4. And we expect that product margins will continue to be resilient, benefiting from our ability to leverage raw flash and our increasing mix of QLC flash. We are also pleased with the strength of subscription services gross margin of 74% for the quarter and nearly 73% for the year, driven by increasing efficiencies as we grow and scale our Evergreen subscription offerings. We remain focused on profitability as reflected in our strong Q4 operating profit of nearly $160 million and operating margin of 19.6%. We are very pleased with our substantial operating margin expansion this year, and we will continue to be very focused on our spending. Approximately two points of our operating margin in FY2023 was attributable to tailwinds that we do not expect will occur next year. This included higher attrition and slower-than-planned hiring that we experienced during the first half of FY2023 as well as lower-than-expected sales costs in Q4. We have a very strong balance sheet that includes approximately $1.6 billion in cash and investments. We generated significant cash flows from operations during the quarter of approximately $230 million and approximately $770 million for the year as a result of strong collections and increasing profits. Capital expenditures in Q4 were $60 million and during the year represented approximately 6% of revenue. Factors driving our higher capital expenditures include the strength of our Evergreen//One solution as well as test systems for our new product offerings. In Q4, we repurchased over 2.4 million shares of stock, returning approximately $67.5 million to our shareholders. For the year, we repurchased approximately 7.8 million shares, returning nearly $219 million in capital to our shareholders. We have approximately $31 million remaining on our existing $250 million repurchase authorization, and we are announcing today a new share repurchase authorization of an additional $250 million. Turning to revenue guidance for FY2024. We believe the current macro uncertainties will continue to persist, creating headwinds to enterprise IT spending. And as such, we expect revenue growth to be in the mid to high-single digits. This revenue guidance considers the macro backdrop and uncertainties that we are currently seeing today. As Charlie mentioned, the progression of new and early-stage sales opportunities are taking a longer period of time to close due to increased customer diligence, approvals and tightening budgets. We expect this to continue through FY2024 with some moderation later in the year as our sales teams adjust their selling motions to more closely align with evolving customer buying motions. During Q4, we did not receive new product orders for Meta and this is reflected in our forecasted growth rate for next year. Also, our FY2024 revenue guidance assumes a modest ramp during the second half of the year from sales of our newest FlashBlade//E offering. Turning to operating margin guidance for FY2024. We remain very focused on profitable growth while continuing to support our highest, long-term growth opportunities, such as our announcement today of FlashBlade//E. As a reminder, last quarter, we shared a preliminary view of operating margins in the range of 14% to 15% for FY2024. At the time, our preliminary view contemplated key considerations, including higher revenue growth assumptions. With our expectations of slower revenue growth, we adjusted our spending budgets for next year to align with an expected operating margin of 15%, representing the high end of the range of our preliminary view. We expect to achieve this operating margin by exercising strong focus and discipline on both hiring and spend management. Now turning to revenue guidance for Q1. As we have mentioned on multiple occasions in prior earnings calls, Q1 of last year reflected $60 million of product revenue impacting seasonality as this revenue had been contemplated for the second half of FY2023. Excluding the seasonality impact to product revenue of $60 million, we expect that Q1 revenue this year will be flat at $560 million when compared to Q1 of last year. Our Q1 revenue guide of $560 million takes into consideration that newer, early-stage opportunities will require a longer period of time to close. Again, we expect this impact will moderate later in the year. While we are confident and committed to achieving 15% operating margin for the year, we expect that our operating profit in Q1 will be approximately $10 million. Operating profit in Q1 reflects a significant investment for our first in-person sales kickoff event since 2020 as well as higher costs as a result of our planned hiring in both Q3 and Q4 of last year. In closing, I\u2019d like to thank our customers, partners and employees for an incredibly strong FY2023. Although the current macro backdrop presents its challenges, Pure is uniquely positioned to help our customers navigate these challenges, leveraging our innovative, high-performance solutions while providing financial flexibility through Evergreen and reducing total cost of ownership and energy consumption. As we look forward, we are confident in our strategy and ability to continue taking market share and deliver strong operating margin of 15% in FY2024. With that, I will turn it to Paul for Q&A.\nPaul Ziots: Thanks, Kevan. Before we begin the Q&A session, I\u2019ll ask you to please limit yourselves to one question consisting of one part so we can get to as many people as possible. If you have additional questions, we kindly ask that you please rejoin the queue, and we\u2019ll be happy to take those additional questions if time allows. Operator, let\u2019s get started.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question for today comes from Amit Daryanani of Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nAmit Daryanani: Thanks for taking my question. I guess there\u2019ll be a fair bit of focus on this fiscal 2024 revenue guide for mid to high-single digit growth. I think last quarter, you can obviously give a formal guide but I think the expectation would be around double-digit growth or thereabouts. So I\u2019d love to understand what\u2019s changed in the last 90 days? And to the extent you can talk about how much of this guide adjustment is due to macro worries versus perhaps something that\u2019s more company specific? Do we worry about competition or share gain trajectory kind of slowing that? I\u2019d love to understand the downtick you\u2019re seeing, how much is macro versus company specific that would be really helpful. Thank you.\nCharlie Giancarlo: Thanks, Amit. Absolutely. This is Charlie. Good to hear from you. First, let\u2019s just say that as we went into last quarter, we were expecting double-digit for Q4, and we were able to deliver on that and feel really proud about the team and what they\u2019re able to do. And that really represented the \u2013 a good close rate of our advanced stage opportunities, which continued through the quarter. What did change is, especially as we came into the new calendar year, was a slowing down of progression of the pipeline of the staged opportunities, meaning the progression that we had typically seen in earlier quarters of movement from early stage to later stage in the progression. That has slowed down since the beginning of the year. And we have to assume that, that will be true for at least a couple of quarters going forward. And so that\u2019s changed the outlook, if you will, for the year as we go forward. That being said, we\u2019re positive on the year overall, we\u2019re positive on our competitiveness in the market. What \u2013 the other thing that\u2019s perhaps changed is that we do notice a change in the way that the customers are evaluating their purchases, a lot more focus on economic analyses, especially on near-term operating costs. And that\u2019s \u2013 of course, we\u2019re responding to that now by changing the way our sales teams go about working with the customer on evaluating our products in a much more \u2013 much greater focus on near-term operational costs as a justification for making the choice to proceed forward with a project versus maybe other projects that they have in their consideration.\nPaul Ziots: Charlie, did you want to mention anything about the expectation to continue to gain share?\nCharlie Giancarlo: I think both Kevan and I mentioned that. But as we\u2019ve done certainly every year and almost every single quarter, we continue to gain share against our competitors. Everybody is affected by the macro. We\u2019re no different than that. But the goal is obviously to continue to outpace the rest of the field.\nPaul Ziots: Great. Thank you. Thank you, Amit. Next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Aaron Rakers of Wells Fargo. Aaron, your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nAaron Rakers: Yes. Thanks for taking the question guys. I just want to unpack the guidance a little bit in the current quarter and just understand what\u2019s implied subsequent to that. So the $560 million, it sounds like, obviously, adjusting for the item you had the year ago quarter, if I take that out of product revenue, it seems to imply an extremely sharp decline sequentially in the subscription revenue. So I guess \u2013 the first part of that is, is that necessarily how you\u2019re thinking about that? Or am I missing something that and why would subscription necessarily decline that much? And I guess, if I take at face value, the mid to high single digit for the year, to be even mid-single digit, the assumption would be is that your growth actually in the subsequent quarters looks like it\u2019s even high single or even double-digit of returning. So I\u2019m just curious how you kind of bridge the seasonality after the first quarter guide to get to that mid to high single-digit full year guide. Thank you.\nKevan Krysler: Aaron, this is Kevan. I appreciate the question. And you\u2019re right. With the first point, around the $60 million that really was seasonality and it really should be excluded in terms of how we\u2019re thinking about the comparability of product revenue. As that $60 million, if you recall where we had mentioned that on previous earnings calls was really planned for the second half of the year. So that\u2019s really impacting seasonality. So then after you adjust the $60 million, you still have for Q1 of last year a very strong year-over-year growth of 37%. So that does set up for a tough compare. And then the macro backdrop that Charlie mentioned and I mentioned, which really resulted in longer-than-expected sales progression of new and early opportunities did add additional headwind to that tough compare that we\u2019re thinking about specific to Q1. And that\u2019s what\u2019s leading to the Q1 revenue outlook of flat year-over-year when excluding the impact of seasonality. But look, it really does generally align in terms of seasonality when we think about Q1 and when we think about our overall guide for revenue in the mid to high single digits. It generally is aligning with our seasonality that we saw with FY2022. So we actually feel pretty comfortable with that.\nAaron Rakers: Yes. Okay. I think I was missing a point on the flash. Thank you.\nPaul Ziots: Yes. Thank you, Aaron. Next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Meta Marshall of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nMeta Marshall: Great. Thanks. Just on kind of some of the sales marketing changes that you guys are planning on making. Just when did you start making some of those changes as even last quarter, you would have started to kind of see some of this cost sensitivity. And just kind of what gives you confidence that those changes will be kind of impactful towards the back half of the fiscal year? Thanks.\nCharlie Giancarlo: Yes. Thank you, Meta. Well, you\u2019re correct. I mean, obviously, as we proceeded from Q3 into Q4, we knew that economic concerns would be higher. And we started adding some additional training to the sales force. We do have next week our first full in-person sales kickoff in three years since 2020 and a lot of what we\u2019ve done is prepare the training for that for this new economic reality. So we\u2019ve had enough forewarning, if you will, and we planned early enough so that the way that the training is working out for our sales kickoff is going to be very much in the mode of selling and creating value propositions in an environment where customers are much more focused on near-term cost savings rather than, let\u2019s say, long-term advantage or long-term cost savings. So that\u2019s a clear change in the training that we\u2019re putting in place in our field.\nKevan Krysler: Yes. I think that\u2019s a great point, Charlie. And maybe what we can add to is our thoughts around Pure\u2019s unique positioning even in this environment and then connecting that with the field as well, which I think is going to be really important.\nCharlie Giancarlo: While our development of FlashBlade//E was not done in anticipation of a recession, it couldn\u2019t come at a better time. It\u2019s operating costs well below the operating cost of a hard disk environment that it will be replacing. And Evergreen//One, we should mention Evergreen//One. We did see significant increase in Evergreen//One versus capital purchases. Last quarter, every time we see some economic slowdown, whether it was the early COVID days or now this, we see a pickup in interest in Evergreen//One. So we\u2019ve already seen that, and we can expect that, I think, for the next several quarters. That will have both short-term and long-term effects, overall good for the company but a transition to Evergreen//One from a capital also has immediate reduction of the revenue line.\nKevan Krysler: Yes. That\u2019s great. And I\u2019d add a couple more to that as well, which is FlashArray//C continues to get traction and really is resonating with customers in this environment. And we introduced last year Evergreen//Flex, which is starting to pick up some traction and interest as well, and we do expect some more momentum on that front. But really, what it\u2019s getting at is that we\u2019ve got a lot of solutions for our customers that provide a lot of flexibility both in terms of consumption and financial. And I think that\u2019s really going to resonate with customers as we navigate this environment.\nPaul Ziots: Thank you, Meta. Next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Sidney Ho of Deutsche Bank. Sidney, your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nSidney Ho: Great. Thank you for taking the question. First of all, I want to clarify to an earlier answer to the earlier question. In your fiscal first quarter guidance, what are you expecting for your subscription services revenue to do on a year-over-year basis? And maybe I\u2019ll ask a follow-up question here is the subscription ARR has been growing quite steadily at 30% a year, how does that growth rate change, if any, if the hardware sales slowdown in the near-term. Is there a lacking effect that we should consider? That\u2019s my follow-up. Thanks.\nKevan Krysler: Yes, it\u2019s a great question. This is Kevan again. Look, we\u2019ve been very pleased, obviously, with the strength of our subscription business. You see that again in our subscription ARR growth rate. We see that continuing to be strong as we progress through the year. Charlie pointed out the strength that we saw in Evergreen//One in Q3 and Q4 of last year. We expect that to continue. So that\u2019s going to be a benefit for us as we continue to navigate. And look, I do expect that overall, our renewals of Evergreen solutions will continue to be very strong. During this time, customers are valuing in a significant way the ability to have their solutions and peer solutions modernized through the Evergreen offerings. And so we do expect that to continue to be strong, offset somewhat slightly by the attach of Evergreen to new product given the slowdown that we\u2019ve communicated.\nPaul Ziots: Thank you, Sidney. Next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Wamsi Mohan from Bank of America. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nWamsi Mohan: Yes. Thank you so much. Charlie, these growth rates are some of the lowest that Pure has seen, probably just excluding COVID and that was a very, very difficult, uncertain economic environment and now you\u2019re guiding fiscal 2024 at the low end, maybe 2, 3 points about those growth rates. How can we get confidence that this is purely just macro when these growth rates are historically something that you\u2019ve well outperformed taking massive amounts of share historically. Is there something happening either between pricing or between your ability to take incremental share? I mean you\u2019re arguably $1 billion \u2013 $1.2 billion larger company [indiscernible]. So what are the different factors that we should be thinking about especially with respect to NAND flash drives share and just the ability to take incremental share?\nCharlie Giancarlo: Yes. Wamsi, thank you. We have consistently grown roughly 10% to 15% higher than our competition than the market as a whole on an annual basis. Obviously, every quarter is a little bit different. But on an annual basis, 10% to 15%, I expect that this year as well. It\u2019s just a measure \u2013 a matter of calling out the overall market as a whole. I think that we also are not forecasting Meta because we don\u2019t forecast until we get an actual order, and that obviously had an effect on both of our last two years. And we do have significant large high-tech customers. And as others have reported, those are down a bit, but they always come back. So on \u2013 I was \u2013 I think everyone on this call knows that I look at this business on a long-term basis. I have no loss of confidence. I am every bit as confident about our long-term projections as I\u2019ve had in quarters and years past. Evergreen \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, FlashBlade//E, I think, is going to be a barn burner. Obviously, we\u2019re just getting it started, and it\u2019s going to be early days. But it opens up a major new part of the market for us. Our field teams have been strong year in and year out, and we\u2019re only making them stronger with some of the new programs we\u2019re putting in place for this fiscal year in our sales kickoff that will be next week. So no loss of confidence in terms of our overall ability to perform, but we are facing a very uncertain year as is everybody else on a variety of fronts. And as we \u2013 hopefully, as we go through the year, we\u2019ll pick up confidence as we go along.\nKevan Krysler: Yes. Wamsi, I think the only thing I would add to Charlie\u2019s answer is the strength we\u2019re seeing on Evergreen//One and Evergreen//Flex is significant and is really resonating with our customer base. And obviously, if that mix changes significantly, that would have a short-term headwind on revenue as well. So that\u2019s another factor to be considering when you\u2019re thinking about our guide and outlook for revenue next year.\nPaul Ziots: Thank you, Wamsi. Next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Pinjalim Bora of JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nPinjalim Bora: Hey guys, thanks for taking the question. I wanted to go back to the guidance just [ph] one more time. Maybe talk about the assumptions behind, it seems like your pipeline is good. Is it mainly a factor of the close rates that\u2019s kind of driving then are you expecting to the last point that you made a higher shift towards Evergreen//One or subscriptions that might put potential pressure? Is that baked into the guidance?\nCharlie Giancarlo: Certainly, more Evergreen//One relative to the overall is baked into the guidance. As we mentioned, we\u2019re not including Meta at all. What we did see that was a significant shift was the amount of time it takes to go from early stage opportunity in the pipeline to a later stage in the pipeline. The close rates of later stage have been consistent, I would say. But it\u2019s that progression as you go through a pipeline funnel that\u2019s taking longer.\nKevan Krysler: And then I would add on to that, just that we\u2019re also contemplating a moderate second half ramp of FlashBlade//E as well. And we do expect that to ramp in a manner similar to what we saw with FlashArray//C.\nPaul Ziots: Thank you, Pinjalim. Next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question from today comes from Nehal Chokshi of Northland Capital Markets. Your line is now. Please go ahead.\nNehal Chokshi: Yes. Thank you. Incredible free cash flow margin quarter and year, you\u2019re now at 20% plus free cash flow margin. Your last Analyst Day implied expect to get to a Rule of 40 benchmark in due course, which at this free cash flow margin would require about 20% overall growth rate. So the question is that do you believe you\u2019re already there if it was not for a macroeconomic impact?\nKevan Krysler: Thanks, Nehal. And it\u2019s a great question and obviously made great progress really across the board in terms of performance on both the expansion of our operating margin as well as free cash flow. And yes, you\u2019re right. I do think the headwinds that will navigate associated with the macro backdrop would be the one factor, which has been driving our outlook, our near-term outlook for FY 2024 for revenue growth. But when we think about our free cash flow performance, we\u2019re very pleased with that. And we do believe that we\u2019ll continue to outpace our free cash flow margin. We\u2019ll continue to outpace our operating margin slightly. Now we will have some pressure, if you will, due to the lower outlook growth for product revenue, which will have some impact on that as well as continued strength of Evergreen//One which will add to our CapEx needs as we continue to expand. But overall, really happy with the direction we\u2019re headed in.\nPaul Ziots: Thank you, Nehal. Great. Next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Simon Leopold from Raymond James. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nSimon Leopold: Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to see if maybe you could address a longer-term opportunity around artificial intelligence and machine learning. I think that was sort of the root of the use case for Meta. And wondering, particularly with the introduction of the E platform for unstructured data, how we should think about that particular use case broadly affecting Pure Storage over the longer term? Thank you.\nRob Lee: Yes, Simon, this is Rob. I\u2019ll take that one. So yes, I mean, certainly, as we\u2019ve talked about in prior calls, the broader space of analytics and AI continues to be a strong one for us, certainly with Meta, but also the broader customer base. And then certainly, within the last several months, a lot of news in that space around new developments, generative AI technology, so on and so forth. Look, at the end of the day, we very much believe that this entire space of technology is extremely dependent on data, on very large corpuses of data. And if you step back and you look at where our customers are largely housing those sets of data today all together, way too often, it\u2019s sitting in bulk repositories trapped on very, very inefficient pools of disk. And this is precisely the opportunity that we developed FlashBlade//E to go and attack. And so I think, we feel long term that this is a \u2013 it does present a very significant the bulk data space overall, and certainly the focus of AI to go and capitalize on those sets of data presents a very significant opportunity for us. And we\u2019re going to go pursue that very aggressively as we\u2019re now really the only ones that are going to be able to take flash technology and go and modernize those environments.\nCharlie Giancarlo: Yes, and Simon, I might add on to that. The listeners may recall that the Meta architecture was FlashBlade for the high performance side which was approximately in terms of bytes stored about 10% of the bytes stored. And then FlashArray//C for 90% of the bytes stored, which are let\u2019s say in hot standby, the \u2013 with FlashBlade providing the high performance side of it and the FlashArray//C providing the warm storage for data that\u2019s about to be processed. Well, what we see with FlashBlade//E is the opportunity to expand that even further. So it\u2019s a great architectural, we have to provide both performance and then lower cost for the warm tier. And so, we can get into an all flash environment as well as an all pure environment in these customers, rather than having to have a high performance tier that\u2019s flash, and then a lower performance, lower cost tier that\u2019s hard disk.\nPaul Ziots: Thank you, Simon.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thank you.\nPaul Ziots: Next question, please?\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Sheerin of Stifel. Matt, your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nMatt Sheerin: Yes, thank you. I had another question regarding your strong free cash flow beyond the incremental buyback you announced today. How should we think about your use of cash and specifically on M&A? Do you continue to see opportunities there?\nKevan Krysler: We\u2019re always evaluating M&A as we should and we want to make sure that we always have enough cash in reserve to be able to make, especially tuck-ins, but small M&A acquisitions. Obviously, if we were to consider a larger one that would probably require a more complex transaction. But yes, we continue to consider M&A. And we think that as you know, the current venture environment starts to become much more let\u2019s say reasonable in terms of expectations. Those types of opportunities will come up a bit more often. I will say, however, that we are extremely fortunate as a company and being very rich in organic opportunities, and that continues to be our preference.\nCharlie Giancarlo: And Matt, one other point just to raise in terms of use of cash. Obviously, we\u2019ve got our converts coming up for maturity and use of cash will be contemplated as we work through that as well in April. So another consideration there.\nPaul Ziots: Thank you, Matt. Next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Tim Long of Barclays. Tim, your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nGeorge Wang: Hey guys. It\u2019s actually George Wang on for Tim Long. Just to have a couple of questions. First of all maybe you can kind of unpack give some update on the telco customers. In prior quarters, you guys talk about opportunities kind of for shipping to telco customers for the 5G deployment. Just curious if you have any latest update on this particular vertical?\nCharlie Giancarlo: I don\u2019t have any to call out, but we did have 5G shipments in the quarter. And it continues to be an area of strong focus and attention for us. We are \u2013 we do have a presence in Barcelona this week and getting a fair amount of attention there.\nPaul Ziots: Thank you, George. Next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from a Krish Sankar from Cowen. Krish, your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hey guys. This is Eddie [ph] for Krish. Thanks for taking my question. Are you contemplating any impact from lower NAND prices on your ASPs in your fiscal 2024 guidance? And I have a follow up, please.\nCharlie Giancarlo: Let me start with that, and then Kevan maybe can provide some additional color. There\u2019s always ASP effect from pricing on flash. As you know, we operate in a market where the price per gigabyte generally declines every year. And that\u2019s good for us because it allows us to penetrate increasingly the disk market. That being said, I would say that currently we expect to take advantage of what has been some lower NAND prices. And as callers who \u2013 or people who have followed us know, we tend to have an advantage in timing with early reductions in NAND pricing. And then eventually gets follows through to the rest of the market. And then, it comes back into equilibrium. But I think overall, the pricing of NAND is going to operate to our favor as we go through the year.\nKevan Krysler: Ye. And I think that\u2019s without a doubt, Charlie. ASPs continue to be strong. It's certainly going to give us \u2013 the NAND pricing will give us a significant advantage as we move out and aggressively market FlashBlade//E as well as FlashArray//C. So when we think about it in terms of product gross margins, we do consider that as an overall favorable factor for us as we navigate through next year. And again, to Charlie's point, it's all about us being able to take a full advantage of raw NAND and flash instead of our competitors who are having to still rely on SSD drives. But we do expect some balance with the favorability we'll get on NAND, again, given the aggressive nature will pursue FlashBlade//E and FlashArray//C.\nPaul Ziots: And Krish, [indiscernible] request. I would like to ask if you'd please get back in queue, and hopefully we'll have time to take your second question. Thank you very much. Next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Eric Martinuzzi of Lake Street. Eric, your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nEric Martinuzzi: Yes, I wanted to get some color just sort of a month-by-month basis. The Q4 linearity and then with February in the book, obviously you had already had November in the books when you talked about the Q4 guide. But when you started to see the slowdown, was that in December? Was that in January? And then if you could characterize the advancement through the pipeline of February versus January?\nCharlie Giancarlo: Yes. I would say that it was most noticeable as we turned the year \u2013 the calendar year that is. As we mentioned, we are able to close the advanced stage deals and as we went into the New Year, and to some extent I feel that it's probably had to do with the resetting of budgets by our customers as they enter their new \u2013 most customers obviously are operating on a calendar year basis. That as they entered their New Year, perhaps it's reconsideration or perhaps they're going into a planning mode that may be slowing things down or perhaps it may be simply a tighter budget being held to tighter budget restrictions or doing greater analysis little bit we're still trying to diagnose this. I would say it's very hard to say in the first few weeks of February in the sense that as I said, we're having our sales kick-off, all of the new quota and territory assignments are going out. So it's a little bit hard for us to get intelligence in the first few weeks of the fiscal year. But by going through the last month of the \u2013 of last fiscal year, that was when we really started to see this effect.\nKevan Krysler: Yes. And Eric, I'm going to add on to this a little bit. So I think a couple of takeaways when we think about how things develop through Q4 and then obviously up and through to what we're talking to you today. As Charlie mentioned, our conversion of advanced stage opportunities were actually consistent with what we've historically seen. So I view that as a significant positive as we think about navigating through Q4. The other significant positive for us is we saw strong volume of new opportunities through Q4. Really, what the change was is really that to Charlie's point that the sales progression of those new opportunities and early-stage opportunities that's what substantially slowed down, and that's what we saw really in January and February, which is giving rise to the outlook that we're providing to you today.\nEric Martinuzzi: Got it. Thanks.\nPaul Ziots: Thank you, Eric. Next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from David Vogt of UBS. David, your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nDavid Vogt: Great. Thank you, guys. I just want to go back to the guidance and not to belabor the point. But presumably, the $60 million in the first quarter last year that was pulled forward, a large percentage of that would have fallen in the fourth quarter. And so if I make that adjustment, it sounds like your 1Q guide is about 4 to 5 points below seasonal. And if that's the case, would you need to have mid-teens growth in the second half if you follow sort of normal seasonality in the second quarter off of 1Q?\nKevan Krysler: Yes. I think it's a great question. And I think you're thinking about the $60 million, right, although I would clarify that a little bit. I would put that more in the second half category. So Q3, Q4, I wouldn't put that all into Q4. Seasonality Q1-to-Q1 a little bit of pressure as we think about it. But again, that's really as a result of the sales progression of these early opportunities in early stage that we've highlighted on multiple occasions. I think our assumption is that that will start to moderate somewhat as we progress through the year. In addition to that, we're layering on some moderate contribution for FlashBlade//E in the second half as well.\nPaul Ziots: Thank you David. Next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ashley Ellis from Credit Suisse. Ashley, your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nAshley Ellis: Hi. Thank you for taking my question. I was wondering, could you discuss a little bit more of the changes you're making in go-to-market? Is this just kind of a change in the pitch? Are you making any structural changes? And then is it primarily given the weaker macro customers taking longer to make a decision? Or are you seeing some incremental competitive pressures that are making you change the way you want to approach customers? Thanks.\nCharlie Giancarlo: Yes. I'll start with the second part. We're not seeing any different behavior by the competitors. So we're not seeing additional competitive pressures. Win rates are holding basically steady. So no concern there. It's changing both the pitch, but also we're not making \u2013 the second part was we're not making any major structural changes to the sales force either. So no major changes there.  We are introducing a lot more training and enablement, but this has been on the books now for quite some time as well as more detailed information all the way down to the DM level so they can manage their operations better. We are expecting to see improvement in that overall. As you might imagine, during times like this inspection gets tighter. And so we are planning for some much more detailed inspection of deals, especially as they progress through the different stages of the pipeline as you might imagine given this new environment. But outside of that, I would say it's just general, improvement in general operational discipline and things, as I mentioned, that have been on the books for a while. \nRob Lee: I'll add one thing to that, which is, I think we are, as we work with the sales teams coming to our sale kick-off next week. I'm really going to be working with them to highlight the cost savings benefits of our products and services and so whether that's with FlashArray//C, the new FlashBlade//E and really just the potential that offers customers go and reduce their operating costs, their energy costs, their footprint, highlighting the benefits of the entire Evergreen portfolio, but specifically, as we look at Evergreen//One, Evergreen//Flex to create that optionality and flexibility for customers. That's an area we're going to be really focusing on articulating the benefits of the portfolio. \nPaul Ziots: Thank you, Ashley. And it looks like we have time for one more question. And I think the last question is from a person who's rejoined the queue. So the last question, please. \nOperator: Thank you. Our final question for today comes from Aaron Rakers of Wells Fargo. Aaron, your line is now open. Please go ahead. \nAaron Rakers: Yes. I'll just ask a real quick follow-up. On the FlashBlade//E product as you think about the engagement. Somebody asked, I think Simon asked about AI earlier in the call, I'm just curious of how your dialogue has evolved with other potential cloud opportunities, whether or not it's related to AI or bulk storage now that the E-Series product is out?\nCharlie Giancarlo: I'm going to give it a start, and then I'm going to invite Rob who's very engaged in those conversations. The interest level around energy and space savings is very high. There's always a question of doing it \u2013 that is in hyperscalers in particular, doing it internally versus using a vendor and a system level, but the conversations continue, which is very promising. I would say that outside of the three hyperscalers, the conversations in other, what you might call, cloud service providers and SaaS providers are very promising for both FlashArray//E [ph] as well as Pure Fusion, which is getting a lot of attention to enable these cloud service providers to operate much more like the hyperscalers in terms of the operations as well as being able to provide storage as a service to their customers. \nRob Lee: Yes. And I'll just add on to that, Aaron. I think the conversations we are having with the top hyperscalers definitely continue to progress. And certainly, the introduction \u2013 well, the continued success we're seeing in FlashArray//C in the last fiscal year. But now certainly with the introduction of FlashBlade//E, just further proof points highlighting our significant leadership position in being able to work directly with NAND flash. I think that really is having a positive effect for us as we go and pursue those early-stage conversations with the hyperscalers.  I think another factor potentially is that the ability for some of these firms to potentially go in try to address their needs directly is perhaps reduced. And so a little bit more willingness to kind of engage and see, hey, how can we go and help accelerate their plans to transition to flash. So net-net, all very positive. And certainly, the introduction of E is only going to move that along. \nPaul Ziots: Thank you, Aaron. Before we conclude, I think Charlie has a few final comments. \nCharlie Giancarlo: I want to thank you all for joining us on today's call. And I, of course, want to thank our employees for creating and driving our vision and constantly improving our operations and our culture. Thank you to our long-term investors for your support and being part of our mission. And special thanks to our customers and partners for continuing to choose Pure for their business, data storage and management needs. Goodbye all. \nOperator: Thank you. That concludes the Pure Storage Fourth Quarter Fiscal Year 2023 Earnings Conference Call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.",

            "name": "Charlie Giancarlo",
            "content": "Thank you, Paul. Hello, everyone, and welcome to our Q4 and fiscal year 2023 call. We were pleased with our Q4 year-over-year revenue growth of 14% and we're very pleased with our annual revenue growth of 26% and annual subscription ARR growth of 30%, especially considering the challenges of the steadily increasing global economic slowdown. Revenue growth, operating leverage and operating discipline helped drive strong annual profit and cash flow in FY 2023, with operating cash flow up over 85%, and non-GAAP operating income up almost 100% for the full year. We achieved solid growth as we continue to take share driven by our best-in-class portfolio of products and services, our innovative Evergreen business model and leading customer centricity proven by our industry-leading Net Promoter Score. In FY 2023, we expanded our core product offerings with the new FlashBlade//S through our Fusion and Portworx Data Services offerings. We also expanded our as-a-service offerings, adding more service tiers and SLA guarantees to Evergreen//One and extending our as-a-Service model across the full suite of Portworx solutions. Pure's sustainable competitive advantage lies in our highly consistent product lines, all based on our Purity operating system, direct flash modules, Pure1 cloud management and Evergreen subscription model. Competitors have tried for years to imitate our differentiated Evergreen business model, but have been unable to deliver the combined benefits of continual non-disruptive upgrades and forever flash through a transparent and flat and fair subscription agreement. Pure, for the first time, had a presence at the World Economic Forum in Davos this past January. The largest topics at Davos this year were the war over Ukraine, digital currencies and sustainability. Our participation focused on promoting the important role that Pure will play in reducing technologies and IT's demand for energy and its production of e-waste. Just prior to the event, the World Economic Forum produced a study stating that digital electronics of all types contribute 4% to 5% of all carbon emissions. Other studies identify that data center is used between 1% and 2% of all electrical power generated in the world. It is further estimated that data storage accounts for 20% to 25% of data center power usage, increasing to as much as 40% by the end of the decade. The vast majority of data centers over 80% remains trapped on magnetic hard disks. As we have stated for the past year, Pure's flash-optimized systems generally use between 2x and 5x less power than competitive SSD-based systems and between 5x and 10x less power than the hard disk systems we replace. Simple math then shows that replacing that 80% of hard disk storage and data centers with Pure's flash-based storage can reduce total data center power utilization by approximately 20%. That same math shows that both data center space and e-waste would also be reduced by similar amounts with reduced labor costs and increased reliability as additional benefits. Reducing the world's data center power, space and e-waste by 20% is a very significant reduction in the world of sustainability and needs to be recognized and amplified. This opportunity is resonating not only within the highly specialized field of IT data storage teams, but now also with the entire C-suite, including CIOs, CFOs and even CEOs. While our product and technology leadership remains the primary reason by which customers select Pure, the competitive sustainability of our products continues to grow in importance with customers. In Q4, we saw more customers citing energy efficiency as a reason they chose Pure than in any previous quarter-to-date. Beyond just the environmental benefits we provide, customers are increasingly compelled by their ability to get more out of their storage at a lower total cost of ownership, given the backdrop of increasing energy prices. This simple step of replacing hard disk with Pure's flash-optimized storage has significant benefits to any organization but has been out of reach economically for the majority of secondary tier data because of the higher cost of solid-state flash technology compared to the lowest cost hard disk drives. Large, unstructured data repositories continue to be dominated by 7,200 RPM disks, despite their difficulty to manage, relatively low reliability and their substantial power, space and cooling needs, because superior all-flash systems were too expensive. Well, I'm pleased to announce that our founders' vision of the all-flash data center is finally here. And the days of hard disk dominance of data are coming to a close. Today, Pure announced FlashBlade//E, a scale-out, unstructured data repository built for large capacity data stores, which provides a lower total operating costs compared to secondary tier disk. FlashBlade//E will ship late this quarter. FlashBlade//E will be priced under $0.20 per gigabyte at a system level and costs even less when measured on effective capacity. Let me repeat that. FlashBlade//E will be priced under $0.20 per gigabyte at a system level, inclusive of the first three years of subscription, which directly competes with lower performance all hard disk systems. And operating costs for FlashBlade//E are significantly lower than the hard disk systems that it will replaced with its 5x to 10x reduction in cost for power, space, cooling and labor. FlashBlade//E, the second in our series of cost-optimized products after FlashArray//C opens up a massive new opportunity for us and allows us to expand further into our total available market. FlashBlade//E enables Pure to significantly penetrate many segments of the storage market currently dominated by disc, which has been inaccessible to Pure until now. FlashBlade//E is a perfect example of how we are investing our R&D dollars in a focused and strategic manner to maximize long-term growth opportunities in one of the world's largest IT categories. We are extremely excited about how this new product complements our innovative portfolio and strengthens our opportunity to drive Pure's growth over the long-term. While we are excited about the prospects for our products and the competitiveness of our organization, we are also well aware of the challenges of the current economic environment and the strains that it places on our customers. Since our Q2 earnings call, we have discussed seeing instances of longer sales cycles and caution with large purchases, especially in the enterprise segment. As expected, these conditions continued through Q4 and close rates of our advanced stage deals continue to be consistent with the earlier quarters. While we were able to generate considerable new opportunities and pipeline during Q4, the development and progression of these new opportunities slowed substantially, especially in our enterprise segment. This recent slowdown in customers' purchasing expectations in conjunction with heightened concerns around further tightening monetary actions by the Fed and other central banks and governments, has impacted our growth outlook for the coming year. We also believe that our successful sales motion over the last few years will need to adapt to the additional scrutiny that customers are now placing on purchases. We are, therefore, adjusting our sales motion for the additional economic analysis that customers need to justify purchases with tightened budgets. In particular, focusing our efforts on steps our customers can take to reduce their costs, both capital as well as operational while improving their human productivity. Evergreen One, FlashBlade//E and FlashArray//C will all play a large role in this new economy. We have high confidence in our long-term growth and strategy but have made operational changes for what we believe will be near-term economic headwinds. We have already taken action to reduce spending across the company and have reduced our spending in budgetary growth plans for FY2024 until we see improvements in the environment. As Kevin will cover in a few moments, we are maintaining our operating margin guidance for FY2024 even after taking into account lower revenue growth expectations than previously anticipated. We are very excited about the innovations we delivered in the year and are particularly excited about the introduction of FlashBlade//E, which will further fuel our ability to make the all-flash data center a reality, a benefit for both our customers and our planet. We expect to continue to be share takers in FY2024. What we provide in terms of energy efficiency, total cost of ownership and best-in-class technology strongly resonates with our customers, especially in the current environment where organizations need to do more with less. Despite the lower-than-anticipated revenue guide for fiscal year 2024, we are confident that we will continue to grow faster than the overall storage market and continue to take share from our key competitors. We will continue to lead the market in meaningful innovation in data storage and management. We will increase our relevance and opportunities with the world's largest technology companies, and we will further leverage our leadership position to accelerate the drive to the all-flash data center. I'll now turn it over to Kevan to cover our financial performance and outlook in more detail. Thanks, Amit. Absolutely. This is Charlie. Good to hear from you. First, let's just say that as we went into last quarter, we were expecting double-digit for Q4, and we were able to deliver on that and feel really proud about the team and what they're able to do. And that really represented the \u2013 a good close rate of our advanced stage opportunities, which continued through the quarter. What did change is, especially as we came into the new calendar year, was a slowing down of progression of the pipeline of the staged opportunities, meaning the progression that we had typically seen in earlier quarters of movement from early stage to later stage in the progression. That has slowed down since the beginning of the year. And we have to assume that, that will be true for at least a couple of quarters going forward. And so that's changed the outlook, if you will, for the year as we go forward. That being said, we're positive on the year overall, we're positive on our competitiveness in the market. What \u2013 the other thing that's perhaps changed is that we do notice a change in the way that the customers are evaluating their purchases, a lot more focus on economic analyses, especially on near-term operating costs. And that's \u2013 of course, we're responding to that now by changing the way our sales teams go about working with the customer on evaluating our products in a much more \u2013 much greater focus on near-term operational costs as a justification for making the choice to proceed forward with a project versus maybe other projects that they have in their consideration. I think both Kevan and I mentioned that. But as we've done certainly every year and almost every single quarter, we continue to gain share against our competitors. Everybody is affected by the macro. We're no different than that. But the goal is obviously to continue to outpace the rest of the field. Yes. Thank you, Meta. Well, you're correct. I mean, obviously, as we proceeded from Q3 into Q4, we knew that economic concerns would be higher. And we started adding some additional training to the sales force. We do have next week our first full in-person sales kickoff in three years since 2020 and a lot of what we've done is prepare the training for that for this new economic reality. So we've had enough forewarning, if you will, and we planned early enough so that the way that the training is working out for our sales kickoff is going to be very much in the mode of selling and creating value propositions in an environment where customers are much more focused on near-term cost savings rather than, let's say, long-term advantage or long-term cost savings. So that's a clear change in the training that we're putting in place in our field. While our development of FlashBlade//E was not done in anticipation of a recession, it couldn't come at a better time. It's operating costs well below the operating cost of a hard disk environment that it will be replacing. And Evergreen//One, we should mention Evergreen//One. We did see significant increase in Evergreen//One versus capital purchases. Last quarter, every time we see some economic slowdown, whether it was the early COVID days or now this, we see a pickup in interest in Evergreen//One. So we've already seen that, and we can expect that, I think, for the next several quarters. That will have both short-term and long-term effects, overall good for the company but a transition to Evergreen//One from a capital also has immediate reduction of the revenue line. Yes. Wamsi, thank you. We have consistently grown roughly 10% to 15% higher than our competition than the market as a whole on an annual basis. Obviously, every quarter is a little bit different. But on an annual basis, 10% to 15%, I expect that this year as well. It's just a measure \u2013 a matter of calling out the overall market as a whole. I think that we also are not forecasting Meta because we don't forecast until we get an actual order, and that obviously had an effect on both of our last two years. And we do have significant large high-tech customers. And as others have reported, those are down a bit, but they always come back. So on \u2013 I was \u2013 I think everyone on this call knows that I look at this business on a long-term basis. I have no loss of confidence. I am every bit as confident about our long-term projections as I've had in quarters and years past. Evergreen \u2013 I'm sorry, FlashBlade//E, I think, is going to be a barn burner. Obviously, we're just getting it started, and it's going to be early days. But it opens up a major new part of the market for us. Our field teams have been strong year in and year out, and we're only making them stronger with some of the new programs we're putting in place for this fiscal year in our sales kickoff that will be next week. So no loss of confidence in terms of our overall ability to perform, but we are facing a very uncertain year as is everybody else on a variety of fronts. And as we \u2013 hopefully, as we go through the year, we'll pick up confidence as we go along. Certainly, more Evergreen//One relative to the overall is baked into the guidance. As we mentioned, we're not including Meta at all. What we did see that was a significant shift was the amount of time it takes to go from early stage opportunity in the pipeline to a later stage in the pipeline. The close rates of later stage have been consistent, I would say. But it's that progression as you go through a pipeline funnel that's taking longer. Yes, and Simon, I might add on to that. The listeners may recall that the Meta architecture was FlashBlade for the high performance side which was approximately in terms of bytes stored about 10% of the bytes stored. And then FlashArray//C for 90% of the bytes stored, which are let's say in hot standby, the \u2013 with FlashBlade providing the high performance side of it and the FlashArray//C providing the warm storage for data that's about to be processed. Well, what we see with FlashBlade//E is the opportunity to expand that even further. So it's a great architectural, we have to provide both performance and then lower cost for the warm tier. And so, we can get into an all flash environment as well as an all pure environment in these customers, rather than having to have a high performance tier that's flash, and then a lower performance, lower cost tier that's hard disk. And Matt, one other point just to raise in terms of use of cash. Obviously, we've got our converts coming up for maturity and use of cash will be contemplated as we work through that as well in April. So another consideration there. I don't have any to call out, but we did have 5G shipments in the quarter. And it continues to be an area of strong focus and attention for us. We are \u2013 we do have a presence in Barcelona this week and getting a fair amount of attention there. Let me start with that, and then Kevan maybe can provide some additional color. There's always ASP effect from pricing on flash. As you know, we operate in a market where the price per gigabyte generally declines every year. And that's good for us because it allows us to penetrate increasingly the disk market. That being said, I would say that currently we expect to take advantage of what has been some lower NAND prices. And as callers who \u2013 or people who have followed us know, we tend to have an advantage in timing with early reductions in NAND pricing. And then eventually gets follows through to the rest of the market. And then, it comes back into equilibrium. But I think overall, the pricing of NAND is going to operate to our favor as we go through the year. Yes. I would say that it was most noticeable as we turned the year \u2013 the calendar year that is. As we mentioned, we are able to close the advanced stage deals and as we went into the New Year, and to some extent I feel that it's probably had to do with the resetting of budgets by our customers as they enter their new \u2013 most customers obviously are operating on a calendar year basis. That as they entered their New Year, perhaps it's reconsideration or perhaps they're going into a planning mode that may be slowing things down or perhaps it may be simply a tighter budget being held to tighter budget restrictions or doing greater analysis little bit we're still trying to diagnose this. I would say it's very hard to say in the first few weeks of February in the sense that as I said, we're having our sales kick-off, all of the new quota and territory assignments are going out. So it's a little bit hard for us to get intelligence in the first few weeks of the fiscal year. But by going through the last month of the \u2013 of last fiscal year, that was when we really started to see this effect. Yes. I'll start with the second part. We're not seeing any different behavior by the competitors. So we're not seeing additional competitive pressures. Win rates are holding basically steady. So no concern there. It's changing both the pitch, but also we're not making \u2013 the second part was we're not making any major structural changes to the sales force either. So no major changes there.  We are introducing a lot more training and enablement, but this has been on the books now for quite some time as well as more detailed information all the way down to the DM level so they can manage their operations better. We are expecting to see improvement in that overall. As you might imagine, during times like this inspection gets tighter. And so we are planning for some much more detailed inspection of deals, especially as they progress through the different stages of the pipeline as you might imagine given this new environment. But outside of that, I would say it's just general, improvement in general operational discipline and things, as I mentioned, that have been on the books for a while. I'm going to give it a start, and then I'm going to invite Rob who's very engaged in those conversations. The interest level around energy and space savings is very high. There's always a question of doing it \u2013 that is in hyperscalers in particular, doing it internally versus using a vendor and a system level, but the conversations continue, which is very promising. I would say that outside of the three hyperscalers, the conversations in other, what you might call, cloud service providers and SaaS providers are very promising for both FlashArray//E [ph] as well as Pure Fusion, which is getting a lot of attention to enable these cloud service providers to operate much more like the hyperscalers in terms of the operations as well as being able to provide storage as a service to their customers. I want to thank you all for joining us on today's call. And I, of course, want to thank our employees for creating and driving our vision and constantly improving our operations and our culture. Thank you to our long-term investors for your support and being part of our mission. And special thanks to our customers and partners for continuing to choose Pure for their business, data storage and management needs. Goodbye all."

            "name": "Kevan Krysler",
            "content": "Thank you, Charlie, and good afternoon. We delivered strong financial results in Q4, with revenue growing 14% and operating margin of 19.6% while navigating the increased challenges of the macroeconomic environment. Also as a reminder for comparability, our Q4 last year included an additional week of revenue and expenses. For the year, we grew revenue 26% to $2.8 billion and substantially expanded our operating margins from 10.8% to 16.6%. Subscription annual recurring revenue or subscription ARR continues to be strong, exceeding $1.1 billion, up 30% year-over-year. Evergreen//One once again represented a key driver of our subscription ARR growth in Q4 and resonate strongly with customers as they navigate tighter IT budgets without having to compromise performance and value. Also consistent with last year, our subscription net dollar retention or NDR at the end of the year exceeded 120% compared to our long-term target of 15% as a result of expansion from existing customers. Remaining performance obligations, or RPO, grew 24% to $1.8 billion. Similar to the remarks we've made in previous quarters, our RPO growth is impacted by product shipments for an outstanding commitment with one of our global system integrators. Excluding these product shipments, RPO grew 28% year-over-year. Our headcount increased to approximately 5,100 employees. As the macro backdrop persists, our investment in incremental headcount next year will be focused on quota-carrying and critical business hires. International revenue in Q4 grew 39% to $258 million and U.S. revenue of $552 million grew 6% year-over-year. U.S. revenue growth reflects caution in IT spending that customers are exercising most notably in the Enterprise segment. Q4 product revenue grew 11% and subscription services revenue increased 23% year-over-year and comprised approximately one-third of total revenue for the quarter. Adjusting for the extra week in Q4 last year, subscription services revenue would have grown 31% year-over-year. We acquired approximately 490 new customers during the quarter, which was strong despite the challenges of the macro backdrop. Contributions from both product and subscription services gross margins continued to be strong as total gross margins were nearly 71% in Q4. And we expect that product margins will continue to be resilient, benefiting from our ability to leverage raw flash and our increasing mix of QLC flash. We are also pleased with the strength of subscription services gross margin of 74% for the quarter and nearly 73% for the year, driven by increasing efficiencies as we grow and scale our Evergreen subscription offerings. We remain focused on profitability as reflected in our strong Q4 operating profit of nearly $160 million and operating margin of 19.6%. We are very pleased with our substantial operating margin expansion this year, and we will continue to be very focused on our spending. Approximately two points of our operating margin in FY2023 was attributable to tailwinds that we do not expect will occur next year. This included higher attrition and slower-than-planned hiring that we experienced during the first half of FY2023 as well as lower-than-expected sales costs in Q4. We have a very strong balance sheet that includes approximately $1.6 billion in cash and investments. We generated significant cash flows from operations during the quarter of approximately $230 million and approximately $770 million for the year as a result of strong collections and increasing profits. Capital expenditures in Q4 were $60 million and during the year represented approximately 6% of revenue. Factors driving our higher capital expenditures include the strength of our Evergreen//One solution as well as test systems for our new product offerings. In Q4, we repurchased over 2.4 million shares of stock, returning approximately $67.5 million to our shareholders. For the year, we repurchased approximately 7.8 million shares, returning nearly $219 million in capital to our shareholders. We have approximately $31 million remaining on our existing $250 million repurchase authorization, and we are announcing today a new share repurchase authorization of an additional $250 million. Turning to revenue guidance for FY2024. We believe the current macro uncertainties will continue to persist, creating headwinds to enterprise IT spending. And as such, we expect revenue growth to be in the mid to high-single digits. This revenue guidance considers the macro backdrop and uncertainties that we are currently seeing today. As Charlie mentioned, the progression of new and early-stage sales opportunities are taking a longer period of time to close due to increased customer diligence, approvals and tightening budgets. We expect this to continue through FY2024 with some moderation later in the year as our sales teams adjust their selling motions to more closely align with evolving customer buying motions. During Q4, we did not receive new product orders for Meta and this is reflected in our forecasted growth rate for next year. Also, our FY2024 revenue guidance assumes a modest ramp during the second half of the year from sales of our newest FlashBlade//E offering. Turning to operating margin guidance for FY2024. We remain very focused on profitable growth while continuing to support our highest, long-term growth opportunities, such as our announcement today of FlashBlade//E. As a reminder, last quarter, we shared a preliminary view of operating margins in the range of 14% to 15% for FY2024. At the time, our preliminary view contemplated key considerations, including higher revenue growth assumptions. With our expectations of slower revenue growth, we adjusted our spending budgets for next year to align with an expected operating margin of 15%, representing the high end of the range of our preliminary view. We expect to achieve this operating margin by exercising strong focus and discipline on both hiring and spend management. Now turning to revenue guidance for Q1. As we have mentioned on multiple occasions in prior earnings calls, Q1 of last year reflected $60 million of product revenue impacting seasonality as this revenue had been contemplated for the second half of FY2023. Excluding the seasonality impact to product revenue of $60 million, we expect that Q1 revenue this year will be flat at $560 million when compared to Q1 of last year. Our Q1 revenue guide of $560 million takes into consideration that newer, early-stage opportunities will require a longer period of time to close. Again, we expect this impact will moderate later in the year. While we are confident and committed to achieving 15% operating margin for the year, we expect that our operating profit in Q1 will be approximately $10 million. Operating profit in Q1 reflects a significant investment for our first in-person sales kickoff event since 2020 as well as higher costs as a result of our planned hiring in both Q3 and Q4 of last year. In closing, I'd like to thank our customers, partners and employees for an incredibly strong FY2023. Although the current macro backdrop presents its challenges, Pure is uniquely positioned to help our customers navigate these challenges, leveraging our innovative, high-performance solutions while providing financial flexibility through Evergreen and reducing total cost of ownership and energy consumption. As we look forward, we are confident in our strategy and ability to continue taking market share and deliver strong operating margin of 15% in FY2024. With that, I will turn it to Paul for Q&A. Aaron, this is Kevan. I appreciate the question. And you're right. With the first point, around the $60 million that really was seasonality and it really should be excluded in terms of how we're thinking about the comparability of product revenue. As that $60 million, if you recall where we had mentioned that on previous earnings calls was really planned for the second half of the year. So that's really impacting seasonality. So then after you adjust the $60 million, you still have for Q1 of last year a very strong year-over-year growth of 37%. So that does set up for a tough compare. And then the macro backdrop that Charlie mentioned and I mentioned, which really resulted in longer-than-expected sales progression of new and early opportunities did add additional headwind to that tough compare that we're thinking about specific to Q1. And that's what's leading to the Q1 revenue outlook of flat year-over-year when excluding the impact of seasonality. But look, it really does generally align in terms of seasonality when we think about Q1 and when we think about our overall guide for revenue in the mid to high single digits. It generally is aligning with our seasonality that we saw with FY2022. So we actually feel pretty comfortable with that. Yes. I think that's a great point, Charlie. And maybe what we can add to is our thoughts around Pure's unique positioning even in this environment and then connecting that with the field as well, which I think is going to be really important. Yes. That's great. And I'd add a couple more to that as well, which is FlashArray//C continues to get traction and really is resonating with customers in this environment. And we introduced last year Evergreen//Flex, which is starting to pick up some traction and interest as well, and we do expect some more momentum on that front. But really, what it's getting at is that we've got a lot of solutions for our customers that provide a lot of flexibility both in terms of consumption and financial. And I think that's really going to resonate with customers as we navigate this environment. Yes, it's a great question. This is Kevan again. Look, we've been very pleased, obviously, with the strength of our subscription business. You see that again in our subscription ARR growth rate. We see that continuing to be strong as we progress through the year. Charlie pointed out the strength that we saw in Evergreen//One in Q3 and Q4 of last year. We expect that to continue. So that's going to be a benefit for us as we continue to navigate. And look, I do expect that overall, our renewals of Evergreen solutions will continue to be very strong. During this time, customers are valuing in a significant way the ability to have their solutions and peer solutions modernized through the Evergreen offerings. And so we do expect that to continue to be strong, offset somewhat slightly by the attach of Evergreen to new product given the slowdown that we've communicated. Yes. Wamsi, I think the only thing I would add to Charlie's answer is the strength we're seeing on Evergreen//One and Evergreen//Flex is significant and is really resonating with our customer base. And obviously, if that mix changes significantly, that would have a short-term headwind on revenue as well. So that's another factor to be considering when you're thinking about our guide and outlook for revenue next year. And then I would add on to that, just that we're also contemplating a moderate second half ramp of FlashBlade//E as well. And we do expect that to ramp in a manner similar to what we saw with FlashArray//C. Thanks, Nehal. And it's a great question and obviously made great progress really across the board in terms of performance on both the expansion of our operating margin as well as free cash flow. And yes, you're right. I do think the headwinds that will navigate associated with the macro backdrop would be the one factor, which has been driving our outlook, our near-term outlook for FY 2024 for revenue growth. But when we think about our free cash flow performance, we're very pleased with that. And we do believe that we'll continue to outpace our free cash flow margin. We'll continue to outpace our operating margin slightly. Now we will have some pressure, if you will, due to the lower outlook growth for product revenue, which will have some impact on that as well as continued strength of Evergreen//One which will add to our CapEx needs as we continue to expand. But overall, really happy with the direction we're headed in. We're always evaluating M&A as we should and we want to make sure that we always have enough cash in reserve to be able to make, especially tuck-ins, but small M&A acquisitions. Obviously, if we were to consider a larger one that would probably require a more complex transaction. But yes, we continue to consider M&A. And we think that as you know, the current venture environment starts to become much more let's say reasonable in terms of expectations. Those types of opportunities will come up a bit more often. I will say, however, that we are extremely fortunate as a company and being very rich in organic opportunities, and that continues to be our preference. Ye. And I think that's without a doubt, Charlie. ASPs continue to be strong. It's certainly going to give us \u2013 the NAND pricing will give us a significant advantage as we move out and aggressively market FlashBlade//E as well as FlashArray//C. So when we think about it in terms of product gross margins, we do consider that as an overall favorable factor for us as we navigate through next year. And again, to Charlie's point, it's all about us being able to take a full advantage of raw NAND and flash instead of our competitors who are having to still rely on SSD drives. But we do expect some balance with the favorability we'll get on NAND, again, given the aggressive nature will pursue FlashBlade//E and FlashArray//C. Yes. And Eric, I'm going to add on to this a little bit. So I think a couple of takeaways when we think about how things develop through Q4 and then obviously up and through to what we're talking to you today. As Charlie mentioned, our conversion of advanced stage opportunities were actually consistent with what we've historically seen. So I view that as a significant positive as we think about navigating through Q4. The other significant positive for us is we saw strong volume of new opportunities through Q4. Really, what the change was is really that to Charlie's point that the sales progression of those new opportunities and early-stage opportunities that's what substantially slowed down, and that's what we saw really in January and February, which is giving rise to the outlook that we're providing to you today. Yes. I think it's a great question. And I think you're thinking about the $60 million, right, although I would clarify that a little bit. I would put that more in the second half category. So Q3, Q4, I wouldn't put that all into Q4. Seasonality Q1-to-Q1 a little bit of pressure as we think about it. But again, that's really as a result of the sales progression of these early opportunities in early stage that we've highlighted on multiple occasions. I think our assumption is that that will start to moderate somewhat as we progress through the year. In addition to that, we're layering on some moderate contribution for FlashBlade//E in the second half as well."

Our fourth quarter of fiscal '23 quite period begins at the close of business Friday, January 20, 2023. With that, I will turn it over to Charlie.\nCharlie Giancarlo: Thanks Paul. Hello, everyone and welcome to the call. We hope that our fellow Americans had a wonderful Thanksgiving holiday, and that our non-U.S. listeners had a wrestle few days while everyone in the U.S. was offline. We are once again pleased with our quarterly results, showing a year-over-year revenue growth of 20% and subscription ARR growth of 30%, surpassing $1 billion for the first time. Our portfolio of subscription products had a strong quarter with Evergreen//One achieving record results. Our new products including FlashArray//C, FlashArray//XL, and FlashBlade S also saw excellent growth this past quarter. FlashBlade S our newest product is off to a great start in its first full quarter sales. The number of S systems sold were above our plan and petabytes sold were well above our plan. We're also seeing S customers taking advantage of the increased performance and scale choosing to purchase larger systems than the prior generation. Pure continues to lead the industry in product innovation having released a record number of new products and services this year, including FlashArray//XL, FlashBlade S, Pure Fusion, Portworx data services and Evergreen//Flex. We are proud to share that this innovation has once again been recognized with Gartner's highest rankings in their magic quadrant, Pure was named the leader for the ninth consecutive year for primary storage and a leader for distributed file systems and object storage, significantly increasing flash blades ranking year-over-year. Pure's unique value proposition of advanced technology, low total cost of ownership, industry leading energy savings, combined with powerful performance is the reason that leading edge technology and hyperscale cloud companies increasingly choose to rely on Pure. This past quarter as planned, we were pleased to ship the second phase of Meta's build out of their research super cluster or RSC. As a reminder, our shipments for Meta's RSC consists of both FlashBlade and FlashArray//C. Meta relies on Pure's FlashBlade to provide lightning fast data delivery to their NVIDIA GPUs and FlashArray//C to provide performance oriented and cost effective bulk data storage at 1/10, the space power and cooling of a disk alternative. NAND cost per bit continues to approach that of magnetic disks. Because of Pure's unique intellectual property, Pure's QLC based systems are now competitive with hybrid disk based systems on a price per bit level years ahead of the commodity crossover point. We expect that the currently anticipated improvements in Pure's NAND economics this coming here will enable Pure to deliver our QLC based products at prices competitive with most near line disk arrays on a total cost of ownership basis. We believe strongly that the days of the hard disk in the data center are over. Customers that do not take advantage of Pure's QLC products to replace disk systems are choosing the more expensive and energy intensive options. New enterprise customers this quarter include a large global telco, a large global payment processor, and a major energy provider. Existing customers like Vertafore, a leading provider of modern insurance technology continue to expand their relationship with Pure, relying on the combination of technology performance, total cost of ownership and an Evergreen customer experience to fuel their data dependent business objectives. This past quarter significant numbers of enterprise companies specifically chose Pure for our exceptionally low power space and cooling performance. This has been especially evident in Europe, where not only energy prices, but energy security is a major concern. As mentioned, we saw strong growth in both new and existing Evergreen customers this quarter. Evergreen's flexible approach to both consumption and pricing is helping customers of every size, deal with the uncertainties that businesses and organizations face in the current environment. Many new customers also cited energy savings as a new important benefit. Also this quarter, we saw several large telco customers purchase our portfolio to support projects ranging from 5G deployment to modernizing infrastructure. For example, one of the largest telecommunication providers in Asia increased their Pure portfolio including their FlashArray//C footprint, furthering their commitment to environmental sustainability, while accelerating their transformation and services offerings to their customers. Looking ahead to world economic conditions, we continue to see instances of longer sales cycles in the enterprise segment, and expect that enterprises will continue to exercise caution in spending over the next year. We believe that this focus on spending uniquely favors Pure Storage in the quarters ahead. The combination of Pure's Evergreen offerings, best-in-class power space and cooling, and operating simplicity results in significantly lower operating costs for enterprise customers. Given challenging economic and energy situations around the world, more enterprises are focused on total cost of ownership and the area where Pure excels. As we look forward, we are keeping our eyes on a number of macroeconomic factors, in particular inflation, slower economic growth, and lingering supply chain disruptions. Considering the current economic uncertainty, we plan to thoughtfully invest in our expansion, while continuing to deliver strong operating results. Despite the challenges and uncertainties of the current business environment, we remain confident in our ability to take share and outpace the market, while delivering products, solutions and services to customers that exceed their expectations. I'd like to hand the mic over now to our CFO, Kevan Krysler for a review of our numbers.\nKevan Krysler: Thank you, Charlie. Through solid execution, we delivered strong financial results in Q3, growing revenue 20% and increasing our operating profits by over 50%, while navigating the effects of the macroeconomic environment. Substantial revenue from sales to Meta also contributed to our financial results this quarter. Our customers which now exceed 11,000, and represent 58% of the Fortune 500, leverage our portfolio of innovative data storage and management products and subscription services to drive optimal business outcomes and performance. Revenue performance growth and demand our FlashArray//C and FlashBlade S solutions, both leveraging QLC Flash was very strong this quarter. Our leadership in Flash management, enabled by our software and declining cost of Flash is accelerating our progress and replacing traditional disk solutions in substantially reducing data center, energy consumption. We also continue to be pleased with meaningful contributions from new business as we acquired approximately 390 new customers this quarter including across the telecom industry. Subscription annual recurring revenue or subscription ARR exceeded 1 billion this quarter, growing 30% year-over-year. Record sales of Evergreen//One in Q3 represent a key driver of our subscription ARR growth. Remaining performance obligations or RPO grew 26% to $1.6 billion. Similar to the remarks we made in previous quarters, our RPO growth is impacted by product shipments for an outstanding commitment with one of our global system integrators. Excluding these product shipments, RPO grew 31% year-over-year. Our headcount has increased to nearly 4,900 employees and our investments in talent continue to be disciplined and focused around our key business objectives. Total revenue for the quarter grew 20% to $676 million. For Q3, U.S. revenue was $493 million, an increase of 21% year-over-year with international revenue, which continues to be impacted by foreign exchange headwinds growing 19% year-over-year to $183 million. Product revenue grew 15% and subscription services revenue increased 30%. Subscription services comprise 36% of total revenue for the quarter. Contributions from both product and subscription services gross margins continue to be strong, as total gross margins were 70.9% in Q3. Sales of our larger configuration systems and new FlashBlade S contributed to slightly higher product gross margins of 70.1%. Subscription services gross margins were 72.3%. Our strong Q3 operating profit of 107 million and operating margin of 15.9% were driven by a combination of factors including strong gross margins. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.5 billion in cash and investments. Cash flow from operations was $155 million in Q3, resulting from the combination of strong sales, collections and operating profit. Capital expenditures trended higher this quarter at nearly $40 million due to deliveries of test equipment, which had previously been on backorder. In Q3, we returned approximately $24.5 million in capital to repurchase approximately 900,000 shares of stock. This represents a lower level of repurchase activity than recent quarters as a result of the fixed trading plan parameters that were in place throughout the quarter. We would expect that share repurchase volume will increase next quarter. We have approximately $100 million remaining from our $215 million share repurchase program. Now, turning to guidance, we estimate revenue for Q4 to be approximately $810 million up 14% year-over-year. For comparison purposes, a couple of reminders, our Q4 of last year, included an additional week a revenue of approximately $20 million as a result of FY '22, including 53 weeks. Also, from our previous remarks, approximately $60 million of product revenue recognized in the first quarter of FY '23 had been forecasted to close in the second half of the year. Adjusting for this impact of seasonality, our expected revenue growth in the second half of FY '23 would have been nearly 21% year-over-year. For FY '23, we are reiterating our annual revenue guidance of approximately $2.75 billion, an increase of 26% versus FY '22. Our operating profits remained solid, which is reflected in our Q4 operating profit outlook of $130 million or operating margin of approximately 16%. As a result of our performance in Q3 and outlook for Q4, we are increasing our operating profit outlook for the full year to $430 million. Operating margins are expected to be approximately 15.6%, reflecting a significant expansion from 10.8% last year. Revenue growth and strong product and subscription services gross margins have contributed to our strong operating profit and operating margin outlook for this year. During the first half of the year, our operating profits also benefited from less travel, higher attrition and slower than anticipated hiring. We do not expect that our operating profits will continue to benefit from these tailwinds next year. While the remains too early to provide guidance for FY '24, our current preliminary view is for operating margins to remain robust, around 14% to 15%. In closing, through our unwavering commitment to innovation, and customer service, we continue to be in a unique position of creating valuable outcomes for our customers, including dramatically reducing energy consumption and e-waste. With the strength of our portfolio of products and the power of our evergreen offerings, the opportunities in front of us remain compelling. With that, I will turn it back to Paul for Q&A.\nPaul Ziots: Thanks, Kevan. Before we begin the Q&A, I'll please ask you to limit yourself to one question consisting of one part so we can get to as many people as possible. Operator, let's get started.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Amit, your line is now open.\nAmit Daryanani: Perfect. Thank you and congrats on the print book. I guess my question is, Charlie, do you believe the print and the guide you provided is fairly impressive especially in comparison to the commentary, I think some of your peers like Dell and NetApp recently. So I'd love to just understand, what do you think is driving this contrast within your peers? I don't think you both have a sizable backlog, for example, that could be helping you. So would be great to just hear what you think is enabling the divergence of performance at Pure versus -- at Pure versus your peers? And then, what do you think the durability of the divergence [indiscernible] as you go forward? Thank you.\nCharlie Giancarlo: Thank you, Amit, and hope you're well. Thank you for the question. Well, Amit, I think it's a based on a variety of different things, but fundamentally upon our core strategy. So, the core strategy, first of all, is to drive an all Flash data environment in the data center and to be able to provide a product that's very modern in terms of its software capabilities and management abilities. We have consistently grown market share, since the day that we were founded, that is based on the fact that, we have all the vendors developed a software stack that focused on the benefits of using a Pure semiconductor versus just refilling disk oriented architectures with SSDs. And that's allowed us to provide a product that's simpler to operate uses less power, space, power and cooling requires far less labor is far more reliable, and more performance than competitive products that are out there. And to this day, our competitors still compete with SSD alternatives. Secondly, it's based on a much broader portfolio, we believe. Going from, our roots or our initial product, which was block oriented to now having file and object based systems. And then thirdly, it's now starting to pursue our replacements for secondary tier disk alternatives. So, this allows us a lot of market allows us to expand into a lot of market adjacencies and allows a lot of elasticity in our market as flat prices decline. So, we're very excited about this. Finally, what I'll mention is, once we penetrate an account, our ability to expand in that account is very large because of the improved experience that our customers have. When I repeat to our team that our Net Promoter Score, the most important number in the Company, that's, it's the experience of our customers that allow us really broad expansion capabilities in an account once we penetrate. So, I think you add those things together, it allows us to continue to operate as a share taker in this market, in this $50 billion market. And as you well know, we're still coming up upon 3 billion in terms of our total revenue. So lots of growth opportunities in the future.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. Meta, your line is now open.\nMeta Marshall: Maybe a question for me of, clearly you are highlighting that some of the memory pricing getting cheaper is helping with the QLC this conversion. So just wanted to kind of get a sense of what kind of traction you're seeing with either very large enterprises or hyperscalers with that motion, and whether you're seeing kind of some shortening of sales cycles as we kind of get closer to some of these conversion points?\nCharlie Giancarlo: Yes, let me address the hyperscaler first. Obviously, we I spoke about Meta in my initial remarks, the fact that we were able to deliver FlashArray//C for their bulk data, requirements at a price point that competed with their own software running on -- their, what would have been their disk arrays, really speaks to the power of the being able to use QLC and Flash to compete with disk. And now that environment also benefited from the lower power and lower space requirements. And I think that's part of what will allow Flash to compete against a disk in this environment, are increasingly in this environment, as the Flash prices start to -- NAND costs start to come down. We're seeing the same in large enterprises, although I would say that that's in an earlier phase right now, but FlashArray//C has been an incredible grower for us, and that does compete largely with the hybrid disk market, and we think we'll be able to go after the non-hybrid, that is the what's called the near line market, as we go into this New Year. So, we believe that, thirdly, the power while we've been speaking about the lower power requirements and cooling requirements for many years, this is the first year and starting in Europe, but also Asia, where we're seeing companies say it specifically because of the power savings, that they're buying Pure products or getting them initially to start with Pure products. So we think it's going to become an even bigger issue as we go forward. So, we are starting to see that now in large enterprise.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Wamsi, your line is now open.\nWamsi Mohan: Charlie, I was wondering, if you could share some color around the outlook on IT spending into 2023, particularly for the storage market? And some of your competitors are talking about that being down on a year-on-year basis. You mentioned your confidence in your ability to take share and outgrow that market. So curious if you could give us some high-level thoughts of what those trends look like if storage is going to grow or decline and how much you can outgrow that market? And what's embedded in that inside of that operating margin of 14% to 15%? Thank you.\nCharlie Giancarlo: Yes, let me start with sort of our view on GDP in general, and then go into what we think will happen in the IT side with storage. So for GDP in general, obviously, there are a lot of different analysts out there, speaking about, the current economic environment and how that their prognostication for next year. The way we're looking at it is a roughly flat U.S. economy next year, and perhaps a slightly recessionary international economy, obviously, varying a lot, country by country. And as we go into that, we're seeing IT spending, a holding steady, maybe it's slightly up relative to the overall GDP growth. But in addition to that, what we are looking at is storage, remaining relatively healthy relative to the rest of the IT economy. So, we actually believe that storage might be up a moderately next year. That being said, you're correct. In terms of our own results, we believe we'll be continuing to take market share. And we believe that we similar to this quarter versus our competitors, we believe that we'll be able to stay in the double digit growth area. Perhaps a bit more moderate than our overall growth this year, but we believe still solidly well into the double digits.\nOperator: Our next question comes in the line of Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank. Sidney, your line is now open.\nSidney Ho: I want to ask about the, your visibility beyond this quarter, I am not asking specific for financial guidance for calendar '23. But previously, you talk about having good visibility and then pipeline the second half of the year, and that there are some delays, but not known permanent pause. I also think you mentioned you could still be on one quarter. So how would you characterize the pipeline in the first half of next year at this point? And maybe comment on demand trends between the Enterprise versus Commercial customers? Thanks.\nCharlie Giancarlo: Sure. Generally, our ability to have visibility in the pipeline extends about two quarters, so current quarter plus one current quarter plus two. So you're asking and that would extend to through Q1 of next year, not our Q1 that is of next year. And generally, we don't necessarily have visibility three quarters out just to be really clear. So I can't really speak about the first half from a visibility perspective. What I would say is visibility into our Q4 the remainder of this year and visibility into Q1 of next year remains quite good. So, that will form if you will, that will go into forming our view of next fiscal year. We're in the middle of planning right now. So difficult to give you any further insight into that. But as I said that our visibility into Q plus 1, Q plus 2 remains fairly good.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of David Vogt with UBS. David, your line is now open.\nDavid Vogt: Maybe just a follow-up to Kevan's comments about preliminary margins next year and Charlie's comments about growth being well into the double-digits next year. I know you mentioned Kevan, that there's going to be some items that are not going to repeat this year, excuse me in fiscal '23 versus this year. But just quickly, kind of doing top back of the envelope math, they would suggest that you're sort of incremental margins next year are going to be under pretty material pressure. If your margins are going to come in at 14% to 15%, can you kind of walk us through what's really the incremental spend categories or spend that you're looking at next year given where you are and sort of where the long term operating model should shake out over the medium term?\nKevan Krysler: Yes, I'd appreciate that David. Look, we're quite pleased with the overall margin expansion that we've seen this year. And really key drivers of that being are strong revenue growth and product gross margins and subscription services gross margins. And I've talked about the fact that we did have some tailwinds. And we're thinking that it's approximately 1.5, 1.5 points to our operating profits this year. And really, it's kind of in three areas. We've talked about, as we were exiting last year, early in first half, we had higher attrition levels. And that really continued through Q1 and Q2. So, obviously, there's a benefit a pickup there. And then, there was slower than planned hiring during the first half as well. Now, we've made really good progress as you've seen on our hiring of talent, particularly in Q2 and this quarter. And obviously, that that's going to play into to next year in terms of how we're thinking about it. But then, in addition to that, we are planning for an increase in travel costs slightly. For example, we're doing our first in person sales kickoff in the New Year. We haven't had that in two years, so years or three years. So obviously, we're considering that as we're looking at our operating margin and profits for next year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mehdi Hosseini with Susquehanna. Mehdi, your line is now open.\nMehdi Hosseini: Just a quick follow-up for the Charlie and the team. You have done a good job of expanding margin very diligently, keeping the OpEx very reasonable, and realizing margin expansion. I just want to get an update on the strategy looking into the next one to two year. Especially into next calendar year perhaps as enterprise budgets are more constrained. How is that strategy going to evolve? Are you going to spend more to capture more dollars of revenue? Or the strategies to remain focused on having more leverage in a P&L? And I'm not asking for a guide, but it would just be helpful if you could give us an update our strategy changes into a rather challenging macro environment?\nCharlie Giancarlo: Absolutely, and it's a very fair question, Mehdi. So, we are consistently focused on revenue growth. That being said, we never like to go back on margin and largely because it's about operational discipline. About being a high performing company with good internal practices. We should be able to grow at an optimal rate, while at the same time being diligent in terms of delivering good operating margin. Now, that being said, as we go into next year, we've increased a lot on our headcount already, and we'll be seeing the full impact of that next year. We want to continue investing in our quota bearing heads. So we'll continue making that investment. We want to continue obviously in developing good core product, but we're going to be very diligent and focused, and we also want to be just thoughtful about potential pitfalls in the economy as we go forward. So, we want to stay agile as well, in terms of, our ability to be flexible in the way we spend money or how much money we spend, given that the economy is uncertain. So, we are going to prioritize revenue growth, but at the same time, we want to make sure we can deliver, good results on the bottom line.\nOperator: Our next question comes from a line of Nehal Chokshi with Northland Capital Markets. Nehal, your line is now open.\nNehal Chokshi: Provided just very generic color regarding the contribution from Meta's research SuperCluster, can you give a little bit more detail around that? And more importantly, trying to get a sense as far as what is the revenue growth excluding Meta?\nCharlie Giancarlo: You're right. Well, let me give it a start and then Kevan will give you and fill in some of the details. So first of all, we did ship the vast majority of the second phase of our Meta program this past quarter. We were very pleased to be able to do so. The relationship remains very strong and we look forward to continuing to build good strength and good business with Meta as we go forward. So, Kevan, I know there's a lot behind this quarter so perhaps you can provide some additions to this.\nKevan Krysler: Yes. So, I'll touch on the financial comparison and Nehal I hope you're doing well. When you think about the economics of our Phase 2 shipments to Meta, when comparing that to our Phase 1 shipments back in Q3 of last year, without getting into specifics, we did make some modifications to the deal structure of Phase 2, which actually resulted in less revenue and improved product gross margins, because obviously, you see the strength of our product gross margins this quarter, especially compared to Q3 of last year. If we'd use the same deal structure for Phase 2 that we used in, in Phase 1 revenue growth, frankly, would have been aligned with the remarks I made earlier in the year. Also, our product gross margin profile would have been similar to what we saw in Q3 of FY '22. So hopefully, that's helpful for you, Nehal in terms of how we're thinking about it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Simon, your line is now open.\nSimon Leopold: I wanted to see how you're thinking about product gross margins in light of the idea that memory prices appear to have come down and look like they'll be down meaningfully over at least the next several quarters, and I appreciate the fact that there are other inputs but I imagine that's a pretty significant contributor to your bill of materials. So, I'm just wondering, if you're expecting maybe some price deflation or responses from others in your competitive space, cutting prices. What are you assuming in terms of the inputs for product gross margin?\nCharlie Giancarlo: Yes, I mean a great, but complex question. As you know, we have a lot of experience in this now, especially and frankly, probably, for me, especially not coming in and not originally being in this market. I've had now five years experience of how this operates. And of course, as you well know, costs and prices operate on different timeframes, and they're not 100% connected to one another. We compete with companies that utilize SSDs, and therefore don't yet, are not exposed specifically, to the raw, the costs of raw Flash whereas we are. Our point of view on this is that as always, we tend to have advanced opportunity with a lower costs compared to our competitors, which doesn't mean that they won't discount in the market. So I suppose that we believe that we will see pricing come down sometime in the future, maybe not right away, we'll see prices start to come down. Overall a good thing for us, it allows us to go after more of the disk market. One of the things that's very different this time around is that these, this round of NAND reductions is going to make Flash especially with our products on the QLC side with FlashArray//C and S, much more competitive with Pure disk based products. And to be direct, we're going to use any cost reductions we see to go after that market. So, it's always hard to predict gross margins with any level of exactitude, but you should expect us to stay within the range that we identified, and use cost savings that we have there to focus on the disk side.\nKevan Krysler: And if I could jump in, I think it's really important here to you know, just again, emphasize, the sustained and structural advantages that Pure has and being able to use the raw NAND Flash versus really being limited to enterprise SSDs such as most of our larger competitors are, especially in terms of navigating some of the near-term cost of volatility. And these advantages really go back to our direct Flash technology, which is the result of over a decade of software and hardware IP, and it gives us a sustained, structural advantages over the competitive set in terms of will A, being able to source a raw commodity NAND versus the higher priced enterprise SSDs, which don't always travel in line with one another in terms of the short-term. Number two, to be able to make much more efficient use of that NAND have faster time to market and just realize and deliver to customers significant reliability and performance advantages. And so, you'll add it all up, I think this set of advantages was a huge benefit in the early days. But as we look at today's technology set, QLC the roadmaps beyond QLC in terms of cost effective NAND, it's just absolutely requisite to be able to deliver that technology to customers and reliable performance efficient manner.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Matt Sheerin with Stifel. Matt, your line is now open.\nMatt Sheerin: As we think about modeling for next year. It looks like you're going to come up against some tough comps with Meta and so, are their expectations for contributions from that customer next year? And then, as related to that in terms of other hyperscale opportunities, could you update us on what that pipeline looks like?\nCharlie Giancarlo: Absolutely. So on Meta, as we've identified, we ship Phase 2, by Meta's own blog, they had indicated an exabyte to be shipped in total. So, there's still more to be completed in that project for the RSC. There's no further guidance we can give you on the timing of that right now. We just don't have that for certain. So unfortunately, we're not able to provide additional insight into that. And in terms of other hyperscalers conversations continue, where we're optimistic that we will see realizable opportunities there, but again too early to be able to put any real guidance on that.\nOperator: Our next question comes from a line of Krish Sankar with Cowen. Krish, your line is now open.\nKrish Sankar: Charlie and Kevan, thanks for taking my question. Very interest to op margins of 16% last quarter, and your guidance of 14% to 15% for next year. I'm just wondering, what would the op margin last quarter, has been without Meta in the mix? And kind of you mentioned that you cannot quantify Meta revenue but you kind of highlighted that 14% to 15% op margin is a guidance. I'm going to curious, how to think about that with Meta in the mix because my understanding is Meta is op margin accretive since you don't go to the channel. Any color there would be helpful.\nKevan Krysler: Hey, Chris, this is Kevan. Look, when we think about Meta from an operating margin perspective, I think it'd be good to be thinking about that in terms of the Company profile on operating margins. I don't think that's a detractor or positive force. Where we saw the benefit was really on product gross margin, and again that that was a result of using a different deal structure. But I think from a company profile, operating margin standpoint, I would put that in that category.\nCharlie Giancarlo: I do want to correct one statement, however, which is that in fact, we do use, we do have a partner with Meta. It's an integration partner. And so, there is economics involved in that.\nPaul Ziots: It looks like we have one more question in queue. So this will be the last question.\nOperator: Our last question comes from the line of Eric Martinuzzi with Lake Street. Eric, your line is now open.\nEric Martinuzzi: Yes, you've talked about having a little bit better success on the hiring side. As we look at Q4, where is that, is that kind of equally distributed across R&D and sales and marketing?\nCharlie Giancarlo: I would say that while we're continuing to hire in both and in particular on the R&D side, we are expanding overseas, largely to take advantage of overall lower cost profile. And to make it more, to be honest to be just much more balanced as a company between our onshore and offshore headcount in R&D, we're really very much focused on the quota bearing head side in terms of our expansion in sales and marketing. I believe that to continue the growth we have to continue to improve our capacity on the sales side, so we'll be continuing to invest there.\nPaul Ziots: Thank you, Eric. Before we conclude, I think Charlie has few parting comments.\nCharlie Giancarlo: Yes. Thank you, Paul. Pure continues I think as you can see it outpace our industry in both innovation and customer satisfaction. And now our advantages and total cost of ownership, energy efficiency, price performance are setting the pace in this new economy, and they're going to make and they are making it the preferred choice for leading organizations around the world. I remain confident that we will continue to take share and outperform the market as we've done since the very first day of our founding. I want to thank again, our dedicated employees, our partners, our suppliers, and our especially our customers for choosing to partner with Pure are the world's best data storage and management solutions. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today's Pure Storage third quarter fiscal year 2023 financial results call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your line.",

            "content": "Thanks Paul. Hello, everyone and welcome to the call. We hope that our fellow Americans had a wonderful Thanksgiving holiday, and that our non-U.S. listeners had a wrestle few days while everyone in the U.S. was offline. We are once again pleased with our quarterly results, showing a year-over-year revenue growth of 20% and subscription ARR growth of 30%, surpassing $1 billion for the first time. Our portfolio of subscription products had a strong quarter with Evergreen//One achieving record results. Our new products including FlashArray//C, FlashArray//XL, and FlashBlade S also saw excellent growth this past quarter. FlashBlade S our newest product is off to a great start in its first full quarter sales. The number of S systems sold were above our plan and petabytes sold were well above our plan. We're also seeing S customers taking advantage of the increased performance and scale choosing to purchase larger systems than the prior generation. Pure continues to lead the industry in product innovation having released a record number of new products and services this year, including FlashArray//XL, FlashBlade S, Pure Fusion, Portworx data services and Evergreen//Flex. We are proud to share that this innovation has once again been recognized with Gartner's highest rankings in their magic quadrant, Pure was named the leader for the ninth consecutive year for primary storage and a leader for distributed file systems and object storage, significantly increasing flash blades ranking year-over-year. Pure's unique value proposition of advanced technology, low total cost of ownership, industry leading energy savings, combined with powerful performance is the reason that leading edge technology and hyperscale cloud companies increasingly choose to rely on Pure. This past quarter as planned, we were pleased to ship the second phase of Meta's build out of their research super cluster or RSC. As a reminder, our shipments for Meta's RSC consists of both FlashBlade and FlashArray//C. Meta relies on Pure's FlashBlade to provide lightning fast data delivery to their NVIDIA GPUs and FlashArray//C to provide performance oriented and cost effective bulk data storage at 1/10, the space power and cooling of a disk alternative. NAND cost per bit continues to approach that of magnetic disks. Because of Pure's unique intellectual property, Pure's QLC based systems are now competitive with hybrid disk based systems on a price per bit level years ahead of the commodity crossover point. We expect that the currently anticipated improvements in Pure's NAND economics this coming here will enable Pure to deliver our QLC based products at prices competitive with most near line disk arrays on a total cost of ownership basis. We believe strongly that the days of the hard disk in the data center are over. Customers that do not take advantage of Pure's QLC products to replace disk systems are choosing the more expensive and energy intensive options. New enterprise customers this quarter include a large global telco, a large global payment processor, and a major energy provider. Existing customers like Vertafore, a leading provider of modern insurance technology continue to expand their relationship with Pure, relying on the combination of technology performance, total cost of ownership and an Evergreen customer experience to fuel their data dependent business objectives. This past quarter significant numbers of enterprise companies specifically chose Pure for our exceptionally low power space and cooling performance. This has been especially evident in Europe, where not only energy prices, but energy security is a major concern. As mentioned, we saw strong growth in both new and existing Evergreen customers this quarter. Evergreen's flexible approach to both consumption and pricing is helping customers of every size, deal with the uncertainties that businesses and organizations face in the current environment. Many new customers also cited energy savings as a new important benefit. Also this quarter, we saw several large telco customers purchase our portfolio to support projects ranging from 5G deployment to modernizing infrastructure. For example, one of the largest telecommunication providers in Asia increased their Pure portfolio including their FlashArray//C footprint, furthering their commitment to environmental sustainability, while accelerating their transformation and services offerings to their customers. Looking ahead to world economic conditions, we continue to see instances of longer sales cycles in the enterprise segment, and expect that enterprises will continue to exercise caution in spending over the next year. We believe that this focus on spending uniquely favors Pure Storage in the quarters ahead. The combination of Pure's Evergreen offerings, best-in-class power space and cooling, and operating simplicity results in significantly lower operating costs for enterprise customers. Given challenging economic and energy situations around the world, more enterprises are focused on total cost of ownership and the area where Pure excels. As we look forward, we are keeping our eyes on a number of macroeconomic factors, in particular inflation, slower economic growth, and lingering supply chain disruptions. Considering the current economic uncertainty, we plan to thoughtfully invest in our expansion, while continuing to deliver strong operating results. Despite the challenges and uncertainties of the current business environment, we remain confident in our ability to take share and outpace the market, while delivering products, solutions and services to customers that exceed their expectations. I'd like to hand the mic over now to our CFO, Kevan Krysler for a review of our numbers. Thank you, Amit, and hope you're well. Thank you for the question. Well, Amit, I think it's a based on a variety of different things, but fundamentally upon our core strategy. So, the core strategy, first of all, is to drive an all Flash data environment in the data center and to be able to provide a product that's very modern in terms of its software capabilities and management abilities. We have consistently grown market share, since the day that we were founded, that is based on the fact that, we have all the vendors developed a software stack that focused on the benefits of using a Pure semiconductor versus just refilling disk oriented architectures with SSDs. And that's allowed us to provide a product that's simpler to operate uses less power, space, power and cooling requires far less labor is far more reliable, and more performance than competitive products that are out there. And to this day, our competitors still compete with SSD alternatives. Secondly, it's based on a much broader portfolio, we believe. Going from, our roots or our initial product, which was block oriented to now having file and object based systems. And then thirdly, it's now starting to pursue our replacements for secondary tier disk alternatives. So, this allows us a lot of market allows us to expand into a lot of market adjacencies and allows a lot of elasticity in our market as flat prices decline. So, we're very excited about this. Finally, what I'll mention is, once we penetrate an account, our ability to expand in that account is very large because of the improved experience that our customers have. When I repeat to our team that our Net Promoter Score, the most important number in the Company, that's, it's the experience of our customers that allow us really broad expansion capabilities in an account once we penetrate. So, I think you add those things together, it allows us to continue to operate as a share taker in this market, in this $50 billion market. And as you well know, we're still coming up upon 3 billion in terms of our total revenue. So lots of growth opportunities in the future. Yes, let me address the hyperscaler first. Obviously, we I spoke about Meta in my initial remarks, the fact that we were able to deliver FlashArray//C for their bulk data, requirements at a price point that competed with their own software running on -- their, what would have been their disk arrays, really speaks to the power of the being able to use QLC and Flash to compete with disk. And now that environment also benefited from the lower power and lower space requirements. And I think that's part of what will allow Flash to compete against a disk in this environment, are increasingly in this environment, as the Flash prices start to -- NAND costs start to come down. We're seeing the same in large enterprises, although I would say that that's in an earlier phase right now, but FlashArray//C has been an incredible grower for us, and that does compete largely with the hybrid disk market, and we think we'll be able to go after the non-hybrid, that is the what's called the near line market, as we go into this New Year. So, we believe that, thirdly, the power while we've been speaking about the lower power requirements and cooling requirements for many years, this is the first year and starting in Europe, but also Asia, where we're seeing companies say it specifically because of the power savings, that they're buying Pure products or getting them initially to start with Pure products. So we think it's going to become an even bigger issue as we go forward. So, we are starting to see that now in large enterprise. Yes, let me start with sort of our view on GDP in general, and then go into what we think will happen in the IT side with storage. So for GDP in general, obviously, there are a lot of different analysts out there, speaking about, the current economic environment and how that their prognostication for next year. The way we're looking at it is a roughly flat U.S. economy next year, and perhaps a slightly recessionary international economy, obviously, varying a lot, country by country. And as we go into that, we're seeing IT spending, a holding steady, maybe it's slightly up relative to the overall GDP growth. But in addition to that, what we are looking at is storage, remaining relatively healthy relative to the rest of the IT economy. So, we actually believe that storage might be up a moderately next year. That being said, you're correct. In terms of our own results, we believe we'll be continuing to take market share. And we believe that we similar to this quarter versus our competitors, we believe that we'll be able to stay in the double digit growth area. Perhaps a bit more moderate than our overall growth this year, but we believe still solidly well into the double digits. Sure. Generally, our ability to have visibility in the pipeline extends about two quarters, so current quarter plus one current quarter plus two. So you're asking and that would extend to through Q1 of next year, not our Q1 that is of next year. And generally, we don't necessarily have visibility three quarters out just to be really clear. So I can't really speak about the first half from a visibility perspective. What I would say is visibility into our Q4 the remainder of this year and visibility into Q1 of next year remains quite good. So, that will form if you will, that will go into forming our view of next fiscal year. We're in the middle of planning right now. So difficult to give you any further insight into that. But as I said that our visibility into Q plus 1, Q plus 2 remains fairly good. Absolutely, and it's a very fair question, Mehdi. So, we are consistently focused on revenue growth. That being said, we never like to go back on margin and largely because it's about operational discipline. About being a high performing company with good internal practices. We should be able to grow at an optimal rate, while at the same time being diligent in terms of delivering good operating margin. Now, that being said, as we go into next year, we've increased a lot on our headcount already, and we'll be seeing the full impact of that next year. We want to continue investing in our quota bearing heads. So we'll continue making that investment. We want to continue obviously in developing good core product, but we're going to be very diligent and focused, and we also want to be just thoughtful about potential pitfalls in the economy as we go forward. So, we want to stay agile as well, in terms of, our ability to be flexible in the way we spend money or how much money we spend, given that the economy is uncertain. So, we are going to prioritize revenue growth, but at the same time, we want to make sure we can deliver, good results on the bottom line. You're right. Well, let me give it a start and then Kevan will give you and fill in some of the details. So first of all, we did ship the vast majority of the second phase of our Meta program this past quarter. We were very pleased to be able to do so. The relationship remains very strong and we look forward to continuing to build good strength and good business with Meta as we go forward. So, Kevan, I know there's a lot behind this quarter so perhaps you can provide some additions to this. Yes, I mean a great, but complex question. As you know, we have a lot of experience in this now, especially and frankly, probably, for me, especially not coming in and not originally being in this market. I've had now five years experience of how this operates. And of course, as you well know, costs and prices operate on different timeframes, and they're not 100% connected to one another. We compete with companies that utilize SSDs, and therefore don't yet, are not exposed specifically, to the raw, the costs of raw Flash whereas we are. Our point of view on this is that as always, we tend to have advanced opportunity with a lower costs compared to our competitors, which doesn't mean that they won't discount in the market. So I suppose that we believe that we will see pricing come down sometime in the future, maybe not right away, we'll see prices start to come down. Overall a good thing for us, it allows us to go after more of the disk market. One of the things that's very different this time around is that these, this round of NAND reductions is going to make Flash especially with our products on the QLC side with FlashArray//C and S, much more competitive with Pure disk based products. And to be direct, we're going to use any cost reductions we see to go after that market. So, it's always hard to predict gross margins with any level of exactitude, but you should expect us to stay within the range that we identified, and use cost savings that we have there to focus on the disk side. Absolutely. So on Meta, as we've identified, we ship Phase 2, by Meta's own blog, they had indicated an exabyte to be shipped in total. So, there's still more to be completed in that project for the RSC. There's no further guidance we can give you on the timing of that right now. We just don't have that for certain. So unfortunately, we're not able to provide additional insight into that. And in terms of other hyperscalers conversations continue, where we're optimistic that we will see realizable opportunities there, but again too early to be able to put any real guidance on that. I do want to correct one statement, however, which is that in fact, we do use, we do have a partner with Meta. It's an integration partner. And so, there is economics involved in that. I would say that while we're continuing to hire in both and in particular on the R&D side, we are expanding overseas, largely to take advantage of overall lower cost profile. And to make it more, to be honest to be just much more balanced as a company between our onshore and offshore headcount in R&D, we're really very much focused on the quota bearing head side in terms of our expansion in sales and marketing. I believe that to continue the growth we have to continue to improve our capacity on the sales side, so we'll be continuing to invest there. Yes. Thank you, Paul. Pure continues I think as you can see it outpace our industry in both innovation and customer satisfaction. And now our advantages and total cost of ownership, energy efficiency, price performance are setting the pace in this new economy, and they're going to make and they are making it the preferred choice for leading organizations around the world. I remain confident that we will continue to take share and outperform the market as we've done since the very first day of our founding. I want to thank again, our dedicated employees, our partners, our suppliers, and our especially our customers for choosing to partner with Pure are the world's best data storage and management solutions. Thank you."

            "content": "Thank you, Charlie. Through solid execution, we delivered strong financial results in Q3, growing revenue 20% and increasing our operating profits by over 50%, while navigating the effects of the macroeconomic environment. Substantial revenue from sales to Meta also contributed to our financial results this quarter. Our customers which now exceed 11,000, and represent 58% of the Fortune 500, leverage our portfolio of innovative data storage and management products and subscription services to drive optimal business outcomes and performance. Revenue performance growth and demand our FlashArray//C and FlashBlade S solutions, both leveraging QLC Flash was very strong this quarter. Our leadership in Flash management, enabled by our software and declining cost of Flash is accelerating our progress and replacing traditional disk solutions in substantially reducing data center, energy consumption. We also continue to be pleased with meaningful contributions from new business as we acquired approximately 390 new customers this quarter including across the telecom industry. Subscription annual recurring revenue or subscription ARR exceeded 1 billion this quarter, growing 30% year-over-year. Record sales of Evergreen//One in Q3 represent a key driver of our subscription ARR growth. Remaining performance obligations or RPO grew 26% to $1.6 billion. Similar to the remarks we made in previous quarters, our RPO growth is impacted by product shipments for an outstanding commitment with one of our global system integrators. Excluding these product shipments, RPO grew 31% year-over-year. Our headcount has increased to nearly 4,900 employees and our investments in talent continue to be disciplined and focused around our key business objectives. Total revenue for the quarter grew 20% to $676 million. For Q3, U.S. revenue was $493 million, an increase of 21% year-over-year with international revenue, which continues to be impacted by foreign exchange headwinds growing 19% year-over-year to $183 million. Product revenue grew 15% and subscription services revenue increased 30%. Subscription services comprise 36% of total revenue for the quarter. Contributions from both product and subscription services gross margins continue to be strong, as total gross margins were 70.9% in Q3. Sales of our larger configuration systems and new FlashBlade S contributed to slightly higher product gross margins of 70.1%. Subscription services gross margins were 72.3%. Our strong Q3 operating profit of 107 million and operating margin of 15.9% were driven by a combination of factors including strong gross margins. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.5 billion in cash and investments. Cash flow from operations was $155 million in Q3, resulting from the combination of strong sales, collections and operating profit. Capital expenditures trended higher this quarter at nearly $40 million due to deliveries of test equipment, which had previously been on backorder. In Q3, we returned approximately $24.5 million in capital to repurchase approximately 900,000 shares of stock. This represents a lower level of repurchase activity than recent quarters as a result of the fixed trading plan parameters that were in place throughout the quarter. We would expect that share repurchase volume will increase next quarter. We have approximately $100 million remaining from our $215 million share repurchase program. Now, turning to guidance, we estimate revenue for Q4 to be approximately $810 million up 14% year-over-year. For comparison purposes, a couple of reminders, our Q4 of last year, included an additional week a revenue of approximately $20 million as a result of FY '22, including 53 weeks. Also, from our previous remarks, approximately $60 million of product revenue recognized in the first quarter of FY '23 had been forecasted to close in the second half of the year. Adjusting for this impact of seasonality, our expected revenue growth in the second half of FY '23 would have been nearly 21% year-over-year. For FY '23, we are reiterating our annual revenue guidance of approximately $2.75 billion, an increase of 26% versus FY '22. Our operating profits remained solid, which is reflected in our Q4 operating profit outlook of $130 million or operating margin of approximately 16%. As a result of our performance in Q3 and outlook for Q4, we are increasing our operating profit outlook for the full year to $430 million. Operating margins are expected to be approximately 15.6%, reflecting a significant expansion from 10.8% last year. Revenue growth and strong product and subscription services gross margins have contributed to our strong operating profit and operating margin outlook for this year. During the first half of the year, our operating profits also benefited from less travel, higher attrition and slower than anticipated hiring. We do not expect that our operating profits will continue to benefit from these tailwinds next year. While the remains too early to provide guidance for FY '24, our current preliminary view is for operating margins to remain robust, around 14% to 15%. In closing, through our unwavering commitment to innovation, and customer service, we continue to be in a unique position of creating valuable outcomes for our customers, including dramatically reducing energy consumption and e-waste. With the strength of our portfolio of products and the power of our evergreen offerings, the opportunities in front of us remain compelling. With that, I will turn it back to Paul for Q&A. Yes, I'd appreciate that David. Look, we're quite pleased with the overall margin expansion that we've seen this year. And really key drivers of that being are strong revenue growth and product gross margins and subscription services gross margins. And I've talked about the fact that we did have some tailwinds. And we're thinking that it's approximately 1.5, 1.5 points to our operating profits this year. And really, it's kind of in three areas. We've talked about, as we were exiting last year, early in first half, we had higher attrition levels. And that really continued through Q1 and Q2. So, obviously, there's a benefit a pickup there. And then, there was slower than planned hiring during the first half as well. Now, we've made really good progress as you've seen on our hiring of talent, particularly in Q2 and this quarter. And obviously, that that's going to play into to next year in terms of how we're thinking about it. But then, in addition to that, we are planning for an increase in travel costs slightly. For example, we're doing our first in person sales kickoff in the New Year. We haven't had that in two years, so years or three years. So obviously, we're considering that as we're looking at our operating margin and profits for next year. Yes. So, I'll touch on the financial comparison and Nehal I hope you're doing well. When you think about the economics of our Phase 2 shipments to Meta, when comparing that to our Phase 1 shipments back in Q3 of last year, without getting into specifics, we did make some modifications to the deal structure of Phase 2, which actually resulted in less revenue and improved product gross margins, because obviously, you see the strength of our product gross margins this quarter, especially compared to Q3 of last year. If we'd use the same deal structure for Phase 2 that we used in, in Phase 1 revenue growth, frankly, would have been aligned with the remarks I made earlier in the year. Also, our product gross margin profile would have been similar to what we saw in Q3 of FY '22. So hopefully, that's helpful for you, Nehal in terms of how we're thinking about it. And if I could jump in, I think it's really important here to you know, just again, emphasize, the sustained and structural advantages that Pure has and being able to use the raw NAND Flash versus really being limited to enterprise SSDs such as most of our larger competitors are, especially in terms of navigating some of the near-term cost of volatility. And these advantages really go back to our direct Flash technology, which is the result of over a decade of software and hardware IP, and it gives us a sustained, structural advantages over the competitive set in terms of will A, being able to source a raw commodity NAND versus the higher priced enterprise SSDs, which don't always travel in line with one another in terms of the short-term. Number two, to be able to make much more efficient use of that NAND have faster time to market and just realize and deliver to customers significant reliability and performance advantages. And so, you'll add it all up, I think this set of advantages was a huge benefit in the early days. But as we look at today's technology set, QLC the roadmaps beyond QLC in terms of cost effective NAND, it's just absolutely requisite to be able to deliver that technology to customers and reliable performance efficient manner. Hey, Chris, this is Kevan. Look, when we think about Meta from an operating margin perspective, I think it'd be good to be thinking about that in terms of the Company profile on operating margins. I don't think that's a detractor or positive force. Where we saw the benefit was really on product gross margin, and again that that was a result of using a different deal structure. But I think from a company profile, operating margin standpoint, I would put that in that category."

This call is being broadcast live on the Pure Storage Investor Relations website and is being recorded for playback purposes. An archive of the webcast will be available on the IR website and is the property of Pure Storage. With that, I will turn the call over to our CEO, Charlie Giancarlo.\nCharlie Giancarlo: Hello, everyone and thank you for joining us today. Once again, we are very pleased with Pure\u2019s continued success as demonstrated by this quarter\u2019s strong results. Pure\u2019s Q2 revenue grew by 30% year-over-year with our subscription ARR up 31%. Our growth was balanced between the U.S. and our international markets, highlighting the broad and durable appeal of our portfolio and Pure\u2019s continuing ability to deliver simple, sustainable data storage and management solutions that every organization needs. Data is the modern linchpin of business transformation and Pure is the innovation and customer experience leader in one of the largest segments of technology investment. Building on our momentum, we introduced a number of major advancements in our portfolio during our annual Accelerate conference in Q2, generating strong excitement from current and potential customers. We unveiled FlashBlade S, our next generation FlashBlade, a significant step forward in performance, density and capacity, providing a modular architecture for increased efficiency and flexibility. FlashBlade S significantly expands the use cases for this product line, including a wide price performance range of file and object workloads, such as computational analytics and AI, image search and recognition, electronic design automation, media special effects, high-performance computing and data protection. FlashBlade S was designed with full evergreen capabilities, enabling the system to be continuously upgraded without disruption. With its launch in mid-Q2, FlashBlade S comprised 20% of all Q2 FlashBlade orders and customer feedback on the first installed units is excellent. In Q2, our Evergreen subscription portfolio was extended with the addition of Evergreen Flex, a new fleet level Evergreen offering. Evergreen Flex provides customers additional flexibility as they optimize their data infrastructure. It provides utilization pricing across a customer\u2019s entire storage environment with the ability for customers to purchase inexpensive storage hardware and consume capacity on a pay-as-you-go model. Evergreen Flex joins Evergreen Forever and Evergreen One, formerly known as Pure as-a-Service and is available across our Pure portfolio. We also released our Pure Fusion service for general availability this past quarter. Pure Fusion enables customers, managed service providers and cloud service providers to implement a cloud operating model for data storage management and offerings. The industry sometimes refers to this as infrastructure-as-code. Customers can use Pure Fusion to orchestrate and manage their entire fleet of Pure Storage, reducing cost and complexity and also offer storage services to their customers or developers through APIs, dramatically increasing developer productivity and corporate agility. While Pure Fusion is still in its early days, it has generated great interest from our largest enterprise and MSP customers. Pure Fusion is yet another example of how Pure continues to drive the data storage and management industry forward. Pure\u2019s Portworx software was chosen by GigaOm Radar reports for the third consecutive year as the leader for enterprise Kubernetes storage and cloud native Kubernetes data storage. Their in-depth analysis awarded us the highest scores among all market segments, deployment models and evaluation metrics. Portworx\u2019s ability to empower developers to deliver superior outcomes on every cloud, both public and private, is the reason that a large global credit card company dramatically expanded their use of Portworx this quarter to support their hybrid cloud data strategy. Portworx data services released just 3 months ago has likewise generated great interest, including many POCs and its first sales in Q2. Customers valued its simple one-stop shop for modern database operations, its rapid time to deploy and scale database as a service for developers and ability to avoid cloud lock-in due to its multi-cloud compatibility. As I have said before, Pure believes data storage and management is high tech, a fundamental component of critical infrastructure and we invest in it accordingly. We are reaping the rewards of delivering leading products and services in a massive market that was written off as a commodity by legacy competitors. In this uncertain macro environment, customers are especially looking for solutions that speed their digital transformation roadmaps while reducing their overhead and total cost of ownership. I have just returned from 2 weeks of customer and partner visits in Australia and Japan, including hosting a very successful Tokyo Accelerate event. In our Asia-Pacific theater as elsewhere, customers are simply blown away by the superior performance, reliability and simplicity of our products, and they rave about their entire experience with Pure. One customer who installed Pure to replace a competitor\u2019s all-flash product reported a tenfold improvement in performance, while also significantly reducing their labor and energy expenses. And now for the first time, I increasingly hear from international customers that they actively consider Pure specifically for our ability to drive down energy usage and e-waste. The demand for solutions that reduce customers\u2019 environmental footprint is now top of mind in a majority of international enterprises that we speak to. We added more than 350 new customers this past quarter. In addition to sustained growth of new customers in Enterprise and Commercial segments, we also saw very strong interest from public sector customers this quarter. Many of them cited sustainability and energy reduction goals as equal to their performance, price and reliability targets. One example is San Luis Obispo County\u2019s IT department, which reduced their data center storage footprint by 75% and power consumption by 59%, while substantially increasing their storage capacity. By replacing a competitor\u2019s all-flash systems with Pure, they also reduced their time dedicated to storage administration with Pure1 and enabled safe mode to protect their data infrastructure against cyber threats. Now, I will discuss the business environment as we see it today. I am pleased with our ability to deliver on our strategy of strong growth while increasing operating profit, all while navigating the external inflationary and supply chain environments without raising list prices. Our customers are continuing to expand their data storage with Pure and we continue to expand our customer base. We do however see signs of increased diligence of purchases by enterprise customers, resulting in some lengthening of sales cycle. Overall, I remain confident in our ability to take market share and to grow faster than the market. As reported last quarter, our hiring remains strong. Our attrition rates are below the rest of our industry peers and are reduced from the highs experienced this past spring. As companies around the world adjust to a post-COVID normal, we believe that investment in critical data infrastructure will remain central to their growth plans and that the dedication of our talented technology, sales, customer success and other core teams will enable Pure to outperform the market. Next week, we are officially kicking off our new hybrid work policy, which will have full teams come together in the office on specified days to collaborate, enhance creativity and increase employee engagement. Many of our development teams are already at over 50% in-office occupancy. Like everyone else at Pure, I am excited about our new Silicon Valley campus that we will be moving into this coming spring. I\u2019d now like to hand the mic over to our CFO, Kevan Krysler, for a detailed review of our numbers.\nKevan Krysler: Thank you, Charlie and good afternoon. We delivered strong financial results once again this quarter. Our ongoing commitment to innovation, including our recent introduction of FlashBlade S and our expanded Evergreen subscription business models have enabled us to deliver highly differentiated solutions that our customers are leveraging to accelerate their strategic objectives. The power of our technology and software enables our customers to grow and increase productivity. Our customers also deeply appreciate our ability and commitment to deliver our products with short lead times, not increase prices and substantially lower their energy requirements. These factors, among others, are why we believe demand for our solution portfolio continues to be strong despite a turbulent macro environment. Our U.S. business continues to deliver strong revenue growth, growing 31% with particular strength this quarter in both commercial and public sector. Revenue growth of 29% from our international business was also strong, even with FX headwinds due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. We continue to be pleased with meaningful contributions from new business. Our total customer count reflects the acquisition of more than 350 new customers this quarter and 56% of the U.S. Fortune 500 customers. Performance of our Evergreen subscription businesses and Portworx were solid as subscription annual recurring revenue, or ARR, grew 31% to $955 million. Remaining performance obligations or RPO grew 25% to $1.5 billion. Similar to the remarks we made last quarter our RPO growth compared to Q2 of last year reflects a reduction of approximately $32 million relating to product shipments for an outstanding commitment with one of our global system integrators. Excluding these product shipments, RPO grew 28% year-over-year. Our headcount has increased to 4,600 employees as our investments in talent continue to be disciplined and focused around our key business objectives. Now turning to specific financial results and discussion. Total revenue for the quarter grew 30% to approximately $647 million. Product revenue grew 28% and subscription services revenue grew approximately 35%. Subscription services revenue represented approximately 36% of total revenue. We continue to drive solid gross margin at 70.4% this quarter. High performance, reliability, simplicity and sustainability of our solutions are factors contributing to both our strong product gross margins of 69% this quarter and subscription services gross margins of nearly 73% this quarter. Importantly, we were also able to deliver these gross margins without passing price increases on to our customers. We achieved favorable operating profits of $106 million and operating margins of 16.4% this quarter. Now, let\u2019s turn to the balance sheet and cash flows. We ended the quarter with over $1.36 billion in cash. Cash flow from operations was over $159 million, resulting from the combination of strong sales, collections and increasing profitability. Capital expenditures were approximately $25 million during the quarter. We returned over $60 million of capital to repurchase approximately 2.4 million shares during the quarter. We have approximately $123 million remaining from our $250 million share repurchase program. Now, turning to guidance. We are pleased to have established a track record of strong performance in the dynamic and challenging environments. Demand signals for our solutions are solid and our visibility of opportunities is healthy. We estimate revenue in Q3 to be approximately $670 million, growing approximately 19% year-over-year and we expect operating profit to be approximately $85 million in Q3, representing approximately 12.7% operating margin. We are also raising our annual guidance for the full fiscal year. We now expect that revenue for FY \u201823 will be $2.75 billion, growing approximately 26% year-over-year. Operating profit is estimated to be approximately $390 million, representing approximately 14% operating margin. Also, as a reminder from our remarks last quarter, approximately $60 million of product revenue in the first quarter of this year was forecasted to close in the second half of our fiscal year. This impacts seasonality when comparing growth rates in our first half compared to our back half of this year. Our Q3 and updated annual guidance contemplates, based on our visibility, macro environment conditions, including factors such as demand signals, foreign currency and inflation. With time being such a critical asset for our customers, we continue to expect to deliver our solutions with short lead times despite supply chain challenges that have reduced slightly, but still exist. In closing, our data storage and management technologies and software are critical to accelerating our customers\u2019 digital transformation objectives. Customers continue to depend on us to innovate, to be flexible, to meet their needs quickly, to not raise prices and to reduce their energy consumption any waste. With that, I will turn it over to the operator so we can get to your questions. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.\nAaron Rakers: Yes, thank you very much and congratulations on the solid results. You guys raised the guidance for the full year, strong guidance in the fiscal third quarter, but clearly, there is a little bit of kind of commentary around the macro. I think, Charlie, you had mentioned that you did see some signs of lengthening maybe sales cycles, etcetera. So I am curious if you could kind of expand a little bit upon what you are exactly seeing from a demand profile in your pipeline? Have you seen kind of coming out of this quarter any kind of extension in deal cycles? Just any kind of incremental clarity you can provide on how you factored in the macro environment currently looking into this quarter? Can you hear, Charlie? I can hear you now, Charlie.\nCharlie Giancarlo: You could. Okay. Sorry, I guess we are having technical trouble. So let me start over again. I was talking to myself apparently for a while. We are very pleased obviously with the financial results we had this quarter and frankly, demand signals continue to be quite healthy. So we wanted to make sure we were very measured in the way that we were reflecting what we are seeing. While we are seeing a little bit of, let\u2019s say, second looks by companies, finance, perhaps stepping in for a second look at a deal and that is lengthening some of the enterprise sales cycles, but it\u2019s not changed the closing of the deals later in the process. And as I said, demand and pipeline looks very healthy. The way we look at this is we are market share takers in what is a very large market, slight perturbations in the growth of this market shouldn\u2019t affect dramatically our ability to transform pipeline into sales and continue to grow our pipeline. So we feel like we are very well positioned. We have a very broad portfolio. Our differentiation is only increasing right now. We are still the only player that can now take on hard disk at the secondary tier level, which is continues to be a strong area of growth for us. And now, honestly, our ability to provide a more sustainable product is in greater demand on a worldwide basis. So we are very bullish from the standpoint of being able to weather some amount of economic uncertainty.\nAaron Rakers: Yes, very good. And then as a quick follow-up, I wanted to touch maybe on some of the points you brought up there, portfolio differentiation and just portfolio expansion. The FlashBlade S product, you started off your prepared remarks just highlighting \u2013 it sounds like out of the gate very strong traction, 20% of your FlashBlade volumes. Where are you seeing exactly the most momentum from that product? And has that seen \u2013 have you seen any cannibalistic effect of your existing product portfolio or is this what I am trying to, I guess, get at is how expansion \u2013 how much expansion of your existing TAM does that bring to the table for Pure?\nKevan Krysler: Yes. Well, it is the next generation product. So I don\u2019t know that cannibalization is the right word. It\u2019s our next generation product in several quarters, it should be full replacement for the existing, the Generation 1 FlashBlade product. But it\u2019s a very significant expansion of the price performance range that the former that the Gen 1 product provided. So, it scales both up and down better in both capacity as well as in performance. And in fact, it\u2019s capable of multiple levels of performance in the same implementation. So, we really see it as dramatically expanding what our share of the original TAM deal brought out. And it really represents a broadening of the family of FlashBlade.\nAaron Rakers: Very good. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you, Aaron. Our next question comes from Simon Leopold from Raymond James.\nSimon Leopold: I wanted to see if maybe you could help us characterize how your customer base might be evolving? And what I am getting at here is you have talked in the past about moving up market and doing more business with larger enterprises and larger deals that I imagine could offset some weakening from smaller businesses. Is there some metrics you could share with us to help us understand the change in the profile of your customers?\nCharlie Giancarlo: Well, I think we continue to expand on all fronts. There is no \u2013 this quarter, commercial, what we call commercial and public sector were the stars of the quarter, but we continue to expand into enterprise and large enterprise, which was a process that we started a little over 3 years ago. My expectations is that we will continue to optimize each of those market segments and our business model to support each of those market segments as we go forward. But my expectations, over the longer term, is that the percentage of enterprise in our sales will continue to increase, simply because we started out as a commercial player and enterprise was something that we had to grow into. And our brand is continuing to build among those enterprise players. So on a longer-term basis, I\u2019d expect the percentage of our sales in enterprise and frankly, cloud to continue to increase, not because of any lack of success in commercial and public sector, just because of the size of those markets in general.\nKevan Krysler: Yes. And Simon, I think \u2013 this is Kevan. I\u2019d add on just a little bit more in terms of the traction we\u2019re getting with new business and new customers. And we saw some meaningful contribution to revenue from new customers across all customer segments this quarter, which was definitely a plus.\nSimon Leopold: And just as a quick follow-up. Your architecture, which is basically leveraging raw NAND rather than buying solid-state drives. Could you talk about whether you\u2019re seeing some benefit from maybe lower prices in the marketplace for that raw NAND because of weakness in verticals like PCs or smartphones, how much sort of shifting of production capacity and trends are you seeing even though there may be different products, is there any flexibility or fungibility of the manufacturing that is benefiting you.\nCharlie Giancarlo: Well, Simon, this is something that\u2019s been a hallmark for Pure since almost the very beginning since \u2013 ever since we started building our own digital flash modules, which is that we have a wide variety of suppliers for the raw NAND. We\u2019re able to leverage different levels of quality of that raw NAND without affecting the quality that we deliver to our customers. And that gives us a large degree of freedom in terms of the costs that we pay for the NAND as well as choice of supply. And it also tends to allow us to be able to take advantage of price declines on the NAND market faster than the rest of the competition. So yes, it\u2019s given \u2013 Lastly, what I\u2019ll mention is that it\u2019s also given this sort of tremendous energy advantage because we make better use of the flash, which allows us to produce products that require far less power than the competition. But I\u2019m going to invite our CTO, Rob, to chime in.\nRob Lee: Yes, Simon, just to add a couple of things there. Like Charlie said, the direct flash technology definitely opens up a much broader menu of NAND options for us to go and evaluate and incorporate into the products. We do drive a significant amount of efficiency, more efficiency than others would be able to achieve through SSDs out of our direct flash technology. The other thing I would point out is that now with the intro FlashBlade S as we\u2019ve gone over the years and standardized our technology on the same direct flash modules across the entire platform, we\u2019re going to realize some pretty significant benefits from this. One is certainly, the kind of scale and leverage that we have in terms of the development of the technology, but then number two, this is also going to allow us to move a bit more nimbly and intentionally, even more so than we do today as we navigate future NAND parts and generation. So net-net, it\u2019s a significant advantage for us all around.\nSimon Leopold: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thanks, Simon. Our next question comes from Shannon Cross from Credit Suisse. Shannon, please go ahead.\nShannon Cross: Thank you very much. Charlie, can you take a step back and talk about your thoughts regarding margin? And you obviously have a very leverageable model where revenue growth sort of flows through very quickly and drive a higher operating margin. But I\u2019m wondering how you think about investments in the business to continue to drive the strong revenue growth versus trying to increase your cash flow or over time, see the operating margin go up as it is because clearly, you have a good product that\u2019s well received that I don\u2019t know if you could invest even more, maybe you could either accelerate or at least continue the rapid revenue growth? And then I have a follow-up. Thank you.\nCharlie Giancarlo: Yes. Thank you, Shannon. We\u2019re actually always looking at this in terms of pricing and growth. Frankly, we believe we provide a very high-value product, and we do get a return. We think we get a premium of 10% or more, in general \u2013 in the market for the product and the value that we deliver in our product. I would say that we\u2019re generally fairly happy with the margins in the product margin in the range where we\u2019ve been over the last multiple quarters. We think it gives us a lot of flexibility to be able to win deals, especially new customers. We do invest in winning new customers without a doubt. Existing customers over time really understand the total cost of ownership that we deliver and our \u2013 and I think we received the value accordingly. So I think we have the right balance of investment versus margin at this point. Kevan, do you want to add?\nKevan Krysler: Yes, Shannon, I think I\u2019ll add just a couple of things, right? So when we think about the full year from an investment standpoint, I mean we\u2019re talking about 20% in terms of additional operating expense investment. And when we entered the year, we were very much committed to disciplined investment as well as addressing some of the inflationary impacts we were seeing. And those business objectives really haven\u2019t changed. Now our talent team has done a wonderful job this quarter. We had some great success in hiring talent. We\u2019re not where we\u2019d like to be, frankly, with our quota sellers, our quota-carrying sellers. And so that will be an area of focus for us in terms of hiring for the remainder of the year in investment. So we are expecting to see some higher investment levels really within our sales organization in the second half. And there is always some seasonality with our OpEx, especially in the fourth quarter as a result of our sales reps starting to earn their accelerators. So hopefully, that\u2019s helpful context for you.\nShannon Cross: Okay. Yes, thank you. And I\u2019m sorry if I missed it, I don\u2019t think I did. Can you give us an update on the meta relationships and opportunities with other hyperscalers? Thanks.\nCharlie Giancarlo: Sure. Meta relationship continues. We did \u2013 it wasn\u2019t terribly significant this quarter, although there were some shipments, and we continue to make progress slow and steady with other hyperscalers. Obviously, you\u2019ll be the first to hear when \u2013 assuming that we actually are able to solidify something solid.\nShannon Cross: Thank you.\nOperator: Thanks, Shannon. Our next question comes from Tim Long from Barclays. Tim, please go ahead.\nTim Long: Thank you. Two questions, if I could. First, on the subscription services side, another strong quarter and it sounds like some of the new platforms are really working. Maybe just \u2013 just give us a sense as you kind of transition some of the solutions towards more subscription. What are the pushbacks and what are the customers like about that? And then secondly, I did want to follow-up before you had a pretty nice win with a large telco customer. I think, for 5G. So just update us on that larger deal and also similar to the last question, are there any other large opportunities that seems like it could be a nice large new TAM for you guys to go after? Thank you.\nCharlie Giancarlo: Absolutely. Well, the numbers, I think on the subscription side, pretty much speak for themselves. I\u2019d say the largest hurdle that we have with customers is just that it\u2019s a very new way to buy. And it may very well be that other parts of their data center build, they build with CapEx. So it\u2019s a bit different from that standpoint. So I would say it is largely that it\u2019s new and different is the largest hurdle. In terms of the terms of the service capability, no \u2013 one additional one actually is the channel. It\u2019s also a new way for the channel to sell. And of course, the economics like any company going through a CapEx to OpEx transition, it takes time for them to adjust how they pay their sellers and for their sellers to adjust as well. So I would say, in general, it\u2019s just the newness of the OpEx model versus CapEx, both with customers and the channel that is probably the biggest hurdle. But we are seeing steady as you can see, steady growth and steady interest in it.\nKevan Krysler: Two additional things I\u2019d add to that, Tim, and maybe Charlie or Rob, you can jump in. But the expansion of Evergreen with Flex, I think that\u2019s going to be a big opportunity for us early days at this point. But then even more so with FlashBlade S and the additional features now with Evergreen that we\u2019ve enabled, I think, it\u2019s going to be pretty powerful as well. And I don\u2019t know if you want to add some commentary on that.\nRob Lee: Yes, absolutely, this is Rob. Let me answer that. So I think one of the biggest impacts that we have with S, Charlie talked about in his prepared remarks, significant step forward in performance capacity density, lowering of power consumption. That\u2019s all true. One of the biggest other impacts that we haven\u2019t covered yet is the additional flexibility that we\u2019ve introduced to the platform. By separating the compute and the storage elements, not only have we allowed customers to configure that really family of products at this point for different performance and capacity levels on day 1, but we\u2019ve also now opened up the customer as they evolve to grow independently performance or capacity as they need and that flexibility now allows us to introduce the full benefits of Evergreen forever to FlashBlade. And so we look at that as definitely going to be a tailwind as we look forward. On the 5G question, that \u2013 as you may know, we\u2019ve already made shipments against that account they are being deployed. The commentary that we\u2019re receiving back from the customer is excellent. So I expect more of the same in the future. But it does tend to be ordered in \u2013 ordered episodically as they build out.\nTim Long: Alright. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you, Tim. Our next question comes from Krish Sankar from Cowen & Company. Krish, please go ahead.\nKrish Sankar: Hi, thanks for taking my question. And Charlie and Kevan, congrats on executing really well in a very tough environment. So kudos you and your team.\nCharlie Giancarlo: Thanks, Krish.\nKrish Sankar: My first \u2013 thanks for that. Charlie, my first question is to the then you can talk about it. How should we think about enterprise demand beyond the January quarter? I know it\u2019s still early, but the main concern with investors seems to be that storage could be the next shoe to drop. So I\u2019m kind of wondering what you\u2019re hearing from your customer base about their IT spend budget for next year and another falloff for Kevan on operating margins.\nCharlie Giancarlo: Well, that\u2019s a tough question. I\u2019ll pull out my crystal ball. What we\u2019re generally hearing is from the enterprise customers is general optimism around the IT budget, meaning that they also see the questions around the economy, questions around recession. And I don\u2019t think we can answer this question uniformly around the world. I think Europe and in particular, the UK is different from Asia-Pac and different from the U.S. But in the U.S., I think general optimism that with digital transformation and the need for companies to really be able to compete in the new world that they have to continue investing in their IT environment. Data is the core of that being able to leverage their data. And so data infrastructure is important. So we\u2019re seeing general optimism there. I think Europe is going through somewhat different challenges with energy pricing and inflation. And that could be affected a bit more. And then Asia-Pac is a tale of many different countries. But I\u2019m expecting Asia-Pac absent some kind of geopolitical issue to continue to be a strong growth engine for us.\nKrish Sankar: Got it. Very helpful. And then a follow-up for Kevan, on the operating margin, and our congrats on raising the off margin guidance from 12% to 14%. I\u2019m just kind of curious to figure out what are the key drivers for it? I\u2019m just trying to understand the sustainability of an operating margin. And Kevan, if you can extend this question a little further. If hypothetically speaking, revenues are up 10% next year. How will op margins look? And conversely, if revenues were down 10% next year, how will op margin look.\nKevan Krysler: Yes. Thanks, Krish. I mean \u2013 let\u2019s first talk about the performance around op margins, which yes, we\u2019re very pleased with. And again, when we think about our strategy and business objectives, it\u2019s really about growing our top line and balancing that with increasing profitability in a sustainable way. And we\u2019re doing that, and we feel very comfortable with that. This year is a fine example of being able to grow both our top line while seeing some expansion in terms of our operating margin. And we believe that\u2019s sustainable as we look out beyond this year. And we\u2019ve got a track record of that, and it\u2019s not without investing heavily. I view a 20% increase in investment this year, very healthy, and we\u2019re really driving that across our innovation with our engineers. I\u2019ve talked a little bit about our sellers. We\u2019ve got more work to do to invest in our selling organization, and we look forward to doing that in the second half. And then on scale and infrastructure, we\u2019re doing a nice job continuing to invest in that area. And so without getting into details beyond this year, I would just say that I have a lot of confidence that it\u2019s sustainable.\nKrish Sankar: Thanks a lot, Kevan.\nKevan Krysler: Thanks, Krish.\nOperator: Thank you, Krish. Our next question comes from Nehal Chokshi from Northland Capital Markets. Nehal, please go ahead.\nNehal Chokshi: Yes. Thank you. Great quarter and really very impressive guidance given the trends that everybody is citing. I\u2019m not going to beat that dead horse, clearly a very strong pipeline that you have. A couple of quick things. So dollar-based net revenue retention rate on your ARR, you did give some color a couple of quarters ago that was a 120% plus. Has there been any material change on that?\nKevan Krysler: High level, no material change, and we update that, Nehal, once a year.\nNehal Chokshi: Okay. Great. And then I do want to double click on the sales hiring environment. It does seem like things are improving, but your sales hiring has not improved in material way yet. Why is that? And why do you expect that to be able to improve going forward?\nCharlie Giancarlo: Well, I think our sales hiring has improved, but we\u2019re continuing to scale. And we are a bit behind. No doubt, we\u2019re a bit behind where we\u2019d like to be or behind plan. But we caught up quite a bit in Q1 to where plan had been. So we\u2019re narrowing that delta, if you will, between where we are in plan. I do agree with you. I think the environment is getting a bit better on the sales hiring side.\nNehal Chokshi: Okay. And then finally, just a follow-up to that is that clearly, you\u2019ve been putting up very strong results that imply that your sales productivity has been improving massively. Is there room for further sales productivity improvements here?\nCharlie Giancarlo: Short answer is absolutely. I think we still have a ways to go to become best-in-class there, and we have plans in place to that we think are the elements that will allow us to continue to improve sales productivity.\nNehal Chokshi: Great. Thank you. Congratulations.\nCharlie Giancarlo: Thanks, Nehal.\nOperator: Our next question comes from David Vogt from UBS. David, please go ahead.\nDavid Vogt: Great. Thanks, guys for taking my question. If we just could go back to the [Technical Difficulty]. Can you guys hear me?\nCharlie Giancarlo: Yes, yes, we can hear you. Go ahead, David. He can't hear us though. Hello. While we move on to the next question, and if he comes back on we will.\nDavid Vogt: Wait. Hey, guys, I'm here.\nCharlie Giancarlo: Okay, good. Yes. We can hear you, David, go ahead. \nDavid Vogt: Yes. So just want to go back to the macro and the conversation around elongated sales cycles. When you talk to customers, are you seeing any \u2013 again, it just out. [Technical Difficulty]\nCharlie Giancarlo: Please go ahead, David. Yes, let\u2019s move on to Amit, if we can.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Amit Daryanani from Evercore. Amit, please go ahead.\nAmit Daryanani: Thanks for taking my questions. I guess the first question I have is, you beat July quarter were about $12 million versus what you folks initially said, but you\u2019re raising the full year by like $90 million or so. So you\u2019re clearly thinking of the back half expectations up a fair bit beyond just the beat? And despite only all the macro commentary you had, I\u2019d love to sort of understand what are the levers of the upside you are seeing? Is it better share gains? Is it more of the hyperscale or meta ramps that are happening or it\u2019s something else? I\u2019d love to just understand what\u2019s [indiscernible] numbers well above and beyond what you [indiscernible]?\nCharlie Giancarlo: Yes. I\u2019ll start, and I\u2019m going to invite Kevan to join in. We do a very bottoms up fundamental analysis of everything from everything from pipeline to deal to the field forecasts and so forth, and it\u2019s really based on that. So if I were to up-level it towards more of the macro, I would say, yes, it\u2019s continued share gains. And as I might have mentioned earlier in this call, we are still roughly a $2.5 billion $2.75 billion knock on wood, a vendor in a $50 billion market. Our opportunity is based on gaining share and less on the overall size of the market at any particular time. So Kevan, do you want to.\nKevan Krysler: Yes. I mean, I think I\u2019d add a little bit here. So we continue to have relatively good visibility beyond just one quarter out. I think our sales leadership team has done a really nice job focusing on demand gen and pipeline beyond one quarter. The sales team has really got a good pulse on the business right now around our pipeline, our opportunities ability to convert what that looks like. That, in combination with our track record, both with our existing customers and be able to expand within our existing customers as well as the continued traction we\u2019re seeing with the new business, this is just really how the second half shapes out based on what we saw exiting Q2 and looking out to Q3 and the rest of the year. So hopefully, that\u2019s helpful for you.\nAmit Daryanani: That is super helpful. And I know there is a bunch of moving parts over here. Kevan, I guess, from your perspective, I think the question that folks will probably have it. In the back half of the year, you\u2019re sort of implying low double-digit kind of top line growth versus the 40% in the first half. I know there are a few moving parts to compare to that decile. But maybe just help contextualize what\u2019s driving the deceleration in the back half versus the first half?\nKevan Krysler: Yes. It\u2019s a great question. And obviously, we\u2019ve had a fantastic first half and leading to raising our annual guidance to 26% year-over-year. But you\u2019re right, as we think about growth in the second half, there is a few things to be thinking about and a few factors to keep in mind here. One is that the second half is impacted by seasonality of that deal we mentioned previously around $60 million. There is actually a couple of deals that we delivered in Q1, really contemplated for second half. And so that\u2019s going to impact second half growth by approximately 6 points. So that\u2019s important to consider. I think the next factor to consider is our comps are getting much tougher in the second half due to the substantial growth and the additional week we had last year. Now just a reminder, in terms of our growth last year in Q3 and Q4, were 37% and 41%, respectively, which was just outstanding. And then lastly, as we mentioned, we\u2019re navigating some incremental headwinds as we think about the elongation of the sales cycle, but we\u2019ve contemplated that in our guide. So that with FX, I feel pretty good in terms of how we\u2019re looking in terms of second half growth.\nAmit Daryanani: Perfect. Thank you. Congrats on a great quarter.\nCharlie Giancarlo: Appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you, Amit. Our next question comes from Meta Marshall from Morgan Stanley. Meta, please go ahead.\nMeta Marshall: Great. Thanks. Charlie, you mentioned it again on the call, but I just wanted to get a sense of on the power consumption advantages that you guys have are just kind of green energy angle where or what type of customer type is that having the most success with? You mentioned Europe last quarter? Is it having any increase prevalence or acceptance with cloud customers? And then maybe second, you guys have clearly talked about a little bit of elongation of deal cycle. Just wondering if there is any different in deal types, whether you\u2019re seeing customers want to move more towards Evergreen or kind of pay as you grow versus kind of whatever purchasing model they were looking at before? Have we seen any changes in what type of purchasing they are looking to make. Thanks.\nCharlie Giancarlo: Yes. Great. Thanks, Meta. On the energy side, there are several different customer types that are focused on energy. One I would say our large reporting companies that are now needing to report on their own ESG environment, and that\u2019s been pushed down into their data center operations, which tends to be a very large part of their energy utilization. The second, I would say, is countries now with energy in security. So that covers a lot of Europe right now. It\u2019s not just the price of energy that\u2019s causing them to take a look at their energy bills and so forth. It\u2019s now also the availability of energy, making them quite nervous about how much energy their entire environment takes up. But certainly, a big part of that, again, is in their data center. And then third, I\u2019d say is it\u2019s government. Government worldwide, governments worldwide now are very focused on energy reduction, and so we\u2019re seeing a lot of it there. In Japan, it was palpable, and it also fits if you will, the Japanese ethic for smaller, more compact, more efficient, more reliable capabilities, which we fit really quite perfectly. So I\u2019d say the energy sensitivity is large and growing, probably not surprising to this audience, larger internationally currently than it is in the U.S. but growing in the U.S. as well. On the deal cycle standpoint, we started to see it earlier, I would say starting around mid-quarter, we started to see it and then it increased through the quarter. The deal cycles were just taking another week or two weeks. Generally, all of those deals closed. So, it wasn\u2019t a demand issue. And so far, the approvals are still going through, but there definitely was on average, a lengthening of the deal process.\nKevan Krysler: Yes. And I would say \u2013 this is Kevan. I would add a couple of things. I think the elongation I would really point that more to the enterprise, larger enterprise segment. We didn\u2019t see a lot of that, frankly, on the commercial and public sector side. So, I think that\u2019s an important clarification. I think the other thing you had asked, which we absolutely are seeing and we are well positioned for is our customers looking for more flexibility in how they structure their deals. And I would say absolutely. And I think our timing of Evergreen Flex bringing another option for customers and how they might want to consume our technology and solutions is really resonating. But we are having a fair amount of conversations with our customers around flexibility.\nMeta Marshall: Great. Thanks.\nOperator: Thanks Meta. Our next question comes from Wamsi Mohan from Bank of America. Wamsi, please go ahead.\nWamsi Mohan: Yes. Thank you and congrats on the solid results. If we look at your guidance here, it sort of implies product revenue grow about 20% or a little bit higher. And when we look at your long-term model, that really implies software or subscription growing at 30% plus and becoming more than 50% of revenues. So, as we look into next year and further out, should we be thinking that product meaningfully decelerates, or is a 20% product revenue growth sustainable from share gains? And I have a follow-up.\nCharlie Giancarlo: Yes. My opinion, Wamsi, is that product growth will continue. Again, we are still a relatively small player in a very large market. And so share gains continue to be a major growth item for us or growth sector plus there is the option or the opportunity to start selling more into the hyperscale environment, whether the top 10 hyperscalers. And if each one of those that gets cracked really would be a meaningful revenue accelerant. So, on the product side. So, no, we are looking at both as meaningful growth factors for us.\nWamsi Mohan: Okay. Thanks Charlie. And then if we think about your operating margin performance in the quarter, relative to your expectation, you got a $12 million top line beat, but you had a multiple add on your operating income dollar delta on your beat. And I\u2019m just wondering if there was anything that you would call out specifically around the operating margin performance. And as we look at the back half of the year, I know the revenue growth is decelerating, but generally speaking, like when you think about the margin profile there, anything you can help us to bridge the sequential margins, that would be helpful. Thank you.\nKevan Krysler: Yes. Thanks Wamsi. I think the primary factor \u2013 I probably want to highlight around our investments for the second half. And then overall, when we think about our operating expenses for the year and the growth is really around continuing to invest in our sellers. And we have mentioned that before. But that is an area where, for Q2, arguably, I would have liked to have been further along in terms of where we are with our investment profile on the sales side with our sellers. But we will make that up. I feel confident on that and we will see that through our investments as you look at the second half.\nWamsi Mohan: Okay. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you, Wamsi. Our next question comes from Matt Sheerin from Stifel. Matt, please go ahead.\nMatt Sheerin: Yes. Thank you. I have a follow-up, Charlie, on your comments regarding customer expansion in addition to the new logo adds. Can you comment on the progress you are seeing an increasing spend within existing customers, particularly large enterprises due to the expanding products and services within your portfolio and the opportunity for that going forward?\nCharlie Giancarlo: Absolutely. That is another major growth vector for us is simply the number of large enterprise logos that we have. I think it kind of hides a big opportunity for us in that. Our wallet share on average in those large enterprises is still relatively small. I mean obviously, there are a handful of them where we are the majority of their spend in the storage area. But for the vast majority of those enterprise logos, we still have a lot of opportunity ahead of us. And frankly, with our customers to know us they still love us. Their experience with Pure is very, very good. And because of that, we get, I think exceptional opportunities every time another one of their storage properties comes up for renewal. So, it is a major area of growth for us and I expect that to continue to pay dividends for quite some time.\nMatt Sheerin: Okay. Thank you. And just for my follow-up, could you just comment on the supply environment. I mean you really haven\u2019t called that out as an issue relative to your competitors. I know you have got a smaller footprint in terms of components, and you have managed that very well. But any sort of hiccups or incremental pluses or minuses or negatives there?\nCharlie Giancarlo: I would say that in general and on average, the situation has ameliorated somewhat. That is \u2013 it\u2019s not quite, it hasn\u2019t gotten worse. And in fact, if anything, it\u2019s gotten a little better, but it\u2019s very uneven. In other words, there are some components that have become much more widely available, shorter lead times, but many others that are still on allocation and we still get de-commits every now and then. So, the number of de-commits are down. Things are a little bit easier, but it\u2019s still \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t say that we are out of the woods yet. That being said, we expect it to continue to improve.\nKevan Krysler: Yes. And I think it\u2019s all about our confidence in our track record of delivering timely to our customers, which is so critical for them as they are kind of working through accelerating what they need to do from a digital transformation standpoint and we don\u2019t see that changing. And again, the challenges we are having would be outside, obviously, of NAND and DRAM to be clear as well.\nMatt Sheerin: Got it. Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jason Ader from William Blair. Jason, please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hey. Good morning. Good afternoon. This is Sebastian on for Jason. I just wanted to ask a little bit more about the Evergreen Flex offering. What is sort of the target customer for that offering? And what has been the initial reaction from the channel or from customers that are looking to adopt it?\nCharlie Giancarlo: Yes. Thanks. So, Evergreen Flex is really targeted at those customers that we are open and interested in a subscription model that is a pay-as-you-go model, but whose internal financial philosophy was really based on CapEx. So, you can think of, in some cases, managed service providers. You can think of a large enterprise where I had mentioned on an earlier question that there \u2013 the model for the rest of their data center is CapEx. And they just couldn\u2019t make the full jump over to an OpEx model or at least not yet. And this gives them the ability \u2013 gives them several things. One is it gives them the ability to buy on CapEx, but to really reserve a lot of their spending for when they actually start using the product. The second and this one is more subtle and more important to many customers. Flex is really calculated on a full fleet environment across their entire environment rather than on an array by an array in capability. And what that means is it gives them greater economics, more efficiency, and it gives them much greater flexibility, Evergreen [ph] Flex as they build out their data infrastructure. Rob, do you want to add?\nRob Lee: Yes. I just wanted to jump in and add here for a second. We introduced Flex at the same time that we rebranded and we renamed some of our other subscription offerings to bring them all under the Evergreen umbrella. And that would be Evergreen forever, Flex and then Evergreen One, formerly known as Pure-as-a-Service. And one of the reasons that we did this is it really is a spectrum of ways that customers can get the benefits of the Evergreen architecture and the services we are able to deliver there. And just to put this in perspective, right. We look at this as a spectrum all the way from one end where you have got, as Charlie mentioned, a more CapEx-oriented customer, more traditional hardware sale that\u2019s seeing the benefits of Evergreen through the Forever program, where those assets are being constantly modernized, hardware and software non-disruptively, they get access to future evolution and growth without worry there. On the other end of the spectrum, you have got customers that are fully bought into the cloud operating model, want to effectively turn the keys over to Pure to go and run and manage and say, \u201cHey, we just want to interact based on a performance SLA, capacity basis with full consumption level flexibility.\u201d And then in the middle, you have customers that are more in the camp that Charlie was discussing where either as a stepping stone to get to the full cloud operating model, they see the benefits of Flex owning title to the hardware upfront, but seeing the benefits that Flex can offer in terms of flexibility to grow, evolve as well as redeploy assets across their fleet. And so what we really see with this enhanced and more, I would say, consolidated Evergreen family is introducing a variety of ways for customers to realize the benefits of the core architecture wherever they are on that journey to the cloud operating model.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got it. That\u2019s really helpful. Maybe just a quick follow-up on that point, I guess now that you have the sort of middle offering, is this going to be a big driver you think of new customer additions, or was this something that existing customers were asking for and it\u2019s going to be a big driver of expansions within those accounts? Can you help me think about how you are thinking about those aspects?\nCharlie Giancarlo: Yes. I really think it\u2019s both that certainly for existing customers that \u2013 and we have reported this in the past that we are looking at Evergreen One, but at the end, fell back to CapEx because of their unfamiliarity with that buying model. We think Evergreen Flexes now gives them that opportunity to get into a capacity-oriented subscription model. And secondly, no doubt, for customers that \u2013 or for prospects that want to try Pure, but want to do so on an as-you-go basis, I think it can open up new opportunities for us.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great. Very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you, Sebastian. Our next question comes from Tom Blakey from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Tom, please go ahead.\nTom Blakey: Couple of questions here. I think just listening to Rob talk about the change in products. I mean going forward, is it fair to say that the strength that we are seeing in product and obviously early in share gains, Charlie, will be coming from more of a subscription-based sale. Maybe this kind of software model last question here, just the precursor, holding back product growth, so strengthen long-term deferred here in the quarter. So, going forward, we can expect some mechanisms there, just going out maybe in the fiscal \u201824. Is that something we can expect in terms of the product revenue growth? And I have a follow-up on the service side.\nKevan Krysler: Well, we definitely believe that subscription should outpace product growth. That\u2019s been our \u2013 that\u2019s our long-range plan and certainly what we believe. But I would also remind everybody on the call that, in fact, our Evergreen subscription, the entire range of it, even the Evergreen Forever, which is attached to a CapEx sale does in fact, over time reduce the CapEx sale. And that\u2019s because we never have to replace an existing, so customer never has to replace an existing system. So, many \u2013 the storage industry, a significant portion of their sales is just selling a new system to replace an old system. We always see that in our subscription line. We don\u2019t see that in a \u2013 you don\u2019t see that in a product sale line. You see that in growth in subscription. So, it\u2019s a different way to sell product. We only sell it once. The customer never has to buy it a second time.\nTom Blakey: Okay. Great. I thought the upfront portion of the subscription sales was recognized in product, not all-in. And then so\u2026\nKevan Krysler: You are right. It\u2019s subscription. So, when we do an Evergreen One transaction, the entire value would be reflected as a subscription. Evergreen Flex, the hardware portion obviously would be in product, but the consumption piece would be in subscription. And then for Evergreen, Evergreen Forever, all of the Evergreen Forever attached for that subscription is reflected as subscription revenue. Hopefully, that\u2019s helpful for you.\nTom Blakey: Very clear, Kevan. Thank you. And then second question, I guess related more to the services side. We know this is where the data services and workloads and basically your overall software portfolio is there. Any commentary you can give in terms of maybe you are getting a little more steep here? Any like type of up-sell callouts you can call maybe an attach rate of software to new enterprise deals now? Any type of like help you can give that can give us comfort in terms of continued strong growth here on the services line as it relates to software would be helpful. Thank you.\nKevan Krysler: Absolutely. Well, we are seeing a large fraction, probably more than 50% of the software sales are going to existing customers, but a significant amount are going to new customers as well. And I would say that also, even within existing customers, it may be a new buyer within that customer account. I would say that a large fraction are into enterprise customers more so than on the commercial side and a small, but increasing amount coming from channel source.\nTom Blakey: Alright. Thanks Kevan. Thank you.\nOperator: Thanks Tom. Our last question comes from Rod Hall from Goldman Sachs. Rob, please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hey guys. Thanks for squeezing me in. This is Bala on for Rod. Congrats on a good quarter. I double click on the guidance, really strong guidance for the second half. Implied Q4 guidance, it looks like it\u2019s up meaningfully from what you are thinking before. I am just wondering if there is any large deal. I know you mentioned that telco deal got back and then Meta ramp, I know you said Meta could be lumpy and then it didn\u2019t do much business this quarter. So, could one of those large deals be helping in Q4, that\u2019s why there is in guidance? And I have a follow-up.\nKevan Krysler: Yes. Thank you. A couple of things. Meta hasn\u2019t changed in terms of our remarks earlier. I think when we were coming into the year and our view on Meta. So, that hasn\u2019t changed meaningfully. And then in terms of how we are thinking about the second half, we will walk through that a fair amount in terms of how we are thinking about it. Our approach hasn\u2019t changed. We continue to evaluate and analyze our pipeline and opportunities. We are staying very close with the sales leadership team who have a very good pulse on the business. I wouldn\u2019t call out anything specific as we think about implied Q4 on any particular deals. It\u2019s just where we are falling out based on the visibility we have over the next two quarters or the remainder of the year.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. Thanks Kevan. Follow-up, product gross margins at 69%, still very strong, but down slightly, only slightly from last quarter. I understand FlashBlade new product, FlashBlade S, that could carry lower margins. So, maybe it\u2019s that. But I am just wondering, given your commentary about not planning to increase the list prices for your products. I am just wondering what are you seeing in terms of competition, are you seeing any increase in intensity at all?\nCharlie Giancarlo: Look, we are having some great success in terms of the opportunities we are in and winning those opportunities. I have said and been very consistent with my remarks on product gross margin that the high-60s is our sweet spot, and we continue to be in our sweet spot of product gross margins. Frankly, when I start getting into the 70s, it\u2019s a bit hot in terms of sustainability and what we can do with our customers. So, I actually like where we are in terms of our product gross margin profile, if that\u2019s helpful.\nUnidentified Analyst: Alright. Thank you.\nCharlie Giancarlo: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Alright. Thank you, Bala. This concludes the question-and-answer session. At this time, I will turn the call back over to Charlie for closing remarks.\nEnd of Q&A:\nCharlie Giancarlo: Well, as I hope we have been able to convey, we believe Pure Storage is well positioned to grow both in the near and in the long-term. We have this unique combination of product portfolio and operational rigor to continue to lead our industry, and we continue to improve our game every quarter. We enable organizations everywhere to build a cloud operating model for their private and hybrid cloud infrastructure. We lead in solutions for the all-flash data center. We have the most advanced services and tools to automate data management for both traditional and modern cloud native applications. And we are definitely the clear sustainability and energy reduction leader now. I am deeply appreciative to all of our employees for their innovation and their diligence to our partners and suppliers for their ongoing partnership to our customers for entrusting Pure Storage with their mission-critical data storage and management needs and to all of you that follow us so closely each and every quarter. Thank you all very much and have a wonderful rest of your day.\nOperator: That concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Rob Lee",
            "content": "Yes, Simon, just to add a couple of things there. Like Charlie said, the direct flash technology definitely opens up a much broader menu of NAND options for us to go and evaluate and incorporate into the products. We do drive a significant amount of efficiency, more efficiency than others would be able to achieve through SSDs out of our direct flash technology. The other thing I would point out is that now with the intro FlashBlade S as we've gone over the years and standardized our technology on the same direct flash modules across the entire platform, we're going to realize some pretty significant benefits from this. One is certainly, the kind of scale and leverage that we have in terms of the development of the technology, but then number two, this is also going to allow us to move a bit more nimbly and intentionally, even more so than we do today as we navigate future NAND parts and generation. So net-net, it's a significant advantage for us all around. Yes, absolutely, this is Rob. Let me answer that. So I think one of the biggest impacts that we have with S, Charlie talked about in his prepared remarks, significant step forward in performance capacity density, lowering of power consumption. That's all true. One of the biggest other impacts that we haven't covered yet is the additional flexibility that we've introduced to the platform. By separating the compute and the storage elements, not only have we allowed customers to configure that really family of products at this point for different performance and capacity levels on day 1, but we've also now opened up the customer as they evolve to grow independently performance or capacity as they need and that flexibility now allows us to introduce the full benefits of Evergreen forever to FlashBlade. And so we look at that as definitely going to be a tailwind as we look forward. On the 5G question, that \u2013 as you may know, we've already made shipments against that account they are being deployed. The commentary that we're receiving back from the customer is excellent. So I expect more of the same in the future. But it does tend to be ordered in \u2013 ordered episodically as they build out. Yes. I just wanted to jump in and add here for a second. We introduced Flex at the same time that we rebranded and we renamed some of our other subscription offerings to bring them all under the Evergreen umbrella. And that would be Evergreen forever, Flex and then Evergreen One, formerly known as Pure-as-a-Service. And one of the reasons that we did this is it really is a spectrum of ways that customers can get the benefits of the Evergreen architecture and the services we are able to deliver there.

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Charlie Giancarlo",
            "content": "Hello, everyone and thank you for joining us today. Once again, we are very pleased with Pure's continued success as demonstrated by this quarter's strong results. Pure's Q2 revenue grew by 30% year-over-year with our subscription ARR up 31%. Our growth was balanced between the U.S. and our international markets, highlighting the broad and durable appeal of our portfolio and Pure's continuing ability to deliver simple, sustainable data storage and management solutions that every organization needs. Data is the modern linchpin of business transformation and Pure is the innovation and customer experience leader in one of the largest segments of technology investment. Building on our momentum, we introduced a number of major advancements in our portfolio during our annual Accelerate conference in Q2, generating strong excitement from current and potential customers. We unveiled FlashBlade S, our next generation FlashBlade, a significant step forward in performance, density and capacity, providing a modular architecture for increased efficiency and flexibility. FlashBlade S significantly expands the use cases for this product line, including a wide price performance range of file and object workloads, such as computational analytics and AI, image search and recognition, electronic design automation, media special effects, high-performance computing and data protection. FlashBlade S was designed with full evergreen capabilities, enabling the system to be continuously upgraded without disruption. With its launch in mid-Q2, FlashBlade S comprised 20% of all Q2 FlashBlade orders and customer feedback on the first installed units is excellent. In Q2, our Evergreen subscription portfolio was extended with the addition of Evergreen Flex, a new fleet level Evergreen offering. Evergreen Flex provides customers additional flexibility as they optimize their data infrastructure. It provides utilization pricing across a customer's entire storage environment with the ability for customers to purchase inexpensive storage hardware and consume capacity on a pay-as-you-go model. Evergreen Flex joins Evergreen Forever and Evergreen One, formerly known as Pure as-a-Service and is available across our Pure portfolio. We also released our Pure Fusion service for general availability this past quarter. Pure Fusion enables customers, managed service providers and cloud service providers to implement a cloud operating model for data storage management and offerings. The industry sometimes refers to this as infrastructure-as-code. Customers can use Pure Fusion to orchestrate and manage their entire fleet of Pure Storage, reducing cost and complexity and also offer storage services to their customers or developers through APIs, dramatically increasing developer productivity and corporate agility. While Pure Fusion is still in its early days, it has generated great interest from our largest enterprise and MSP customers. Pure Fusion is yet another example of how Pure continues to drive the data storage and management industry forward. Pure's Portworx software was chosen by GigaOm Radar reports for the third consecutive year as the leader for enterprise Kubernetes storage and cloud native Kubernetes data storage. Their in-depth analysis awarded us the highest scores among all market segments, deployment models and evaluation metrics. Portworx's ability to empower developers to deliver superior outcomes on every cloud, both public and private, is the reason that a large global credit card company dramatically expanded their use of Portworx this quarter to support their hybrid cloud data strategy. Portworx data services released just 3 months ago has likewise generated great interest, including many POCs and its first sales in Q2. Customers valued its simple one-stop shop for modern database operations, its rapid time to deploy and scale database as a service for developers and ability to avoid cloud lock-in due to its multi-cloud compatibility. As I have said before, Pure believes data storage and management is high tech, a fundamental component of critical infrastructure and we invest in it accordingly. We are reaping the rewards of delivering leading products and services in a massive market that was written off as a commodity by legacy competitors. In this uncertain macro environment, customers are especially looking for solutions that speed their digital transformation roadmaps while reducing their overhead and total cost of ownership. I have just returned from 2 weeks of customer and partner visits in Australia and Japan, including hosting a very successful Tokyo Accelerate event. In our Asia-Pacific theater as elsewhere, customers are simply blown away by the superior performance, reliability and simplicity of our products, and they rave about their entire experience with Pure. One customer who installed Pure to replace a competitor's all-flash product reported a tenfold improvement in performance, while also significantly reducing their labor and energy expenses. And now for the first time, I increasingly hear from international customers that they actively consider Pure specifically for our ability to drive down energy usage and e-waste. The demand for solutions that reduce customers' environmental footprint is now top of mind in a majority of international enterprises that we speak to. We added more than 350 new customers this past quarter. In addition to sustained growth of new customers in Enterprise and Commercial segments, we also saw very strong interest from public sector customers this quarter. Many of them cited sustainability and energy reduction goals as equal to their performance, price and reliability targets. One example is San Luis Obispo County's IT department, which reduced their data center storage footprint by 75% and power consumption by 59%, while substantially increasing their storage capacity. By replacing a competitor's all-flash systems with Pure, they also reduced their time dedicated to storage administration with Pure1 and enabled safe mode to protect their data infrastructure against cyber threats. Now, I will discuss the business environment as we see it today. I am pleased with our ability to deliver on our strategy of strong growth while increasing operating profit, all while navigating the external inflationary and supply chain environments without raising list prices. Our customers are continuing to expand their data storage with Pure and we continue to expand our customer base. We do however see signs of increased diligence of purchases by enterprise customers, resulting in some lengthening of sales cycle. Overall, I remain confident in our ability to take market share and to grow faster than the market. As reported last quarter, our hiring remains strong. Our attrition rates are below the rest of our industry peers and are reduced from the highs experienced this past spring. As companies around the world adjust to a post-COVID normal, we believe that investment in critical data infrastructure will remain central to their growth plans and that the dedication of our talented technology, sales, customer success and other core teams will enable Pure to outperform the market. Next week, we are officially kicking off our new hybrid work policy, which will have full teams come together in the office on specified days to collaborate, enhance creativity and increase employee engagement. Many of our development teams are already at over 50% in-office occupancy. Like everyone else at Pure, I am excited about our new Silicon Valley campus that we will be moving into this coming spring. I'd now like to hand the mic over to our CFO, Kevan Krysler, for a detailed review of our numbers. You could. Okay. Sorry, I guess we are having technical trouble. So let me start over again. I was talking to myself apparently for a while. We are very pleased obviously with the financial results we had this quarter and frankly, demand signals continue to be quite healthy. So we wanted to make sure we were very measured in the way that we were reflecting what we are seeing. While we are seeing a little bit of, let's say, second looks by companies, finance, perhaps stepping in for a second look at a deal and that is lengthening some of the enterprise sales cycles, but it's not changed the closing of the deals later in the process. And as I said, demand and pipeline looks very healthy. The way we look at this is we are market share takers in what is a very large market, slight perturbations in the growth of this market shouldn't affect dramatically our ability to transform pipeline into sales and continue to grow our pipeline. So we feel like we are very well positioned. We have a very broad portfolio. Our differentiation is only increasing right now. We are still the only player that can now take on hard disk at the secondary tier level, which is continues to be a strong area of growth for us. And now, honestly, our ability to provide a more sustainable product is in greater demand on a worldwide basis. So we are very bullish from the standpoint of being able to weather some amount of economic uncertainty. Well, I think we continue to expand on all fronts. There is no \u2013 this quarter, commercial, what we call commercial and public sector were the stars of the quarter, but we continue to expand into enterprise and large enterprise, which was a process that we started a little over 3 years ago. My expectations is that we will continue to optimize each of those market segments and our business model to support each of those market segments as we go forward. But my expectations, over the longer term, is that the percentage of enterprise in our sales will continue to increase, simply because we started out as a commercial player and enterprise was something that we had to grow into. And our brand is continuing to build among those enterprise players. So on a longer-term basis, I'd expect the percentage of our sales in enterprise and frankly, cloud to continue to increase, not because of any lack of success in commercial and public sector, just because of the size of those markets in general. Well, Simon, this is something that's been a hallmark for Pure since almost the very beginning since \u2013 ever since we started building our own digital flash modules, which is that we have a wide variety of suppliers for the raw NAND. We're able to leverage different levels of quality of that raw NAND without affecting the quality that we deliver to our customers. And that gives us a large degree of freedom in terms of the costs that we pay for the NAND as well as choice of supply. And it also tends to allow us to be able to take advantage of price declines on the NAND market faster than the rest of the competition. So yes, it's given \u2013 Lastly, what I'll mention is that it's also given this sort of tremendous energy advantage because we make better use of the flash, which allows us to produce products that require far less power than the competition. But I'm going to invite our CTO, Rob, to chime in. Yes. Thank you, Shannon. We're actually always looking at this in terms of pricing and growth. Frankly, we believe we provide a very high-value product, and we do get a return. We think we get a premium of 10% or more, in general \u2013 in the market for the product and the value that we deliver in our product. I would say that we're generally fairly happy with the margins in the product margin in the range where we've been over the last multiple quarters. We think it gives us a lot of flexibility to be able to win deals, especially new customers. We do invest in winning new customers without a doubt. Existing customers over time really understand the total cost of ownership that we deliver and our \u2013 and I think we received the value accordingly. So I think we have the right balance of investment versus margin at this point. Kevan, do you want to add? Sure. Meta relationship continues. We did \u2013 it wasn't terribly significant this quarter, although there were some shipments, and we continue to make progress slow and steady with other hyperscalers. Obviously, you'll be the first to hear when \u2013 assuming that we actually are able to solidify something solid. Absolutely. Well, the numbers, I think on the subscription side, pretty much speak for themselves. I'd say the largest hurdle that we have with customers is just that it's a very new way to buy. And it may very well be that other parts of their data center build, they build with CapEx. So it's a bit different from that standpoint. So I would say it is largely that it's new and different is the largest hurdle. In terms of the terms of the service capability, no \u2013 one additional one actually is the channel. It's also a new way for the channel to sell. And of course, the economics like any company going through a CapEx to OpEx transition, it takes time for them to adjust how they pay their sellers and for their sellers to adjust as well. So I would say, in general, it's just the newness of the OpEx model versus CapEx, both with customers and the channel that is probably the biggest hurdle. But we are seeing steady as you can see, steady growth and steady interest in it. Thanks, Krish. Well, that's a tough question. I'll pull out my crystal ball. What we're generally hearing is from the enterprise customers is general optimism around the IT budget, meaning that they also see the questions around the economy, questions around recession. And I don't think we can answer this question uniformly around the world. I think Europe and in particular, the UK is different from Asia-Pac and different from the U.S. But in the U.S., I think general optimism that with digital transformation and the need for companies to really be able to compete in the new world that they have to continue investing in their IT environment. Data is the core of that being able to leverage their data. And so data infrastructure is important. So we're seeing general optimism there. I think Europe is going through somewhat different challenges with energy pricing and inflation. And that could be affected a bit more. And then Asia-Pac is a tale of many different countries. But I'm expecting Asia-Pac absent some kind of geopolitical issue to continue to be a strong growth engine for us. Well, I think our sales hiring has improved, but we're continuing to scale. And we are a bit behind. No doubt, we're a bit behind where we'd like to be or behind plan. But we caught up quite a bit in Q1 to where plan had been. So we're narrowing that delta, if you will, between where we are in plan. I do agree with you. I think the environment is getting a bit better on the sales hiring side. Short answer is absolutely. I think we still have a ways to go to become best-in-class there, and we have plans in place to that we think are the elements that will allow us to continue to improve sales productivity. Thanks, Nehal. Yes, yes, we can hear you. Go ahead, David. He can't hear us though. Hello. While we move on to the next question, and if he comes back on we will. Okay, good. Yes. We can hear you, David, go ahead. Please go ahead, David. Yes, let's move on to Amit, if we can. Yes. I'll start, and I'm going to invite Kevan to join in. We do a very bottoms up fundamental analysis of everything from everything from pipeline to deal to the field forecasts and so forth, and it's really based on that. So if I were to up-level it towards more of the macro, I would say, yes, it's continued share gains. And as I might have mentioned earlier in this call, we are still roughly a $2.5 billion $2.75 billion knock on wood, a vendor in a $50 billion market. Our opportunity is based on gaining share and less on the overall size of the market at any particular time. So Kevan, do you want to. Appreciate it. Yes. Great. Thanks, Meta. On the energy side, there are several different customer types that are focused on energy. One I would say our large reporting companies that are now needing to report on their own ESG environment, and that's been pushed down into their data center operations, which tends to be a very large part of their energy utilization. The second, I would say, is countries now with energy in security. So that covers a lot of Europe right now. It's not just the price of energy that's causing them to take a look at their energy bills and so forth. It's now also the availability of energy, making them quite nervous about how much energy their entire environment takes up. But certainly, a big part of that, again, is in their data center. And then third, I'd say is it's government. Government worldwide, governments worldwide now are very focused on energy reduction, and so we're seeing a lot of it there. In Japan, it was palpable, and it also fits if you will, the Japanese ethic for smaller, more compact, more efficient, more reliable capabilities, which we fit really quite perfectly. So I'd say the energy sensitivity is large and growing, probably not surprising to this audience, larger internationally currently than it is in the U.S. but growing in the U.S. as well. On the deal cycle standpoint, we started to see it earlier, I would say starting around mid-quarter, we started to see it and then it increased through the quarter. The deal cycles were just taking another week or two weeks. Generally, all of those deals closed. So, it wasn't a demand issue. And so far, the approvals are still going through, but there definitely was on average, a lengthening of the deal process. Yes. My opinion, Wamsi, is that product growth will continue. Again, we are still a relatively small player in a very large market. And so share gains continue to be a major growth item for us or growth sector plus there is the option or the opportunity to start selling more into the hyperscale environment, whether the top 10 hyperscalers. And if each one of those that gets cracked really would be a meaningful revenue accelerant. So, on the product side. So, no, we are looking at both as meaningful growth factors for us. Absolutely. That is another major growth vector for us is simply the number of large enterprise logos that we have. I think it kind of hides a big opportunity for us in that. Our wallet share on average in those large enterprises is still relatively small. I mean obviously, there are a handful of them where we are the majority of their spend in the storage area. But for the vast majority of those enterprise logos, we still have a lot of opportunity ahead of us. And frankly, with our customers to know us they still love us. Their experience with Pure is very, very good. And because of that, we get, I think exceptional opportunities every time another one of their storage properties comes up for renewal. So, it is a major area of growth for us and I expect that to continue to pay dividends for quite some time. I would say that in general and on average, the situation has ameliorated somewhat. That is \u2013 it's not quite, it hasn't gotten worse. And in fact, if anything, it's gotten a little better, but it's very uneven. In other words, there are some components that have become much more widely available, shorter lead times, but many others that are still on allocation and we still get de-commits every now and then. So, the number of de-commits are down. Things are a little bit easier, but it's still \u2013 I wouldn't say that we are out of the woods yet. That being said, we expect it to continue to improve. Yes. Thanks. So, Evergreen Flex is really targeted at those customers that we are open and interested in a subscription model that is a pay-as-you-go model, but whose internal financial philosophy was really based on CapEx. So, you can think of, in some cases, managed service providers. You can think of a large enterprise where I had mentioned on an earlier question that there \u2013 the model for the rest of their data center is CapEx. And they just couldn't make the full jump over to an OpEx model or at least not yet. And this gives them the ability \u2013 gives them several things. One is it gives them the ability to buy on CapEx, but to really reserve a lot of their spending for when they actually start using the product. The second and this one is more subtle and more important to many customers. Flex is really calculated on a full fleet environment across their entire environment rather than on an array by an array in capability. And what that means is it gives them greater economics, more efficiency, and it gives them much greater flexibility, Evergreen [ph] Flex as they build out their data infrastructure. Rob, do you want to add? Yes. I really think it's both that certainly for existing customers that \u2013 and we have reported this in the past that we are looking at Evergreen One, but at the end, fell back to CapEx because of their unfamiliarity with that buying model. We think Evergreen Flexes now gives them that opportunity to get into a capacity-oriented subscription model. And secondly, no doubt, for customers that \u2013 or for prospects that want to try Pure, but want to do so on an as-you-go basis, I think it can open up new opportunities for us. Look, we are having some great success in terms of the opportunities we are in and winning those opportunities. I have said and been very consistent with my remarks on product gross margin that the high-60s is our sweet spot, and we continue to be in our sweet spot of product gross margins. Frankly, when I start getting into the 70s, it's a bit hot in terms of sustainability and what we can do with our customers. So, I actually like where we are in terms of our product gross margin profile, if that's helpful. Okay. Thank you."

            "name": "Kevan Krysler",
            "content": "Thank you, Charlie and good afternoon. We delivered strong financial results once again this quarter. Our ongoing commitment to innovation, including our recent introduction of FlashBlade S and our expanded Evergreen subscription business models have enabled us to deliver highly differentiated solutions that our customers are leveraging to accelerate their strategic objectives. The power of our technology and software enables our customers to grow and increase productivity. Our customers also deeply appreciate our ability and commitment to deliver our products with short lead times, not increase prices and substantially lower their energy requirements. These factors, among others, are why we believe demand for our solution portfolio continues to be strong despite a turbulent macro environment. Our U.S. business continues to deliver strong revenue growth, growing 31% with particular strength this quarter in both commercial and public sector. Revenue growth of 29% from our international business was also strong, even with FX headwinds due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. We continue to be pleased with meaningful contributions from new business. Our total customer count reflects the acquisition of more than 350 new customers this quarter and 56% of the U.S. Fortune 500 customers. Performance of our Evergreen subscription businesses and Portworx were solid as subscription annual recurring revenue, or ARR, grew 31% to $955 million. Remaining performance obligations or RPO grew 25% to $1.5 billion. Similar to the remarks we made last quarter our RPO growth compared to Q2 of last year reflects a reduction of approximately $32 million relating to product shipments for an outstanding commitment with one of our global system integrators. Excluding these product shipments, RPO grew 28% year-over-year. Our headcount has increased to 4,600 employees as our investments in talent continue to be disciplined and focused around our key business objectives. Now turning to specific financial results and discussion. Total revenue for the quarter grew 30% to approximately $647 million. Product revenue grew 28% and subscription services revenue grew approximately 35%. Subscription services revenue represented approximately 36% of total revenue. We continue to drive solid gross margin at 70.4% this quarter. High performance, reliability, simplicity and sustainability of our solutions are factors contributing to both our strong product gross margins of 69% this quarter and subscription services gross margins of nearly 73% this quarter. Importantly, we were also able to deliver these gross margins without passing price increases on to our customers. We achieved favorable operating profits of $106 million and operating margins of 16.4% this quarter. Now, let's turn to the balance sheet and cash flows. We ended the quarter with over $1.36 billion in cash. Cash flow from operations was over $159 million, resulting from the combination of strong sales, collections and increasing profitability. Capital expenditures were approximately $25 million during the quarter. We returned over $60 million of capital to repurchase approximately 2.4 million shares during the quarter. We have approximately $123 million remaining from our $250 million share repurchase program. Now, turning to guidance. We are pleased to have established a track record of strong performance in the dynamic and challenging environments. Demand signals for our solutions are solid and our visibility of opportunities is healthy. We estimate revenue in Q3 to be approximately $670 million, growing approximately 19% year-over-year and we expect operating profit to be approximately $85 million in Q3, representing approximately 12.7% operating margin. We are also raising our annual guidance for the full fiscal year. We now expect that revenue for FY \u201823 will be $2.75 billion, growing approximately 26% year-over-year. Operating profit is estimated to be approximately $390 million, representing approximately 14% operating margin. Also, as a reminder from our remarks last quarter, approximately $60 million of product revenue in the first quarter of this year was forecasted to close in the second half of our fiscal year. This impacts seasonality when comparing growth rates in our first half compared to our back half of this year. Our Q3 and updated annual guidance contemplates, based on our visibility, macro environment conditions, including factors such as demand signals, foreign currency and inflation. With time being such a critical asset for our customers, we continue to expect to deliver our solutions with short lead times despite supply chain challenges that have reduced slightly, but still exist. In closing, our data storage and management technologies and software are critical to accelerating our customers' digital transformation objectives. Customers continue to depend on us to innovate, to be flexible, to meet their needs quickly, to not raise prices and to reduce their energy consumption any waste. With that, I will turn it over to the operator so we can get to your questions. Operator? Yes. Well, it is the next generation product. So I don't know that cannibalization is the right word. It's our next generation product in several quarters, it should be full replacement for the existing, the Generation 1 FlashBlade product. But it's a very significant expansion of the price performance range that the former that the Gen 1 product provided. So, it scales both up and down better in both capacity as well as in performance. And in fact, it's capable of multiple levels of performance in the same implementation. So, we really see it as dramatically expanding what our share of the original TAM deal brought out. And it really represents a broadening of the family of FlashBlade. Yes. And Simon, I think \u2013 this is Kevan. I'd add on just a little bit more in terms of the traction we're getting with new business and new customers. And we saw some meaningful contribution to revenue from new customers across all customer segments this quarter, which was definitely a plus. Yes, Shannon, I think I'll add just a couple of things, right? So when we think about the full year from an investment standpoint, I mean we're talking about 20% in terms of additional operating expense investment. And when we entered the year, we were very much committed to disciplined investment as well as addressing some of the inflationary impacts we were seeing. And those business objectives really haven't changed. Now our talent team has done a wonderful job this quarter. We had some great success in hiring talent. We're not where we'd like to be, frankly, with our quota sellers, our quota-carrying sellers. And so that will be an area of focus for us in terms of hiring for the remainder of the year in investment. So we are expecting to see some higher investment levels really within our sales organization in the second half. And there is always some seasonality with our OpEx, especially in the fourth quarter as a result of our sales reps starting to earn their accelerators. So hopefully, that's helpful context for you. Two additional things I'd add to that, Tim, and maybe Charlie or Rob, you can jump in. But the expansion of Evergreen with Flex, I think that's going to be a big opportunity for us early days at this point. But then even more so with FlashBlade S and the additional features now with Evergreen that we've enabled, I think, it's going to be pretty powerful as well. And I don't know if you want to add some commentary on that. Yes. Thanks, Krish. I mean \u2013 let's first talk about the performance around op margins, which yes, we're very pleased with. And again, when we think about our strategy and business objectives, it's really about growing our top line and balancing that with increasing profitability in a sustainable way. And we're doing that, and we feel very comfortable with that. This year is a fine example of being able to grow both our top line while seeing some expansion in terms of our operating margin. And we believe that's sustainable as we look out beyond this year. And we've got a track record of that, and it's not without investing heavily. I view a 20% increase in investment this year, very healthy, and we're really driving that across our innovation with our engineers. I've talked a little bit about our sellers. We've got more work to do to invest in our selling organization, and we look forward to doing that in the second half. And then on scale and infrastructure, we're doing a nice job continuing to invest in that area. And so without getting into details beyond this year, I would just say that I have a lot of confidence that it's sustainable. Thanks, Krish. High level, no material change, and we update that, Nehal, once a year. Yes. I mean, I think I'd add a little bit here. So we continue to have relatively good visibility beyond just one quarter out. I think our sales leadership team has done a really nice job focusing on demand gen and pipeline beyond one quarter. The sales team has really got a good pulse on the business right now around our pipeline, our opportunities ability to convert what that looks like. That, in combination with our track record, both with our existing customers and be able to expand within our existing customers as well as the continued traction we're seeing with the new business, this is just really how the second half shapes out based on what we saw exiting Q2 and looking out to Q3 and the rest of the year. So hopefully, that's helpful for you. Yes. It's a great question. And obviously, we've had a fantastic first half and leading to raising our annual guidance to 26% year-over-year. But you're right, as we think about growth in the second half, there is a few things to be thinking about and a few factors to keep in mind here. One is that the second half is impacted by seasonality of that deal we mentioned previously around $60 million. There is actually a couple of deals that we delivered in Q1, really contemplated for second half. And so that's going to impact second half growth by approximately 6 points. So that's important to consider. I think the next factor to consider is our comps are getting much tougher in the second half due to the substantial growth and the additional week we had last year. Now just a reminder, in terms of our growth last year in Q3 and Q4, were 37% and 41%, respectively, which was just outstanding. And then lastly, as we mentioned, we're navigating some incremental headwinds as we think about the elongation of the sales cycle, but we've contemplated that in our guide. So that with FX, I feel pretty good in terms of how we're looking in terms of second half growth. Yes. And I would say \u2013 this is Kevan. I would add a couple of things. I think the elongation I would really point that more to the enterprise, larger enterprise segment. We didn't see a lot of that, frankly, on the commercial and public sector side. So, I think that's an important clarification. I think the other thing you had asked, which we absolutely are seeing and we are well positioned for is our customers looking for more flexibility in how they structure their deals. And I would say absolutely. And I think our timing of Evergreen Flex bringing another option for customers and how they might want to consume our technology and solutions is really resonating. But we are having a fair amount of conversations with our customers around flexibility. Yes. Thanks Wamsi. I think the primary factor \u2013 I probably want to highlight around our investments for the second half. And then overall, when we think about our operating expenses for the year and the growth is really around continuing to invest in our sellers. And we have mentioned that before. But that is an area where, for Q2, arguably, I would have liked to have been further along in terms of where we are with our investment profile on the sales side with our sellers. But we will make that up. I feel confident on that and we will see that through our investments as you look at the second half. Yes. And I think it's all about our confidence in our track record of delivering timely to our customers, which is so critical for them as they are kind of working through accelerating what they need to do from a digital transformation standpoint and we don't see that changing. And again, the challenges we are having would be outside, obviously, of NAND and DRAM to be clear as well. Well, we definitely believe that subscription should outpace product growth. That's been our \u2013 that's our long-range plan and certainly what we believe. But I would also remind everybody on the call that, in fact, our Evergreen subscription, the entire range of it, even the Evergreen Forever, which is attached to a CapEx sale does in fact, over time reduce the CapEx sale. And that's because we never have to replace an existing, so customer never has to replace an existing system. So, many \u2013 the storage industry, a significant portion of their sales is just selling a new system to replace an old system. We always see that in our subscription line. We don't see that in a \u2013 you don't see that in a product sale line. You see that in growth in subscription. So, it's a different way to sell product. We only sell it once. The customer never has to buy it a second time. You are right. It's subscription. So, when we do an Evergreen One transaction, the entire value would be reflected as a subscription. Evergreen Flex, the hardware portion obviously would be in product, but the consumption piece would be in subscription. And then for Evergreen, Evergreen Forever, all of the Evergreen Forever attached for that subscription is reflected as subscription revenue. Hopefully, that's helpful for you. Absolutely. Well, we are seeing a large fraction, probably more than 50% of the software sales are going to existing customers, but a significant amount are going to new customers as well. And I would say that also, even within existing customers, it may be a new buyer within that customer account. I would say that a large fraction are into enterprise customers more so than on the commercial side and a small, but increasing amount coming from channel source. Yes. Thank you. A couple of things. Meta hasn't changed in terms of our remarks earlier. I think when we were coming into the year and our view on Meta. So, that hasn't changed meaningfully. And then in terms of how we are thinking about the second half, we will walk through that a fair amount in terms of how we are thinking about it. Our approach hasn't changed. We continue to evaluate and analyze our pipeline and opportunities. We are staying very close with the sales leadership team who have a very good pulse on the business. I wouldn't call out anything specific as we think about implied Q4 on any particular deals. It's just where we are falling out based on the visibility we have over the next two quarters or the remainder of the year."

With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to our CEO, Charlie Giancarlo.\nCharlie Giancarlo: Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Pure once again delivered very strong results this quarter in the midst of a highly dynamic environment. We drove 50% year-over-year revenue growth with exceptional performance in both U.S. and international markets. Enterprise expansion continues, experiencing strong growth year-over-year. The Pure brand is now both highly recognized and highly respected in enterprise customers worldwide and is considered a must-have in any storage consideration. We were especially delighted this quarter that a large telecom customer expanded their relationship with Pure, selecting our FlashArray product line for their 5G deployments. Our industry-leading subscription services business grew 35% over the same quarter last year. Pure\u2019s unique Evergreen and Pure as-a-Service models continue to resonate strongly with customers and differentiate us from the rest of the industry. Next week at our Annual //Accelerate conference in Los Angeles, we will announce further expansions of our Evergreen portfolio. Customers such as [Knight Systems], which provides predictive behavioral analytics, will share stories of how multigenerational Evergreen upgrades have provided huge benefits including lowered operational costs and complexity, increased uptime and lower energy consumption, yielding greater environmental sustainability. On this very topic, we released our first-ever environmental, social and governance, or ESG report this past quarter. On particular note, we were proud to show that our products make a significant and immediate reduction of data center energy usage. Pure positively improves our customers\u2019 environmental footprint by requiring substantially less power, space and cooling and by producing less waste than both legacy solutions and current competitive systems. Customers that deploy Pure are able to reduce direct energy usage in their data storage systems by up to 80%. They are also able to reduce their data center\u2019s contribution to e-waste. More than 97% of Pure Arrays purchased 6 years ago are still in service benefiting from our industry-leading Evergreen program, which actively reduces e-waste while also saving customers\u2019 time, money and effort. In our ESG report, we commit to extend our leadership by further reducing our Scope 3 emissions by 66% per petabyte by 2030. Operating profit was very strong this quarter, continuing the trend of past quarters and benefiting from the combination of increased scale and prudent expense management. Our investment in research and development remains strong, demonstrating our commitment to innovation and belief that data storage and management is high technology and requires the same level of investment as other critical technologies. Too many competitors in our industry actively promote and invest in storage as a commodity. For both enterprise customers and developing modern private and hybrid cloud solutions as well as cloud service providers, Pure delivers the flexibility, simplicity and agility required by today\u2019s operations and applications environments. A key milestone we achieved last month was releasing both Pure Fusion and Portworx data services for general availability. Pure Fusion provides an end-to-end storages code platform for organizations that want to create a cloud operating model to automate and deliver data services to their organizations. Portworx data services deliver single click deployments of multiple data services for search, event streaming, no SQL databases and more. Together, these 2 products allow customers to create a cloud operating model, automating data management tasks and delivering customized data services to developers and applications, through a simple unified control plane. With these products, customers will be able to modernize their data center operations, avoiding existing highly manual and costly operations for both traditional and cloud-native workloads. FlashArray, FlashArray//C and FlashBlade all saw strong growth during the quarter, setting multiple individual records. Unstructured file and object data makes up the majority of data worldwide, and FlashBlade has taken the lead in penetrating the file and object workloads that require high performance such as EDA, advanced analytics and AI and rapid recovery. However, the vast majority of unstructured data continues to exist primarily on lower cost disk-based storage systems. Please join us next week at our //Accelerate conference for a game-changing announcement on FlashBlade. We continue our progress towards creating the all-flash data center, expanding into higher performance Tier 0 workloads with FlashArray//XL while also expanding our leadership in QLC. With our unique DirectFlash technology, we\u2019re using QLC to close the price gap with magnetic storage. Using the latest developments in solid-state storage to overtake the lower-cost magnetic market requires sophisticated software and years of experience. We believe we have a multiyear advantage in delivering this price performing QLC technology, and we\u2019ll showcase this next week. This past quarter, I had the opportunity to meet with many of our customers, partners and team members in Europe and the Middle East for the first time in over 2 years. It was wonderful to strengthen existing relationships and build new ones. And it\u2019s impossible to overstate the pleasure and the effectiveness of resuming face-to-face meetings. These meetings made clear that our customers\u2019 confidence in Pure is high, that our brand is strong and getting stronger and that we are clearly differentiating ourselves in the market. Simply put, our messages are being embraced, that data storage is high technology, not a commodity as our competitors promote, that customers can build the cloud operating model for themselves and that Evergreen is a better way to buy and operate their infrastructure. We are also aware of current industry and customer concerns. Of course, one of these concerns is supply chain. This remains a challenge across industries and around the world. Pure\u2019s focus on a simplified, consistent and efficient architecture across our product line has served us and our customers well as fewer components means lower cost, lower waste and less supplier risk. Our architecture and world-class hardware design team means that we can quickly address component supply disruptions with design modifications. And as we\u2019ve stated before, we have invested for years in strong relationships with our supply partners and flexible, multi-sourced global operations. I\u2019m very proud of the way our extended team have worked together to continue meeting customer demand with minimal disruption. Another area of concern is inflation and its effect on the economy and on demand. We believe inflation will be present for some time and will also cause both stock market rebalancing as well as monetary and fiscal responses. And this will certainly have economic effects in our market. However, we believe its influence on IT customer behavior will be muted in aggregate and even less for Pure. First, enterprises have now made digital transformation top on their list for the success of their organizations. Next, we believe Pure has entered a second phase of growth, enabled by an expanding portfolio of highly differentiated and leading products as well as sales and business models spanning commercial, enterprise and cloud customers. Another area of concern is cost inflation, coupled with the so-called great resignation. We have seen higher-than-average levels of attrition over the last year, but lower than what has been reported for the industry as a whole. While we do expect somewhat higher labor costs this year, we expect labor cost increases to moderate going forward. Recently reported slowdowns of hiring in the tech space will soften the demand for technology professionals, which will, in turn, reduce attrition and wage inflation. We believe that this marks the beginning of a return to the old normal. Pure is a great place to work as validated by both external recognition and our own internal surveys, which has enabled us to recruit and retain top talent. Our brand and our strong talent acquisition team are attracting top performance across industries, and we are hiring to our planned targets. The final item I\u2019d like to touch upon is the European economy given the effects of general inflation and Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. Inflation, especially in energy, is projected to dampen European economies in the near term. While this may somewhat reduce overall investment capacity of European-based businesses, European customers have indicated that investment in IT is required to make up for the loss of other business modalities, as noted earlier. Furthermore, higher energy costs are already increasing demand for IT equipment that is energy efficient, something that Pure excels in. We believe that this represents another opportunity for Pure to pick up more market share. The bottom line is that technology is now the #1 driving force of enterprise strategy and business transformation. And Pure is the innovation and customer experience leader in one of the largest segments of technology investment. We believe that we are now positioned to see secular growth, less affected by this economic cycle than our competitors. Our full views of the impact of all these events are taken into consideration in our guidance. Overall, we have never been more optimistic about Pure\u2019s opportunity and growth prospects. Despite pandemic, war and market turmoil, Pure has thrived and grown. We have only gotten stronger over these last several years, and we expect to delight ever more customers in the years ahead. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to our CFO, Kevan Krysler, for a deeper look at the numbers.\nKevan Krysler: Thank you, Charlie, and good afternoon. Robust demand across our portfolio, outstanding execution and high resilience continue to be the constant, contributing to our sustaining momentum and our very strong performance this quarter. We again saw solid demand across our portfolio of solutions, services and geographies. We saw impressive growth in our key international geographies as well as the U.S. We continue to minimize delays and deliver for our customers as the backdrop of a challenging supply chain environment has not improved. We also achieved increased profitability in cash flows during the quarter, resulting from our revenue growth and continued operational discipline despite broad-based inflationary pressures. The strength of our subscription business continues as subscription annual recurring revenue, or ARR, grew 29% to $900 million, remaining performance obligations or RPO grew to $1.43 billion. Our RPO balance when compared to Q1 of last year reflects a reduction of approximately $32 million relating to product shipments for an outstanding commitment with 1 of our global system integrators. Excluding these product shipments, our RPO also grew 29% year-over-year. We continue to be very focused on growth of our new customer business, which has improved as we increase our travel. Our total customer count reflects the acquisition of approximately 360 new customers this quarter and includes approximately 54% of the U.S. Fortune 500 customers. Total revenue for the quarter was exceptional, growing over 50% to over $620 million. Approximately $60 million of our product revenue upside this quarter was with several of our larger enterprise customers in the U.S. that we had originally forecasted to close in the second half of our fiscal year. Our customers were pleased we were able to deliver our solutions against the earlier schedule, which is a testament to the agility and resilience of our technology and supply chain. Revenue growth when excluding these transactions was still a very strong 36%. Revenue in the U.S. grew 57% and international revenue grew 33% year-over-year. Subscription services revenue grew approximately 35% year-over-year and represented approximately 35% of total revenue. Non-GAAP total gross margins were solid at 70.6% this quarter. As we have continued to highlight, we believe our integrated software and hardware designs continue to be a key differentiator that our customers appreciate and value. High performance, simplicity, sustainability and resilience of our solutions are key factors contributing to our product gross margins of 70% this quarter. Non-GAAP subscription services gross margins also continue to be strong at 71.5% this quarter. We were very pleased with achieving non-GAAP operating profit of over $85 million and non-GAAP operating margins of 13.8% this quarter. The strength of our operating profit and margin during the quarter was further improved by transactions that occurred during the quarter but were forecasted to close later in the year that I mentioned earlier. Now let\u2019s turn to the balance sheet and cash flows. We ended the quarter with over $1.29 billion in cash and approximately 4,400 employees. Cash flow from operations was over $220 million this quarter. High collections benefited both from robust sales in both Q4 and Q1. Higher profitability was also a contributing factor. Capital expenditures were approximately $33 million during the quarter. As mentioned last quarter, our outstanding credit revolver balance of $250 million was paid at the beginning of this fiscal quarter. We returned approximately $66 million of capital to repurchase slightly over 2.1 million shares during the quarter. We have approximately $184 million remaining from our $250 million share repurchase program. Now turning to guidance. Clearly, we are executing well against our strategy of driving strong revenue growth and continued improvement in profitability. We expect continued demand strength in Q2 with estimated revenue to be approximately $635 million, growing approximately 28%. We expect non-GAAP operating profit to be approximately $75 million in Q2, representing approximately 11.8% non-GAAP operating margin. Given our Q1 performance and outlook for Q2, as well as consideration of the current macro environment, we are raising our annual guidance for the full fiscal year. We now expect that revenue for FY \u201823 will be $2.66 billion, growing approximately 22%. Non-GAAP operating profit is estimated to be approximately $320 million, representing approximately 12% non-GAAP operating margin. Revenue and estimated profits from transactions that were projected to close later in the year, but closed during Q1 were included in our original annual guidance. In closing, our team and partners continue to deliver as the results this quarter were exceptional. Our sustained commitment to innovation provides our customers with solutions that are highly performing and reliable. On integrated software and hardware that require fewer components consume substantially less energy and space and produce less waste than other flash storage alternatives in the market. Strong demand for our market-leading solutions and excellent execution, in particular to our supply chain, providing our leading storage and data management solutions to our customers when and where they need it, will help us deliver 22% annual revenue growth, along with 12% non-GAAP operating margins. With that, I will turn it over to the operator so we can get to your questions. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question is from the line of Simon Leopold with Raymond James.\nSimon Leopold: I wanted to first to help -- get a little help on, Charlie, your comments around the macro. It sounds like you\u2019re acknowledging the environment is more difficult, yet you sound quite upbeat. I\u2019d like a better understanding of what\u2019s really informing your view of how Pure should be more resilient than its peers? And essentially, what are your customers telling you that give you the kind of confidence that you\u2019re essentially giving us yet acknowledgment that the macro is more challenging. What -- how do we put these things together? And just as a very quick follow-up, if you guys could give us a little bit of insight regarding the recent announcement you made with a partnership with Snowflake. I\u2019d like to hear about that as well.\nCharlie Giancarlo: Very good. Thank you, Simon. I hope you\u2019re well. So Simon, our -- what we\u2019re seeing is strong momentum in the market overall. All of our products, customers buying more, the fact that we have a stronger and broader portfolio now being brought into a much greater set of opportunities in large existing customers and a stronger brand that\u2019s allowing us to penetrate net new logos and to penetrate with larger opportunities in larger companies as a net new logo. So we\u2019re actually seeing strength. And just to address your question, I would say that our -- the way we\u2019re looking at the macro is a little bit different. I would say we have not yet seen affects -- the macro affecting us or the customers that we speak to, but we are not blind to the fact that the macro and the possibility of economic slowdown can affect us going forward. So I would say what we\u2019re currently seeing -- what I\u2019m currently seeing in the market through last quarter, continues to be strong demand by IT customers and then a greater acceptance for Pure overall, just the strengthening, if you will, of our brand and our value proposition -- and the breadth of our value proposition to our customers. And I\u2019m going to let Rob answer the question on Snowflake.\nRob Lee: Yes, Simon, this is Rob. So to answer your question on Snowflake, look, we\u2019re super excited about the joint hybrid cloud analytics solution that we announced earlier this month. This is the first step in a strategic partnership that we\u2019re forging with Snowflake. And we think that this joint solution is going to be a great fit really for customers who would benefit from the power of cloud-based data warehousing, but would also benefit from holding either tighter control or -- over their data or want to manage and operate that data in their on-premise environment. We see early customer demand for these types of solutions for security reasons, customers that need to hold and manage the data more tightly for security compliance as well as customers who are generating a lot of data in the on-premise environment, that may want to share that data across multiple tool sets. And so like I said, early days, but we\u2019re seeing good signs of early interest, and we think this is just a great joint solution to bring the 2 technologies together for customers.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Pinjalim Bora with JP Morgan.\nPinjalim Bora: Charlie, Kevan and everyone else, it seems like a really solid quarter. I had to look at the number twice, again, I guess, for the second quarter in a row. But Charlie, I wanted to ask you on supply chain. Pure obviously has done an incredible job in managing the supply chain until now, and it seems like you\u2019re not getting affected at all. However, we do see casualties all over in the field. So -- are you -- as this kind of elongates or prolongs, I should say, for a longer time, are you seeing any streams developing which investors should be aware of that might impact Pure over the 6 to 12 months if this kind of environment prolongs on the supply chain side?\nCharlie Giancarlo: Thank you, Pinjalim. It\u2019s a great question. Let me characterize the supply chain environment now. We generally -- and if you were to ask our supply -- our operations team or engineering, they would tell you that the situation has not gotten better. It\u2019s changed in character perhaps a bit, but we still see surprises on decommits. Obviously, things like Shanghai shutting down means a lot of background work to rebalance and to find new sources of supply for various subassemblies and so forth. So it\u2019s a constant stream of challenges that are being thrown at us from a supply chain perspective. I would say that we\u2019ve minimized to the point of almost nonexistent, the effect on our customers. but it\u2019s certainly affecting us a lot. Our teams are very, very busy, and I want to take my hat off to them because there\u2019s a lot of work that goes into this. But as Kevan mentioned, as did I in our prepared remarks, we have fewer parts that we need to worry about. That gives us more optionality. We have -- because we design our own hardware rather than most of our competitors are using commodity parts, they have less choice, less flexibility. So it gives us greater flexibility and our goal is to make sure we have a minimum effect on our customers. And we were fortunate to actually be able to accelerate some of the shipments this quarter, as Kevan noted. But I knock on wood as I talk about these things because the supply chain remains challenging.\nKevan Krysler: Two other things I\u2019d add to that is high confidence with the risk that Charlie alluded to. I\u2019d say the -- the other thing I\u2019d add to it is our supply partners are doing a terrific job as well. And the 3 factors combined, I think, really drives the sustainability confidence that we have around the supply chain even acknowledging the risks that we\u2019ve alluded to. The other thing I\u2019d point out is NAND is not subject to the same types of challenges and constraints that we see across -- really around the IC side and semiconductor side. And so obviously, that\u2019s the biggest part of our BOM and materials, and that\u2019s an important call-out as well.\nPinjalim Bora: Understood. And a quick follow-up for Kevan. I had to really squint to find [indiscernible] the press release. But I want to ask you on the subscription revenue side, it seems it was in line to consensus. When I look at the sequential growth, it seems like it\u2019s not that much. And then when I look at subscription ARR, net new growth seems like it\u2019s decelerated a bit. Was this mainly kind of a CapEx led quarter versus unified subscription led?\nKevan Krysler: I think that\u2019s right. That\u2019s a good way to be thinking about it. I mean we had a lot of volume coming through on the CapEx side. But look, the subscription business continues to be strong. ARR growing 29%. I would be expecting variability quarter-to-quarter. We\u2019re very focused on accelerating growth with our partner ecosystem, a lot of great energy out there and looking forward to accelerate and talking to our partners around Pure as-a-Service. We\u2019ve got some key milestones that we\u2019ve identified around general availability for Pure Fusion and imported data services. And really, this takes us on a roadmap that we\u2019ve talked about that Charlie has laid out around really establishing a cloud operating model for every customer no matter where their workloads are being run. I\u2019d say stay tuned, too. We\u2019re very excited with some new announcements of Evergreen at //Accelerate as well.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo.\nAaron Rakers: And congrats on the great results. I guess the first question I wanted to ask is that when I look at your gross margin at 70% on the product line, it would really imply that you\u2019ve not seen any incremental deployments with one of your large hyperscale cloud customers. So I guess first question is, is that a fair assessment? And I guess, on the heels of that, how are you thinking about that hyperscale customer, Meta, fully deploying their AI project through the course of this year, how that factored into the expectations?\nCharlie Giancarlo: Yes. Thanks, Aaron. So you\u2019re correct. We\u2019ve not seen this quarter substantial revenues from the nature of the hyperscaler that you spoke about before. We do -- but we\u2019ve also been making good progress on both the discounting front as our -- as the market has stabilized, if you will, from a pricing standpoint as well as the ability to extract more value from our products overall. So I would say that we\u2019ve been able to manage the gross margin, I think, very well. And I\u2019ll let Kevan answer the question. Well, actually, I\u2019ll take this one. As we discussed when we first started speaking about the Meta win, and that was before they permitted the use of their name, we indicated that these types of sales tend to be somewhat episodic as they build out their data centers on specific quarters. And this is one of the light quarters, but we continue working with them. We\u2019re certainly optimistic on future orders, but it will be on their time frames.\nKevan Krysler: Yes. And I think to be clear, that was expected, right?\nCharlie Giancarlo: Very much expected. We\u2019re not expecting the sales this quarter. That\u2019s correct. Right.\nAaron Rakers: Yes. That\u2019s very helpful. And I guess I\u2019m just curious, given the momentum that you not only saw this last quarter, but you\u2019ve seen these last couple of quarters, how has the competitive landscape reacted? What have you seen? I know that Dell EMC saw a little bit of growth, 9% growth this last quarter in your storage business. I\u2019m just curious, have you seen any changes on the competitive landscape at all?\nCharlie Giancarlo: Yes. It\u2019s relatively minor to be honest with you. We tend to be competing against the same set of products in the same type of environments with the same set of customers. Obviously, as we expand our sales force, we\u2019re competing across a greater set of customers, a larger set of customers, which is a good thing. We get in more fights and more at bats. And our win rates are very good. So I would say -- and our brand is certainly helping. The fact that we\u2019re now -- I think customers believe that we have to be in any competitive bake-off that they may be performing. So I would say that -- and I\u2019ll let Rob contribute here, but I haven\u2019t seen anything terribly substantial from the competitors in this space.\nRob Lee: Yes, Aaron, I\u2019ll just add. I think the biggest takeaway is that, from my view, we really remain standouts as we look at the competitive set in terms of having really differentiated technology as well as, as Charlie talked about in his prepared remarks, our thesis in investing in innovation to further expand those -- that differentiated technology. If you look at what we\u2019re doing with QLC to go after disk and hybrid. If you look at what we\u2019re doing with FlashArray and extending that family into XL, to go after higher performance, with Pure Fusion, now GA and with Portworx Data Services, and not to mention significantly more to come next week. I think this is just an area where we see a great opportunity set out there for us, a lot of runway ahead of us to go grab more market share. And I think the biggest standout is that we don\u2019t see any of the competitive announcements materially changing that landscape.\nCharlie Giancarlo: Actually, Aaron, let me also answer it with 1 additional comment, which is we\u2019re just playing a different game than our competitors. Our competitors play a commodity game. They\u2019ve been marketing their products. They\u2019ve been marketing storage as a commodity. The customers should only care about price and nothing else. And we\u2019re playing a high technology game. We invest in it like it\u2019s high technology. It\u2019s an entirely different business strategy, and it\u2019s going to be very difficult, I think, for them to respond.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Amit Daryanani with Evercore.\nAmit Daryanani: Congrats on a great quarter. I guess my first one is really, Charlie, you sort of talked in your prepared comments about Pure has entered a second phase of growth in its journey. I\u2019m hoping you could talk a little bit about what does that mean for Pure? Because when looking at the new customer additions, for example, that definitely inflected higher pretty materially. But what is the second phase of growth mean for the company? Are you seeing engagements with bigger enterprises? Or are you seeing a quicker land and expand? Just maybe help frame what does this mean? And does that potentially inflect growth higher as you go forward?\nCharlie Giancarlo: Yes. What we mean by second phase is if we look back, our first phase of growth was building an award-winning product in a unique environment where really for many years, it was the only product of its type, and therefore, allowed us very, very rapid early growth. And as our competitors started to respond, they were able to use their larger sales forces and their greater portfolio to compete with us more effectively and so our growth slowed a bit. We\u2019ve responded over the last several years as our long-time investors know, with continued investment in R&D and in particular, an investment in broadening out our sales focus and capabilities, sales and support such that we could support enterprise customers with a larger portfolio. And now we\u2019re seeing the fruits of that bear out. And so the second phase of growth is the fact that we can penetrate more into larger customers with an expanded and superior portfolio, and that\u2019s going to give us a runway, a pretty long runway to continue what I believe is going to be a second phase of growth. And we\u2019re now -- we now have the scale, if you will, to compete with any of our competitors and deploy our unfair advantage of leadership products. So that\u2019s how I phrased the second phase of growth.\nAmit Daryanani: Got it. And then if I could just follow up really quick. The upside in growth -- in revenues, I\u2019m sorry, that we saw in the quarter, right? And I think, Kevan, the way you laid it out, it was sounding like $60 million of that, call it, was from pulling from the back half and $40 million was more organic. I\u2019m curious is the outgrowth that Pure is seeing more a reflection of the fact that you are resonating better with customers on the engagement Charlie is that what you talked about? Or is it very simply the fact that you probably have better supply ability and so you\u2019re getting incremental market share because you are the one with better supply versus your peers. I\u2019m curious do you think better supply is playing a part in this outgrowth? Or is it more fundamentally driven?\nKevan Krysler: Well, look, I mean -- this is Kevan. I\u2019ll start with that, and I\u2019ll let Charlie add to it. I\u2019m not sure it makes sense to decouple supply versus the power of our portfolio and our technology. I mean when you look at the architecture of our technology and how we\u2019re leveraging software and how we -- from an architecture standpoint, require less components, simpler in terms of architecture. That\u2019s obviously helping us a lot on the supply side. But then that\u2019s also what really resonates for customers, right? It\u2019s performance, it\u2019s resilient. It\u2019s simple to use. And the -- our ESG report, we\u2019ve got some just kind of stunning stats in terms of what we\u2019re doing in terms of sustainability and in energy reduction with the architecture that we\u2019re leveraging with our portfolio. So I would actually say that the 2 go together from my perspective. Charlie, any other thoughts?\nCharlie Giancarlo: That says it all, Kevan. Really do. Mic drop.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs.\nRod Hall: I wanted to go back to the $60 million and just try to understand how we should be thinking about that? In other words, are we -- should we be thinking about it as backlog that you had good execution against supply so you were able to kind of go ahead and deliver it? Or more a customer coming back to you and going, \"Hey, we were thinking about doing this in H2. We really want to accelerate that.\" I\u2019m just kind of trying to figure out how we should come and sensically think about that $60 million? And then I have a quick follow-up.\nKevan Krysler: Rod, it\u2019s a great question. It was very much the latter. We -- obviously, we have visibility with these large enterprise customers in terms of our plan. In terms of our discussions, they came back to us requesting earlier delivery. I could appreciate those requests given the environment, but it\u2019s really the latter to your point, Rod.\nRod Hall: Okay, great, Charlie. And then on Portworx, I noticed all these -- the Portworx GA announcements mid-month. And I feel like that\u2019s a pretty exciting part of the Services portfolio. I\u2019m just curious what you think the funnel looks like there? What kind of interest have you had expressed? Kind of how does that affect ARR as we move through the next few quarters?\nCharlie Giancarlo: Well, as we spoke about in the past, Portworx is still a relatively new product and because it is, as you point out, it\u2019s ratable and goes into ARR. We are seeing very good growth in that product line overall. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, I\u2019ve spent a lot of time this past quarter -- or actually over the last quarter and this quarter, in Europe and the Middle East, a lot of excitement by customers and our sales teams and partners in the product. So I think it has -- what we\u2019re -- we believe it has a really strong future as we go forward. Obviously, it will take a little bit of time before it really starts making a tangible difference, a reportable difference, if you will, in our ARR.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Jason Ader with William Blair.\nJason Ader: Yes. I guess I want to understand, Kevan, on the comment on macro and how you -- when you thought about the guidance for the year, you baked in macro? Does that mean that you changed any of your assumptions on close rates or deal sizes or geographies or customer behavior?\nKevan Krysler: Yes, it\u2019s a great question, Jason. And then I think the simple answer is no. There were no significant changes to our assumptions. Look, the first thing we evaluated pretty carefully was demand signals. And as Charlie mentioned, demand continues to be quite strong. Obviously, a lot of noise out there from a macro perspective that we\u2019re digesting and understanding what, if any, impact that will have for us in second half. But when I really break it down and look and compare against our initial guide for the year, we\u2019re outperforming. We saw that from a demand standpoint in Q1. We see that in terms of our guide for Q2 and then obviously increasing our annual guide for the year. So I think it\u2019s business as usual with the outperformance that we\u2019re seeing in Q1 and Q2.\nJason Ader: Okay, great. And then, Charlie, for you, just in the last couple of quarters have been off the charts. And I understand that there\u2019s been some kind of, let\u2019s call it, near-term spikiness to the business, and you\u2019re going to have some deceleration as you move through the year here. But is the storage market just that much better right now than it\u2019s been in a while? Or is it just that you guys are taking just gobs of share?\nCharlie Giancarlo: It\u2019s an interesting question, Jason. Obviously, the numbers speak for themselves. We\u2019re clearly taking share. The market is very benign at the moment. It\u2019s a strong market despite everything that\u2019s going on. Prices at ASPs have stayed strong. That\u2019s always helpful. So I think it\u2019s been a benign market, and we\u2019re taking share. It\u2019s probably the best way to put it.\nJason Ader: And is there a lot of pent-up demand still from the pandemic that\u2019s helping? In other words, should we be moderating our expectations for 2020 -- for fiscal 2024 because of pent-up demand sort of will be -- that tailwind will be gone in 2024.\nCharlie Giancarlo: Honestly, we\u2019ve not really been seeing -- even over the last year, pent-up demand playing a role here. It\u2019s usually new developments, new infrastructure, expansions -- fundamental expansions, not pent-up demand. So I would say pent-up demand, at least for us, has not been playing a big role. Remember, we don\u2019t get refreshes of equipment. Our Evergreen means that the equipment is always upgraded on a regular basis. And when customers need additional capacity, they pay for that, but they don\u2019t pay for any replacement of existing capacity. So we don\u2019t get the same benefit that maybe some of our competitors get by pent-up demand because we don\u2019t have replacements. We have Evergreen. And so I would say, again, that pent-up demand has not really been a factor for us. This is all basically new demand or expansion of existing environments.\nKevan Krysler: Yes. It is interesting too, Jason, when you look at seasonality, pre-COVID for us and growth rates and you normalize for the $60 million that we alluded to. I\u2019ll tell you that the seasonality is matching kind of the pre-COVID days in terms of first half, second half growth rates. So that\u2019s another data point for thoughts as well.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley.\nMeta Marshall: Great. Maybe taking it away from macro, but a little bit more micro into your -- you guys do have about 30% exposure to cloud customers. And so just want to get a sense just as we\u2019re seeing some kind of changes in the technology, hiring environment, whether that\u2019s trickled down to anything you\u2019re seeing from that customer set? And then just maybe diving into the $40 million kind of an additional upside that you guys saw in the quarter. Just any indications of whether that\u2019s from more like of your commercial or enterprise customers?\nCharlie Giancarlo: So overall, I would say we\u2019ve seen just strong demand and growth across the entire set of customer segments that commercial enterprise what we characterized as cloud in the past. These were all strong segments for us. I don\u2019t think, other than the continuing exceptional growth of enterprise, I wouldn\u2019t say there\u2019s been a dramatic change in the overall character of the revenues coming in. And I\u2019ll let Kevan answer the question on the accelerated shipments.\nKevan Krysler: Yes. And I would call out actually that international had a fantastic quarter along with U.S. And so to Charlie\u2019s point on broad-based performance, we saw that from a geography standpoint, I was really pleased with what we saw in the international side, which really, when you normalize for the $60 million in the U.S., it\u2019s really tracking with the U.S. growth rates. And as Charlie talked about commercial, we saw some good strength there. Public sector was a highlight for us as well in terms of how we look at it. So again, when we look at the $40 million of outperformance, I would, again, talk about the power of the portfolio we have. Enterprise is absolutely a workhorse for us, but we\u2019re seeing it across the board.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank.\nSidney Ho: I want to go back to the full year guidance. Obviously, you raised it by a little bit, but that would imply second half will be up about 10% year-over-year, but maybe 15% of your account for the revenue pulling you talked about. Can you walk us through your thought process there? Are you just being prudent in your guidance? Or are there more revenue being pulled in from second half into second quarter? And the follow-up to that is if I look at the operating profit, you also raised it. But you\u2019re seeing high revenue in the second half, but the operating profit dollar is roughly flat in the first half of the year. Just can you walk us through maybe that dynamics as well.\nKevan Krysler: Yes. That sounds great, Sidney. Let me start with revenue growth. And look, we\u2019re very pleased with the raise of our annual guide to 22%. I think that\u2019s very strong. Obviously, an outlier in terms of what we\u2019re seeing, especially in this environment. So not backing away from that annual growth rate, which I think is very strong. You\u2019re seeing strong growth in the first half, and you\u2019re seeing some moderation in the second half. Some of that is seasonality. The $60 million that we alluded to that really was contemplated and forecasted for second half. But when normalizing for this seasonality, the expected growth rate in the back half is still in the high teens, which is quite strong. And then again, as I talked with Jason about when you look at our growth rates, first half, second half from a seasonality standpoint, we\u2019re kind of getting back to what we saw in the pre-COVID days, which is great. A couple of other thoughts. As we progress through the year, we\u2019re also working with strong comps. I mean, we had a fantastic year last year, and that\u2019s only growing. We also had an extra week in the fourth quarter. So that\u2019s a consideration as well. And we are being thoughtful about the macro environment as well. But without a doubt, we\u2019re pleased with our revenue growth outlook for the year. Now if I move to operating profits, which was really the second piece of your question, we feel really good about the current view and increasing profitability. This is our execution against our strategy that Charlie laid out, which is absolutely prioritizing innovation and growth while at the same time improving profitability, and that\u2019s what you\u2019re seeing here. So we\u2019re quite pleased with the operating profits in the quarter. Expect 12% operating margin for the year. And obviously, our profit overachievement this quarter was helped by the transactions that were moved into Q1. We\u2019re also doing very well on hiring in Q1. We\u2019ve made great progress in hiring talent, and we continue to invest thoughtfully and we\u2019ll continue to be focused on operating discipline and operating leverage as we monitor the effects of inflation at time that is on. So hopefully, that answers your question.\nSidney Ho: Yes. That\u2019s helpful. Maybe 1 quick follow-up. If I look at the product gross margin for Q1, it\u2019s definitely improved more than we expected. But was NAND pricing a headwind in the quarter as you expected that may be able to raise prices to offset that. But the real question is, how are you thinking about gross margin for both products and subscription services for Q2 and the rest of the year?\nKevan Krysler: Yes, we might be a broken record on the product gross margins. Look, I still think longer term, I\u2019m very happy with product gross margins being in the high 60s. I think once again, we\u2019ve overachieved and I\u2019m very pleased. I think the sales team is doing a tremendous job selling the value of our solution, and we\u2019re seeing that in the average selling prices as we navigated Q1. So I think that\u2019s a large driver on it. In terms of subscription gross margins, what we\u2019ve been tracking is pretty consistent in the low 70s, and that\u2019s a good kind of corridor that I like in terms of subscription gross margins.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Nehal Chokshi with Northland Capital Markets.\nNehal Chokshi: Yes. And a fantastic quarter of execution. I take a tick on this. But subscription year-over-year growth did decelerate to 35% year-over-year growth from 42% in the prior quarter. Why did that happen? And then also why subscription ARR growing slower than the revenue line? I think you did mention that there is some lumpiness. And so if you go into why there\u2019s that lumpiness that would be helpful as well.\nKevan Krysler: Yes. I mean, look, I think when you look at the subscription revenue growth, I mean, that\u2019s really a late indicator. I mean that\u2019s revenue coming off the balance sheet over time. I think when I really look at the health of our subscription business, I\u2019m looking at our subscription ARR balance as well as how we\u2019re doing from an RPO standpoint, which grew 29%. And look, I\u2019m very pleased with that. That\u2019s very strong growth. We\u2019re set up well. We\u2019ve got a lot of good things happening in terms of our accelerated announcements on Evergreen. And so -- and obviously, you\u2019re going to get a little bit of variability on subscription ARR as well as RPO growth. But again, if I\u2019m looking at the revenue and rolling off the balance sheet to the top line, I think that\u2019s really not a strong indicator in terms of the health of the subscription business. Now the other thing, Nehal, that I would highlight to you is when you\u2019re comparing quarter-to-quarter and you\u2019ve got to build in the extra week in Q4, which would have a bearing on that as well.\nNehal Chokshi: Yes. Okay. All right. Understood on that. That\u2019s a good point. And then Charlie, in an earlier question, you had made a point of saying Pure Storage is doing a technology sale versus competitors doing a commodity sale. Can you expand on what do you actually really mean by that?\nCharlie Giancarlo: You bet. I\u2019ll take it back to R&D. We invest heavily in R&D, which means that we consistently build a product that leads the market. Our competitors -- generally our largest competitors spend less than 5% on R&D. I used to run a very large R&D shop. You can barely keep the lights on at 5% R&D. They can\u2019t keep up with us from a technology development perspective. And if we\u2019re correct that data storage and management is high technology and requires continuing development of advanced capability. It\u2019s going to be very difficult for them to change their business models to accommodate that higher R&D, not just from a financial standpoint, but from the standpoint of managing a top tier -- top class R&D staff. You get a reputation. And so we -- as I said, we play a very different game. And customers have been used to buying storage as a commodity, used to substandard support and capability and assuming that all of them were alike, they\u2019re learning very quickly that Pure is very different than the other vendors that we require far less labor, that we\u2019re highly automated, that we require less space power and cooling and that they have a superior experience overall with our product, and that\u2019s being now increasingly appreciated.\nRob Lee: I think the results of that are pretty apparent if you look across the portfolio, but if you look at FlashArray//C., we\u2019ve been shipping that product for 2.5 years now, going after hybrid and disk completely unmatched out in the market. You look at FlashBlade. What we\u2019re doing for some of the high-value use cases out there, whether it\u2019s analytics and AI, whether it\u2019s technical computing, chip design, simulation, modernizing data protection, rapid recovery. And if you look at Portworx and the entire suite of products that we have there, that just gives you some small hints of really the results that this focus on R&D and innovation is driving, much less what we have to discuss next week at //Accelerate.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America.\nWamsi Mohan: I was wondering -- I apologize if this has already been answered, jumping across calls here. But can you talk about the second half guide? I mean, you\u2019re attributing about $60 million to pull forward, but also effectively lowering the second half implied guide by the same amount. So are you actually saying that the demand environment has not changed because I mean, there\u2019s all the companies are saying that the demand remains robust. There are supply chain issues, but demand remains robust. So I just want to clarify if you\u2019re saying that the macro environment is not actually impacting demand thus far? And what\u2019s the methodology where you\u2019re effectively calculating the $60 million pull forward? I know you have obviously visibility into the deals in your pipeline. Can you talk about how broad-based that was in terms of -- was it just an isolated like a few customers where you saw this pull forward? Was it much more broader? And if you could address profit seasonality as well in the second half relative to the first half?\nCharlie Giancarlo: Yes, you bet. So we can only report on what we are actually seeing and what we\u2019re actually seeing is demand remains robust. At the same time, we\u2019re certainly taking note of the increase in inflation. The public debate around a slowdown in the economy, possible -- even some discussion about possible recession. And so we -- our outlook has to be a bit more -- I have to keep that in mind and not get ahead of ourselves. And so I think that our forecast reflects exactly that thinking. But for -- through the last quarter, demand remains strong without -- and even at the end of -- at the end of April, even though at that time, there were warning clouds on the horizon with respect to economies. Certainly, energy in the -- prices in Europe, et cetera. At the same time, we were hearing from our IT customers that their budgets and their focus on investment in IT was remaining strong.\nKevan Krysler: Yes. And then just to answer your question in terms of the $60 million, that would have been a couple of large customers, so it was limited. Obviously, for these large enterprise customers, we\u2019re working with them very closely with their demand planning. So I would put it in more of the isolated bucket, very easy for us to quantify, very binary in terms of understanding in our demand planning with the customer that, that was second half. So that\u2019s a shift in seasonality. And that\u2019s how I view it. It\u2019s simply a shift in seasonality. It has nothing to do in my mind with demand drop-off as one might have alluded to in the second half. Demand looks strong. Revenue, as I mentioned, I went through a fair amount of detail, Wamsi, in terms of revenue first half, second half as well as operating profit first half and second half, and we can take you through that in more detail as well.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Tim Long with Barclays.\nTim Long: Yes, two, if I could, as well. First, Charlie, you mentioned something about a win with a large telco for FlashArray for 5G. Could you talk a little bit about kind of application there? And just give us a little color on this as a potential new vertical. How important can this be as the wireless world moves to more of a data-centric architecture? And secondly, just one more on the Op margin, just 22% revenue growth, but only moving overall Op margin a little over 100 basis points for the year. So can you talk about what\u2019s limiting that? Is that just return to office and T&E -- or is there any other reason we\u2019re not seeing as much leverage on a really strong revenue growth here?\nCharlie Giancarlo: Thanks, Tim. I\u2019ll let Kevan handle the second part. As far as 5G, what an exciting opportunity and an exciting -- and call-out we were able to make for this quarter. It\u2019s one of the top telcos in the world. They\u2019re not the only ones we\u2019re talking to about 5G, but it was great to get one of the first large orders associated with 5G deployments. The fact that we\u2019re smaller, we\u2019re denser, more power efficient and generally more performance than other products in the market have certainly helped in this environment. We think it\u2019s -- as I mentioned, we are talking to quite a few other telcos about 5G deployments. I\u2019m optimistic about this space. And I\u2019m going to invite Rob who worked on this opportunity to tell us a little bit more about this specific deployment.\nRob Lee: Yes. So I think this is a testament really to the quality of our products and the reliability and performance, all the attributes that Charlie just mentioned and really the suitability of those attributes to 5G deployments. In many ways, it\u2019s a great validation that just like the hyperscale environments, which we\u2019ve spoken to you previously about. In these large telecom environments, really share a lot of the same requirements. They\u2019re highly available, highly performance demanding, very mission-critical environment, highly automated as well. And I think those are all attributes where Pure\u2019s products and services are uniquely well positioned to go and serve. And so I think we\u2019re super pleased with the win. I think I\u2019d also mention that in this particular environment, we were chosen to replace what was initially a custom design built around open source software as customer had really tried to build out part of the environment themselves and then turn back to us to -- when they couldn\u2019t achieve the reliability performance and really the ease of management and automation required of these very demanding environments.\nKevan Krysler: And I\u2019ll just hit the operating profit question again. And really, this just comes back down to our strategy really around prioritizing innovation and growth that\u2019s paying off. We\u2019re seeing it. We\u2019ve been seeing it for several quarters. And at the same time, we\u2019re increasing our profitability. Now we\u2019re balancing that. We had some great hiring, as I mentioned. I think we quarter-over-quarter, hired over 170 folks and new talent worldwide, which we\u2019re really pleased with. We are navigating some higher wage costs as to be expected, and all that\u2019s being balanced and incorporated while we\u2019re increasing profitability for the year. So hopefully, that\u2019s a helpful context.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Eric Martinuzzi with Lake Street.\nEric Martinuzzi: Just curious, I wanted to go a layer deeper on the product gross margins. Curious to see if there\u2019s any let up. Obviously, you\u2019re putting up good gross margins in a tough supply chain environment. But expedited shipping fees, anything there where you\u2019re seeing relief or forecasting relief?\nCharlie Giancarlo: I would say not at the moment. We had hoped back in Q3 and Q4 that the supply chain constraints would start to ease by Q1 or Q2. Unfortunately, we\u2019ve not seen that. One situation after another just continues to extend. It changes the nature of the supply chain problems, but it extends the supply chain problems. To be clear, we\u2019ve not seen it get worse, but we\u2019ve not seen it get better either. And it\u2019s across the board, as you\u2019re pointing out, everything from logistics shipping, but the ones that -- we can absorb all of that, the ones that always concern us is components and availability of components because that can get you to shut -- or border closures, right? Those are the ones we\u2019re most concerned about. But it\u2019s still across the board.\nKevan Krysler: It\u2019s across the board. And where the advantage again comes to us is really around the fact that we have less parts that we have to navigate in terms of exposure. And that\u2019s really paying off for us, both on the inflationary side as well as supply constraints and how we\u2019ve been able to navigate against that headwind.\nOperator: This concludes the question-and-answer session. At this time, I will turn the call back over to Charlie Giancarlo for closing remarks.\nCharlie Giancarlo: Thank you, operator. Our strategy to deliver a simple and Evergreen data platform, enabling our customers and companies around the world to turn their data and innovation. It continues to deliver exceptional results across our business. We\u2019re growing share in our market segments as customers turn to our leadership in digital transformation and that\u2019s critical to their future, and this promises to sustain us for quite a few quarters and hopefully years ahead. I want to thank once again our customers, our partners for their trust, our suppliers for their collaboration and to all of our employees for their innovation and their hard work. And I thank -- I\u2019d like to thank all of our listeners today and look forward to seeing you next week at //Accelerate. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Rob Lee",
            "content": "Yes, Simon, this is Rob. So to answer your question on Snowflake, look, we're super excited about the joint hybrid cloud analytics solution that we announced earlier this month. This is the first step in a strategic partnership that we're forging with Snowflake. And we think that this joint solution is going to be a great fit really for customers who would benefit from the power of cloud-based data warehousing, but would also benefit from holding either tighter control or -- over their data or want to manage and operate that data in their on-premise environment. We see early customer demand for these types of solutions for security reasons, customers that need to hold and manage the data more tightly for security compliance as well as customers who are generating a lot of data in the on-premise environment, that may want to share that data across multiple tool sets. And so like I said, early days, but we're seeing good signs of early interest, and we think this is just a great joint solution to bring the 2 technologies together for customers. Yes, Aaron, I'll just add. I think the biggest takeaway is that, from my view, we really remain standouts as we look at the competitive set in terms of having really differentiated technology as well as, as Charlie talked about in his prepared remarks, our thesis in investing in innovation to further expand those -- that differentiated technology. If you look at what we're doing with QLC to go after disk and hybrid. If you look at what we're doing with FlashArray and extending that family into XL, to go after higher performance, with Pure Fusion, now GA and with Portworx Data Services, and not to mention significantly more to come next week. I think this is just an area where we see a great opportunity set out there for us, a lot of runway ahead of us to go grab more market share. And I think the biggest standout is that we don't see any of the competitive announcements materially changing that landscape. I think the results of that are pretty apparent if you look across the portfolio, but if you look at FlashArray//C., we've been shipping that product for 2.5 years now, going after hybrid and disk completely unmatched out in the market. You look at FlashBlade. What we're doing for some of the high-value use cases out there, whether it's analytics and AI, whether it's technical computing, chip design, simulation, modernizing data protection, rapid recovery.

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Charlie Giancarlo",
            "content": "Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Pure once again delivered very strong results this quarter in the midst of a highly dynamic environment. We drove 50% year-over-year revenue growth with exceptional performance in both U.S. and international markets. Enterprise expansion continues, experiencing strong growth year-over-year. The Pure brand is now both highly recognized and highly respected in enterprise customers worldwide and is considered a must-have in any storage consideration. We were especially delighted this quarter that a large telecom customer expanded their relationship with Pure, selecting our FlashArray product line for their 5G deployments. Our industry-leading subscription services business grew 35% over the same quarter last year. Pure's unique Evergreen and Pure as-a-Service models continue to resonate strongly with customers and differentiate us from the rest of the industry. Next week at our Annual //Accelerate conference in Los Angeles, we will announce further expansions of our Evergreen portfolio. Customers such as [Knight Systems], which provides predictive behavioral analytics, will share stories of how multigenerational Evergreen upgrades have provided huge benefits including lowered operational costs and complexity, increased uptime and lower energy consumption, yielding greater environmental sustainability. On this very topic, we released our first-ever environmental, social and governance, or ESG report this past quarter. On particular note, we were proud to show that our products make a significant and immediate reduction of data center energy usage. Pure positively improves our customers' environmental footprint by requiring substantially less power, space and cooling and by producing less waste than both legacy solutions and current competitive systems. Customers that deploy Pure are able to reduce direct energy usage in their data storage systems by up to 80%. They are also able to reduce their data center's contribution to e-waste. More than 97% of Pure Arrays purchased 6 years ago are still in service benefiting from our industry-leading Evergreen program, which actively reduces e-waste while also saving customers' time, money and effort. In our ESG report, we commit to extend our leadership by further reducing our Scope 3 emissions by 66% per petabyte by 2030. Operating profit was very strong this quarter, continuing the trend of past quarters and benefiting from the combination of increased scale and prudent expense management. Our investment in research and development remains strong, demonstrating our commitment to innovation and belief that data storage and management is high technology and requires the same level of investment as other critical technologies. Too many competitors in our industry actively promote and invest in storage as a commodity. For both enterprise customers and developing modern private and hybrid cloud solutions as well as cloud service providers, Pure delivers the flexibility, simplicity and agility required by today's operations and applications environments. A key milestone we achieved last month was releasing both Pure Fusion and Portworx data services for general availability. Pure Fusion provides an end-to-end storages code platform for organizations that want to create a cloud operating model to automate and deliver data services to their organizations. Portworx data services deliver single click deployments of multiple data services for search, event streaming, no SQL databases and more. Together, these 2 products allow customers to create a cloud operating model, automating data management tasks and delivering customized data services to developers and applications, through a simple unified control plane. With these products, customers will be able to modernize their data center operations, avoiding existing highly manual and costly operations for both traditional and cloud-native workloads. FlashArray, FlashArray//C and FlashBlade all saw strong growth during the quarter, setting multiple individual records. Unstructured file and object data makes up the majority of data worldwide, and FlashBlade has taken the lead in penetrating the file and object workloads that require high performance such as EDA, advanced analytics and AI and rapid recovery. However, the vast majority of unstructured data continues to exist primarily on lower cost disk-based storage systems. Please join us next week at our //Accelerate conference for a game-changing announcement on FlashBlade. We continue our progress towards creating the all-flash data center, expanding into higher performance Tier 0 workloads with FlashArray//XL while also expanding our leadership in QLC. With our unique DirectFlash technology, we're using QLC to close the price gap with magnetic storage. Using the latest developments in solid-state storage to overtake the lower-cost magnetic market requires sophisticated software and years of experience. We believe we have a multiyear advantage in delivering this price performing QLC technology, and we'll showcase this next week. This past quarter, I had the opportunity to meet with many of our customers, partners and team members in Europe and the Middle East for the first time in over 2 years. It was wonderful to strengthen existing relationships and build new ones. And it's impossible to overstate the pleasure and the effectiveness of resuming face-to-face meetings. These meetings made clear that our customers' confidence in Pure is high, that our brand is strong and getting stronger and that we are clearly differentiating ourselves in the market. Simply put, our messages are being embraced, that data storage is high technology, not a commodity as our competitors promote, that customers can build the cloud operating model for themselves and that Evergreen is a better way to buy and operate their infrastructure. We are also aware of current industry and customer concerns. Of course, one of these concerns is supply chain. This remains a challenge across industries and around the world. Pure's focus on a simplified, consistent and efficient architecture across our product line has served us and our customers well as fewer components means lower cost, lower waste and less supplier risk. Our architecture and world-class hardware design team means that we can quickly address component supply disruptions with design modifications. And as we've stated before, we have invested for years in strong relationships with our supply partners and flexible, multi-sourced global operations. I'm very proud of the way our extended team have worked together to continue meeting customer demand with minimal disruption. Another area of concern is inflation and its effect on the economy and on demand. We believe inflation will be present for some time and will also cause both stock market rebalancing as well as monetary and fiscal responses. And this will certainly have economic effects in our market. However, we believe its influence on IT customer behavior will be muted in aggregate and even less for Pure. First, enterprises have now made digital transformation top on their list for the success of their organizations. Next, we believe Pure has entered a second phase of growth, enabled by an expanding portfolio of highly differentiated and leading products as well as sales and business models spanning commercial, enterprise and cloud customers. Another area of concern is cost inflation, coupled with the so-called great resignation. We have seen higher-than-average levels of attrition over the last year, but lower than what has been reported for the industry as a whole. While we do expect somewhat higher labor costs this year, we expect labor cost increases to moderate going forward. Recently reported slowdowns of hiring in the tech space will soften the demand for technology professionals, which will, in turn, reduce attrition and wage inflation. We believe that this marks the beginning of a return to the old normal. Pure is a great place to work as validated by both external recognition and our own internal surveys, which has enabled us to recruit and retain top talent. Our brand and our strong talent acquisition team are attracting top performance across industries, and we are hiring to our planned targets. The final item I'd like to touch upon is the European economy given the effects of general inflation and Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Inflation, especially in energy, is projected to dampen European economies in the near term. While this may somewhat reduce overall investment capacity of European-based businesses, European customers have indicated that investment in IT is required to make up for the loss of other business modalities, as noted earlier. Furthermore, higher energy costs are already increasing demand for IT equipment that is energy efficient, something that Pure excels in. We believe that this represents another opportunity for Pure to pick up more market share. The bottom line is that technology is now the #1 driving force of enterprise strategy and business transformation. And Pure is the innovation and customer experience leader in one of the largest segments of technology investment. We believe that we are now positioned to see secular growth, less affected by this economic cycle than our competitors. Our full views of the impact of all these events are taken into consideration in our guidance. Overall, we have never been more optimistic about Pure's opportunity and growth prospects. Despite pandemic, war and market turmoil, Pure has thrived and grown. We have only gotten stronger over these last several years, and we expect to delight ever more customers in the years ahead. I'll now turn the call over to our CFO, Kevan Krysler, for a deeper look at the numbers. Very good. Thank you, Simon. I hope you're well. So Simon, our -- what we're seeing is strong momentum in the market overall. All of our products, customers buying more, the fact that we have a stronger and broader portfolio now being brought into a much greater set of opportunities in large existing customers and a stronger brand that's allowing us to penetrate net new logos and to penetrate with larger opportunities in larger companies as a net new logo. So we're actually seeing strength. And just to address your question, I would say that our -- the way we're looking at the macro is a little bit different. I would say we have not yet seen affects -- the macro affecting us or the customers that we speak to, but we are not blind to the fact that the macro and the possibility of economic slowdown can affect us going forward. So I would say what we're currently seeing -- what I'm currently seeing in the market through last quarter, continues to be strong demand by IT customers and then a greater acceptance for Pure overall, just the strengthening, if you will, of our brand and our value proposition -- and the breadth of our value proposition to our customers. And I'm going to let Rob answer the question on Snowflake. Thank you, Pinjalim. It's a great question. Let me characterize the supply chain environment now. We generally -- and if you were to ask our supply -- our operations team or engineering, they would tell you that the situation has not gotten better. It's changed in character perhaps a bit, but we still see surprises on decommits. Obviously, things like Shanghai shutting down means a lot of background work to rebalance and to find new sources of supply for various subassemblies and so forth. So it's a constant stream of challenges that are being thrown at us from a supply chain perspective. I would say that we've minimized to the point of almost nonexistent, the effect on our customers. but it's certainly affecting us a lot. Our teams are very, very busy, and I want to take my hat off to them because there's a lot of work that goes into this. But as Kevan mentioned, as did I in our prepared remarks, we have fewer parts that we need to worry about. That gives us more optionality. We have -- because we design our own hardware rather than most of our competitors are using commodity parts, they have less choice, less flexibility. So it gives us greater flexibility and our goal is to make sure we have a minimum effect on our customers. And we were fortunate to actually be able to accelerate some of the shipments this quarter, as Kevan noted. But I knock on wood as I talk about these things because the supply chain remains challenging. Yes. Thanks, Aaron. So you're correct. We've not seen this quarter substantial revenues from the nature of the hyperscaler that you spoke about before. We do -- but we've also been making good progress on both the discounting front as our -- as the market has stabilized, if you will, from a pricing standpoint as well as the ability to extract more value from our products overall. So I would say that we've been able to manage the gross margin, I think, very well. And I'll let Kevan answer the question. Well, actually, I'll take this one. As we discussed when we first started speaking about the Meta win, and that was before they permitted the use of their name, we indicated that these types of sales tend to be somewhat episodic as they build out their data centers on specific quarters. And this is one of the light quarters, but we continue working with them. We're certainly optimistic on future orders, but it will be on their time frames. Very much expected. We're not expecting the sales this quarter. That's correct. Right. Yes. It's relatively minor to be honest with you. We tend to be competing against the same set of products in the same type of environments with the same set of customers. Obviously, as we expand our sales force, we're competing across a greater set of customers, a larger set of customers, which is a good thing. We get in more fights and more at bats. And our win rates are very good. So I would say -- and our brand is certainly helping. The fact that we're now -- I think customers believe that we have to be in any competitive bake-off that they may be performing. So I would say that -- and I'll let Rob contribute here, but I haven't seen anything terribly substantial from the competitors in this space. Actually, Aaron, let me also answer it with 1 additional comment, which is we're just playing a different game than our competitors. Our competitors play a commodity game. They've been marketing their products. They've been marketing storage as a commodity. The customers should only care about price and nothing else. And we're playing a high technology game. We invest in it like it's high technology. It's an entirely different business strategy, and it's going to be very difficult, I think, for them to respond. Yes. What we mean by second phase is if we look back, our first phase of growth was building an award-winning product in a unique environment where really for many years, it was the only product of its type, and therefore, allowed us very, very rapid early growth. And as our competitors started to respond, they were able to use their larger sales forces and their greater portfolio to compete with us more effectively and so our growth slowed a bit. We've responded over the last several years as our long-time investors know, with continued investment in R&D and in particular, an investment in broadening out our sales focus and capabilities, sales and support such that we could support enterprise customers with a larger portfolio. And now we're seeing the fruits of that bear out. And so the second phase of growth is the fact that we can penetrate more into larger customers with an expanded and superior portfolio, and that's going to give us a runway, a pretty long runway to continue what I believe is going to be a second phase of growth. And we're now -- we now have the scale, if you will, to compete with any of our competitors and deploy our unfair advantage of leadership products. So that's how I phrased the second phase of growth. That says it all, Kevan. Really do. Mic drop. Well, as we spoke about in the past, Portworx is still a relatively new product and because it is, as you point out, it's ratable and goes into ARR. We are seeing very good growth in that product line overall. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, I've spent a lot of time this past quarter -- or actually over the last quarter and this quarter, in Europe and the Middle East, a lot of excitement by customers and our sales teams and partners in the product. So I think it has -- what we're -- we believe it has a really strong future as we go forward. Obviously, it will take a little bit of time before it really starts making a tangible difference, a reportable difference, if you will, in our ARR. It's an interesting question, Jason. Obviously, the numbers speak for themselves. We're clearly taking share. The market is very benign at the moment. It's a strong market despite everything that's going on. Prices at ASPs have stayed strong. That's always helpful. So I think it's been a benign market, and we're taking share. It's probably the best way to put it. Honestly, we've not really been seeing -- even over the last year, pent-up demand playing a role here. It's usually new developments, new infrastructure, expansions -- fundamental expansions, not pent-up demand. So I would say pent-up demand, at least for us, has not been playing a big role. Remember, we don't get refreshes of equipment. Our Evergreen means that the equipment is always upgraded on a regular basis. And when customers need additional capacity, they pay for that, but they don't pay for any replacement of existing capacity. So we don't get the same benefit that maybe some of our competitors get by pent-up demand because we don't have replacements. We have Evergreen. And so I would say, again, that pent-up demand has not really been a factor for us. This is all basically new demand or expansion of existing environments. So overall, I would say we've seen just strong demand and growth across the entire set of customer segments that commercial enterprise what we characterized as cloud in the past. These were all strong segments for us. I don't think, other than the continuing exceptional growth of enterprise, I wouldn't say there's been a dramatic change in the overall character of the revenues coming in. And I'll let Kevan answer the question on the accelerated shipments. You bet. I'll take it back to R&D. We invest heavily in R&D, which means that we consistently build a product that leads the market. Our competitors -- generally our largest competitors spend less than 5% on R&D. I used to run a very large R&D shop. You can barely keep the lights on at 5% R&D. They can't keep up with us from a technology development perspective. And if we're correct that data storage and management is high technology and requires continuing development of advanced capability. It's going to be very difficult for them to change their business models to accommodate that higher R&D, not just from a financial standpoint, but from the standpoint of managing a top tier -- top class R&D staff. You get a reputation. And so we -- as I said, we play a very different game. And customers have been used to buying storage as a commodity, used to substandard support and capability and assuming that all of them were alike, they're learning very quickly that Pure is very different than the other vendors that we require far less labor, that we're highly automated, that we require less space power and cooling and that they have a superior experience overall with our product, and that's being now increasingly appreciated. Yes, you bet. So we can only report on what we are actually seeing and what we're actually seeing is demand remains robust. At the same time, we're certainly taking note of the increase in inflation. The public debate around a slowdown in the economy, possible -- even some discussion about possible recession. And so we -- our outlook has to be a bit more -- I have to keep that in mind and not get ahead of ourselves. And so I think that our forecast reflects exactly that thinking. But for -- through the last quarter, demand remains strong without -- and even at the end of -- at the end of April, even though at that time, there were warning clouds on the horizon with respect to economies. Certainly, energy in the -- prices in Europe, et cetera. At the same time, we were hearing from our IT customers that their budgets and their focus on investment in IT was remaining strong. Thanks, Tim. I'll let Kevan handle the second part. As far as 5G, what an exciting opportunity and an exciting -- and call-out we were able to make for this quarter. It's one of the top telcos in the world. They're not the only ones we're talking to about 5G, but it was great to get one of the first large orders associated with 5G deployments. The fact that we're smaller, we're denser, more power efficient and generally more performance than other products in the market have certainly helped in this environment. We think it's -- as I mentioned, we are talking to quite a few other telcos about 5G deployments. I'm optimistic about this space. And I'm going to invite Rob who worked on this opportunity to tell us a little bit more about this specific deployment. I would say not at the moment. We had hoped back in Q3 and Q4 that the supply chain constraints would start to ease by Q1 or Q2. Unfortunately, we've not seen that. One situation after another just continues to extend. It changes the nature of the supply chain problems, but it extends the supply chain problems. To be clear, we've not seen it get worse, but we've not seen it get better either. And it's across the board, as you're pointing out, everything from logistics shipping, but the ones that -- we can absorb all of that, the ones that always concern us is components and availability of components because that can get you to shut -- or border closures, right? Those are the ones we're most concerned about. But it's still across the board. Thank you, operator. Our strategy to deliver a simple and Evergreen data platform, enabling our customers and companies around the world to turn their data and innovation. It continues to deliver exceptional results across our business. We're growing share in our market segments as customers turn to our leadership in digital transformation and that's critical to their future, and this promises to sustain us for quite a few quarters and hopefully years ahead. I want to thank once again our customers, our partners for their trust, our suppliers for their collaboration and to all of our employees for their innovation and their hard work. And I thank -- I'd like to thank all of our listeners today and look forward to seeing you next week at //Accelerate. Thank you."

            "name": "Kevan Krysler",
            "content": "Thank you, Charlie, and good afternoon. Robust demand across our portfolio, outstanding execution and high resilience continue to be the constant, contributing to our sustaining momentum and our very strong performance this quarter. We again saw solid demand across our portfolio of solutions, services and geographies. We saw impressive growth in our key international geographies as well as the U.S. We continue to minimize delays and deliver for our customers as the backdrop of a challenging supply chain environment has not improved. We also achieved increased profitability in cash flows during the quarter, resulting from our revenue growth and continued operational discipline despite broad-based inflationary pressures. The strength of our subscription business continues as subscription annual recurring revenue, or ARR, grew 29% to $900 million, remaining performance obligations or RPO grew to $1.43 billion. Our RPO balance when compared to Q1 of last year reflects a reduction of approximately $32 million relating to product shipments for an outstanding commitment with 1 of our global system integrators. Excluding these product shipments, our RPO also grew 29% year-over-year. We continue to be very focused on growth of our new customer business, which has improved as we increase our travel. Our total customer count reflects the acquisition of approximately 360 new customers this quarter and includes approximately 54% of the U.S. Fortune 500 customers. Total revenue for the quarter was exceptional, growing over 50% to over $620 million. Approximately $60 million of our product revenue upside this quarter was with several of our larger enterprise customers in the U.S. that we had originally forecasted to close in the second half of our fiscal year. Our customers were pleased we were able to deliver our solutions against the earlier schedule, which is a testament to the agility and resilience of our technology and supply chain. Revenue growth when excluding these transactions was still a very strong 36%. Revenue in the U.S. grew 57% and international revenue grew 33% year-over-year. Subscription services revenue grew approximately 35% year-over-year and represented approximately 35% of total revenue. Non-GAAP total gross margins were solid at 70.6% this quarter. As we have continued to highlight, we believe our integrated software and hardware designs continue to be a key differentiator that our customers appreciate and value. High performance, simplicity, sustainability and resilience of our solutions are key factors contributing to our product gross margins of 70% this quarter. Non-GAAP subscription services gross margins also continue to be strong at 71.5% this quarter. We were very pleased with achieving non-GAAP operating profit of over $85 million and non-GAAP operating margins of 13.8% this quarter. The strength of our operating profit and margin during the quarter was further improved by transactions that occurred during the quarter but were forecasted to close later in the year that I mentioned earlier. Now let's turn to the balance sheet and cash flows. We ended the quarter with over $1.29 billion in cash and approximately 4,400 employees. Cash flow from operations was over $220 million this quarter. High collections benefited both from robust sales in both Q4 and Q1. Higher profitability was also a contributing factor. Capital expenditures were approximately $33 million during the quarter. As mentioned last quarter, our outstanding credit revolver balance of $250 million was paid at the beginning of this fiscal quarter. We returned approximately $66 million of capital to repurchase slightly over 2.1 million shares during the quarter. We have approximately $184 million remaining from our $250 million share repurchase program. Now turning to guidance. Clearly, we are executing well against our strategy of driving strong revenue growth and continued improvement in profitability. We expect continued demand strength in Q2 with estimated revenue to be approximately $635 million, growing approximately 28%. We expect non-GAAP operating profit to be approximately $75 million in Q2, representing approximately 11.8% non-GAAP operating margin. Given our Q1 performance and outlook for Q2, as well as consideration of the current macro environment, we are raising our annual guidance for the full fiscal year. We now expect that revenue for FY \u201823 will be $2.66 billion, growing approximately 22%. Non-GAAP operating profit is estimated to be approximately $320 million, representing approximately 12% non-GAAP operating margin. Revenue and estimated profits from transactions that were projected to close later in the year, but closed during Q1 were included in our original annual guidance. In closing, our team and partners continue to deliver as the results this quarter were exceptional. Our sustained commitment to innovation provides our customers with solutions that are highly performing and reliable. On integrated software and hardware that require fewer components consume substantially less energy and space and produce less waste than other flash storage alternatives in the market. Strong demand for our market-leading solutions and excellent execution, in particular to our supply chain, providing our leading storage and data management solutions to our customers when and where they need it, will help us deliver 22% annual revenue growth, along with 12% non-GAAP operating margins. With that, I will turn it over to the operator so we can get to your questions. Operator? Two other things I'd add to that is high confidence with the risk that Charlie alluded to. I'd say the -- the other thing I'd add to it is our supply partners are doing a terrific job as well. And the 3 factors combined, I think, really drives the sustainability confidence that we have around the supply chain even acknowledging the risks that we've alluded to. The other thing I'd point out is NAND is not subject to the same types of challenges and constraints that we see across -- really around the IC side and semiconductor side. And so obviously, that's the biggest part of our BOM and materials, and that's an important call-out as well. I think that's right. That's a good way to be thinking about it. I mean we had a lot of volume coming through on the CapEx side. But look, the subscription business continues to be strong. ARR growing 29%. I would be expecting variability quarter-to-quarter. We're very focused on accelerating growth with our partner ecosystem, a lot of great energy out there and looking forward to accelerate and talking to our partners around Pure as-a-Service. We've got some key milestones that we've identified around general availability for Pure Fusion and imported data services. And really, this takes us on a roadmap that we've talked about that Charlie has laid out around really establishing a cloud operating model for every customer no matter where their workloads are being run. I'd say stay tuned, too. We're very excited with some new announcements of Evergreen at //Accelerate as well. Yes. And I think to be clear, that was expected, right? Well, look, I mean -- this is Kevan. I'll start with that, and I'll let Charlie add to it. I'm not sure it makes sense to decouple supply versus the power of our portfolio and our technology. I mean when you look at the architecture of our technology and how we're leveraging software and how we -- from an architecture standpoint, require less components, simpler in terms of architecture. That's obviously helping us a lot on the supply side. But then that's also what really resonates for customers, right? It's performance, it's resilient. It's simple to use. And the -- our ESG report, we've got some just kind of stunning stats in terms of what we're doing in terms of sustainability and in energy reduction with the architecture that we're leveraging with our portfolio. So I would actually say that the 2 go together from my perspective. Charlie, any other thoughts? Rod, it's a great question. It was very much the latter. We -- obviously, we have visibility with these large enterprise customers in terms of our plan. In terms of our discussions, they came back to us requesting earlier delivery. I could appreciate those requests given the environment, but it's really the latter to your point, Rod. Yes, it's a great question, Jason. And then I think the simple answer is no. There were no significant changes to our assumptions. Look, the first thing we evaluated pretty carefully was demand signals. And as Charlie mentioned, demand continues to be quite strong. Obviously, a lot of noise out there from a macro perspective that we're digesting and understanding what, if any, impact that will have for us in second half. But when I really break it down and look and compare against our initial guide for the year, we're outperforming. We saw that from a demand standpoint in Q1. We see that in terms of our guide for Q2 and then obviously increasing our annual guide for the year. So I think it's business as usual with the outperformance that we're seeing in Q1 and Q2. Yes. It is interesting too, Jason, when you look at seasonality, pre-COVID for us and growth rates and you normalize for the $60 million that we alluded to. I'll tell you that the seasonality is matching kind of the pre-COVID days in terms of first half, second half growth rates. So that's another data point for thoughts as well. Yes. And I would call out actually that international had a fantastic quarter along with U.S. And so to Charlie's point on broad-based performance, we saw that from a geography standpoint, I was really pleased with what we saw in the international side, which really, when you normalize for the $60 million in the U.S., it's really tracking with the U.S. growth rates. And as Charlie talked about commercial, we saw some good strength there. Public sector was a highlight for us as well in terms of how we look at it. So again, when we look at the $40 million of outperformance, I would, again, talk about the power of the portfolio we have. Enterprise is absolutely a workhorse for us, but we're seeing it across the board. Yes. That sounds great, Sidney. Let me start with revenue growth. And look, we're very pleased with the raise of our annual guide to 22%. I think that's very strong. Obviously, an outlier in terms of what we're seeing, especially in this environment. So not backing away from that annual growth rate, which I think is very strong. You're seeing strong growth in the first half, and you're seeing some moderation in the second half. Some of that is seasonality. The $60 million that we alluded to that really was contemplated and forecasted for second half. But when normalizing for this seasonality, the expected growth rate in the back half is still in the high teens, which is quite strong. And then again, as I talked with Jason about when you look at our growth rates, first half, second half from a seasonality standpoint, we're kind of getting back to what we saw in the pre-COVID days, which is great. A couple of other thoughts. As we progress through the year, we're also working with strong comps. I mean, we had a fantastic year last year, and that's only growing. We also had an extra week in the fourth quarter. So that's a consideration as well. And we are being thoughtful about the macro environment as well. But without a doubt, we're pleased with our revenue growth outlook for the year. Now if I move to operating profits, which was really the second piece of your question, we feel really good about the current view and increasing profitability. This is our execution against our strategy that Charlie laid out, which is absolutely prioritizing innovation and growth while at the same time improving profitability, and that's what you're seeing here. So we're quite pleased with the operating profits in the quarter. Expect 12% operating margin for the year. And obviously, our profit overachievement this quarter was helped by the transactions that were moved into Q1. We're also doing very well on hiring in Q1. We've made great progress in hiring talent, and we continue to invest thoughtfully and we'll continue to be focused on operating discipline and operating leverage as we monitor the effects of inflation at time that is on. So hopefully, that answers your question. Yes, we might be a broken record on the product gross margins. Look, I still think longer term, I'm very happy with product gross margins being in the high 60s. I think once again, we've overachieved and I'm very pleased. I think the sales team is doing a tremendous job selling the value of our solution, and we're seeing that in the average selling prices as we navigated Q1. So I think that's a large driver on it. In terms of subscription gross margins, what we've been tracking is pretty consistent in the low 70s, and that's a good kind of corridor that I like in terms of subscription gross margins. Yes. I mean, look, I think when you look at the subscription revenue growth, I mean, that's really a late indicator. I mean that's revenue coming off the balance sheet over time. I think when I really look at the health of our subscription business, I'm looking at our subscription ARR balance as well as how we're doing from an RPO standpoint, which grew 29%. And look, I'm very pleased with that. That's very strong growth. We're set up well. We've got a lot of good things happening in terms of our accelerated announcements on Evergreen. And so -- and obviously, you're going to get a little bit of variability on subscription ARR as well as RPO growth. But again, if I'm looking at the revenue and rolling off the balance sheet to the top line, I think that's really not a strong indicator in terms of the health of the subscription business. Now the other thing, Nehal, that I would highlight to you is when you're comparing quarter-to-quarter and you've got to build in the extra week in Q4, which would have a bearing on that as well. Yes. And then just to answer your question in terms of the $60 million, that would have been a couple of large customers, so it was limited. Obviously, for these large enterprise customers, we're working with them very closely with their demand planning. So I would put it in more of the isolated bucket, very easy for us to quantify, very binary in terms of understanding in our demand planning with the customer that, that was second half. So that's a shift in seasonality. And that's how I view it. It's simply a shift in seasonality. It has nothing to do in my mind with demand drop-off as one might have alluded to in the second half. Demand looks strong. Revenue, as I mentioned, I went through a fair amount of detail, Wamsi, in terms of revenue first half, second half as well as operating profit first half and second half, and we can take you through that in more detail as well. And I'll just hit the operating profit question again. And really, this just comes back down to our strategy really around prioritizing innovation and growth that's paying off. We're seeing it. We've been seeing it for several quarters. And at the same time, we're increasing our profitability. Now we're balancing that. We had some great hiring, as I mentioned. I think we quarter-over-quarter, hired over 170 folks and new talent worldwide, which we're really pleased with. We are navigating some higher wage costs as to be expected, and all that's being balanced and incorporated while we're increasing profitability for the year. So hopefully, that's a helpful context. It's across the board. And where the advantage again comes to us is really around the fact that we have less parts that we have to navigate in terms of exposure. And that's really paying off for us, both on the inflationary side as well as supply constraints and how we've been able to navigate against that headwind."

With that, I'll turn it over to Charlie.\nCharles Giancarlo: Thank you, Paul. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our Q4 and fiscal 2024 earnings call. We had a solid Q4 performance and ended the year with increasing sales momentum and balanced performance across our theaters and product portfolio. This momentum and growing customer interest in our platform strategy provides us with increased confidence for the coming year. This year, we expanded our Evergreen portfolio and increased subscription services revenue now to over 40% of total revenue. FY '24 total contract value sales for Evergreen/One and Evergreen/Flex grew to over $400 million, more than doubling over the prior year. product and platform innovation was strong as evidenced by FlashBlade now exceeding $2 billion in total sales since launch.  FlashBlade continues to serve as the leading platform for customers' modern file and object data requirements for both high performance and low-cost applications. Launched just 9 months ago, our new E-family of products achieved the fastest sales growth of any pure product, presaging that flash will soon replace all disk. Our data storage platform strategy and vision is working and continues to succeed with large enterprises and managed service providers, Pure's strategy to consolidate data storage using a single operating and management environment for the majority of storage requirements just makes more sense than managing multiple different and disparate system environments.  Pure's direct reliability and economics continue to be unmatched and customers appreciate our Evergreen guarantee of no application downtime with system upgrades. Pure's platform strategy incorporating Pure Fusion, which enables Pure systems to operate as a distributed storage cloud combines the best features of enterprise storage with cloud agility and programmability. It enables customers to manage their data environment as unified storage pools, seamlessly spanning across data centers and public cloud platforms, all within a single operating and management framework.  Pure allows customers to organize their data infrastructure efficiently and optimize their data environment. Our platform vision was a major factor in several strategic enterprise deals in Q4. In one example, a major Fortune 500 financial services firm selected Pure based on our platform strategy, our proven reliability, and our ability to satisfy the majority of their diverse storage needs with a consistent environment and cloud-like operation and efficiency. This high 8-figure deal comprised almost all of Pure's products and services and represents our growing success in large enterprise.  A second notable 8-figure deal this past quarter with an Evergreen/One deal with one of the largest specialized GPU cloud providers for artificial intelligence, offering highly differentiated AI infrastructure solutions to their customers. Pure is excited to partner with this company to deliver one of the most powerful and fastest AI training environments in the world. However, what truly excites me about AI confirmed through conversations with customers and partners is the focus that it is bringing to customers fragmented data environments. Customers are beginning to realize that their current fragmented data storage environment will significantly hinder their ability to leverage AI to unlock the full potential of their data.  Current data storage environments inhibit AI deployments in 2 ways. First, existing data storage arrays were selected to provide just enough performance for their primary function, leaving little performance left for AI access. Second, existing storage arrays are not networked, limiting access to AI apps not provisioned directly on their primary compute stack. The Pure Storage platform solves both of these issues. Pure's E-family delivers flash reliability and efficiency at prices now comparable to traditional hard disk systems and with plenty of performance there for AI access.  And the single operating and management environment of the pure platform across protocols and price performance ranges makes accessing data easier. We are also seeing increased numbers of Portworx deployments in AI environments for data management preparation. Portworx had a record year and accelerated growth based on customers increasingly graduating their container-based development projects to production scale. Portworx saw strong sales in the financial sector this past quarter. A leading global financial institution significantly improved the efficiency and lower the cost of critical Tier 0 applications by automating its internal cloud infrastructure with Portworx. Portworx industry leadership was recognized by IDC, which positioned Portworx as an industry leader in their new and latest Kuganetes container data management category.  As we reported all year, Evergreen/One consistently experienced breakout growth. Customers appreciate the simplicity of Evergreen's/One SaaS model. The Evergreen One service offers always improving data services, always modern infrastructure and a world-class customer experience with contractually guaranteed service level agreements. Now with Evergreen/One, Pure pays customers for power and rack space when hosting the service in their data centers. Adding to our SLA industry leadership, Pure introduced 3 new SLA guarantees this past year. One, no data migration; two, 0 data loss; and three, power and space efficiency across our Evergreen family, Evergreen/Forever, Evergreen/One and Evergreen/Flex offerings.  Our commitment to offering the most sustainable storage solutions in the industry continues to drive competitive advantage for customers focused on their environmental reporting. Furthermore, the energy demands of AI is outstripping the availability of power in many data center environments. Pure Flash Solutions can reduce data center power usage, space and e-waste by approximately 20%, and this is proving critical in an environment driven by artificial intelligence and the world's growing demand for data. We are increasingly confident in our platform strategy and our opportunity to lead this market. Our evergreen technology and programs are changing the industry of allowing customers to eliminate the need to continually rebuy and disruptively replace outdated hardware.  Most importantly, to enterprises, sure reduces risk. Eliminating application downtime due to infrastructure updates and upgrades while dramatically improving system reliability. Our confidence is bolstered by our 4 sustainable competitive advantages. This includes our ability to deliver a single operating and management environment for the majority of enterprise data storage needs. Our Evergreen technology, which guarantees an always modern environment without application disruption, our management, which enables both performance and cost leadership. And finally, our cloud operating model, which allows customers to manage all of their data across data centers and clouds as unified pools of data.  While we remain cautious about the economy, we are beginning to see some encouraging signs of improvement in the macro environment. As the industry's most performant consistent and sustainable storage solution we are well positioned to serve both the energy and data-intensive demands of artificial intelligence. Additionally, after 18 months of steep declines, NAND market pricing has stabilized, which should improve storage market growth. Looking forward to FY '25, a I have high confidence of returning to double-digit revenue growth, given our platform strategy, our growing product portfolio, our cloud operating model, and strong customer demand for our Evergreen and Fort Works subscription offerings. With that, I'd like to turn it over to Kevan now.\nKevan Krysler: Thank you, Charlie. We are pleased with our Q4 financial performance, exceeding guidance for both revenue and operating profit. As we were expecting, customer demand for our consumption and subscription-based offerings was very strong, especially for Evergreen/One, our Storage as a Service offering and Portworx. Annual sales for both offerings grew over 100% in FY '24 and total contract value or TCV sales for Evergreen/One and Evergreen/Flex exceeded $400 million. Remaining performance obligations, or RPO, associated solely with our subscription service offerings at the end of Q4 was very strong, growing 29%. Our subscription services net dollar retention, or MDR at the end of the year was 120%.  For the year, revenue grew 2.8%. As a reminder, our annual revenue growth expectations at the beginning of FY '24, assumed that Evergreen/One and Evergreen/Flex TCV sales would grow approximately 50%. When adjusting for the substantial growth above our expectations at the beginning of the year for Evergreen/One and Evergreen/Flex TCV sales and a noncancelable product sale with a telco customer we mentioned last quarter that is expected to be shipped in FY '25, revenue growth for the year would have been over 7%. As a reminder, revenue from our Evergreen/One and Evergreen/Flex consumption and subscription service offerings are recognized over time. Whereas product revenue related to sales of our products across our data storage platform is recognized upon shipment.  Operating margin for FY '24 was approximately 16% above our original guide of 15% at the beginning of the year. Key contributors of our operating margin strength were strong gross margins across our data storage platform reflecting the value of our solutions and disciplined investing. Total RPO, which also includes product orders grew 31% year-over-year in Q4, exceeding $2.3 billion. Product orders included in total RPO at the end of Q4, including a noncancelable telco order that we mentioned last quarter, and orders relating to a significant win in Q4 with a major Fortune 500 financial services company.  In Q4, subscription services annual recurring revenue or ARR grew 25% to approximately $1.4 billion, highlighting the strong traction for our consumption and subscription-based service offerings. As we mentioned previously, subscription services ARR excludes noncancelable Evergreen subscription contracts where the effective service date has not started. Including noncancelable subscription contracts where the effective service date has not started, Subscription Services ARR at the end of Q4 grew 27%. Subscription services revenue during Q4 was $329 million, growing 24% and comprising 42% of total revenue.  U.S. revenue for Q4 was $522 million, and international revenue was $268 million. Our new customer acquisition grew by 349 customers during Q4, including 6 new Fortune 500 customers. We now serve slightly over 60% of the Fortune 500. Product and subscription services gross margin both contributed to total gross margin strength of 73.7% in Q4 and 73.2% for the year. In Q4, product gross margin was 73.4% and subscription services gross margin was 74.1%. Our headcount increased slightly to nearly 5,600 employees at the end of the quarter. Pure's balance sheet and liquidity remains very strong, including approximately $1.5 billion in cash and investments at the end of Q4. Cash flow from operations during the quarter was approximately $244 million and approximately $678 million for FY '24.  Capital expenditures during the year were nearly $200 million. Representing approximately 6.9% of revenue for FY '24. Factors driving our higher capital expenditures during the year included sales growth of our Evergreen/One Storage as a Service offering, our new headquarters and test equipment supporting our engineering team for new product innovations. In Q4, we repurchased 585,000 shares of stock returning approximately $21.4 million to our shareholders. For the year, we repurchased nearly 4.7 million shares, returning nearly $136 million in capital to our shareholders. Consistent with our remarks last quarter, our share repurchases represent a lower level of repurchase activity as a result of the fixed trading parameters that were in place throughout the quarter.  We have approximately $145 million remaining on our existing $250 million repurchase authorization, and we are announcing today a new share repurchase authorization of $250 million. Now turning to our guidance for FY '25. We expect to return to double-digit revenue growth in FY '25, growing 10.5% to $3.1 billion. We expect demand across our entire data storage platform will strengthen while also remaining cautious of the macro spending environment. Our annual revenue guide of 10.5% growth also contemplates approximately 50% growth in TCV sales for our collective Evergreen/One and Evergreen/Flex service offerings, which are expected to be $600 million.  To help better understand the short-term impact that growth of our consumption and subscription offerings have on our annual revenue growth rate we estimate that our forecasted FY '25 revenue growth would be in the mid-teens when adjusting for the expected growth of both our Evergreen/One and Evergreen/Flex service offerings. Slightly offset by expected additional revenue arising from past TCV sales in FY '24. Consistent with our philosophy in driving profitable growth, we expect FY '25 operating profit to be $532 million, and operating margin to be 17%. Margin for FY '25 is in line with our longer-term goal of expanding operating margin by a percentage point or 2 each year and represents a 2-point increase from our FY '24 guide that we communicated at the beginning of the year.  We are pleased with our expectations of getting back to double-digit revenue growth and continuing strong growth from our nev Storage as a Service, and Evergreen/Flex offerings. Pure's data storage platform and Evergreen architecture delivers substantial business value to our customers by reducing complexity, while increasing reliability, flexibility and unparalleled power and cost efficiencies. With that, I'll turn it back to Paul for Q&A.\nA - Paul Ziots: Thanks, Kevan. [Operator Instructions]. If you have additional questions, we kindly ask that you please rejoin the queue and we'll be happy to take those additional questions if time allows. Operator, let's get started.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. The first question is from Amit Daryanani from Evercore.\nAmit Daryanani: Thanks a lot. Good afternoon, everyone, and congrats on a nice print here. I guess, Charlie, the question for you really is it looks like Evergreen/One sales should continue to grow at a really robust rate again into fiscal '25 after what you did in '24. Can you just touch on what do you think is resonating so well from a value proposition basis with customers when it comes to Evergreen/One offering. And then is there a framework to think about how much of your revenue base kind of your shipment base, if you may, could actually move to a subscription model over time?\nCharles Giancarlo: Yes. Thanks, Amit. Hope you're doing well. So actually, I think I could answer the question in really two ways. The economic and then the noneconomic, and I'll start with the noneconomic first. What's very exciting about Evergreen/One is that it really is a SaaS-like model. And I think just like you and probably everybody else on this call, no longer use external hard drives on their on their PCs or laptops, but use some type of cloud-based service. Because of the ease, it's managed for you. You don't have to worry about it failing, you're able to easily just subscribe to more capacity if that's what you need without worrying about having to go out and buy and configure a new system. The same is true with our Evergreen/One service. That is it really is storage as a service, whether that is deployed in the cloud, in a colo or actually on the customer's premise. And now it's deployed on the customer's premise, we pay them for hosting it for us.  So from the customer standpoint, it has all of the attributes of a SaaS service. They manage entirely through the cloud. We manage it otherwise. We're constantly looking at it from a capacity and performance standpoint. Upgraded as necessary, mostly remotely. And so it's a very easy service and completely managed. And of course, that's the way that the modern world is operating now and the reason why many customers are they attracted to the service. Of course, the economic elements of it are that they only pay for what they use when they use it, they don't need to buy a system that is sized at the rate that they think they'll need 4 or 5 years, hence, that they're able to just pay for what they -- as I said, and what they use when they use it.  So it's compelling from both economic and noneconomic purposes. Lastly, 2% in terms of total subscription. And so I think easily, with any continued growth in this environment, we certainly see our way clear to a majority of revenue over time being in the subscription category.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Aaron Rakers from Wells Fargo.\nAaron Rakers: Yes. And also congrats on the quarter. I wanted to ask about the numbers a little bit. The RPO balance at $2.3 billion stands out, but I think even more notably is the unbilled component of that at about $709 million. That's up about 90% year-over-year. I know, Kevan, you talked about the $41 million from the telco sitting in that number this last quarter, but you also alluded to -- it sounds like a very large significant win with a major financial services company. I think if we unpack that, that might give us a little bit more insight into the subscription growth that you're seeing. So I'm wondering if you could help us bridge that growth in the unbilled RPO number ex those big product contributions in the quarter? And just any help would be useful.\nKevan Krysler: That's great, Aaron, you I will give you some of the bridging discussion. But before we get into it, yes, we're really excited about this Fortune 500 win. Let me have Charlie explain that a little bit, and then I'll provide some bridging information for you.\nCharles Giancarlo: Yes, the wind came in a bit late in the quarter. So it's obvious that you will be deploying that through this new fiscal year. Very exciting. They really -- it was a deal that covered really the majority, if not most of Pure's services, our products. And frankly, it was all based on them buying into and fully understanding the ramifications of having a single operating environment to unify their data storage environment. So really pleased with that win.\nKevan Krysler: And then, Aaron, from a bridging standpoint, our total RPO, which would include product orders. And again, that's the telco order and that's the significant win with the Fortune 500. And you're exactly right. Both of those would be unbilled because we haven't shipped the product yet. So as we ship that product, you'll see more billings come through. as it relates to that RPO. But the other large piece of it is going to be the significant growth of our Evergreen/One and Evergreen/Flex subscription offerings. And again, we build for that either annually, quarterly, depending on what the customers' preferences are. So that will be a large piece of the end build that you're seeing as well.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Meta Marshall from Morgan Stanley.\nMeta Marshall: Great. Maybe on the AI discussion, I think a lot of the conversations we've been having with investors is just trying to figure out the timing of when you would expect some of these storage investments versus -- is that in the data preparedness time as you're getting ready for inference. Just any kind of patterns that you're seeing just in terms of timing when enterprises or other customers are considering these investments?  And then maybe just as a second question, there's been a lot of talk about volatility in NAND pricing, hammer on -- from some of the disk vendors, is there even a conversation about are we at a different crossover point this year? Or has the conversation really moved on to, okay, I'm moving my infrastructure eventually to all-flash let's not be concerned about a quarter-on-quarter price differential?\nPaul Ziots: Meta, this is Paul. I'm sorry, I'm going to be the bad guy so that the others don't get upset with us. We'll take your first question. And at the end, we'll pick back up on your last question.\nCharles Giancarlo: Sorry, I had to follow that. So let's talk about AI. And you're right. I'm sort of looking at the AI market in three categories. One is the modeling area, that's a super high-performance GPUs, super high-performance storage, everything to go along with it. The inference market, which involves perhaps some GPUs but -- and good performance, but not necessarily the supercharged performance. And then just the data -- the general data or the uplift to data storage that needs to take place so that customers can get access to data that's right now in silos.  Obviously, the market has been transfixed with the modeling side of things. And I think appropriately so, but I do think out of all of them, it's probably the smallest in terms of total market size. And of course, the world is going dog on that, and we're tracking a lot of different entities and activities on that in the modeling part of the market. I think inference is only just beginning. Customers trying to figure out what they're going to do there. I think what's really impressed me over the last 6 months as I've spoken to both customers and large integrators and channels that work with customers is everybody starting to recognize that their current data environment is not really up to the task of being able to even offer the data, let alone do it at high performance to the AI environments that they'll want to create.  So that's -- I view that as a very large opportunity. So I would say we're still very early in this. I think that's the other part of your question. I think we're very early in this, and I think it's going to take some time for it to to work its way through the enterprise -- through enterprises planning horizons.\nRobert Lee: Yes. And Meta, this is Rob. Just to jump in on that. I would definitely agree echoing Charlie's comments. For my own discussions with customers, I think we're early in cycle in terms of customers, really understanding how do they transition from breaking down the silos that are fragmenting their data today, moving away from physical limitations to being able to connect data access through automation and policy certainly bringing performance to all areas of their data. I think the other discussion that we're having is customers that are navigating this space are realizing the importance of future proofing their technology decisions, especially as it pertains to infrastructure investments.  If you're investing in building out infrastructure to modernize and prepare your environment for AI, it's absolutely critical that you're making choices that are going to be utmost flexibility just because of the speed that the space is moving in. And so when you kind of map that, you got to step back from that and map that down to the Pure portfolio, very pleased with our position, right? You can see where our single consistent software and hardware operating environment with Fusion, really helping customers emerge from that fragmented data storage position.  Certainly, what we're doing with in terms of bringing performance, much needed performance to an area storage that frankly has been lacking that for quite some time. And then certainly with Evergreen, bringing that future proofing and optionality.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Tim Long from Barclays.\nTimothy Long: I wanted to follow back up on margins and leverage a little bit here. Kind of as it pertains to the company becoming a little bit more of a subscription service based. So maybe kind of a 2-parter here. Just talk about the gross margin line. It does look like that's probably guided a little bit lower. It's been a pretty high level. What are the levers on the gross margin line?  And then maybe, Kevan, can you just talk a little bit about the kind of OpEx investment in an environment where more of the revenues is going to be pulling off of the subscription line?\nPaul Ziots: Tim, I'll jump in and be the bad guy again. Kevan, please go ahead and take the gross margin question, and we'll come back to the OpEx later.\nKevan Krysler: Yes. And I'll do that in the context of FY '25, and we can go into some more detail if needed. But look, pleased with both gross margin and operating margin performance as we think about it in '24, and it really is consistent with our philosophy of driving profitable growth. And as we look to FY '25, we're again expecting to expand our operating margin to 17% while also returning to double-digit revenue growth. And this assumes that our operating expenses will grow at a slightly lower rate than what we saw in FY '24 as we continue to invest in our sales capacity and in innovation.  And you're right, Tim, this would then imply a slight decline in gross margins, which we expect to be derived principally within product gross margins as we continue to penetrate the disk market and scale our E-family. So hopefully, that's helpful for you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Howard Ma from Guggenheim Partners.\nHoward Ma: My question is for Kevan. Kevan, based on the customer data you have so far, on average, how much smaller does the TCV for an OpEx deal start compared to a CapEx deal? And what is the crossover point. And just on a related note, I think it would be helpful for us if you could comment on the range of scenarios where an OpEx deal might start smaller or maybe much smaller than then a CapEx deal and scenarios where an OpEx deal might start at the same size of the CapEx deal.\nKevan Krysler: Yes, it's a great question, Howard, and I'll let Charlie and Rob jump into as they see fit. But when we think about. Obviously, we have a lot of variation in terms of sizing between our CapEx offerings as well as Evergreen/One. And frankly, when we pull out the on-demand billings and then do a straight comparison, on average deal size, we're actually pretty close. When you take a step back between value at the order level between CapEx and Evergreen One. But again, our data points are principally around FY '24. Still a lot more time to see how that evolves. And Charlie, do you have any other points you'd want to raise?\nCharles Giancarlo: Yes. Howard, it's a great question, and we're trying to actually dig down into ourselves in a number of different ways because rarely do we have a situation where the customer is deciding for the same -- exactly the same environment, one versus the other. And because of that, as Kevan mentioned, we have average numbers. Average numbers, if you look across the entire customer base and all the deals in the quarter are coming out about the same, but that may not be true on an individual deal-by-deal basis. My gut tells me that that the average TCV of Evergreen/One deal is somewhat lower than the CapEx, but that's got level reaction not yet bolstered by data. We're hoping to get a better handle of that over the next couple of quarters. What I will say, we do know, though, the breakeven. The breakeven is approximately 2.5 years.\nKevan Krysler: That would be the revenue breakeven.\nCharles Giancarlo: Sorry, the revenue breakeven or the same amount of capacity. And that -- what you're asking about is not necessarily the same level of capacity, and we're still trying to figure that out.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Pinjalim Bora from JPMorgan.\nPinjalim Bora: Great. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on the quarter. Just one question for Kevan. Kevan, I'm trying to understand the guidance and kind of the assumption around your TCV bookings for Evergreen/One last year -- or fiscal '24 when you guided, we obviously -- you had to raise the assumption on Evergreen/One bookings contribution through the year, and that led to a headwind to top line growth, what gives you confidence that 50% is kind of the right number and that at the end of the year or through half the year, it's not going to be 100%. I understand the numbers are a little bigger and you're assuming kind of the similar dollar additions. But I'm trying to understand just the risk to the top line guide.\nKevan Krysler: Yes, I appreciate the question, Pinjalim. And look, when we're coming up with our guide for both the TCV sales of Evergreen/One and Evergreen/Flex as well as our revenue guide, you have to imagine a lot of work in terms of modeling, looking at pipeline, looking at opportunities are involved as part of that process. And look, that then informs our best view, if you will, of guide, which is 10.5% for revenue and the 50% growth rate that we gave for TCV sales for Evergreen/One and Evergreen/Flex.  And -- but you really -- your question is, hey, what if we see significant changes in mix and what's the impact? And how do we think about that similar to the impact we saw in FY '24. And look, if our sales mix results in less TCV sales growth of our subscription and consumption offerings, we would expect that our FY '25 revenue growth would increase. That would be our expectation as we sit here today. Now on the reverse side, if TCV sales of Evergreen/One and Evergreen/Flex grow significantly and well outperforms our assumption of 50% growth that would have an impact on our revenue growth rate. And as we progress through the year, we'll continue to update sales performance across sales of Evergreen/One and Flex to give you that visibility.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Chris Steinar from TD Cowen.\nHadi Orabi: This is Eddy for Chris. I'd like to ask about the 8-figure deal with major GPU cloud provider you guys talked about. Can you talk about where pure systems are being used for and there like are your systems directly feeding the GPUs for training or inference or are they being used in backup and archive for example? Also wondering if you can discuss the FlashBlade versus FlashArray mix in there and whether there is some E-Series I think investors would like to understand where your systems sit within these AR workloads so they can better understand the opportunity there?\nRobert Lee: Yes, Eddy, this is Rob. Thanks for the question. I'll take that one. So Charlie mentioned, very excited about this win. The customer here is one of the largest GPU cloud providers. What's interesting and kind of exciting about the usage and use cases in this environment is it's really a mix of a number of use cases, all involved in AI training workflow. So a portion of it is being used for data preparation, pre and post processing. A large portion is being used for direct AI training. That is, as you said, directly feeding training data into and out of GPU servers, a lot of model experimentation is being done in these environments.  As well, this environment is supporting a large number of users doing -- kind of going through these workflows and doing this development and performing these tasks. I think the second part of your question was to better understand the product mix as part of the sale. I will remind you, this was a large Evergreen/One deal, which is I think speaks to the dynamic nature of a lot of the work in this space. as a lot of the AI workflows expand beyond just high-speed training into the broader set of data preparation, all the elements that I just walked you through Evergreen/One creates a lot of flexibility in that model for the service provider, the cloud provider, in this case, to deploy the right service levels for the right usages.  That said, [indiscernible] environment is being served with the FlashBlade product set. So hopefully, that gives you a little bit more color to think about our opportunity and really the points of validation in the space.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jason Ader from William Blair.\nJason Ader: Just wanted to ask if and when you might be willing to give us revenues from Evergreen/One and Flex.\nKevan Krysler: Jason, great question. Let us work through the transparency we're giving you on TCV sales for the time being and the conversion of those TCV sales in terms of normalized revenue, and you'll see that in the slides we presented, I think that is a level of bridging we'll want to do at this point in time in terms of where we're sitting.\nOperator: Our next question comes from David Vogt from UBS.\nDavid Vogt: And Kevan, I'm going to come back to that prior question. If I -- I'm just trying to think through all of the different disclosures that you gave for '24 and '25, and trying to normalize for the traditional model historically, product and/or services. I mean just based on my math, it looks like your revenue over the last couple of years would have compounded at roughly 9%. Is that a reasonable framework when I make all the adjustments for the model transition and the telco customers push out from '24 and '25. And if that's the case, what's the core underlying sort of storage demand that you think underpins that over the last couple of years? And how did your share during those periods?\nKevan Krysler: Charlie, do you want to hit storage demand and market share first and then I'll hit the modeling question.\nCharles Giancarlo: Yes. I think the core, David, of your question really relates to are we picking up market share at what rate? We feel pretty confident that we're in the still -- we remain in the 15% market share pickup rate for a variety, which is not necessarily reported by the reporting agencies mainly because they do not incorporate our Evergreen/Forever subscription, which, as you know, means that we don't resell the same storage when an array becomes obsolete because in our case, arrays don't become obsolete.  So with that, I can't -- I think the team is taking a good look at the -- we know what it would have been -- and Kevan stated it in his preamble that it would have been around 7 -- a little over 7% this year. I don't have the numbers for the prior year. Do you have that, Kevan? No. We love to get back to you on that. But your basic premise that the market is under accounting, what we believe is -- would be our growth if our Evergreen/One sales were actually in standard product sales is absolutely correct.\nKevan Krysler: The other thing too, David, is you can kind of do back of the envelope calculation to estimate the amount of revenue that's coming off Evergreen/One and Evergreen/Flex given that average duration of these contracts is around 3 years, and obviously, we've given you the TCV sales for FY '24, growing in excess of 100% as well as our expectations for TCV sales for Evergreen/One and Evergreen Flex for FY '25.\nOperator: Comes from Tom Blakey from KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nThomas Blakey: Across your products, Charlie, could you just maybe talk about the FER and straight-up product sales kind of like exit rates in fiscal 4Q and what you're kind of seeing in fiscal 1Q to maybe even and get some insight into the level of possible conservatism in your guide there on the product side.\nCharles Giancarlo: As we indicated, I think, at the end of our -- in our Q3 call and now in Q4, we are seeing strong indications of improving demand both, I think, in the actual results as well as in pipeline as we go forward and in our conversations with customers overall. So that's what's giving us confidence. I think, Kevan, in terms of -- we generally don't provide direct exit rates, but...\nKevan Krysler: Yes, we don't. But I think we've taught it directionally. And obviously, the strength we're seeing, both in FY '24 and FY '25 is really being driven from a growth perspective. Buyer subscription services and subscription services revenue. And when we think about it directionally next year, but to Charlie's point, he's right, we don't guide specifically on product revenue and subscription revenue. I think it's a good way to think about product revenue being flattish to maybe slightly down and really that growth being driven by our subscription services overall for FY '25.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Simon Leopold from Raymond James.\nSimon Leopold: Earlier in the Q&A, Charlie broke down the AI opportunities into sort of the 3 buckets, and I found that helpful. And what I really wanted to see if we could unpack a bit is the item described as data uplift. In other words, I'm trying to get a better sense of what you're assuming for really the timing of when that becomes material and how you expect it to manifest itself in terms of -- is it sales to enterprises as opposed to needing to break into hyperscalers or the operators of the AI platform. Just a little bit more impacting if that would help.\nCharles Giancarlo: Absolutely, Simon. So I think your instinct on this is absolutely correct. What the concept is that, of course, regardless of the manner in which enterprises want to build, whether they want to build their own data environment for AI or do their own modeling or do their own inference or not. They do have to make their data available for analysis by the AI engine. In order to do that, their data today is largely trapped, I say, trapped in silos. It's on storage environments that were largely purchased very much -- storage is bought with economics in mind. And they are purchased at the performance level and at the capacity level necessary for their primary job, which generally means there's not a lot of performance left over to be able to serve up data for analytics of any type, let alone AI.  And even if they had that performance, they're not networked. Traditional storage arrays are not networked at the array level. You have to go through the application environment. which is not terribly useful and very indirect. That would mean that customers would generally have to copy that data and buy new arrays anyway. And in our case, what our platform allows them to do is replace those arrays for their primary purpose going from disk to flash and have plenty of performance left over for the AI environment.  So they get to modernize their environment reduce their power spacing cooling by a factor of 10, have much higher reliability, lower labor associated with it. And at the same time now update their data environment so that it is available for AI analysis.\nRobert Lee: And just to build on that a little bit. Charlie mentioned a lot of these silos and fragmented pools of data storage really aren't network today. Let me take it from a customer and a procurement lens. If you look at a lot of these environments, data storage has historically been purchased and configured application by application, department by department completely independently. And in a world where that data is really only being used for a single purpose, that worked okay. But the whole power of AI technology is being able to connect all these data sets and glean from them in unison greater insights in order to do that, you've got to actually connect all of these things. And so when we step back and we think about our position with our platform strategy, being able to pull all these pools of data together, that's what we really see as the larger opportunity set here.\nCharles Giancarlo: And then when you think about timing, what I'm seeing is it's the most -- it's the companies that are the most advanced in their thinking and analysis of what they might do with that are just beginning to realize, oh my gosh, regardless of how many GPUs we buy or lease or rent, at our data governance is very poor. Our ability to get access to that data is very poor. So I think it's going to take time for the general market to come to full grips with this. So I see it more late this year, early next year. In the meantime, we have -- there's plenty of economic reasons why customers would want to use our e family to replace disc when that's coming up anyway. So as I see it, the e-family kills two birds with one stone. It's a better replacement and it prepares them for AI.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Nehal Chokshi from Northland Cap Markets.\nNehal Chokshi: Yes. Thank you and congrats on your results, and thank you for that detail on what the Evergreen run bookings does to your overall revenue. That's great. I want to double click on the major one with the -- on the major GPU cloud provider. Specifically, I'd like to understand how penetrated are you within that opportunity as well as if you're not -- if that deal does not put you up 100% penetration than what is being utilized alternatively at that particular GPU provider?\nRobert Lee: Yes, Nehal, I'll take that one. This is Rob. We're -- it's not 100%, so I'll tell you that. Look, we're very pleased with the win. I think, as I mentioned before, what's particularly exciting is the mix of use cases being deployed on our footprint there. And look, I think as we mentioned, it's one of the largest GPU cloud providers out there. Our focus at this point really is in ramping that Evergreen One consumption driving those initial project deployments to success, and we'll see where that takes us.\nNehal Chokshi: I was just wondering can Rob describe what is alternately being utilized in before [indiscernible]?\nRobert Lee: I really can't speak to that. I don't know that we have the visibility into that.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Eric Martinuzzi from Lake Street.\nEric Martinuzzi: Yes. So you had a small workforce realignment charge in Q4. I was curious to know what the goal of the realignment was. And are we done with that?\nCharles Giancarlo: Yes. We have restructured to some extent, inside the organization to focus much more on customer segments, enterprise commercial and hyperscaler and putting specialized teams focused on driving business process to fit those 3 models in a very coordinated way across across the company. And based on that, we've moved people and moved roles to different areas. And that also meant that there were some roles that were being eliminated, and that's what really caused the restructuring. And no, we don't -- I mean, that was limited really to the reorganization that we put in place.\nPaul Ziots: Thank you, Eric. I think this next question is a person who got back in line. So I think this will be the last question.\nOperator: Next question is Aaron Rakers from Wells Fargo.\nAaron Rakers: All right. Just because it has not been asked, I'm curious, given the AI discussion and the narrative around the pure, just where we're at with regard to Meta and that deployment, AIRE, I know there's been a lot of discussion about the expansion of Meta's GPU footprint. I'm just curious of where you currently see yourself at and whether or not there's any assumptions of opportunity at Meta baked into your guide this year.\nRobert Lee: Thanks, Aaron. This is Rob. Welcome back for round 2. Our relationship with Meta is stronger than ever. We're working with them on almost a continuous basis. And as we said before, they continue to realize incredible value from our solutions in place. I think specific to your question, just asking about did we see additional sales to the RSC environment. We -- as we've said before, we have sales to Meta in almost every quarter, including in other AI environments. We didn't have sales into RSC. But as we've mentioned, we typically wouldn't be updating or commenting on sales into other environments, including other AI deployments there.\nPaul Ziots: Thank you, Aaron. Charlie, before you give concluding remarks, maybe you could comment on Meta's second really excellent question about whether we're at a different crossover point now to the all-flash data center.\nCharles Giancarlo: Yes, Meta, I think that it's a great question. I still believe we're early in that process. I started saying last year that I expected the last disk storage array to be sold in about 5 years' time. We're now 4 years in front of that. I'm going to stick with that timetable. I think customers -- the growth of our e-family has been really tremendous this year, but it's early -- still early days. We're expecting even greater growth, obviously, this year ahead. But considering how much disk is out there, it will take a bit of time. I am very bullish on this, and I'll stick with it, that I think the next 3 to 4 years, we're going to see the decline of Disc Systems.\nPaul Ziots: And then you had some concluding statement.\nCharles Giancarlo: Well, I do want to thank everyone for joining us today, as always, on today's earnings call. The platform strategy that we've built is now leading the data storage industry's transformation. We are seeing just incredible response to really unifying the way that data operates within the enterprise environment. With this unified and modern storage platform, enterprises now can really uniquely tackle their fragmented data environments. And that's what's going to allow them to unleash the full potential of their artificial intelligence. I do want to thank our customers, our employees, our partners investors and suppliers, your dedication, your collaboration, your trust are really the driving forces behind our progress. Thank you all.\nOperator: That concludes the Pure Storage Fiscal Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2021 Earnings Call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.",

For my own discussions with customers, I think we're early in cycle in terms of customers, really understanding how do they transition from breaking down the silos that are fragmenting their data today, moving away from physical limitations to being able to connect data access through automation and policy certainly bringing performance to all areas of their data. I think the other discussion that we're having is customers that are navigating this space are realizing the importance of future proofing their technology decisions, especially as it pertains to infrastructure investments.  If you're investing in building out infrastructure to modernize and prepare your environment for AI, it's absolutely critical that you're making choices that are going to be utmost flexibility just because of the speed that the space is moving in. And so when you kind of map that, you got to step back from that and map that down to the Pure portfolio, very pleased with our position, right? You can see where our single consistent software and hardware operating environment with Fusion, really helping customers emerge from that fragmented data storage position.  Certainly, what we're doing with in terms of bringing performance, much needed performance to an area storage that frankly has been lacking that for quite some time. And then certainly with Evergreen, bringing that future proofing and optionality. Yes, Eddy, this is Rob. Thanks for the question. I'll take that one. So Charlie mentioned, very excited about this win. The customer here is one of the largest GPU cloud providers. What's interesting and kind of exciting about the usage and use cases in this environment is it's really a mix of a number of use cases, all involved in AI training workflow. So a portion of it is being used for data preparation, pre and post processing. A large portion is being used for direct AI training. That is, as you said, directly feeding training data into and out of GPU servers, a lot of model experimentation is being done in these environments.  As well, this environment is supporting a large number of users doing -- kind of going through these workflows and doing this development and performing these tasks. I think the second part of your question was to better understand the product mix as part of the sale. I will remind you, this was a large Evergreen/One deal, which is I think speaks to the dynamic nature of a lot of the work in this space. as a lot of the AI workflows expand beyond just high-speed training into the broader set of data preparation, all the elements that I just walked you through Evergreen/One creates a lot of flexibility in that model for the service provider, the cloud provider, in this case, to deploy the right service levels for the right usages.  That said, [indiscernible] environment is being served with the FlashBlade product set. So hopefully, that gives you a little bit more color to think about our opportunity and really the points of validation in the space. And just to build on that a little bit. Charlie mentioned a lot of these silos and fragmented pools of data storage really aren't network today. Let me take it from a customer and a procurement lens. If you look at a lot of these environments, data storage has historically been purchased and configured application by application, department by department completely independently. And in a world where that data is really only being used for a single purpose, that worked okay. But the whole power of AI technology is being able to connect all these data sets and glean from them in unison greater insights in order to do that, you've got to actually connect all of these things. And so when we step back and we think about our position with our platform strategy, being able to pull all these pools of data together, that's what we really see as the larger opportunity set here. Yes, Nehal, I'll take that one. This is Rob. We're -- it's not 100%, so I'll tell you that. Look, we're very pleased with the win. I think, as I mentioned before, what's particularly exciting is the mix of use cases being deployed on our footprint there. And look, I think as we mentioned, it's one of the largest GPU cloud providers out there. Our focus at this point really is in ramping that Evergreen One consumption driving those initial project deployments to success, and we'll see where that takes us. I really can't speak to that. I don't know that we have the visibility into that. Thanks, Aaron. This is Rob. Welcome back for round 2. Our relationship with Meta is stronger than ever. We're working with them on almost a continuous basis. And as we said before, they continue to realize incredible value from our solutions in place. I think specific to your question, just asking about did we see additional sales to the RSC environment. We -- as we've said before, we have sales to Meta in almost every quarter, including in other AI environments. We didn't have sales into RSC. But as we've mentioned, we typically wouldn't be updating or commenting on sales into other environments, including other AI deployments there."

            "name": "Charles Giancarlo",
            "content": "Thank you, Paul. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our Q4 and fiscal 2024 earnings call. We had a solid Q4 performance and ended the year with increasing sales momentum and balanced performance across our theaters and product portfolio. This momentum and growing customer interest in our platform strategy provides us with increased confidence for the coming year. This year, we expanded our Evergreen portfolio and increased subscription services revenue now to over 40% of total revenue. FY '24 total contract value sales for Evergreen/One and Evergreen/Flex grew to over $400 million, more than doubling over the prior year. product and platform innovation was strong as evidenced by FlashBlade now exceeding $2 billion in total sales since launch.  FlashBlade continues to serve as the leading platform for customers' modern file and object data requirements for both high performance and low-cost applications. Launched just 9 months ago, our new E-family of products achieved the fastest sales growth of any pure product, presaging that flash will soon replace all disk. Our data storage platform strategy and vision is working and continues to succeed with large enterprises and managed service providers, Pure's strategy to consolidate data storage using a single operating and management environment for the majority of storage requirements just makes more sense than managing multiple different and disparate system environments.  Pure's direct reliability and economics continue to be unmatched and customers appreciate our Evergreen guarantee of no application downtime with system upgrades. Pure's platform strategy incorporating Pure Fusion, which enables Pure systems to operate as a distributed storage cloud combines the best features of enterprise storage with cloud agility and programmability. It enables customers to manage their data environment as unified storage pools, seamlessly spanning across data centers and public cloud platforms, all within a single operating and management framework.  Pure allows customers to organize their data infrastructure efficiently and optimize their data environment. Our platform vision was a major factor in several strategic enterprise deals in Q4. In one example, a major Fortune 500 financial services firm selected Pure based on our platform strategy, our proven reliability, and our ability to satisfy the majority of their diverse storage needs with a consistent environment and cloud-like operation and efficiency. This high 8-figure deal comprised almost all of Pure's products and services and represents our growing success in large enterprise.  A second notable 8-figure deal this past quarter with an Evergreen/One deal with one of the largest specialized GPU cloud providers for artificial intelligence, offering highly differentiated AI infrastructure solutions to their customers. Pure is excited to partner with this company to deliver one of the most powerful and fastest AI training environments in the world. However, what truly excites me about AI confirmed through conversations with customers and partners is the focus that it is bringing to customers fragmented data environments. Customers are beginning to realize that their current fragmented data storage environment will significantly hinder their ability to leverage AI to unlock the full potential of their data.  Current data storage environments inhibit AI deployments in 2 ways. First, existing data storage arrays were selected to provide just enough performance for their primary function, leaving little performance left for AI access. Second, existing storage arrays are not networked, limiting access to AI apps not provisioned directly on their primary compute stack. The Pure Storage platform solves both of these issues. Pure's E-family delivers flash reliability and efficiency at prices now comparable to traditional hard disk systems and with plenty of performance there for AI access.  And the single operating and management environment of the pure platform across protocols and price performance ranges makes accessing data easier. We are also seeing increased numbers of Portworx deployments in AI environments for data management preparation. Portworx had a record year and accelerated growth based on customers increasingly graduating their container-based development projects to production scale. Portworx saw strong sales in the financial sector this past quarter. A leading global financial institution significantly improved the efficiency and lower the cost of critical Tier 0 applications by automating its internal cloud infrastructure with Portworx. Portworx industry leadership was recognized by IDC, which positioned Portworx as an industry leader in their new and latest Kuganetes container data management category.  As we reported all year, Evergreen/One consistently experienced breakout growth. Customers appreciate the simplicity of Evergreen's/One SaaS model. The Evergreen One service offers always improving data services, always modern infrastructure and a world-class customer experience with contractually guaranteed service level agreements. Now with Evergreen/One, Pure pays customers for power and rack space when hosting the service in their data centers. Adding to our SLA industry leadership, Pure introduced 3 new SLA guarantees this past year. One, no data migration; two, 0 data loss; and three, power and space efficiency across our Evergreen family, Evergreen/Forever, Evergreen/One and Evergreen/Flex offerings.  Our commitment to offering the most sustainable storage solutions in the industry continues to drive competitive advantage for customers focused on their environmental reporting. Furthermore, the energy demands of AI is outstripping the availability of power in many data center environments. Pure Flash Solutions can reduce data center power usage, space and e-waste by approximately 20%, and this is proving critical in an environment driven by artificial intelligence and the world's growing demand for data. We are increasingly confident in our platform strategy and our opportunity to lead this market. Our evergreen technology and programs are changing the industry of allowing customers to eliminate the need to continually rebuy and disruptively replace outdated hardware.  Most importantly, to enterprises, sure reduces risk. Eliminating application downtime due to infrastructure updates and upgrades while dramatically improving system reliability. Our confidence is bolstered by our 4 sustainable competitive advantages. This includes our ability to deliver a single operating and management environment for the majority of enterprise data storage needs. Our Evergreen technology, which guarantees an always modern environment without application disruption, our management, which enables both performance and cost leadership. And finally, our cloud operating model, which allows customers to manage all of their data across data centers and clouds as unified pools of data.  While we remain cautious about the economy, we are beginning to see some encouraging signs of improvement in the macro environment. As the industry's most performant consistent and sustainable storage solution we are well positioned to serve both the energy and data-intensive demands of artificial intelligence. Additionally, after 18 months of steep declines, NAND market pricing has stabilized, which should improve storage market growth. Looking forward to FY '25, a I have high confidence of returning to double-digit revenue growth, given our platform strategy, our growing product portfolio, our cloud operating model, and strong customer demand for our Evergreen and Fort Works subscription offerings. With that, I'd like to turn it over to Kevan now. Yes. Thanks, Amit. Hope you're doing well. So actually, I think I could answer the question in really two ways. The economic and then the noneconomic, and I'll start with the noneconomic first. What's very exciting about Evergreen/One is that it really is a SaaS-like model. And I think just like you and probably everybody else on this call, no longer use external hard drives on their on their PCs or laptops, but use some type of cloud-based service. Because of the ease, it's managed for you. You don't have to worry about it failing, you're able to easily just subscribe to more capacity if that's what you need without worrying about having to go out and buy and configure a new system. The same is true with our Evergreen/One service. That is it really is storage as a service, whether that is deployed in the cloud, in a colo or actually on the customer's premise. And now it's deployed on the customer's premise, we pay them for hosting it for us.  So from the customer standpoint, it has all of the attributes of a SaaS service. They manage entirely through the cloud. We manage it otherwise. We're constantly looking at it from a capacity and performance standpoint. Upgraded as necessary, mostly remotely. And so it's a very easy service and completely managed. And of course, that's the way that the modern world is operating now and the reason why many customers are they attracted to the service. Of course, the economic elements of it are that they only pay for what they use when they use it, they don't need to buy a system that is sized at the rate that they think they'll need 4 or 5 years, hence, that they're able to just pay for what they -- as I said, and what they use when they use it.  So it's compelling from both economic and noneconomic purposes. Lastly, 2% in terms of total subscription. And so I think easily, with any continued growth in this environment, we certainly see our way clear to a majority of revenue over time being in the subscription category. Yes, the wind came in a bit late in the quarter. So it's obvious that you will be deploying that through this new fiscal year. Very exciting. They really -- it was a deal that covered really the majority, if not most of Pure's services, our products. And frankly, it was all based on them buying into and fully understanding the ramifications of having a single operating environment to unify their data storage environment. So really pleased with that win. Sorry, I had to follow that. So let's talk about AI. And you're right. I'm sort of looking at the AI market in three categories. One is the modeling area, that's a super high-performance GPUs, super high-performance storage, everything to go along with it. The inference market, which involves perhaps some GPUs but -- and good performance, but not necessarily the supercharged performance. And then just the data -- the general data or the uplift to data storage that needs to take place so that customers can get access to data that's right now in silos.  Obviously, the market has been transfixed with the modeling side of things. And I think appropriately so, but I do think out of all of them, it's probably the smallest in terms of total market size. And of course, the world is going dog on that, and we're tracking a lot of different entities and activities on that in the modeling part of the market. I think inference is only just beginning. Customers trying to figure out what they're going to do there. I think what's really impressed me over the last 6 months as I've spoken to both customers and large integrators and channels that work with customers is everybody starting to recognize that their current data environment is not really up to the task of being able to even offer the data, let alone do it at high performance to the AI environments that they'll want to create.  So that's -- I view that as a very large opportunity. So I would say we're still very early in this. I think that's the other part of your question. I think we're very early in this, and I think it's going to take some time for it to to work its way through the enterprise -- through enterprises planning horizons. Yes. Howard, it's a great question, and we're trying to actually dig down into ourselves in a number of different ways because rarely do we have a situation where the customer is deciding for the same -- exactly the same environment, one versus the other. And because of that, as Kevan mentioned, we have average numbers. Average numbers, if you look across the entire customer base and all the deals in the quarter are coming out about the same, but that may not be true on an individual deal-by-deal basis. My gut tells me that that the average TCV of Evergreen/One deal is somewhat lower than the CapEx, but that's got level reaction not yet bolstered by data. We're hoping to get a better handle of that over the next couple of quarters. What I will say, we do know, though, the breakeven. The breakeven is approximately 2.5 years. Sorry, the revenue breakeven or the same amount of capacity. And that -- what you're asking about is not necessarily the same level of capacity, and we're still trying to figure that out. Yes. I think the core, David, of your question really relates to are we picking up market share at what rate? We feel pretty confident that we're in the still -- we remain in the 15% market share pickup rate for a variety, which is not necessarily reported by the reporting agencies mainly because they do not incorporate our Evergreen/Forever subscription, which, as you know, means that we don't resell the same storage when an array becomes obsolete because in our case, arrays don't become obsolete.  So with that, I can't -- I think the team is taking a good look at the -- we know what it would have been -- and Kevan stated it in his preamble that it would have been around 7 -- a little over 7% this year. I don't have the numbers for the prior year. Do you have that, Kevan? No. We love to get back to you on that. But your basic premise that the market is under accounting, what we believe is -- would be our growth if our Evergreen/One sales were actually in standard product sales is absolutely correct. As we indicated, I think, at the end of our -- in our Q3 call and now in Q4, we are seeing strong indications of improving demand both, I think, in the actual results as well as in pipeline as we go forward and in our conversations with customers overall. So that's what's giving us confidence. I think, Kevan, in terms of -- we generally don't provide direct exit rates, but... Absolutely, Simon. So I think your instinct on this is absolutely correct. What the concept is that, of course, regardless of the manner in which enterprises want to build, whether they want to build their own data environment for AI or do their own modeling or do their own inference or not. They do have to make their data available for analysis by the AI engine. In order to do that, their data today is largely trapped, I say, trapped in silos. It's on storage environments that were largely purchased very much -- storage is bought with economics in mind. And they are purchased at the performance level and at the capacity level necessary for their primary job, which generally means there's not a lot of performance left over to be able to serve up data for analytics of any type, let alone AI.  And even if they had that performance, they're not networked. Traditional storage arrays are not networked at the array level. You have to go through the application environment. which is not terribly useful and very indirect. That would mean that customers would generally have to copy that data and buy new arrays anyway. And in our case, what our platform allows them to do is replace those arrays for their primary purpose going from disk to flash and have plenty of performance left over for the AI environment.  So they get to modernize their environment reduce their power spacing cooling by a factor of 10, have much higher reliability, lower labor associated with it. And at the same time now update their data environment so that it is available for AI analysis. And then when you think about timing, what I'm seeing is it's the most -- it's the companies that are the most advanced in their thinking and analysis of what they might do with that are just beginning to realize, oh my gosh, regardless of how many GPUs we buy or lease or rent, at our data governance is very poor. Our ability to get access to that data is very poor. So I think it's going to take time for the general market to come to full grips with this. So I see it more late this year, early next year. In the meantime, we have -- there's plenty of economic reasons why customers would want to use our e family to replace disc when that's coming up anyway. So as I see it, the e-family kills two birds with one stone. It's a better replacement and it prepares them for AI. Yes. We have restructured to some extent, inside the organization to focus much more on customer segments, enterprise commercial and hyperscaler and putting specialized teams focused on driving business process to fit those 3 models in a very coordinated way across across the company. And based on that, we've moved people and moved roles to different areas. And that also meant that there were some roles that were being eliminated, and that's what really caused the restructuring. And no, we don't -- I mean, that was limited really to the reorganization that we put in place. Yes, Meta, I think that it's a great question. I still believe we're early in that process. I started saying last year that I expected the last disk storage array to be sold in about 5 years' time. We're now 4 years in front of that. I'm going to stick with that timetable. I think customers -- the growth of our e-family has been really tremendous this year, but it's early -- still early days. We're expecting even greater growth, obviously, this year ahead. But considering how much disk is out there, it will take a bit of time. I am very bullish on this, and I'll stick with it, that I think the next 3 to 4 years, we're going to see the decline of Disc Systems. Well, I do want to thank everyone for joining us today, as always, on today's earnings call. The platform strategy that we've built is now leading the data storage industry's transformation. We are seeing just incredible response to really unifying the way that data operates within the enterprise environment. With this unified and modern storage platform, enterprises now can really uniquely tackle their fragmented data environments. And that's what's going to allow them to unleash the full potential of their artificial intelligence. I do want to thank our customers, our employees, our partners investors and suppliers, your dedication, your collaboration, your trust are really the driving forces behind our progress. Thank you all."

            "name": "Kevan Krysler",
            "content": "Thank you, Charlie. We are pleased with our Q4 financial performance, exceeding guidance for both revenue and operating profit. As we were expecting, customer demand for our consumption and subscription-based offerings was very strong, especially for Evergreen/One, our Storage as a Service offering and Portworx. Annual sales for both offerings grew over 100% in FY '24 and total contract value or TCV sales for Evergreen/One and Evergreen/Flex exceeded $400 million. Remaining performance obligations, or RPO, associated solely with our subscription service offerings at the end of Q4 was very strong, growing 29%. Our subscription services net dollar retention, or MDR at the end of the year was 120%.  For the year, revenue grew 2.8%. As a reminder, our annual revenue growth expectations at the beginning of FY '24, assumed that Evergreen/One and Evergreen/Flex TCV sales would grow approximately 50%. When adjusting for the substantial growth above our expectations at the beginning of the year for Evergreen/One and Evergreen/Flex TCV sales and a noncancelable product sale with a telco customer we mentioned last quarter that is expected to be shipped in FY '25, revenue growth for the year would have been over 7%. As a reminder, revenue from our Evergreen/One and Evergreen/Flex consumption and subscription service offerings are recognized over time. Whereas product revenue related to sales of our products across our data storage platform is recognized upon shipment.  Operating margin for FY '24 was approximately 16% above our original guide of 15% at the beginning of the year. Key contributors of our operating margin strength were strong gross margins across our data storage platform reflecting the value of our solutions and disciplined investing. Total RPO, which also includes product orders grew 31% year-over-year in Q4, exceeding $2.3 billion. Product orders included in total RPO at the end of Q4, including a noncancelable telco order that we mentioned last quarter, and orders relating to a significant win in Q4 with a major Fortune 500 financial services company.  In Q4, subscription services annual recurring revenue or ARR grew 25% to approximately $1.4 billion, highlighting the strong traction for our consumption and subscription-based service offerings. As we mentioned previously, subscription services ARR excludes noncancelable Evergreen subscription contracts where the effective service date has not started. Including noncancelable subscription contracts where the effective service date has not started, Subscription Services ARR at the end of Q4 grew 27%. Subscription services revenue during Q4 was $329 million, growing 24% and comprising 42% of total revenue.  U.S. revenue for Q4 was $522 million, and international revenue was $268 million. Our new customer acquisition grew by 349 customers during Q4, including 6 new Fortune 500 customers. We now serve slightly over 60% of the Fortune 500. Product and subscription services gross margin both contributed to total gross margin strength of 73.7% in Q4 and 73.2% for the year. In Q4, product gross margin was 73.4% and subscription services gross margin was 74.1%. Our headcount increased slightly to nearly 5,600 employees at the end of the quarter. Pure's balance sheet and liquidity remains very strong, including approximately $1.5 billion in cash and investments at the end of Q4. Cash flow from operations during the quarter was approximately $244 million and approximately $678 million for FY '24.  Capital expenditures during the year were nearly $200 million. Representing approximately 6.9% of revenue for FY '24. Factors driving our higher capital expenditures during the year included sales growth of our Evergreen/One Storage as a Service offering, our new headquarters and test equipment supporting our engineering team for new product innovations. In Q4, we repurchased 585,000 shares of stock returning approximately $21.4 million to our shareholders. For the year, we repurchased nearly 4.7 million shares, returning nearly $136 million in capital to our shareholders. Consistent with our remarks last quarter, our share repurchases represent a lower level of repurchase activity as a result of the fixed trading parameters that were in place throughout the quarter.  We have approximately $145 million remaining on our existing $250 million repurchase authorization, and we are announcing today a new share repurchase authorization of $250 million. Now turning to our guidance for FY '25. We expect to return to double-digit revenue growth in FY '25, growing 10.5% to $3.1 billion. We expect demand across our entire data storage platform will strengthen while also remaining cautious of the macro spending environment. Our annual revenue guide of 10.5% growth also contemplates approximately 50% growth in TCV sales for our collective Evergreen/One and Evergreen/Flex service offerings, which are expected to be $600 million.  To help better understand the short-term impact that growth of our consumption and subscription offerings have on our annual revenue growth rate we estimate that our forecasted FY '25 revenue growth would be in the mid-teens when adjusting for the expected growth of both our Evergreen/One and Evergreen/Flex service offerings. Slightly offset by expected additional revenue arising from past TCV sales in FY '24. Consistent with our philosophy in driving profitable growth, we expect FY '25 operating profit to be $532 million, and operating margin to be 17%. Margin for FY '25 is in line with our longer-term goal of expanding operating margin by a percentage point or 2 each year and represents a 2-point increase from our FY '24 guide that we communicated at the beginning of the year.  We are pleased with our expectations of getting back to double-digit revenue growth and continuing strong growth from our nev Storage as a Service, and Evergreen/Flex offerings. Pure's data storage platform and Evergreen architecture delivers substantial business value to our customers by reducing complexity, while increasing reliability, flexibility and unparalleled power and cost efficiencies. With that, I'll turn it back to Paul for Q&A. That's great, Aaron, you I will give you some of the bridging discussion. But before we get into it, yes, we're really excited about this Fortune 500 win. Let me have Charlie explain that a little bit, and then I'll provide some bridging information for you. And then, Aaron, from a bridging standpoint, our total RPO, which would include product orders. And again, that's the telco order and that's the significant win with the Fortune 500. And you're exactly right. Both of those would be unbilled because we haven't shipped the product yet. So as we ship that product, you'll see more billings come through. as it relates to that RPO. But the other large piece of it is going to be the significant growth of our Evergreen/One and Evergreen/Flex subscription offerings. And again, we build for that either annually, quarterly, depending on what the customers' preferences are. So that will be a large piece of the end build that you're seeing as well. Yes. And I'll do that in the context of FY '25, and we can go into some more detail if needed. But look, pleased with both gross margin and operating margin performance as we think about it in '24, and it really is consistent with our philosophy of driving profitable growth. And as we look to FY '25, we're again expecting to expand our operating margin to 17% while also returning to double-digit revenue growth. And this assumes that our operating expenses will grow at a slightly lower rate than what we saw in FY '24 as we continue to invest in our sales capacity and in innovation.  And you're right, Tim, this would then imply a slight decline in gross margins, which we expect to be derived principally within product gross margins as we continue to penetrate the disk market and scale our E-family. So hopefully, that's helpful for you. Yes, it's a great question, Howard, and I'll let Charlie and Rob jump into as they see fit. But when we think about. Obviously, we have a lot of variation in terms of sizing between our CapEx offerings as well as Evergreen/One. And frankly, when we pull out the on-demand billings and then do a straight comparison, on average deal size, we're actually pretty close. When you take a step back between value at the order level between CapEx and Evergreen One. But again, our data points are principally around FY '24. Still a lot more time to see how that evolves. And Charlie, do you have any other points you'd want to raise? That would be the revenue breakeven. Yes, I appreciate the question, Pinjalim. And look, when we're coming up with our guide for both the TCV sales of Evergreen/One and Evergreen/Flex as well as our revenue guide, you have to imagine a lot of work in terms of modeling, looking at pipeline, looking at opportunities are involved as part of that process. And look, that then informs our best view, if you will, of guide, which is 10.5% for revenue and the 50% growth rate that we gave for TCV sales for Evergreen/One and Evergreen/Flex.  And -- but you really -- your question is, hey, what if we see significant changes in mix and what's the impact? And how do we think about that similar to the impact we saw in FY '24. And look, if our sales mix results in less TCV sales growth of our subscription and consumption offerings, we would expect that our FY '25 revenue growth would increase. That would be our expectation as we sit here today. Now on the reverse side, if TCV sales of Evergreen/One and Evergreen/Flex grow significantly and well outperforms our assumption of 50% growth that would have an impact on our revenue growth rate. And as we progress through the year, we'll continue to update sales performance across sales of Evergreen/One and Flex to give you that visibility. Jason, great question. Let us work through the transparency we're giving you on TCV sales for the time being and the conversion of those TCV sales in terms of normalized revenue, and you'll see that in the slides we presented, I think that is a level of bridging we'll want to do at this point in time in terms of where we're sitting. Charlie, do you want to hit storage demand and market share first and then I'll hit the modeling question. The other thing too, David, is you can kind of do back of the envelope calculation to estimate the amount of revenue that's coming off Evergreen/One and Evergreen/Flex given that average duration of these contracts is around 3 years, and obviously, we've given you the TCV sales for FY '24, growing in excess of 100% as well as our expectations for TCV sales for Evergreen/One and Evergreen Flex for FY '25. Yes, we don't. But I think we've taught it directionally. And obviously, the strength we're seeing, both in FY '24 and FY '25 is really being driven from a growth perspective. Buyer subscription services and subscription services revenue. And when we think about it directionally next year, but to Charlie's point, he's right, we don't guide specifically on product revenue and subscription revenue. I think it's a good way to think about product revenue being flattish to maybe slightly down and really that growth being driven by our subscription services overall for FY '25."

Our fourth quarter fiscal '24 quiet period begins at the close of business, Friday, January 19, 2024. With that, I'll turn it over to Charlie.\nCharlie Giancarlo: Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our Q3 earnings call. We are pleased with Pure's Q3 financial results. We saw healthy demand for our portfolio throughout the quarter, proving that Pure's platform strategy and vision is resonating with our customers. The Pure Storage platform provides customers the ability to deploy a consistent software and management environment across the full price performance range for block, file and object workloads, for both traditional and cloud-native applications. The Pure platform guarantees customers never experienced change management downtime. It guarantees the lowest space power and e-waste in the industry and provides infrastructure and services that always get better with age without disruption. The Pure Storage platform also promises a cloud operating model for our customers, enabling them to manage their data storage like the cloud providers to reduce their storage costs in the cloud to provide tailored storage services to their developers like the cloud and to consume storage like the cloud as a service. This model is gaining traction with leading customers. Evergreen//One, our Storage as a Service consumption offering saw continued extraordinary growth, more than doubling year-over-year. Evergreen//One and Evergreen/Flex are our preferred services for providing customers data storage on a consumption basis. Although we continue to offer customers the choice of consuming storage as CapEx, we believe the continued high demand for Evergreen//One is being driven by our sales activities, new customer buying behavior, and the current macro environment. Customers are attracted to the ability to manage and consume Evergreen storage as a cloud service as they need it. But with the low cost advanced capabilities and data security of on-prem storage. The outperformance of Evergreen//One this year has been significantly above our prior expectations and we now expect this strong level of demand to continue through Q4. While this success is a long anticipated and welcome expansion of our business model, its overperformance will have an effect on near-term revenue, which Kevan will cover in detail. In Q3, Pure set a new industry standard with eight service level agreement or SLA guarantees across our Evergreen services. With the innovative new paid power and rack program, we pay our Evergreen customers power and rack space costs. This first-of-a-kind program is enabled by our ability to deliver the cloud attributes that customers desire with the most energy efficient and reliable storage technology. Paid power and rack directly addresses the increasing cost of electricity and data center space. Additional SLAs introduced in Q3 and guarantee no change related downtime, no future data migrations for hardware replacements, upgrades or expansions and zero data loss. Portworx, our Kubernetes and container storage software for cloud native applications also had a record quarter. Portworx was recently named a leader in the inaugural IDC Marketscape for container data management. We saw increased multiyear renewals from existing customers and new customers deploying the Portworx suite of products for multi-cloud databases, messaging and logging systems. Portworx was also selected by a leading global retailer to provide a single integrated platform for their machine learning researchers and analysts ensuring consistent models across multiple clouds. A large international government authority is supporting their artificial intelligence and machine learning environments with Portworx deployed in mission-critical cloud-based applications. Customer momentum in the field of artificial intelligence also continues for Pure with a double-digit number of AI wins in the quarter across our portfolio. This included era technology and AI-based decision intelligence and automation platform that chose our Portworx solution for seamless cloud integration, outperforming competitive solutions by 200%. And Olympus adopted Pure's AI-ready infrastructure based on a FlashBlade and NVIDIA solution for a new AI development environment, ensuring performance and capacity for large-scale models to accelerate their success with transformative AI solutions. We remain our customers' preferred partner for AI deployments and have strengthened our innovation and leadership by earning NVIDIA-based pod certification. Aerie, our complete AI-ready infrastructure built on the NVIDIA DGX base pod reference architecture and the latest FlashBlade//S storage platform makes AI scaling and deployments faster and easier for our customers. We continue to see strong demand for FlashBlade//E. And this month, we announced the general availability of FlashArray//E and shipped our first orders. This past quarter, we announced our latest Gartner accolade, a leader in the Magic Quadrant for distributed file systems and object storage, and it's now three years running. This marks the tenth successive year overall that our leadership has been acknowledged by Gartner in transforming the storage industry. The early success of our E family reinforces our belief that flash is replacing this enlarging Pure's opportunity in enterprise and eventually cloud storage. In Q3, Pure scored another major win for new 5G infrastructure to be deployed in our fiscal 2025. Pure's continuing success in the 5G space is based on our superior performance, reliability, density, longevity and advanced remote management capabilities. We are seeing strong early customer interest in our expanded partnership with Microsoft and the Pure Cloud Block store integration with Azure VMware Solution, also known as AVS. Pure and Microsoft announced the public preview of this service this quarter. CVS and AVS are providing customers the opportunity to reduce their cloud storage spend by half or more while providing them the advanced services that they experience with Pure's enterprise systems. Customers are also enthusiastic about managing their storage and data across data centers and clouds in a consistent hybrid environment. Despite the uncertainties of the current business environment, Pure superior low total cost of ownership and Evergreen offerings are making a difference in this challenging IT economy. We are seeing a strong positive response to our position of having a consistent, unified flash platform for all storage needs from the data center to the cloud. This position is enabling us to compete for ever larger footprints in large enterprise accounts. This, coupled with the strong overall demand for our platform gives me the confidence in our continued ability to take share and outpace the market. With that, I'll turn it over to Kevan for further commentary.\nKevan Krysler: Thank you, Charlie. We are pleased with our financial results this quarter. We delivered strong revenue and operating profit, both above our prior guidance for the quarter. Revenue was $763 million, up 13% year-over-year, and operating profit was $169 million. The macro spending environment remains relatively consistent to what we have seen throughout this year. However, demand for our solutions was robust throughout Q3. Our business strategy continues to focus on transitioning our offerings for our customers to consumption and subscription services. These types of offerings provide more value to our customers, which is resonating as customer demand for our consumption and subscription-based offerings across our Evergreen portfolio, especially Evergreen//One and Portworx is very strong. We achieved another quarter of record sales of our FlashBlade portfolio, including FlashBlade//E, which has quickly grown to become a meaningful portion of our FlashBlade business since becoming generally available in late April. We are also seeing customers consuming our FlashBlade technology, including FlashBlade as a service, leveraging our Evergreen//One Storage as a Service offering. Our operating profit of $169 million in Q3 exceeded expectations. Our differentiated flash management technology powered by purity software operating natively with raw flash continues to be a key driver of our strong product and subscription gross margins. As we mentioned last quarter, the majority of our capacity shipped is based on QLC raw flash. Remaining Performance Obligations or RPO was very strong and exceeds $2 billion growing 30%. During Q3, we closed a large non-cancellable product order with a large telco customer totaling $41 million that is included in the RPO balance at the end of Q3. Based on the timing of the shipment schedule for this order, product revenue is not expected until next year, which impacts our revenue outlook this year, which I'll discuss further in my remarks when updating annual guidance. When excluding both the noncancelable product order from RPO in the current quarter and the outstanding commitment in Q3 of last year with one of our global system integrators, RPO growth for our subscription services was also very strong at 29%. As we mentioned last quarter, the outstanding commitment with our global system integrator was fully satisfied during Q1 of this year. In Q3, subscription services annual recurring revenue grew 26% year-over-year to nearly $1.3 billion, highlighting the strong traction for our consumption and subscription-based service offerings. As we have mentioned previously, closed Evergreen//One contracts where the effective service date has not started are excluded from the subscription services ARR calculation including closed Evergreen//One contracts where the service date has not yet started, subscription services ARR was also strong, growing 27%. Subscription services revenue of $310 million comprised 41% of total revenue. U.S. revenue for Q3 was $536 million and international revenue was $227 million. Our new customer acquisition grew sequentially as we acquired 353 new customers during the quarter. As previously mentioned, we were pleased with our strong gross margin performance of 74%. Product gross margin was 73.1%, and subscription services gross margin was 75.4%. Our headcount increased slightly to approximately 5,500 employees at the end of the quarter. Pure's balance sheet and liquidity remains very strong, including $1.35 billion in cash and investments at the end of Q3. Cash flow from operations during the quarter was $158 million and capital expenditures totaled $45 million. In Q2, we repurchased over 630,000 shares of stock, returning over $22 million to our shareholders. Consistent with our remarks last quarter, our share repurchases represent a lower level of repurchase activity as a result of the fixed trading parameters that were in place throughout the quarter. We have approximately $167 million remaining on our existing $250 million repurchase authorization. Now turning to our updated annual guidance for FY '24. A key assumption used to derive our FY '24 annual revenue guide at the beginning of the year was that the macro environment would not meaningfully improve or deteriorate throughout the year. This assumption is holding as the spending environment continues to be challenging. Though despite these challenges, we are seeing increasing demand in the second half of the year across our data storage platform especially for consumption and subscription service offerings. Although we expect the demand to increase for the second half of the year, there are two important factors that are impacting our annual revenue expectation this year, which we now expect to be $2.82 billion, growing 2.5% and Q4 revenue is expected to be $782 million, declining 3.5%. First is the impact of our Evergreen//One Storage as a Service momentum, which will be discussed in more detail. And second is the impact of a $41 million non-canceled product order with a telco customer that is not expected to be fulfilled until next year. Both factors on a combined basis represent approximately 4.5 points of incremental headwind when compared to the annual revenue guide we provided at the beginning of the year. We are very pleased with the momentum and growth of our Evergreen//One service offering, while appreciating that this momentum creates a short-term impact on revenue growth. Last quarter, we stated that sales of our Evergreen//One service offering was expected to create 1 to 2 points of headwind to the annual revenue guide we provided at the beginning of the year. Based on our Evergreen//One sales in Q3 and the opportunities in our seasonally largest quarter Q4, we now expect that annual sales of our Evergreen//One and Evergreen//Flex offerings will more than double this year, reaching nearly $400 million and expect the impact will now create 3 points of headwind to the annual guide we provided at the beginning of the year. When excluding the impacts of the increased shift to our Evergreen//One offering and a $41 million order with a telco customer, our annual revenue growth would have been 7% when compared against the annual revenue guide we provided at the beginning of the year. We expect that our consumption and subscription business models will drive improved long-term growth for Pure as our subscription and consumption business continues to grow, we will provide additional business metrics that will help measure the health of our business. This includes translating growth rates of our subscription and consumption service offerings to a growth rate under our traditional model of a CapEx sale. Finally, we are increasing our annual operating margin guidance from 15.5% to 16% driven by our continued operational discipline and gross margin strength. Q4 operating margin is expected to be approximately 19%. In closing, we are pleased with the strength and demand across our entire Pure Storage platform, including our expectation of more than doubling sales this year of our combined Evergreen//One Storage as a Service and Evergreen//Flex offerings. We could not be more excited with how our solutions resonate with our customers, delivering a consistent, nondisruptive operating and management environment, leveraging the most advanced flash technology. Our innovation across our storage platform also extends to our Evergreen business models, providing customers with increasing flexibility and business value. With that, I will turn it back to Paul for Q&A.\nPaul Ziots: Thanks, Kevan. [Operator Instructions] Operator, let's get started.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Amit Daryanani of Evercore. You may proceed.\nAmit Daryanani: Yes. Thanks for taking my question. Good afternoon, everyone. I guess maybe to start the discussion, there's obviously a lot of focus on the Jan quarter guide and the delta that's there versus seasonality versus what you expected 90 days ago. I realize there are a fair number of cross currents out there. But to the extent you can maybe talk about how much of the shortfall versus your expectations 90 days ago, let's say, is micro versus macro. I'd love to get a sense if you think anything has shifted from Pure's competitive advantage of your positioning that's impacting it. And I realize Evergreen//One is a big part of it. I'd love to kind of understand why do you think customers are massively increasing the shift towards Evergreen//One versus buying storage in a traditional manner. Thank you.\nCharlie Giancarlo: Thanks Amit. Yes. Well, you nailed it, Amit, the shift to the consumption model has just continued to be very, very strong. And as you know, this is a model that we've been investing in for well over five years. It's one that we had staked a lot of our anticipation in and moving forward with, but this year has just been very strong. And one could say that it's the macro that has driven greater interest in a consumption model, I think, for obvious reasons, for the customer. But even more than that, we've invested in it heavily to make it not just a subscription and therefore, an easier bite, if you will, for economically difficult times. But to make it a true cloud service where they manage it like the cloud, it is hands-off. And now we're even paying for their power and rack space so that it's - other than the fact that it sits on their premise, it's a true cloud service. So the uptake in this, especially in these more difficult challenging times has been tremendous. So the two are tightly aligned. The macro overall certainly hasn't helped. Better macro would have lifted all boats. But really, the change as you put it, it was driven primarily by the shift to subscription and consumption model.\nKevan Krysler: Yes. Thanks, Charlie. This is Kevan. And how're you doing Amit? If you take a step back and really look at the change in our annual guide as well as the impact to Q4, it really does come down to two key factors that we've described. One is what Charlie has highlighted, which is the strength and momentum of Evergreen//One. And then the second, obviously, is the telco order. That was all product that's having an impact on Q4 as well.\nPaul Ziots: Thank you, Amit. Next question, please.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers of Wells Fargo. You may proceed.\nAaron Rakers: Thanks for taking the question. Yes. Just to kind of build on Amit's question there. I guess if I'm doing the math right, it looks like you're talking about an impact of about $80 million, $85 million from this higher Evergreen//One contribution. So I guess the question is like what would that number look like just actually three months ago embedded in your expectation? And how do I think about -- you threw out a number, $400 million. Is that $400 million of ARR contribution. Just help me understand what $400 million is and how fast this necessarily could grow into the next year? Just thinking about incremental headwinds from this transition to this consumption model here as we move forward.\nKevan Krysler: Yes. How're you doing, Arron, this is Kevan. The $400 million is really our sales of Evergreen//One and Evergreen//Flex for the year. So think about that as a TCV of sales during the year. And then if you - if we take a step back into exiting Q2 and going into Q3, we had talked about the fact that our annual guide range had contemplated strong growth. We were adding about another 1 to 2 points of headwind to that growth exiting Q2. And then with the strength that we've seen in Q3 on Evergreen//One as well as what we're seeing in terms of volume and opportunities in Q4, that headwind now has been increased to 3 points. So again, and your math is about right in terms of the effects in absolute dollars when in context to our annual revenue guide. And then tacking on to that, the telco order, which is having an impact as well.\nPaul Ziots: Thank you, Aaron. Next question, please.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Meta Marshall of Morgan Stanley. You may proceed.\nMeta Marshall: Great. Thanks. Maybe a couple of questions. One, just on any update on how you're seeing kind of your - or probability of kind of Meta order coming back at least sometime in the next fiscal year? And then just a second question on - I mean, I would assume you would have said that the conditions are largely staying the same for most of this year. And so has this Evergreen transition been a headwind for kind of more than this quarter and it just culminated into something you couldn't kind of make up for given not seeing a better environment? Or just how have you seen this evergreen transition kind of progress throughout the year? Thanks.\nCharlie Giancarlo: Let me start with the Meta question. So we continued - Meta continues to be a good customer. We have not - generally, when - on these calls, we talk about contribution by RSE. No meaningful contribution to RSE this past quarter, but we've had sales to Meta in other segments. And that relationship continues to blossom as far as we're concerned. It continues to get better, and we expect to continue to see good opportunities in Meta as we go forward. And then the second one was the...\nKevan Krysler: You want to clarify your second question as well.\nMeta Marshall: The second question is just it's clearly a headwind as we go into fiscal Q4, this kind of Evergreen transition. But given probably much of the macro environment has stayed stable during the year, how much of a headwind has it been in previous quarters that you were just kind of able to accommodate for? I guess I'm just trying to say or get a sense of how much of that is new this quarter versus this has been a headwind for the entire year?\nCharlie Giancarlo: Well, almost - if I might start. One, because we've had such strong growth in Evergreen//One. It has been a bit of a headwind the whole year, but it had never been sustained the way it is this year. We had good quarters, like every other new program you have strong quarters and then it's balanced off by other quarters where the specific opportunity in this case, Evergreen//One was a bit weaker. And when we saw the growth in Evergreen//One early in the year, as we -- as you may remember, the economy turned weak around Q4 last year, and so we were expecting Evergreen//One to pick up. What's really different this time around is just the continued strength quarter-over-quarter and visibility into Q4 now as well, the strength there. So yes, but it's becoming a more meaningful number now.\nKevan Krysler: Yes. And if I would just to add on to that, to what Charlie was saying, it really is an accumulation of effect. So starting with our annual revenue guide that we provided, obviously, there were two components that were key in that guide of mid-to high single digits. One was contemplation of the macro environment. And second was, we were considering momentum of Evergreen//One when we came into the year. Now exiting Q2, we added on 1 to 2 points of additional headwind as a result of what we were seeing, both for Q1 and Q2 and our visibility to Q3. Now Q3 outperformed even our raised expectations in Q4 looks very strong as well. And so you do have the accumulation effect going on, but lastly, when we think about Q3, there was definitely more pressure on product revenue as a result of the momentum we were seeing with Evergreen//One. And the sales team did a really nice job executing throughout the quarter. And part of this strong execution included accelerating fulfillment and probably of a subset of product orders that would have been expected to close in Q4. So there is an impact there as well. And hopefully, that adds some additional color for you there.\nPaul Ziots: Thank you, Meta. Next question, please.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Tim Long of Barclays. You may proceed.\nTim Long: Thank you. Could we just talk a little bit more about the double-digit AI wins in the quarter. Maybe just give us a little more color there on kind of how big these deals are coming out. Any product portfolio that you have that's differentiated, that's winning there kind of timing to see some revenue recognition from these deals? That would be helpful. Thank you.\nRob Lee: Yes, absolutely, Tim. This is Rob. I'll take that one. Certainly, AI, inclusive of traditional AI and generative AI is and continues to be a strong segment for us. But more importantly, what we've seen this quarter is a variety of AI wins really across all of the areas of the AI-driven opportunity for us here at Pure. And that's number one, certainly, the training infrastructure environments. Number two, the inference and AI application environments, as well as number three, some of the broader data environments that are being connected to these AI workflows. And so if we look at the AI training infrastructure, look, this - we've been in the space for years, continues to be a strong area for us. As an example, this quarter, we had a large automaker, expand their FlashBlade footprint, really driving their autonomous driving efforts as well as number two, we saw customers really deploying both our Portworx as well as our flash array solutions as part of their inference AI application environments. And then thirdly, as we look at the opportunity around the broader data management and data preparation environments, these are equally important parts of AI deployments. And we saw some good wins in both of these - in these areas as well, serving both customers' database and data preparation applications as well as some other bulk data repositories connected to these environments. And so if I net it out continues to be a strong segment for us and look, if we look at the opportunity in terms of both the GPU connected environments as well, the larger data environments being driven by AI technology, we're well positioned across the entire portfolio to benefit from these deployments.\nPaul Ziots: Thank you, Tim. Next question, please.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Pinjalim Bora of JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, guys. This is Noah on for Pinjalim. Thanks for taking our question. I guess how should we really think about fiscal year 2025? And what are really some of the puts and takes you can highlight there especially when we think about the seasonality of the business given all the moving parts going forward? Thank you.\nKevan Krysler: Yes. Thanks for the question. And really, we won't go into a lot of detail specific to next year. We want to navigate through our seasonally largest quarter, which is Q4. But I think two important things to take away that we're seeing. One is that demand has strengthened and is expected to strengthen through the first half, and that's a good sign for us. And second is the momentum on for Evergreen//One and strength we're seeing for a variety of reasons that Charlie walked through. And so both those factors will be in play in terms of how we think about next year, but would want to get through Q4 before providing anything more specific for next year.\nPaul Ziots: Thank you, Noah. Next question, please.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Krish Sankar of TD Cowen. You may proceed.\nKrish Sankar: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I had a question on the $40 million telco order. It seems like a pretty big number on a quarterly basis. I was under the impression you have such a high customer concentration. So can you talk a little bit about that? And also, is this being used for 5G applications what kind of application is being useful. Thank you.\nCharlie Giancarlo: Yes. No, we highlighted that it is, in fact, a 5G application environment that this is going into. And I would say in order of this type in one quarter is not terribly unusual for us. It does happen from time to time. And 5G has been a very strong market for us. The advantages that we have in space, power and cooling, reliability and longevity of the product in its remote management capability really aligns well with telco and especially 5G, which is a very distributed environment. And I will say, although it's unusual for us in general, it's not unusual in the telco space to have scheduled shipments aligning with their upgrades to their distributed 5G environment. So our typical business in IT and other areas is book and ship within weeks. This is a scheduled shipment based on build outs - their build-out schedule of their 5G environment.\nPaul Ziots: Thank you, Krish. Next question, please.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Sidney Ho of Deutsche Bank. You may proceed.\nSidney Ho: Thank you for the question. I want to look at the product growth - actually, gross margin is very, very good at 74%, curious about the sustainability of that, particularly if you look at the product gross margin being 73.1%, looking forward, how would you characterize the pricing environment, especially given many of your competitors have access to lower price and components now? And what specifically do you have to be more aggressive in pricing in order to keep or win businesses, especially in areas that are starting to see more competition? Thanks.\nCharlie Giancarlo: Thank you, Sidney. We intend to be very aggressive in pricing and especially as we penetrate the lower price performance tiers of the disk market. It's a new market for flash and the opportunity there is huge, more than half of the overall enterprise storage market, and we believe we have a special opportunity that ahead of every other player in the market. So our intention is the E family grows is to be very aggressive in that segment. Frankly, as you point out, the 73 is above our intended range for product gross margins. And we're going to use that a natural cost advantage we have to continue to gain market share.\nRob Lee: And just to add on to that, I think it's important to just highlight and remember that because of our flash management technology and direct flash, we've got a sustained and significant structural advantage over the competitive set who are trapped an SSD-based technology. Because of the direct flash, we can deliver products that are less complex, more reliable, more efficient, more performance. And at the end of the day, that translates to better products delivered in a more cost-effective way. And behind that, our Purity software really is that differentiation. And so just to - again, just to add on to Charlie's points, the advantages that we have really are structural and sustainable, driven by our significant software and hardware IP.\nKevan Krysler: So I'm just going to add to this a little bit more, taking a step back, agreeing that the gross margins across the board were very strong, and so we're quite pleased with that and validating and agreeing with obviously Charlie and Rob and really wanting to reiterate as well that the majority of our bits shipped now continue to be QLC, which ties into the continued innovation that we're driving. And look, we really do benefit from flash pricing, both improving and weakening and we are currently seeing some improvement in the NAND pricing. And then reiterating Charlie's point, from a financial lens with our strong product gross margins, we will be aggressive in our disk takeout strategy with our E family price performance solutions. As we think about our subscription growth margins, that's going to be a combination of our scale on our Evergreen offerings, including the consumption and subscription portfolio as a key contributor, also similar to the strength we're seeing in product margins, our Evergreen subscription gross margins are also benefiting from the structural advantages that Rob alluded to. So yes, definitely pleased with what we're seeing in terms of our margin performance overall.\nPaul Ziots: Thank you, Sidney. Next question, please.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Mehdi Hosseini of SIG (sic) [Susquehanna]. You may proceed.\nMehdi Hosseini: Yes. It's actually Mehdi Hosseini. Thanks for taking my question. Just want to better understand Evergreen//One. To follow-up here, would this impact your working capital requirement? And is there anywhere in the balance sheet that we could look and better track the traction with Evergreen//One model?\nKevan Krysler: Yes. I think the key metric, obviously, we added a new metric this quarter, which was the total sales this year expected for the combined Evergreen//One and Evergreen//Flex model and that being $400 million over doubling year-over-year. So that would be a new metric that we've added that hopefully is helpful. The other metric that I think is helpful is the RPO metric and obviously, our strength in growth in RPO is really being driven by our Evergreen//One momentum that we've seen throughout the year, including Q3. And then layering on to that would be our subscription services ARR growth, which is also quite strong. So those are the metrics I'd probably point you to in assessing the health around our consumption and subscription services business.\nPaul Ziots: Thank you, Mehdi. Next question, please.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Simon Leopold of Raymond James. You may proceed.\nSimon Leopold: Great. Thanks for taking the question. I just - first, a quick clarification. I appreciate you're not ready to guide for fiscal '25, but I think it would be helpful to get a little bit of handholding given that your April quarter, your first quarter is typically down teens double digits, but you've got kind of this tough situation in the January quarter. So just some clarification on that. And then the question I wanted to ask, and I love Charlie's description of the competitive environment as a nice fight in the phone booth. I'd love to get some updates there, in that what you're seeing and hearing in terms of competitive actions and your ability to displace both hybrid flash competitors as well as hard disk drive competitors. Thank you.\nKevan Krysler: Yes. I'll hit the discussion for next year, again without providing a lot of details. But as you think about the setup for next year, it is critical for us to navigate through Q4 and our expectations through Q4. But this is really not, in my mind, a seasonal question. It's really about Evergreen//One and the performance of Evergreen//One. And if we take a step back, and look at the Evergreen//One momentum and the telco order, we should be for this year at 7% growth. And so what we've seen on top of that and what we're seeing in the second half is strengthening demand. And I would hope to see that as we continue through Q4 and as we move into next year. So that would be a data point for consideration. We talked about 3 points on the annual guide against the annual guide of headwind for Evergreen//One. Look, we're expecting momentum to continue on Evergreen//One. We're actually thrilled that we're seeing an inflection point with our customers with that model. And so we'll have to provide more color for you as we move through Q4, specific to the Evergreen//One momentum next year. Charlie?\nCharlie Giancarlo: Yes. In terms of selling and what the competitive situation looks like out in the field, I'd say it's as competitive as ever, perhaps, so a little less gross margins generally have been improving. So perhaps the pricing environment has been a little bit better, but I would say, overall, the competition is as tough as ever, both in the channel and directly with customers overall. What I will say is, having perusing as we always do, our overall win rates and at bets. Our overall win rates hold very steady against our competitors. So - but it is a tough environment without doubt.\nPaul Ziots: Thank you, Simon. Next question, please.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Nehal Chokshi of Northland Capital Market. You may proceed.\nNehal Chokshi: Yes. Thanks. I want to double click here on Slide 17. Your unbilled RPO, I've always sort of reviewed that as a good proxy for your Evergreen//One and Evergreen//Flex sales. A, is that true? And then I'll go from there.\nKevan Krysler: Nehal, that is true. And then I would add on to that specific for this quarter would be the telco order that we've been highlighting and discussing as well.\nNehal Chokshi: Right. Okay. So the Q-o-Q change in unbilled RPO $100 million, take out that $40 million for the Telco order, then you're talking about $60 million. That's still a significant increase. And if I just simply do it on a cumulative two-year basis, for this year relative to a year ago, that's more than a doubling on a year-over-year basis. So can you talk about the linearity that you're seeing in this acceleration in Evergreen//Flex, was there relatively sold in the first two quarters and now an explosion in the third quarter and then you expect sort of some sort of normalization in the fourth quarter here?\nKevan Krysler: Yes. And it's primarily Evergreen//One. And we've talked about what we've seen this year is a cumulative build and momentum of Evergreen//One. So again, coming out of the year and developing our guide for the year, we had contemplated a really significant growth in Evergreen//One. And again, as we navigated through Q1 and Q2, we saw that that growth rate was impacted a little bit more 1 to 2 points against our annual guide. Now that we've been through Q3 and our visibility to Q4, now that's about 3 points incremental to what we had provided in our annual guide. So this has been a cumulative effect. And as Charlie has pointed out, really seeing an inflection point in part, I think, due to the macro, but I also think customers are really embracing the value of this business model as well.\nPaul Ziots: Thank you, Nehal. Next question, please.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Wamsi Mohan of Bank of America. You may proceed.\nWamsi Mohan: Hi, thanks so much. I was wondering if you could maybe give us some update on how we should think about CapEx given the increased momentum of Storage as a Service. And where are you in terms of the build-out when you think about maybe this continued momentum of Evergreen//One, what sort of revenue level can the infrastructure that you currently have support? Thank you.\nKevan Krysler: Yes. I don't think we'll see a lot of change in terms of how we're thinking about our CapEx. Obviously, we had higher CapEx as well this year due to the build-out of our headquarters. Obviously, we've got a significant amount of innovation from an R&D perspective. So we've got some CapEx requirements there. And really, the only other big CapEx requirement is supporting the momentum of Evergreen//One. And so that's how we would be thinking about it from a CapEx perspective. And then obviously, you've got a layering on in terms of the subscription services revenue effect coming on as a result of the ramping Evergreen//One sales that we're seeing.\nPaul Ziots: Thank you, Wamsi. Next question, please.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Matt Sheerin of Stifel. You may proceed.\nMatt Sheerin: Thank you. Commentary from one of your competitors last night pointed to a broader QLC-based adoption across the industry. So first, are you seeing any changes in the competitive landscape or market share pressure given some new product introduction. It sounds like from your previous comments that you're not seeing that. And second, can you add more color on the success you've seen so far with FlashBlade//E and expectations for the new array E? And any surprises in terms of use cases or types of customers?\nCharlie Giancarlo: You bet. Well, I'll now refer to the E family given that we've now introduced FlashArray//E, which lowers the incoming price point, if you will, for customers from what was 4 petabytes on FlashBlade now down to 1 petabyte on flash array and even less if they take it as a service. So we really feel that it's a very, very strong product line. We have seen that entry by one of our competitors. E comes in substantially below that. We really feel the E - the competitors see offering is much closer to our C offering. So we're several years ahead of that. The competitive environment for our offering is still largely with disk. And disk - we say disk, but of course, disk comes in many flavors. And as we develop E further and further, we have to address all the different use cases that it's involved in, which is what drives its growth. That growth is still the fastest growth of any new product that we've had here at the company. So we're very pleased with the growth, but it's still at the - we're only two full quarters in. So it's - we anticipate that will be a much more meaningful part of our revenue next year.\nPaul Ziots: Thank you, Matt. Next question, please.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Eric Martinuzzi of Lake Street. You may proceed.\nEric Martinuzzi: Yes. Curious to know how you feel about your sales capacity is typically when you're evaluating your coverage for the coming year? Are you planning on adding sales?\nCharlie Giancarlo: The answer is yes. We believe our capacity is at the level that we had planned for. And we're planning, obviously, to grow. So we are adding to our sales force have been throughout the year, but Q4 is a key time to bring in new players. And so we will be adding to our sales force.\nPaul Ziots: Thank you, Eric. We have one more question. So next question will be the last question.\nOperator: The next question is a follow-up question from the line of Krish Sankar of TD Cowen. You may proceed.\nKrish Sankar: Hi. Thanks for taking my follow-up. I just wanted to follow up on the Evergreen//One. What sort of time frame are the - are these contracts, for example, just to like make it simple. You said it's a three percentage point headwind for your FY '24 outlook. It is very simply that the next two years are flat and because of this one, is it like a 1% uptake every over the next three years, if it's a three-year subscription model. I'm just kind of curious how to think about these Evergreen//One subscription.\nKevan Krysler: Yes, it's a great question. Look, if we look at the Evergreen//One orders that we've closed to date this year, we're probably averaging a little bit over 3.5 years in duration associated with that of those orders, which really is similar to our traditional CapEx commitments as well. So that's the answer in terms of duration that we're seeing.\nCharlie Giancarlo: I do want to point out that these are consumption contracts. And so these are, in effect, minimums. The consumption goes higher, then, of course, we'd expect more. And of course, we expect the contracts to continue even after the contract is done.\nKevan Krysler: That's right, Charlie. And then when we calculate what the headwind is, and against - the headwind again is against our annual guide that we provided at the beginning of the year, we just basically translate the incremental growth we're seeing beyond the growth we had assumed in the annual - in the annual revenue guide that we provided, using about 70% going to product if it was a traditional CapEx sale. So that's how we're calculating the points of headwind against our annual revenue guide.\nOperator: There are no additional questions waiting at this time. So I'll pass the conference over to the management team for closing remarks.\nCharlie Giancarlo: Thank you, operator. Our strategy to provide customers a consistent, unified and modern storage platform for all their storage needs based on a cloud operating model continues to distinguish us in our industry and propel our success. And we believe the strength of our consumption offerings continues to outperform, benefiting both our customers and Pure. As we enter the holiday season, I want to extend our heartfelt thanks to all of our customers, our investors, partners, our suppliers and our employees. Your effort enables Pure to lead the industry in defining the next generation of data storage. Thank you.\nOperator: That concludes the Pure Storage third quarter fiscal year 2024 earnings conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.",

            "name": "Rob Lee",
            "content": "Yes, absolutely, Tim. This is Rob. I'll take that one. Certainly, AI, inclusive of traditional AI and generative AI is and continues to be a strong segment for us. But more importantly, what we've seen this quarter is a variety of AI wins really across all of the areas of the AI-driven opportunity for us here at Pure. And that's number one, certainly, the training infrastructure environments. Number two, the inference and AI application environments, as well as number three, some of the broader data environments that are being connected to these AI workflows. And so if we look at the AI training infrastructure, look, this - we've been in the space for years, continues to be a strong area for us. As an example, this quarter, we had a large automaker, expand their FlashBlade footprint, really driving their autonomous driving efforts as well as number two, we saw customers really deploying both our Portworx as well as our flash array solutions as part of their inference AI application environments. And then thirdly, as we look at the opportunity around the broader data management and data preparation environments, these are equally important parts of AI deployments. And we saw some good wins in both of these - in these areas as well, serving both customers' database and data preparation applications as well as some other bulk data repositories connected to these environments. And so if I net it out continues to be a strong segment for us and look, if we look at the opportunity in terms of both the GPU connected environments as well, the larger data environments being driven by AI technology, we're well positioned across the entire portfolio to benefit from these deployments. And just to add on to that, I think it's important to just highlight and remember that because of our flash management technology and direct flash, we've got a sustained and significant structural advantage over the competitive set who are trapped an SSD-based technology. Because of the direct flash, we can deliver products that are less complex, more reliable, more efficient, more performance. And at the end of the day, that translates to better products delivered in a more cost-effective way. And behind that, our Purity software really is that differentiation. And so just to - again, just to add on to Charlie's points, the advantages that we have really are structural and sustainable, driven by our significant software and hardware IP."

            "name": "Charlie Giancarlo",
            "content": "Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our Q3 earnings call. We are pleased with Pure's Q3 financial results. We saw healthy demand for our portfolio throughout the quarter, proving that Pure's platform strategy and vision is resonating with our customers. The Pure Storage platform provides customers the ability to deploy a consistent software and management environment across the full price performance range for block, file and object workloads, for both traditional and cloud-native applications. The Pure platform guarantees customers never experienced change management downtime. It guarantees the lowest space power and e-waste in the industry and provides infrastructure and services that always get better with age without disruption. The Pure Storage platform also promises a cloud operating model for our customers, enabling them to manage their data storage like the cloud providers to reduce their storage costs in the cloud to provide tailored storage services to their developers like the cloud and to consume storage like the cloud as a service. This model is gaining traction with leading customers. Evergreen//One, our Storage as a Service consumption offering saw continued extraordinary growth, more than doubling year-over-year. Evergreen//One and Evergreen/Flex are our preferred services for providing customers data storage on a consumption basis. Although we continue to offer customers the choice of consuming storage as CapEx, we believe the continued high demand for Evergreen//One is being driven by our sales activities, new customer buying behavior, and the current macro environment. Customers are attracted to the ability to manage and consume Evergreen storage as a cloud service as they need it. But with the low cost advanced capabilities and data security of on-prem storage. The outperformance of Evergreen//One this year has been significantly above our prior expectations and we now expect this strong level of demand to continue through Q4. While this success is a long anticipated and welcome expansion of our business model, its overperformance will have an effect on near-term revenue, which Kevan will cover in detail. In Q3, Pure set a new industry standard with eight service level agreement or SLA guarantees across our Evergreen services. With the innovative new paid power and rack program, we pay our Evergreen customers power and rack space costs. This first-of-a-kind program is enabled by our ability to deliver the cloud attributes that customers desire with the most energy efficient and reliable storage technology. Paid power and rack directly addresses the increasing cost of electricity and data center space. Additional SLAs introduced in Q3 and guarantee no change related downtime, no future data migrations for hardware replacements, upgrades or expansions and zero data loss. Portworx, our Kubernetes and container storage software for cloud native applications also had a record quarter. Portworx was recently named a leader in the inaugural IDC Marketscape for container data management. We saw increased multiyear renewals from existing customers and new customers deploying the Portworx suite of products for multi-cloud databases, messaging and logging systems. Portworx was also selected by a leading global retailer to provide a single integrated platform for their machine learning researchers and analysts ensuring consistent models across multiple clouds. A large international government authority is supporting their artificial intelligence and machine learning environments with Portworx deployed in mission-critical cloud-based applications. Customer momentum in the field of artificial intelligence also continues for Pure with a double-digit number of AI wins in the quarter across our portfolio. This included era technology and AI-based decision intelligence and automation platform that chose our Portworx solution for seamless cloud integration, outperforming competitive solutions by 200%. And Olympus adopted Pure's AI-ready infrastructure based on a FlashBlade and NVIDIA solution for a new AI development environment, ensuring performance and capacity for large-scale models to accelerate their success with transformative AI solutions. We remain our customers' preferred partner for AI deployments and have strengthened our innovation and leadership by earning NVIDIA-based pod certification. Aerie, our complete AI-ready infrastructure built on the NVIDIA DGX base pod reference architecture and the latest FlashBlade//S storage platform makes AI scaling and deployments faster and easier for our customers. We continue to see strong demand for FlashBlade//E. And this month, we announced the general availability of FlashArray//E and shipped our first orders. This past quarter, we announced our latest Gartner accolade, a leader in the Magic Quadrant for distributed file systems and object storage, and it's now three years running. This marks the tenth successive year overall that our leadership has been acknowledged by Gartner in transforming the storage industry. The early success of our E family reinforces our belief that flash is replacing this enlarging Pure's opportunity in enterprise and eventually cloud storage. In Q3, Pure scored another major win for new 5G infrastructure to be deployed in our fiscal 2025. Pure's continuing success in the 5G space is based on our superior performance, reliability, density, longevity and advanced remote management capabilities. We are seeing strong early customer interest in our expanded partnership with Microsoft and the Pure Cloud Block store integration with Azure VMware Solution, also known as AVS. Pure and Microsoft announced the public preview of this service this quarter. CVS and AVS are providing customers the opportunity to reduce their cloud storage spend by half or more while providing them the advanced services that they experience with Pure's enterprise systems. Customers are also enthusiastic about managing their storage and data across data centers and clouds in a consistent hybrid environment. Despite the uncertainties of the current business environment, Pure superior low total cost of ownership and Evergreen offerings are making a difference in this challenging IT economy. We are seeing a strong positive response to our position of having a consistent, unified flash platform for all storage needs from the data center to the cloud. This position is enabling us to compete for ever larger footprints in large enterprise accounts. This, coupled with the strong overall demand for our platform gives me the confidence in our continued ability to take share and outpace the market. With that, I'll turn it over to Kevan for further commentary. Thanks Amit. Yes. Well, you nailed it, Amit, the shift to the consumption model has just continued to be very, very strong. And as you know, this is a model that we've been investing in for well over five years. It's one that we had staked a lot of our anticipation in and moving forward with, but this year has just been very strong. And one could say that it's the macro that has driven greater interest in a consumption model, I think, for obvious reasons, for the customer. But even more than that, we've invested in it heavily to make it not just a subscription and therefore, an easier bite, if you will, for economically difficult times. But to make it a true cloud service where they manage it like the cloud, it is hands-off. And now we're even paying for their power and rack space so that it's - other than the fact that it sits on their premise, it's a true cloud service. So the uptake in this, especially in these more difficult challenging times has been tremendous. So the two are tightly aligned. The macro overall certainly hasn't helped. Better macro would have lifted all boats. But really, the change as you put it, it was driven primarily by the shift to subscription and consumption model. Let me start with the Meta question. So we continued - Meta continues to be a good customer. We have not - generally, when - on these calls, we talk about contribution by RSE. No meaningful contribution to RSE this past quarter, but we've had sales to Meta in other segments. And that relationship continues to blossom as far as we're concerned. It continues to get better, and we expect to continue to see good opportunities in Meta as we go forward. And then the second one was the... Well, almost - if I might start. One, because we've had such strong growth in Evergreen//One. It has been a bit of a headwind the whole year, but it had never been sustained the way it is this year. We had good quarters, like every other new program you have strong quarters and then it's balanced off by other quarters where the specific opportunity in this case, Evergreen//One was a bit weaker. And when we saw the growth in Evergreen//One early in the year, as we -- as you may remember, the economy turned weak around Q4 last year, and so we were expecting Evergreen//One to pick up. What's really different this time around is just the continued strength quarter-over-quarter and visibility into Q4 now as well, the strength there. So yes, but it's becoming a more meaningful number now. Yes. No, we highlighted that it is, in fact, a 5G application environment that this is going into. And I would say in order of this type in one quarter is not terribly unusual for us. It does happen from time to time. And 5G has been a very strong market for us. The advantages that we have in space, power and cooling, reliability and longevity of the product in its remote management capability really aligns well with telco and especially 5G, which is a very distributed environment. And I will say, although it's unusual for us in general, it's not unusual in the telco space to have scheduled shipments aligning with their upgrades to their distributed 5G environment. So our typical business in IT and other areas is book and ship within weeks. This is a scheduled shipment based on build outs - their build-out schedule of their 5G environment. Thank you, Sidney. We intend to be very aggressive in pricing and especially as we penetrate the lower price performance tiers of the disk market. It's a new market for flash and the opportunity there is huge, more than half of the overall enterprise storage market, and we believe we have a special opportunity that ahead of every other player in the market. So our intention is the E family grows is to be very aggressive in that segment. Frankly, as you point out, the 73 is above our intended range for product gross margins. And we're going to use that a natural cost advantage we have to continue to gain market share. Yes. In terms of selling and what the competitive situation looks like out in the field, I'd say it's as competitive as ever, perhaps, so a little less gross margins generally have been improving. So perhaps the pricing environment has been a little bit better, but I would say, overall, the competition is as tough as ever, both in the channel and directly with customers overall. What I will say is, having perusing as we always do, our overall win rates and at bets. Our overall win rates hold very steady against our competitors. So - but it is a tough environment without doubt. You bet. Well, I'll now refer to the E family given that we've now introduced FlashArray//E, which lowers the incoming price point, if you will, for customers from what was 4 petabytes on FlashBlade now down to 1 petabyte on flash array and even less if they take it as a service. So we really feel that it's a very, very strong product line. We have seen that entry by one of our competitors. E comes in substantially below that. We really feel the E - the competitors see offering is much closer to our C offering. So we're several years ahead of that. The competitive environment for our offering is still largely with disk. And disk - we say disk, but of course, disk comes in many flavors. And as we develop E further and further, we have to address all the different use cases that it's involved in, which is what drives its growth. That growth is still the fastest growth of any new product that we've had here at the company. So we're very pleased with the growth, but it's still at the - we're only two full quarters in. So it's - we anticipate that will be a much more meaningful part of our revenue next year. The answer is yes. We believe our capacity is at the level that we had planned for. And we're planning, obviously, to grow. So we are adding to our sales force have been throughout the year, but Q4 is a key time to bring in new players. And so we will be adding to our sales force. I do want to point out that these are consumption contracts. And so these are, in effect, minimums. The consumption goes higher, then, of course, we'd expect more. And of course, we expect the contracts to continue even after the contract is done. Thank you, operator. Our strategy to provide customers a consistent, unified and modern storage platform for all their storage needs based on a cloud operating model continues to distinguish us in our industry and propel our success. And we believe the strength of our consumption offerings continues to outperform, benefiting both our customers and Pure. As we enter the holiday season, I want to extend our heartfelt thanks to all of our customers, our investors, partners, our suppliers and our employees. Your effort enables Pure to lead the industry in defining the next generation of data storage. Thank you."

            "name": "Kevan Krysler",
            "content": "Thank you, Charlie. We are pleased with our financial results this quarter. We delivered strong revenue and operating profit, both above our prior guidance for the quarter. Revenue was $763 million, up 13% year-over-year, and operating profit was $169 million. The macro spending environment remains relatively consistent to what we have seen throughout this year. However, demand for our solutions was robust throughout Q3. Our business strategy continues to focus on transitioning our offerings for our customers to consumption and subscription services. These types of offerings provide more value to our customers, which is resonating as customer demand for our consumption and subscription-based offerings across our Evergreen portfolio, especially Evergreen//One and Portworx is very strong. We achieved another quarter of record sales of our FlashBlade portfolio, including FlashBlade//E, which has quickly grown to become a meaningful portion of our FlashBlade business since becoming generally available in late April. We are also seeing customers consuming our FlashBlade technology, including FlashBlade as a service, leveraging our Evergreen//One Storage as a Service offering. Our operating profit of $169 million in Q3 exceeded expectations. Our differentiated flash management technology powered by purity software operating natively with raw flash continues to be a key driver of our strong product and subscription gross margins. As we mentioned last quarter, the majority of our capacity shipped is based on QLC raw flash. Remaining Performance Obligations or RPO was very strong and exceeds $2 billion growing 30%. During Q3, we closed a large non-cancellable product order with a large telco customer totaling $41 million that is included in the RPO balance at the end of Q3. Based on the timing of the shipment schedule for this order, product revenue is not expected until next year, which impacts our revenue outlook this year, which I'll discuss further in my remarks when updating annual guidance. When excluding both the noncancelable product order from RPO in the current quarter and the outstanding commitment in Q3 of last year with one of our global system integrators, RPO growth for our subscription services was also very strong at 29%. As we mentioned last quarter, the outstanding commitment with our global system integrator was fully satisfied during Q1 of this year. In Q3, subscription services annual recurring revenue grew 26% year-over-year to nearly $1.3 billion, highlighting the strong traction for our consumption and subscription-based service offerings. As we have mentioned previously, closed Evergreen//One contracts where the effective service date has not started are excluded from the subscription services ARR calculation including closed Evergreen//One contracts where the service date has not yet started, subscription services ARR was also strong, growing 27%. Subscription services revenue of $310 million comprised 41% of total revenue. U.S. revenue for Q3 was $536 million and international revenue was $227 million. Our new customer acquisition grew sequentially as we acquired 353 new customers during the quarter. As previously mentioned, we were pleased with our strong gross margin performance of 74%. Product gross margin was 73.1%, and subscription services gross margin was 75.4%. Our headcount increased slightly to approximately 5,500 employees at the end of the quarter. Pure's balance sheet and liquidity remains very strong, including $1.35 billion in cash and investments at the end of Q3. Cash flow from operations during the quarter was $158 million and capital expenditures totaled $45 million. In Q2, we repurchased over 630,000 shares of stock, returning over $22 million to our shareholders. Consistent with our remarks last quarter, our share repurchases represent a lower level of repurchase activity as a result of the fixed trading parameters that were in place throughout the quarter. We have approximately $167 million remaining on our existing $250 million repurchase authorization. Now turning to our updated annual guidance for FY '24. A key assumption used to derive our FY '24 annual revenue guide at the beginning of the year was that the macro environment would not meaningfully improve or deteriorate throughout the year. This assumption is holding as the spending environment continues to be challenging. Though despite these challenges, we are seeing increasing demand in the second half of the year across our data storage platform especially for consumption and subscription service offerings. Although we expect the demand to increase for the second half of the year, there are two important factors that are impacting our annual revenue expectation this year, which we now expect to be $2.82 billion, growing 2.5% and Q4 revenue is expected to be $782 million, declining 3.5%. First is the impact of our Evergreen//One Storage as a Service momentum, which will be discussed in more detail. And second is the impact of a $41 million non-canceled product order with a telco customer that is not expected to be fulfilled until next year. Both factors on a combined basis represent approximately 4.5 points of incremental headwind when compared to the annual revenue guide we provided at the beginning of the year. We are very pleased with the momentum and growth of our Evergreen//One service offering, while appreciating that this momentum creates a short-term impact on revenue growth. Last quarter, we stated that sales of our Evergreen//One service offering was expected to create 1 to 2 points of headwind to the annual revenue guide we provided at the beginning of the year. Based on our Evergreen//One sales in Q3 and the opportunities in our seasonally largest quarter Q4, we now expect that annual sales of our Evergreen//One and Evergreen//Flex offerings will more than double this year, reaching nearly $400 million and expect the impact will now create 3 points of headwind to the annual guide we provided at the beginning of the year. When excluding the impacts of the increased shift to our Evergreen//One offering and a $41 million order with a telco customer, our annual revenue growth would have been 7% when compared against the annual revenue guide we provided at the beginning of the year. We expect that our consumption and subscription business models will drive improved long-term growth for Pure as our subscription and consumption business continues to grow, we will provide additional business metrics that will help measure the health of our business. This includes translating growth rates of our subscription and consumption service offerings to a growth rate under our traditional model of a CapEx sale. Finally, we are increasing our annual operating margin guidance from 15.5% to 16% driven by our continued operational discipline and gross margin strength. Q4 operating margin is expected to be approximately 19%. In closing, we are pleased with the strength and demand across our entire Pure Storage platform, including our expectation of more than doubling sales this year of our combined Evergreen//One Storage as a Service and Evergreen//Flex offerings. We could not be more excited with how our solutions resonate with our customers, delivering a consistent, nondisruptive operating and management environment, leveraging the most advanced flash technology. Our innovation across our storage platform also extends to our Evergreen business models, providing customers with increasing flexibility and business value. With that, I will turn it back to Paul for Q&A. Yes. Thanks, Charlie. This is Kevan. And how're you doing Amit? If you take a step back and really look at the change in our annual guide as well as the impact to Q4, it really does come down to two key factors that we've described. One is what Charlie has highlighted, which is the strength and momentum of Evergreen//One. And then the second, obviously, is the telco order. That was all product that's having an impact on Q4 as well. Yes. How're you doing, Arron, this is Kevan. The $400 million is really our sales of Evergreen//One and Evergreen//Flex for the year. So think about that as a TCV of sales during the year. And then if you - if we take a step back into exiting Q2 and going into Q3, we had talked about the fact that our annual guide range had contemplated strong growth. We were adding about another 1 to 2 points of headwind to that growth exiting Q2. And then with the strength that we've seen in Q3 on Evergreen//One as well as what we're seeing in terms of volume and opportunities in Q4, that headwind now has been increased to 3 points. So again, and your math is about right in terms of the effects in absolute dollars when in context to our annual revenue guide. And then tacking on to that, the telco order, which is having an impact as well. You want to clarify your second question as well. Yes. And if I would just to add on to that, to what Charlie was saying, it really is an accumulation of effect. So starting with our annual revenue guide that we provided, obviously, there were two components that were key in that guide of mid-to high single digits. One was contemplation of the macro environment. And second was, we were considering momentum of Evergreen//One when we came into the year. Now exiting Q2, we added on 1 to 2 points of additional headwind as a result of what we were seeing, both for Q1 and Q2 and our visibility to Q3. Now Q3 outperformed even our raised expectations in Q4 looks very strong as well. And so you do have the accumulation effect going on, but lastly, when we think about Q3, there was definitely more pressure on product revenue as a result of the momentum we were seeing with Evergreen//One. And the sales team did a really nice job executing throughout the quarter. And part of this strong execution included accelerating fulfillment and probably of a subset of product orders that would have been expected to close in Q4. So there is an impact there as well. And hopefully, that adds some additional color for you there. Yes. Thanks for the question. And really, we won't go into a lot of detail specific to next year. We want to navigate through our seasonally largest quarter, which is Q4. But I think two important things to take away that we're seeing. One is that demand has strengthened and is expected to strengthen through the first half, and that's a good sign for us. And second is the momentum on for Evergreen//One and strength we're seeing for a variety of reasons that Charlie walked through. And so both those factors will be in play in terms of how we think about next year, but would want to get through Q4 before providing anything more specific for next year. So I'm just going to add to this a little bit more, taking a step back, agreeing that the gross margins across the board were very strong, and so we're quite pleased with that and validating and agreeing with obviously Charlie and Rob and really wanting to reiterate as well that the majority of our bits shipped now continue to be QLC, which ties into the continued innovation that we're driving. And look, we really do benefit from flash pricing, both improving and weakening and we are currently seeing some improvement in the NAND pricing. And then reiterating Charlie's point, from a financial lens with our strong product gross margins, we will be aggressive in our disk takeout strategy with our E family price performance solutions. As we think about our subscription growth margins, that's going to be a combination of our scale on our Evergreen offerings, including the consumption and subscription portfolio as a key contributor, also similar to the strength we're seeing in product margins, our Evergreen subscription gross margins are also benefiting from the structural advantages that Rob alluded to. So yes, definitely pleased with what we're seeing in terms of our margin performance overall. Yes. I think the key metric, obviously, we added a new metric this quarter, which was the total sales this year expected for the combined Evergreen//One and Evergreen//Flex model and that being $400 million over doubling year-over-year. So that would be a new metric that we've added that hopefully is helpful. The other metric that I think is helpful is the RPO metric and obviously, our strength in growth in RPO is really being driven by our Evergreen//One momentum that we've seen throughout the year, including Q3. And then layering on to that would be our subscription services ARR growth, which is also quite strong. So those are the metrics I'd probably point you to in assessing the health around our consumption and subscription services business. Yes. I'll hit the discussion for next year, again without providing a lot of details. But as you think about the setup for next year, it is critical for us to navigate through Q4 and our expectations through Q4. But this is really not, in my mind, a seasonal question. It's really about Evergreen//One and the performance of Evergreen//One. And if we take a step back, and look at the Evergreen//One momentum and the telco order, we should be for this year at 7% growth. And so what we've seen on top of that and what we're seeing in the second half is strengthening demand. And I would hope to see that as we continue through Q4 and as we move into next year. So that would be a data point for consideration. We talked about 3 points on the annual guide against the annual guide of headwind for Evergreen//One. Look, we're expecting momentum to continue on Evergreen//One. We're actually thrilled that we're seeing an inflection point with our customers with that model. And so we'll have to provide more color for you as we move through Q4, specific to the Evergreen//One momentum next year. Charlie? Nehal, that is true. And then I would add on to that specific for this quarter would be the telco order that we've been highlighting and discussing as well. Yes. And it's primarily Evergreen//One. And we've talked about what we've seen this year is a cumulative build and momentum of Evergreen//One. So again, coming out of the year and developing our guide for the year, we had contemplated a really significant growth in Evergreen//One. And again, as we navigated through Q1 and Q2, we saw that that growth rate was impacted a little bit more 1 to 2 points against our annual guide. Now that we've been through Q3 and our visibility to Q4, now that's about 3 points incremental to what we had provided in our annual guide. So this has been a cumulative effect. And as Charlie has pointed out, really seeing an inflection point in part, I think, due to the macro, but I also think customers are really embracing the value of this business model as well. Yes. I don't think we'll see a lot of change in terms of how we're thinking about our CapEx. Obviously, we had higher CapEx as well this year due to the build-out of our headquarters. Obviously, we've got a significant amount of innovation from an R&D perspective. So we've got some CapEx requirements there. And really, the only other big CapEx requirement is supporting the momentum of Evergreen//One. And so that's how we would be thinking about it from a CapEx perspective. And then obviously, you've got a layering on in terms of the subscription services revenue effect coming on as a result of the ramping Evergreen//One sales that we're seeing. Yes, it's a great question. Look, if we look at the Evergreen//One orders that we've closed to date this year, we're probably averaging a little bit over 3.5 years in duration associated with that of those orders, which really is similar to our traditional CapEx commitments as well. So that's the answer in terms of duration that we're seeing. That's right, Charlie. And then when we calculate what the headwind is, and against - the headwind again is against our annual guide that we provided at the beginning of the year, we just basically translate the incremental growth we're seeing beyond the growth we had assumed in the annual - in the annual revenue guide that we provided, using about 70% going to product if it was a traditional CapEx sale. So that's how we're calculating the points of headwind against our annual revenue guide."

With that, I'll turn it over to Charlie.\nCharlie Giancarlo: Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Pure Storage's Q2 conference call. We are pleased with our financial results this quarter. While the macro environment continued to be challenging, we outpaced our competitors and saw a strong growth in our strategic investments, particularly in FlashBlade//S, FlashBlade//E, and Evergreen//One. Our results demonstrate that we continue to lead our market and that our strategy is working. Pure is delivering extraordinary outcomes for our customers, by transforming data storage, from a highly fragmented solution set to a single consistent platform. Pure is today, the first and only data storage company that can deliver a single, consistent, non-disruptive, operating and management environment, leveraging the most advanced flash technology, across all of data storage needs. With the introduction of the E family, our all-flash products now stand from the highest performance systems to the most cost effective systems for bulk data. Uniquely in our industry, all of Pure's products are based on one operating system, Purity, the only storage software that operates natively, direct to flash rather than using less efficient commodity SSDs. All of Pure's products are managed with our Pure One management system, and have consistent APIs. All of our products support non-disruptive upgrades forever. Through our Evergreen technology and subscription programs and are all available to consume as a service through Evergreen//One. The data storage industry has for decades been plagued with different tailored software and hardware solutions for the wide range of the storage protocols, formats, performance levels and price points needed to cover the market. The storage portfolio of legacy data storage providers was generally assembled by acquisition and are collections of disparate inconsistent environments. That approach left customers with a complex infrastructure, with multiple software operating environments, with different management systems and multiple differing operational processes. As a result, legacy storage environments are complex, they vary for each use-case, they require downtime for upgrades and require forklift replacements roughly every five years. Pure is the only company that provides customers a single, consolidated operating environment for all of their data storage needs, including block, file and objects. Q2 was the first full quarter of shipments for FlashBlade//E, sales and pipeline have exceeded our expectations and it is experiencing the fastest growth of all prior new product releases. At purchase FlashBlade//E with three years of Evergreen subscription has an acquisition cost competitive with hard disk based systems and has substantially lower operating costs. It enables our customers to move ever more of their cost sensitive workloads, to all flash. The E-family of products allows Pure to now cover the entire spectrum of data storage, inclusive of low priced bulk storage, providing customers with a consistent, modern and reliable product line for all their storage needs. Flash-array E will become available later this year, joining FlashBlade//E. FlashArray//E will enable cost effective storage for bulk data or capacities from one to four petabytes. And as part of the E family, it can also reduce customers' total operational costs, by up to 60% and produce 85% less e-waste, compared to hard disk based system. We are seeing continued momentum and opening new opportunities with our cloud strategy. Last week, we announced an expanded multi-year partnership with Microsoft Azure services and its Azure VMware solution known as ADS, using our Pure Cloud Block Store. This offers a new age of cloud migration that can drive faster, more cost effective adoption of cloud services. Combining Pure's industry leading data reduction, with our ability to decouple storage needs from compute, customers can significantly reduce their total cloud costs, while increasing hybrid cloud capabilities. In addition to operating in the cloud, our cloud operating model allows our customers to operate their storage environment like the cloud to offer services like the cloud, to better build for the cloud and also to consume storage like the cloud. Pure Fusion enables our customers to manage the Pure portfolio as a fleet, as an integrated pool of storage across datacenters and across clouds. Pure Fusion allows customers to offer their developers access to bespoke data services through APIs. Portworx, the most highly rated Kubernetes data platform for deploying cloud native applications was chosen for the fourth consecutive year, by analysts from GigaOm as the leader for enterprise Kubernetes data storage, and cloud native Kubernetes data storage. Evergreen//One, allows our customers to also consume like the cloud, based entirely on a service level agreement with Pure to allow them to store their data, whenever and wherever they want. Evergreen//One is available for all of Pure's product offerings. The growth of subscription services contributed significantly to our success in Q2.. Evergreen//One, the industry's leading storage as a service offering saw sales double again year-over-year. Our Evergreen technology and programs revolutionized the industry and provide Pure a sustainable competitive advantage ending traditional legacy hardware replacement practices customers and turning every sale into a storage as a service relationship. With our Evergreen forever subscription, company's upgrade both hardware and software to the latest technology, without paying additional capital continually without downtime forever. As we discussed last quarter, Generative AI and ChatGPT have brought artificial intelligence to the top of mind for all customers. And AI creates two sets of opportunities for Pure. First, we can supply products for AI training environments, such as the creation of large language models or LLMs short. And second, we can support enterprises to prepare their data architecture for AI inference, meaning the use of LLM's on their own data. Most customers will leverage third-party LLM's their base. They will return and retrain these models on their proprietary data within their own organizational boundaries. By adding guard rails they will enable AI inference to achieve outcomes specific to their business. The former requires very high performance, while the latter is enhanced with the replacement of low performance secondary hard disk systems with our E family of cost-effective flash storage. During the quarter, FlashBlade//S one a Generative AI footprint in a production environment in the low eight digits. Portworx also saw multiple wins in early AI development environments. Customers purchased Portworx to ensure reliable data management during the training and inference process. Over the last five years, well over a 100 customers have chosen FlashBlade to accelerate their AI and machine learning environments. With the introduction of FlashBlade//E, AI customers are able to take advantage of a single operating and management environment for both their hot and their bulk data, dramatically simplifying their data storage infrastructure and reducing its cost and environmental footprints. For the last few months, I have visited customers, partners and resellers across the US, Asia-Pacific and Europe to highlight Pure's new ever more powerful position. Customers immediately grasped the benefits of and the need for a unified operating and management environment for all of their data storage needs, blocks, file and object. From the highest performance to the most cost-effective. They responded enthusiastically to the ability to operate their storage and data environment, as consistent storage pools, across datacenters and clouds. And they welcomed the advantages of our Evergreen technology and subscription available across our entire data storage platform. Pure's products uniquely stand out in the industry, due to our single operating environment and consistent APIs across our products. This is powered by our consistent use of Purity and our Pure one management system across all our products. Our new E family of products leverage our latest direct to flash capabilities of Purity software to unlock the most cost effective QLC flash to penetrate the bulk data market for the first time with all flash technology. Our high density direct flash modules or DFM's, work with Purity to power this event. This enables better performance, better longevity, better reliability and ultimately better price performance than both hard disks and even SSD based systems. We have been shipping 48 terabyte DFMs for the last three years and we will introduce our 75 terabyte DFM later this year. Today, Pure's DFM's are 2 to 4 times denser than the largest hard disk and SSDs in competitive use and our advantage and density is accelerating. Our roadmap calls for a 150 terabyte DFM next year and a 300 terabyte DFM by 2026. Our improvements in performance and density of direct flash versus commodity products will enable us to increase our competitiveness in the industry by a wide margin not only in performance and cost but also in energy efficiency and e-waste reduction. Speaking of energy and e-waste we issued our second ESG report last week. It details the advancements we continue to make across our technology portfolio, operations and people. Our largest area of contribution continues to be the extraordinary energy e-waste and space savings of our products, which enable our customers to achieve their environmental sustainability goals. Pure products can reduce the total energy and emissions from data centers globally, by upwards of 20% as Pure's flash optimized systems use up to 5 times less power than competitive SSD based systems up to 10 times less power than the hard disk systems we will replace. In closing, I have never been more confident in our long-term growth strategy, or in our opportunity to lead this market. I'll now turn the call over to Kevin Krysler. Kevin?\nKevan Krysler: Thank you, Charlie. Revenue of $689 million in Q2 grew 6.5% year-over-year and exceeded our revenue guidance. We achieved record sales of our entire FlashBlade portfolio including FlashBlade//E in saw continued high demand for our Evergreen//One subscription services, as sales more than doubled year-over-year. While the spending environment remains relatively consistent to what we have seen over the last couple of quarters, our customers are choosing to invest in our high technology data storage solutions for their key, strategic projects. As we have seen with the sales performance of both our FlashBlade and Evergreen//One offerings this quarter. Momentum we saw across our entire FlashBlade portfolio included specific AI and ML use cases, including a significant Generative AI win that Charlie highlighted. We are excited with the historic ramp for both sales and pipeline of FlashBlade//E throughout the quarter. Customers no longer need to settle for hard-disk systems and can now choose Pure's higher performance flash solutions at competitive price points. Q2 operating profit of nearly $112 million exceeded expectations, due to the performance of our products and subscription gross margins. Our unique Purity security software architecture working directly with raw flash rather than less efficient and shorter lived SSDs contributed to the strength and product gross margins. Leveraging our Purity software, the majority of the capacity we now ship is based on QLC raw flash. More aggressive discounting behavior from our competitors, during the quarter, slightly offset product gross margin expansion. In Q2, subscription services annual recurring revenue grew 27% year-over-year to $1.2 billion and included strong growth from our Evergreen//One storage as a service offering. Close to Evergreen//One contracts where the effective service date has not yet started are excluded from the subscription ARR calculation. Subscription ARR growth would have been 28% when considering closed Evergreen//One contracts, where the service date has not yet started. Remaining performance obligations or RPO grew 26% to $1.9 billion. Similar to the remarks we've made in previous quarters, our RPO previously included an outstanding commitment with one of our global system integrators. During Q1, this remaining outstanding commitment was fully satisfied and when excluding the impact of the past outstanding commitment RPO grew 30% year-over-year. Subscription services revenue of $289 million comprised 42% of total revenue, which is 6 points higher than Q2 last year. U.S. revenue for Q2 was $495 million and international revenue was $194 million. We acquired 325 new customers during the quarter and our total customer count now exceeds 12,000. As previously mentioned, we were pleased with our continued strong gross margin performance of 72.8%, with product gross margin of 71.5%, and subscription services gross margin of 74.5%. Our head count increased slightly to approximately 5,400 employees at the end of the quarter. Pure's balance sheet and liquidity remains very strong, including $1.2 billion in cash and investments at the end of Q2. Cash flow from operations during the quarter was $102 million and capital expenditures totaled $55 million. In Q2, we repurchased nearly 600,000 shares of stock returning nearly $22 million to our shareholders. This represents a lower level of repurchase activity than recent quarters, as a result of the fixed trading parameters that were in-place throughout the quarter. We have approximately $190 million remaining on our existing $215 million repurchase authorization. Now turning to guidance. We expect Q3 revenue to be $760 million, representing double-digit growth of over 12% year-over-year. Our Q3 revenue guidance assumes continued strong subscription revenue growth fueled by our Evergreen//One subscription services. We continue to execute on aligning our cost structure with expected demand. The results of our continued operational discipline and the economic benefits we are seeing with our unique architecture of Purity software working directly with flash is reflected in our Q3 operating profit guide of $135 million, or 17.8% operating margin. Our annual revenue guidance we previously communicated remains unchanged and assumes revenue growth in the mid to high-single digits, as we expect significantly stronger year-over-year revenue growth for the second half of FY '24. As a reminder, revenue for our Evergreen//One subscription service offering is recurring and is recognized over time. The sales strength of our Evergreen//One offering through the first half of the year has outperformed our expectations and this momentum is expected to continue throughout the remainder of the year. The success of our sales of Evergreen//One subscription services, has been considered in our annual revenue guidance as the growth of this offering creates a near term headwind to the total revenue growth rate, as revenue is recognized over time. We also continue to assume no significant improvement or worsening of macroeconomic conditions from what we have seen over the last few quarters. Finally, we are increasing our annual operating margin guidance from 15% to 15.5%, driven by our continued operational discipline, as well as the benefits we are seeing as a result of our unmatched flash management technology, powered by Purity software. In closing, treating data storage and management as high technology as demonstrated through our continuous innovation across our portfolio and business models, we have established an extraordinary advantage in reducing power consumption, real estate space, labor and e-waste for our customers. Our business value and total cost of ownership advantages are unmatched against our competitors. With that, I will turn it back to Paul for Q&A.\nPaul Ziots: Thanks, Kevan. Before we begin the Q&A session, I'll ask you to limit yourselves to one question consisting of one part, so we can get to as many people as possible. If you have additional questions, we kindly ask that you please rejoin the queue. And we'll be happy to take those additional questions if time allows. Operator, let's get started.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll go first this afternoon to Amit Daryanani at Evercore.\nAmit Daryanani: Yes. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Yeah. I was hoping you could talk a bit more about the FlashBlade portfolio. I think in the press release you talked about record sales over here. So I'd love to understand where is the strength coming from, what's driving the success you had given a challenged macro. And we are really related to this, any sense on FlashBlade//E adoption is looking and is there (ph) some traction there. I think NetApp recently talked about how they're equivalent product at least is having a very strong launch. So love to hear you, whereas FlashBlade broadly resonating with customers. And is there any way to quantify what you're seeing that would be really helpful. Thank you.\nCharlie Giancarlo: Absolutely. Thanks, Amit. Well, I just as a reminder to the audience. We launched FlashBlade about five or six years ago now. And then more recently, a little over a year-ago updated it with what we call our FlashBlade//S program, which shares our direct flash modules with our FlashArray series, as well as more recently just last Q1, our FlashBlade//E product. FlashBlade//S addresses the high performance end the market and FlashBlade//E, as I mentioned in my script actually addresses the high capacity but bulk data, lower cost market overall. To answer your question directly, I believe the greater focus around AI certainly helps in FlashBlade sales, but frankly FlashBlade has continued to grow, especially since the introduction of FlashBlade//S, which gave it even greater compatibility with our FlashArray series, ever since we introduced that product. And now that we've introduced the E, it really allows customers to look at the full range of price performance for their high capacity workloads with one consistent platform. And, I think completing, if you will, the family with E, has really helped FlashBlade sales overall.\nRob Lee: Yeah. Absolutely, Amit. This is Rob just to jump into the second part of your question. Look, I think it's important to realize that E really has no equivalent on the market. E as Charlie mentioned is really enabled by our highly differentiated Purity software and direct flash technology that's designed for that software, which really sets us far apart not only from disk, which is largely the displacement market we're going after, but also any of the competitive set that might try to follow us with SSD based technology. And as Charlie mentioned, we started using this technology, leveraging and bringing -- using it to bring QLC into the enterprise over three years ago with FlashArray C, at a time to displace a hybrid disk-based systems and then now with E, with both FlashBlade//E and FlashArray//E joining later this year, I really see a complete portfolio to go after the entirety of a customers' data storage needs. And again, as Charlie said, being able to do that and offer it with a very consistent, hardware, software and management approach.\nPaul Ziots: Thank you, Amit. Next question, please.\nOperator: We go next now to Aaron Rakers at Wells Fargo.\nAaron Rakers: Yeah. Thanks for taking the question. I guess, I wanted to ask about the AI opportunity. Charlie, if you can, can you unpack a little bit about the eight-figure deal that you won in AI this quarter. Have you revenue recognize that just kind of any context on that? And then also just to clarify the Meta deal, are you continuing to not assume any kind of follow-on from that footprint deployment, next generation data center opportunity at Meta in your guidance for fiscal '24? Thank you.\nCharlie Giancarlo: You bet. So the eight-figure deal was nice as I said low eight-figure deal, but in a production environment that has opportunity for expansion. So very excited and it was that, the largest Gen AI deal of it -- of its type, which is why we wanted to highlight it not be not be only AI deal that we did in the quarter, but just because of its scale is something we wanted to highlight. I would also say that, it's an area that where we are seeing additional interest overall in the market. That being said, as I said last quarter, I'm just excited by the opportunity to upgrade customers\u2019 existing data environment, to the lower performance environment, because of the needs of wanting to use that data for AI inference in the future. So I'm seeing both of those opportunities in front of us. Separately, with respect to the Meta RSC which we've commented on the past, because when new shipments happened into that tends to have an effect on our overall P&L. Yeah, as I've stated in the past we have there's really no change from prior quarters. It continues to be an environment that Meta is happy with, our relationship with them is very good. There are no change as far as we know of their plans to expand in the future. In other words, that's still our expectation, but we don't know the exact timing.\nPaul Ziots: Kevan, did you want to make a comment about revenue recognition for that eight-figure deal that was included in our revenue.\nCharlie Giancarlo: Yes. Its included in our revenue. Yes. Thank you, Paul.\nPaul Ziots: Okay. Thank you, Aaron. Next question, please.\nOperator: Next now to Meta Marshall at Morgan Stanley.\nMeta Marshall: Great. Thanks. A couple of questions from me, just coming out of accelerate. You guys have made some very bold statements, just about kind of customers not named us anymore, and I just wanted to get a sense of how you found that message resounding with customers and what pieces of the portfolio, do you feel like or pieces of the roadmap that you need to demonstrate over the next kind of coming years to demonstrate to customers that they can have more comfort in that transition. And then, just maybe a clarification on FlashBlade//E, just kind of typical order to ship time. Thanks.\nCharlie Giancarlo: So, I can answer the first part of that question in a number of different ways. First of all, I believe that customers have already experienced the disk to flash benefits when they went with their primary storage from disk to flash and what they found was smaller footprints, higher reliability, less maintenance, less effort, overall, especially when they move to Pure flash. And so they already recognized that as a positive effect. And so, when we can now go in at these lower-price points, lower priced performance levels, they get very excited about it. But as I had mentioned in my prepared remarks, what gets them even more excited is consolidating their overall environment to a more consistent hardware, software environment, because it reduces the complexity and their overall IT datacenter reduces their complexity, when they want to move to the cloud, just reduces complexity generally. So it's not -- E is interesting, not just in the -- just in the flash transition, but in the ability of customers to move to a more consistent portfolio overall.\nRob Lee: And Meta, just to jump-in here. I think part of your question had to do with building comfort with customers around the transition. Look I think it's important to realize that the transition from hard disk to the flash we're offering with E, is completely seamless. All right. An other way to look at it is, there are basically no reasons that our customer says, hey, I would like to get disk. I would like to keep disk, there really no puts and takes. The only reason that customers have held onto disk in a lot of these environments, historically, has been price. And then now with our technology with what we've been able to do with E, we have effectively neutralized that. And so, I think. I think that's something that perhaps goes less appreciated. And I think we'll use that transition, because it's not a re-architecture, it's not a redesign. It really is, just a seamless and really instantaneous improvement on all dimensions.\nKevan Krysler: And let me just touch on that last question on order to ship time for FlashBlade//E, consistent with what we see across our portfolio. So no significant difference there.\nPaul Ziots: Thank you, Meta. Next question, please.\nOperator: We go next now to Pinjalim Bora at JPMorgan.\nPinjalim Bora: So great, guys. Congrats on the quarter. Staying on the AI theme. I wanted to ask you about Portworx seems that was a little bit surprising. I don't think people are thinking about Portworx and AI together, maybe talk about that AI opportunity with respect to Portworx, what are you seeing? What kind of workloads are these on-premise or cloud attaches? Are this is more of a training or influence time of AI that would be helpful. Thank you.\nCharlie Giancarlo: Yeah. Thanks, Pinjalim. Well, first of all, it's both influence and training. And as you might imagine, a lot of these new developments are being made in container based and Kubernetes based environments. And Portworx is without equal, in terms of its ability to manage storage of all types, for Kubernetes and containers and to do it both -- can do it on bare metal could do it in the cloud can do it on-top of our infrastructure. And so, these are very large environments. Portworx has always been really superior, when it gets too large scale production and so before going into a development where the developers know it's going to go large scale when they when they scale out, they're starting off with Portworx for their stateful data management.\nKevan Krysler: And Pinjalim just to just to add-on to that. I look at the Portworx and cloud native piece of this puzzle is, really a part of the overall set of environments that we see as being impacted by the uptake of AI technology, positively impacted. And so, certainly, number one, AI training infrastructure and environments, we've talked to you a lot about that. Number two, is really the demand to store more and more data in the enterprise, remove the silos and really move more of that cold data into the warm. And then as Charlie says, number three, looking at the application environments that the trend AI models are connected to. If you look at, where a lot of that data is coming into enterprises, it's coming from multiple sources, it is coming from business data, databases, IoT sensors, machine data all over the place. A lot of these applications sets environments, very highly dynamic, very aligned to open source, cloud native technologies. It's also important to realize that, getting these training -- trained AI models deployed and connected to real time systems is ultimately the goal for a lot of these enterprises. And so, when you look at the application environments driving these real time systems that folks want to plug, chat bots or what have you into, again, all very heavily based on and built on cloud-native architectures, open source software and they have the needs for agility, scalability elasticity, that those architectures afford, while at the same time, having the enterprise capabilities that technologies like Portworx can offer. And really that's what we're seeing out there today.\nPaul Ziots: Thank you, Pinjalim. Next question, please.\nOperator: We'll go next now to Wamsi Mohan at Bank of America.\nWamsi Mohan: Hi. Yes. Thank you so much. Charlie, we've not really seen a large uptick on-premise AI-driven workloads, but you mentioned sort of this large inference opportunity at enterprises. Any thoughts on when that can happen, do you see that in calendar '24 or '25 from a materiality perspective? And if I could like subscription ARR has been decelerating over the last four quarters. How should we think about the growth trajectory here? Thank you.\nCharlie Giancarlo: It's an interesting question. I would say that we do see opportunities on-prem for AI in -- I would say, highly specialized environments. And so, I think that is a real thing, of course, many of them are waiting for delivery of GPU and AI based processing systems and environments. And I would say that a lot of focus has been on the -- are currently on the compute side of it, a little bit less focus by the customers, because they've been so focused on the compute side, a little less focused on the storage infrastructure. I believe that's just starting to become a better known and understood requirement for these AI systems. But I'd say that, I just -- I would disagree, Wamsi, I'd say that we do, we are starting to see interest. If not yet deployments on-prem.\nKevan Krysler: And Wamsi, let me touch on the subscription ARR growth definitely pleased with what we saw in terms of subscription ARR growth especially Evergreen//One, which is outperforming our already strong expectations that we had at the beginning of year. And as a reminder, in my prepared remarks, closed Evergreen//One contracts, where the effective service date has not yet started, are excluded from the ARR calculation. And our subscription ARR growth would have been 28% had we included those contracts, where the service date had not begun. And look, is it just, as a result of product revenue being lower for our CapEx sales. We do have less attach of our Evergreen subscription, which is also reflected in our subscription ARR growth rate.\nPaul Ziots: Thank you, Wamsi. And just kind of reminder to everyone to please ask one question consisting of one part, and we'd be happy if you'd like to ask another question later on in the queue. Next question, please.\nOperator: Next now to Krish Sankar at TD Cowen.\nKrish Sankar: Yeah. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Charlie, I had a question on AI too. From a storage standpoint, where do you think benefits the most for AI workloads between block storage and object , whether you think benefits the most. And also, can you help us clarify what products in your portfolio today support InfiniBand and how to think about it into future?\nCharlie Giancarlo: Absolutely. I would say that, a lot of the -- a lot of the AI environments use block because it's very straightforward. Especially with programmers and block can be utilized for any structure that you want underneath, but increasingly, it's moving to an object based environment, because over time block is easier. It's more efficient and it's less, it requires less state the -- than what's generally necessary in a block environment. So, I think we're starting to see that shift, but it's been taking a lot of time to get to very high performance object. Rob do you want to add?\nRob Lee: Yeah. No, Wamsi, I think. Sorry, Chris. A couple of things. Look, I think if we step back from the application sets we're seeing AI technology being applied to today and we look at the long-term drivers. I think it's going to have a positive effect on all forms of storage. And why -- and what makes me believe that is look, the source data that enterprises are looking to feed into AI technology and get benefits from are coming from all over the place. They are coming from business systems that are coming from traditional databases, they're coming from more modern databases they are coming from unstructured data, log files, images, and that really spans the gamut, block file and object. I also think that the enterprises, are kind of source data that they're collecting through those means today and is going to increase in the future. I think that's the larger opportunity set. AI is clearly a fast-moving technology space that every enterprise is looking to adopt, and looking to take advantage of, and that's just going to drive a greater demand to collect and store data across the enterprise. I think just to address the second part of your question on InfiniBand, look, we've really focused on addressing the AI space as one of several very important segments in the portfolio. One of the things that really sets us apart in the market and really with our customers is the benefits we can deliver by having a consistent, hardware, software and management experience across all of their workloads sets. And this is where we see the benefits of ethernet based technologies, we see the benefit of more ubiquitous technologies, that again as the current application sets that you see perhaps an AI training environments broaden, and those environments needs to connect to other parts of the customers datacenter, special-purpose, technologies, if you will, such as InfiniBand really hinder that really get in the way. And so in InifiniBand is nothing new, we'd spent around for quite some time, but mostly found in more specialized environments. We see the bigger demand and value to the enterprise and being able to give them a complete solution set, not just for the AI training environments, but for all of the data environments that are going to be impacted by the uptake of AI technology.\nPaul Ziots: Thank you, Chris. Next question, please.\nOperator: Next, now to Sidney Ho at Deutsche Bank.\nSidney Ho: Great. Thanks for taking the question. My question is on the remaining purchase obligation. That is still showing really good growth in 26% growth year-over-year, but the unbilled portion really accelerated in the past few quarters. Can you talk about what's driving that acceleration, does it have anything to do with the new products or maybe Evergreen just growing rapidly. Thanks.\nCharlie Giancarlo: All right. I appreciate the question and it's a real simple answer. You're exactly right, it's due to the Evergreen//One acceleration and just timing of billings is really what it comes down to.\nPaul Ziots: Thank you, Sidney. Next question, please.\nOperator: We go next now to Shannon Cross at Credit Suisse.\nShannon Cross: Thank you very much. You mentioned that E is exceeding your expectations. I'm wondering, if you can talk a bit more about how the customer conversations are going, how much you're seeing this being sold into existing customers versus some of the new customers? Is it's opening up a new opportunity for RF to bid on new RFPs, just any more color you can give there. Thank you.\nCharlie Giancarlo: Yeah. Let me let me start. It -- first of all it is are exceeding our expectations, both in terms of the revenue that we saw in our first full quarter of shipments, as well as in the pipeline growth, which continues at unprecedented rates very-very fast. The conversations are, first of all, they are happening all-around the world, they are happening across a very broad set of use cases. And in some cases at prices higher than what the customer would be paying for new disk environments, because of the lower total operating cost, that they are able to get, and the better performance that they're able to get-out of the all-flash E environment. So, and I would say that it's really. I have yet to hear of a use-case around for an existing disk based system that flash FlashBlade//E was not able to address.\nPaul Ziots: Great. Thank you, Shannon. Next question, please.\nOperator: We'll go next to Jason Ader at William Blair.\nJason Ader: Yeah. Thank you. Hey, guys. Can you quantify the revenue growth headwind over the last 12 months from Evergreen//One? And also just start, any color on materiality to the total services revenue, I mean, can you give us a ballpark of how big it's becoming?\nCharlie Giancarlo: Yeah. It's a great question and Evergreen//One performances is simply been terrific. In the first half and we're expecting that momentum to continue. And you're right, there is a short-term headwind on revenue, as a result of revenue being recognized over-time. And when we think about it from an annual lens, it's probably about one to two points is how we're thinking about it currently, and then we don't -- we're not quantifying Evergreen//One specifically at this point in time, Jason.\nJason Ader: Okay. Thanks.\nPaul Ziots: Thank you, Jason. Next question, please.\nOperator: We'll go next now to Mehdi Hosseini at Susquehanna.\nMehdi Hosseini: Yes. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to better understand the dynamics of the folks that you're talking to decision makers at the customer side and how is that changing. And I'm asking you, because I'm looking at your OpEx that is on-track to grow in the low-teen versus revenue growth target of mid to high-single digit.\nCharlie Giancarlo: Yeah. Regarding the type of customer environment the new positioning. the new messaging, we're talking about is definitely getting us into the C-Suite, increasingly, and it's both, that message is made-up of several parts, one is an extremely consistent environment, that first of all can take care of all of their storage needs and the same with the same environment, therefore, lowering their total operating costs. The dramatically lower power space and cooling that both lowers costs but it improves their ESG their own ESG ratings, which is extremely important. And then also as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the ability now to be able to rise above just individual arrays attached to individual use cases and enable customers to create an environment where they can have consistent storage pools across their entire enterprise, multiple data centers, multiple clouds. This is really a new message, it's one that addresses the concerns of CIOs of CTOs, even business units and developers. So this is getting us certainly a higher level attention in major accounts.\nPaul Ziots: Thank you, Mehdi. Next question, please.\nOperator: Next now to David Vogt at UBS.\nDavid Vogt: Great. Thanks, guys. So Kevan and Giancarlo. I just want to go back to the current demand environment and the macro. You touched on the challenging macro backdrop and FlashBlade//E was a really strong launch during the quarter. Just curious about what did you see from customers, was there any sort of potential spin down, where it did make sense to maybe use more lower-cost all-flash solution in the quarter. At the expense of maybe a little bit more performance solutions in addition to maybe disk replacement. And then how do you think about that sort of dynamic, as we move through the balance of the year. It doesn't sound like the macro is getting dramatically better, and so should we expect to see, obviously on the Blade E side and then ultimately on the Array E side, sort of be a key growth driver in the second half of the year? Thanks\nCharlie Giancarlo: Yeah. We haven't really seen that type of what do you call-it a spin down or cannibalization. We track this very-very closely, as you might imagine when we bring in a lower-price performance product to see if customers are trading down. We really don't see that, it really did open up net-new opportunity for us to go into go into new areas. I think we were at a better economic environment. All of these numbers would be would be enhanced, but no. I think it's just the. We'd all love to see even stronger growth than what we're seeing now and of course we're pedaling very hard to drive more performance out-of-the team overall but the economic effect has been broad-based. And, I would say if anything, when you have an economy that started-off the year the way it did customers reduce their intention to spend and they have their high-priority projects and because we announced the disk to flash transition after the beginning of the year. I think if anything it's muted and will be increased next year as customers start to plan for it, you know in there in their budgets. So, no, I think it's more of an economy than anything else.\nDavid Vogt: Great. Thank you.\nPaul Ziots: Next question, please.\nOperator: Next now to Thomas Blakey at KeyBanc.\nTom Blakey: Hey, guys. Thank you for taking my question. I just wanted to circle back to the subscription service line, and from a puts-and-takes perspective Evergreen//One doing great, off to a great start. Just what maybe focus on the other areas that maybe you're experiencing some pressure, specifically want to know it's like maybe there is just understanding how you relatively start smaller and grow with your customers, if there's any pent-up demand that you can see there heading into next year from that, for many pressures in the other areas of the Evergreen products. Thank you.\nKevan Krysler: Yes. I know this is Kevan and I'll start-off and then have Charlie add-on any more commentary, but it's a good question. And again, we commented on the strength of our subscription ARR, which really has been driven and fueled by our Evergreen//One subscription offering. Now, obviously, with demand being a bit lower on the CapEx side, the attach of Evergreen subscriptions, whether that's forever or foundation, is impacting somewhat our subscription ARR growth rate, which I've talked about a little bit earlier. Now if we look at -- and really that's the only thing going on that. I would highlight, in particular. If you're looking specifically at our subscription revenue growth rate. Do you want to let you know, we've got professional services in that line-item as well. And obviously, that's not growing at the same pace as our subscription offerings. And so, that would be driving your difference that you might be noting.\nPaul Ziots: Thank you, Tom. Next question, please.\nOperator: We go next now, to Simon Leopold at Raymond James.\nSimon Leopold: Great. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to see if we could maybe step-back and help us size the AI opportunity, as to sort of where it is now and where it's going? I think in the past you've talked about sort of where FlashBlade is and that maybe AI use cases, not just generative we're probably more than half of those use cases. You've given us some customer metrics, wonder if we could get some revenue metrics as well, even a ballpark. Thank you.\nCharlie Giancarlo: Yeah. We don't, you know Simon, we don't generally like to break these things out. I would say though that AI is a significant contributor to our revenue. It's not an -- it's not a dominant one, nor frankly do I expect it to be. It's a very exciting new area without a doubt. And we expect to see growth, growth in that, but plain old -- plain old data storage, both for high-performance databases, as well as for lower performance bulk data, will continue to dominate our market. What is exciting about the AI environment is high-performance systems generally are high-profit system environments, which is good and we do hopefully anticipate like the Meta RSE, that we might see environments where the scale of it really starts to grow. But I would say still -- and I think this is true for everyone except for the GPU builders, while it's an exciting new area. It's probably going to be a small, let's say low-double-digit portion of their overall revenues in general revenue.\nPaul Ziots: Thank you, Simon. Next question, please.\nOperator: We go next now to Nehal Chokshi at Northland Capital Markets. And Nehal your line is open, if you do have a question.\nNehal Chokshi: Yes. Thank you. Hey. Thank you for the question and I really like the new presentation content format, it's really great, thank you for that. So, FlashBlade//E, it sounds like you've had better-expected revenue and pipeline with respect to pipeline, are you assuming a lower conversion rate of that pipeline, for the remainder of this fiscal year, that's more or less driving the -- no change in forward guidance here?\nCharlie Giancarlo: Yeah, Nehal. It's a great question and the answer would be no. Our conversion rate, especially for FlashBlade//E is quite healthy. And we considered that in our overall annual revenue guide, that we provided. The other thing to highlight as well as and we've highlighted that in my prepared remarks, is the strength of Evergreen//One, which needs to be considered as well, because obviously that takes more time to make its way to revenue. And that's been considered as well as we've looked at our overall annual guide for this year. So hopefully that's helpful for you.\nPaul Ziots: Thank you, Nehal. Next question, please.\nOperator: We go next now to Matt Sheerin at Stifel.\nMatt Sheerin: Yes. Thanks. My question is on the recent Azure VMware announcement. Could you help us understand the significance of that, in terms of your position with Microsoft, within that, the Azure ecosystem, how that positions you versus competitors in the cloud and how we should think about the product roadmap going-forward?\nCharlie Giancarlo: Yeah. We consider it to be a very significant announcement. It is a combination of VMware in the cloud Azure VM services, VMware services as well as our Cloud Block Store, providing a simpler methodology for customers to move their existing workloads into the cloud. And also at the same time, dramatically reducing their overall cloud costs. So it's really a one-two punch that's hard to beat. We consider the relationship with Microsoft, very strong and continuing. We're looking-forward to doing more things with them as we, as we go-forward and I think this is going to be a very competitive offering in the market. Rob?\nRob Lee: Yeah. No, I mean I would just add-on to that Charlie said, I think one of the things that really makes us unique is the integration that we've undertaken with in partnership with the Azure team really over the last year-plus to bring this service to-market. We have had a number of Cloud Block Store customers that have really been, pushing both of us in this direction and have been part of early previews and beta activities. And they're very excited now to be able to move into production. And look, overall, we just see this as a continued validation of the benefit that customers are seeing from the Cloud Block Store technology, and reducing their cloud costs. And really, giving them a much better environment on the cloud. Infrastructure to run their production workloads. As we mentioned last quarter, we had our largest individual sale, in the quarter, of cloud blocks to a large healthcare organization that organization is now moving into production and frankly it's seeing, even better-than-expected cost reductions and savings, as a result of that. And so overall, we see this is just continued validation of the great technology, the ability to go drive meaningful savings for customers. And then now in partnership with Azure, tightly integrated to a very-very important use-case for our customers.\nPaul Ziots: Thank you, Matt. It looks like we have time for one more question. And I'm happy to say we have a person who's rejoined the queue. So this will be second step back. So our last question.\nOperator: We will take that now from Mehdi Hosseini.\nMehdi Hosseini: Yes, sir. Thanks for opportunity. I want to go back to my original question. And as you're engaged more of C level executives. Obviously, opportunities are reflected in your subscription, is there another metric that we could track and to better understand your longer-term revenue growth, because you're spending -- your OpEx growth is much higher than this year's fiscal year revenue growth, but obviously it helps in sustainability of revenue growth. And I'm just wondering if there's any other metric that we can look at to better measure your longer-term revenue growth?\nKevan Krysler: Nothing specific that Mehdi , I would point you to that other than the rich amount of in our portfolio and the opportunity associated with that portfolio across our entire data storage platform. So obviously navigating through this year, I provided a guide for this year and as we navigate through the second-half we will be looking at next year as well.\nPaul Ziots: Thank you, Mehdi, before we conclude. I think Charlie has some final comments.\nCharlie Giancarlo: Thank you. Customers appreciate our new capabilities and the positioning as I had mentioned, the only consistent, consolidated, data storage and management platform for all of their data storage needs. I want to thank our customers and partners, suppliers, employees and investors, your collaboration, your innovation, your hard work and your trust, propel us forward. So we look-forward to meeting you around the world. We have a number of accelerate roadshows set-up in various major cities around the world. We look-forward to seeing you all there. Thank you.\nOperator: That concludes the Pure Storage second quarter fiscal year 2024 earnings conference call. Thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.",

            "name": "Rob Lee",
            "content": "Yeah. Absolutely, Amit. This is Rob just to jump into the second part of your question. Look, I think it's important to realize that E really has no equivalent on the market. E as Charlie mentioned is really enabled by our highly differentiated Purity software and direct flash technology that's designed for that software, which really sets us far apart not only from disk, which is largely the displacement market we're going after, but also any of the competitive set that might try to follow us with SSD based technology. And as Charlie mentioned, we started using this technology, leveraging and bringing -- using it to bring QLC into the enterprise over three years ago with FlashArray C, at a time to displace a hybrid disk-based systems and then now with E, with both FlashBlade//E and FlashArray//E joining later this year, I really see a complete portfolio to go after the entirety of a customers' data storage needs. And again, as Charlie said, being able to do that and offer it with a very consistent, hardware, software and management approach. And Meta, just to jump-in here. I think part of your question had to do with building comfort with customers around the transition. Look I think it's important to realize that the transition from hard disk to the flash we're offering with E, is completely seamless. All right. An other way to look at it is, there are basically no reasons that our customer says, hey, I would like to get disk. I would like to keep disk, there really no puts and takes. The only reason that customers have held onto disk in a lot of these environments, historically, has been price. And then now with our technology with what we've been able to do with E, we have effectively neutralized that. And so, I think. I think that's something that perhaps goes less appreciated. And I think we'll use that transition, because it's not a re-architecture, it's not a redesign. It really is, just a seamless and really instantaneous improvement on all dimensions. Yeah. No, Wamsi, I think. Sorry, Chris. A couple of things. Look, I think if we step back from the application sets we're seeing AI technology being applied to today and we look at the long-term drivers.

            "name": "Charlie Giancarlo",
            "content": "Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Pure Storage's Q2 conference call. We are pleased with our financial results this quarter. While the macro environment continued to be challenging, we outpaced our competitors and saw a strong growth in our strategic investments, particularly in FlashBlade//S, FlashBlade//E, and Evergreen//One. Our results demonstrate that we continue to lead our market and that our strategy is working. Pure is delivering extraordinary outcomes for our customers, by transforming data storage, from a highly fragmented solution set to a single consistent platform. Pure is today, the first and only data storage company that can deliver a single, consistent, non-disruptive, operating and management environment, leveraging the most advanced flash technology, across all of data storage needs. With the introduction of the E family, our all-flash products now stand from the highest performance systems to the most cost effective systems for bulk data. Uniquely in our industry, all of Pure's products are based on one operating system, Purity, the only storage software that operates natively, direct to flash rather than using less efficient commodity SSDs. All of Pure's products are managed with our Pure One management system, and have consistent APIs. All of our products support non-disruptive upgrades forever. Through our Evergreen technology and subscription programs and are all available to consume as a service through Evergreen//One. The data storage industry has for decades been plagued with different tailored software and hardware solutions for the wide range of the storage protocols, formats, performance levels and price points needed to cover the market. The storage portfolio of legacy data storage providers was generally assembled by acquisition and are collections of disparate inconsistent environments. That approach left customers with a complex infrastructure, with multiple software operating environments, with different management systems and multiple differing operational processes. As a result, legacy storage environments are complex, they vary for each use-case, they require downtime for upgrades and require forklift replacements roughly every five years. Pure is the only company that provides customers a single, consolidated operating environment for all of their data storage needs, including block, file and objects. Q2 was the first full quarter of shipments for FlashBlade//E, sales and pipeline have exceeded our expectations and it is experiencing the fastest growth of all prior new product releases. At purchase FlashBlade//E with three years of Evergreen subscription has an acquisition cost competitive with hard disk based systems and has substantially lower operating costs. It enables our customers to move ever more of their cost sensitive workloads, to all flash. The E-family of products allows Pure to now cover the entire spectrum of data storage, inclusive of low priced bulk storage, providing customers with a consistent, modern and reliable product line for all their storage needs. Flash-array E will become available later this year, joining FlashBlade//E. FlashArray//E will enable cost effective storage for bulk data or capacities from one to four petabytes. And as part of the E family, it can also reduce customers' total operational costs, by up to 60% and produce 85% less e-waste, compared to hard disk based system. We are seeing continued momentum and opening new opportunities with our cloud strategy. Last week, we announced an expanded multi-year partnership with Microsoft Azure services and its Azure VMware solution known as ADS, using our Pure Cloud Block Store. This offers a new age of cloud migration that can drive faster, more cost effective adoption of cloud services. Combining Pure's industry leading data reduction, with our ability to decouple storage needs from compute, customers can significantly reduce their total cloud costs, while increasing hybrid cloud capabilities. In addition to operating in the cloud, our cloud operating model allows our customers to operate their storage environment like the cloud to offer services like the cloud, to better build for the cloud and also to consume storage like the cloud. Pure Fusion enables our customers to manage the Pure portfolio as a fleet, as an integrated pool of storage across datacenters and across clouds. Pure Fusion allows customers to offer their developers access to bespoke data services through APIs. Portworx, the most highly rated Kubernetes data platform for deploying cloud native applications was chosen for the fourth consecutive year, by analysts from GigaOm as the leader for enterprise Kubernetes data storage, and cloud native Kubernetes data storage. Evergreen//One, allows our customers to also consume like the cloud, based entirely on a service level agreement with Pure to allow them to store their data, whenever and wherever they want. Evergreen//One is available for all of Pure's product offerings. The growth of subscription services contributed significantly to our success in Q2.. Evergreen//One, the industry's leading storage as a service offering saw sales double again year-over-year. Our Evergreen technology and programs revolutionized the industry and provide Pure a sustainable competitive advantage ending traditional legacy hardware replacement practices customers and turning every sale into a storage as a service relationship. With our Evergreen forever subscription, company's upgrade both hardware and software to the latest technology, without paying additional capital continually without downtime forever. As we discussed last quarter, Generative AI and ChatGPT have brought artificial intelligence to the top of mind for all customers. And AI creates two sets of opportunities for Pure. First, we can supply products for AI training environments, such as the creation of large language models or LLMs short. And second, we can support enterprises to prepare their data architecture for AI inference, meaning the use of LLM's on their own data. Most customers will leverage third-party LLM's their base. They will return and retrain these models on their proprietary data within their own organizational boundaries. By adding guard rails they will enable AI inference to achieve outcomes specific to their business. The former requires very high performance, while the latter is enhanced with the replacement of low performance secondary hard disk systems with our E family of cost-effective flash storage. During the quarter, FlashBlade//S one a Generative AI footprint in a production environment in the low eight digits. Portworx also saw multiple wins in early AI development environments. Customers purchased Portworx to ensure reliable data management during the training and inference process. Over the last five years, well over a 100 customers have chosen FlashBlade to accelerate their AI and machine learning environments. With the introduction of FlashBlade//E, AI customers are able to take advantage of a single operating and management environment for both their hot and their bulk data, dramatically simplifying their data storage infrastructure and reducing its cost and environmental footprints. For the last few months, I have visited customers, partners and resellers across the US, Asia-Pacific and Europe to highlight Pure's new ever more powerful position. Customers immediately grasped the benefits of and the need for a unified operating and management environment for all of their data storage needs, blocks, file and object. From the highest performance to the most cost-effective. They responded enthusiastically to the ability to operate their storage and data environment, as consistent storage pools, across datacenters and clouds. And they welcomed the advantages of our Evergreen technology and subscription available across our entire data storage platform. Pure's products uniquely stand out in the industry, due to our single operating environment and consistent APIs across our products. This is powered by our consistent use of Purity and our Pure one management system across all our products. Our new E family of products leverage our latest direct to flash capabilities of Purity software to unlock the most cost effective QLC flash to penetrate the bulk data market for the first time with all flash technology. Our high density direct flash modules or DFM's, work with Purity to power this event. This enables better performance, better longevity, better reliability and ultimately better price performance than both hard disks and even SSD based systems. We have been shipping 48 terabyte DFMs for the last three years and we will introduce our 75 terabyte DFM later this year. Today, Pure's DFM's are 2 to 4 times denser than the largest hard disk and SSDs in competitive use and our advantage and density is accelerating. Our roadmap calls for a 150 terabyte DFM next year and a 300 terabyte DFM by 2026. Our improvements in performance and density of direct flash versus commodity products will enable us to increase our competitiveness in the industry by a wide margin not only in performance and cost but also in energy efficiency and e-waste reduction. Speaking of energy and e-waste we issued our second ESG report last week. It details the advancements we continue to make across our technology portfolio, operations and people. Our largest area of contribution continues to be the extraordinary energy e-waste and space savings of our products, which enable our customers to achieve their environmental sustainability goals. Pure products can reduce the total energy and emissions from data centers globally, by upwards of 20% as Pure's flash optimized systems use up to 5 times less power than competitive SSD based systems up to 10 times less power than the hard disk systems we will replace. In closing, I have never been more confident in our long-term growth strategy, or in our opportunity to lead this market. I'll now turn the call over to Kevin Krysler. Kevin? Absolutely. Thanks, Amit. Well, I just as a reminder to the audience. We launched FlashBlade about five or six years ago now. And then more recently, a little over a year-ago updated it with what we call our FlashBlade//S program, which shares our direct flash modules with our FlashArray series, as well as more recently just last Q1, our FlashBlade//E product. FlashBlade//S addresses the high performance end the market and FlashBlade//E, as I mentioned in my script actually addresses the high capacity but bulk data, lower cost market overall. To answer your question directly, I believe the greater focus around AI certainly helps in FlashBlade sales, but frankly FlashBlade has continued to grow, especially since the introduction of FlashBlade//S, which gave it even greater compatibility with our FlashArray series, ever since we introduced that product. And now that we've introduced the E, it really allows customers to look at the full range of price performance for their high capacity workloads with one consistent platform. And, I think completing, if you will, the family with E, has really helped FlashBlade sales overall. You bet. So the eight-figure deal was nice as I said low eight-figure deal, but in a production environment that has opportunity for expansion. So very excited and it was that, the largest Gen AI deal of it -- of its type, which is why we wanted to highlight it not be not be only AI deal that we did in the quarter, but just because of its scale is something we wanted to highlight. I would also say that, it's an area that where we are seeing additional interest overall in the market. That being said, as I said last quarter, I'm just excited by the opportunity to upgrade customers' existing data environment, to the lower performance environment, because of the needs of wanting to use that data for AI inference in the future. So I'm seeing both of those opportunities in front of us. Separately, with respect to the Meta RSC which we've commented on the past, because when new shipments happened into that tends to have an effect on our overall P&L. Yeah, as I've stated in the past we have there's really no change from prior quarters. It continues to be an environment that Meta is happy with, our relationship with them is very good. There are no change as far as we know of their plans to expand in the future. In other words, that's still our expectation, but we don't know the exact timing. Yes. Its included in our revenue. Yes. Thank you, Paul. So, I can answer the first part of that question in a number of different ways. First of all, I believe that customers have already experienced the disk to flash benefits when they went with their primary storage from disk to flash and what they found was smaller footprints, higher reliability, less maintenance, less effort, overall, especially when they move to Pure flash. And so they already recognized that as a positive effect. And so, when we can now go in at these lower-price points, lower priced performance levels, they get very excited about it. But as I had mentioned in my prepared remarks, what gets them even more excited is consolidating their overall environment to a more consistent hardware, software environment, because it reduces the complexity and their overall IT datacenter reduces their complexity, when they want to move to the cloud, just reduces complexity generally. So it's not -- E is interesting, not just in the -- just in the flash transition, but in the ability of customers to move to a more consistent portfolio overall. Yeah. Thanks, Pinjalim. Well, first of all, it's both influence and training. And as you might imagine, a lot of these new developments are being made in container based and Kubernetes based environments. And Portworx is without equal, in terms of its ability to manage storage of all types, for Kubernetes and containers and to do it both -- can do it on bare metal could do it in the cloud can do it on-top of our infrastructure. And so, these are very large environments. Portworx has always been really superior, when it gets too large scale production and so before going into a development where the developers know it's going to go large scale when they when they scale out, they're starting off with Portworx for their stateful data management. It's an interesting question. I would say that we do see opportunities on-prem for AI in -- I would say, highly specialized environments. And so, I think that is a real thing, of course, many of them are waiting for delivery of GPU and AI based processing systems and environments. And I would say that a lot of focus has been on the -- are currently on the compute side of it, a little bit less focus by the customers, because they've been so focused on the compute side, a little less focused on the storage infrastructure. I believe that's just starting to become a better known and understood requirement for these AI systems. But I'd say that, I just -- I would disagree, Wamsi, I'd say that we do, we are starting to see interest. If not yet deployments on-prem. Absolutely. I would say that, a lot of the -- a lot of the AI environments use block because it's very straightforward. Especially with programmers and block can be utilized for any structure that you want underneath, but increasingly, it's moving to an object based environment, because over time block is easier. It's more efficient and it's less, it requires less state the -- than what's generally necessary in a block environment. So, I think we're starting to see that shift, but it's been taking a lot of time to get to very high performance object. Rob do you want to add? All right. I appreciate the question and it's a real simple answer. You're exactly right, it's due to the Evergreen//One acceleration and just timing of billings is really what it comes down to. Yeah. Let me let me start. It -- first of all it is are exceeding our expectations, both in terms of the revenue that we saw in our first full quarter of shipments, as well as in the pipeline growth, which continues at unprecedented rates very-very fast. The conversations are, first of all, they are happening all-around the world, they are happening across a very broad set of use cases. And in some cases at prices higher than what the customer would be paying for new disk environments, because of the lower total operating cost, that they are able to get, and the better performance that they're able to get-out of the all-flash E environment. So, and I would say that it's really. I have yet to hear of a use-case around for an existing disk based system that flash FlashBlade//E was not able to address. Yeah. It's a great question and Evergreen//One performances is simply been terrific. In the first half and we're expecting that momentum to continue. And you're right, there is a short-term headwind on revenue, as a result of revenue being recognized over-time. And when we think about it from an annual lens, it's probably about one to two points is how we're thinking about it currently, and then we don't -- we're not quantifying Evergreen//One specifically at this point in time, Jason. Yeah. Regarding the type of customer environment the new positioning. the new messaging, we're talking about is definitely getting us into the C-Suite, increasingly, and it's both, that message is made-up of several parts, one is an extremely consistent environment, that first of all can take care of all of their storage needs and the same with the same environment, therefore, lowering their total operating costs. The dramatically lower power space and cooling that both lowers costs but it improves their ESG their own ESG ratings, which is extremely important. And then also as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the ability now to be able to rise above just individual arrays attached to individual use cases and enable customers to create an environment where they can have consistent storage pools across their entire enterprise, multiple data centers, multiple clouds. This is really a new message, it's one that addresses the concerns of CIOs of CTOs, even business units and developers. So this is getting us certainly a higher level attention in major accounts. Yeah. We haven't really seen that type of what do you call-it a spin down or cannibalization. We track this very-very closely, as you might imagine when we bring in a lower-price performance product to see if customers are trading down. We really don't see that, it really did open up net-new opportunity for us to go into go into new areas. I think we were at a better economic environment. All of these numbers would be would be enhanced, but no. I think it's just the. We'd all love to see even stronger growth than what we're seeing now and of course we're pedaling very hard to drive more performance out-of-the team overall but the economic effect has been broad-based. And, I would say if anything, when you have an economy that started-off the year the way it did customers reduce their intention to spend and they have their high-priority projects and because we announced the disk to flash transition after the beginning of the year. I think if anything it's muted and will be increased next year as customers start to plan for it, you know in there in their budgets. So, no, I think it's more of an economy than anything else. Yeah. We don't, you know Simon, we don't generally like to break these things out. I would say though that AI is a significant contributor to our revenue. It's not an -- it's not a dominant one, nor frankly do I expect it to be. It's a very exciting new area without a doubt. And we expect to see growth, growth in that, but plain old -- plain old data storage, both for high-performance databases, as well as for lower performance bulk data, will continue to dominate our market. What is exciting about the AI environment is high-performance systems generally are high-profit system environments, which is good and we do hopefully anticipate like the Meta RSE, that we might see environments where the scale of it really starts to grow. But I would say still -- and I think this is true for everyone except for the GPU builders, while it's an exciting new area. It's probably going to be a small, let's say low-double-digit portion of their overall revenues in general revenue. Yeah, Nehal. It's a great question and the answer would be no. Our conversion rate, especially for FlashBlade//E is quite healthy. And we considered that in our overall annual revenue guide, that we provided. The other thing to highlight as well as and we've highlighted that in my prepared remarks, is the strength of Evergreen//One, which needs to be considered as well, because obviously that takes more time to make its way to revenue. And that's been considered as well as we've looked at our overall annual guide for this year. So hopefully that's helpful for you. Yeah. We consider it to be a very significant announcement. It is a combination of VMware in the cloud Azure VM services, VMware services as well as our Cloud Block Store, providing a simpler methodology for customers to move their existing workloads into the cloud. And also at the same time, dramatically reducing their overall cloud costs. So it's really a one-two punch that's hard to beat. We consider the relationship with Microsoft, very strong and continuing. We're looking-forward to doing more things with them as we, as we go-forward and I think this is going to be a very competitive offering in the market. Rob? Thank you. Customers appreciate our new capabilities and the positioning as I had mentioned, the only consistent, consolidated, data storage and management platform for all of their data storage needs. I want to thank our customers and partners, suppliers, employees and investors, your collaboration, your innovation, your hard work and your trust, propel us forward. So we look-forward to meeting you around the world. We have a number of accelerate roadshows set-up in various major cities around the world. We look-forward to seeing you all there. Thank you."

            "content": "Thank you, Charlie. Revenue of $689 million in Q2 grew 6.5% year-over-year and exceeded our revenue guidance. We achieved record sales of our entire FlashBlade portfolio including FlashBlade//E in saw continued high demand for our Evergreen//One subscription services, as sales more than doubled year-over-year. While the spending environment remains relatively consistent to what we have seen over the last couple of quarters, our customers are choosing to invest in our high technology data storage solutions for their key, strategic projects. As we have seen with the sales performance of both our FlashBlade and Evergreen//One offerings this quarter. Momentum we saw across our entire FlashBlade portfolio included specific AI and ML use cases, including a significant Generative AI win that Charlie highlighted. We are excited with the historic ramp for both sales and pipeline of FlashBlade//E throughout the quarter. Customers no longer need to settle for hard-disk systems and can now choose Pure's higher performance flash solutions at competitive price points. Q2 operating profit of nearly $112 million exceeded expectations, due to the performance of our products and subscription gross margins. Our unique Purity security software architecture working directly with raw flash rather than less efficient and shorter lived SSDs contributed to the strength and product gross margins. Leveraging our Purity software, the majority of the capacity we now ship is based on QLC raw flash. More aggressive discounting behavior from our competitors, during the quarter, slightly offset product gross margin expansion. In Q2, subscription services annual recurring revenue grew 27% year-over-year to $1.2 billion and included strong growth from our Evergreen//One storage as a service offering. Close to Evergreen//One contracts where the effective service date has not yet started are excluded from the subscription ARR calculation. Subscription ARR growth would have been 28% when considering closed Evergreen//One contracts, where the service date has not yet started. Remaining performance obligations or RPO grew 26% to $1.9 billion. Similar to the remarks we've made in previous quarters, our RPO previously included an outstanding commitment with one of our global system integrators. During Q1, this remaining outstanding commitment was fully satisfied and when excluding the impact of the past outstanding commitment RPO grew 30% year-over-year. Subscription services revenue of $289 million comprised 42% of total revenue, which is 6 points higher than Q2 last year. U.S. revenue for Q2 was $495 million and international revenue was $194 million. We acquired 325 new customers during the quarter and our total customer count now exceeds 12,000. As previously mentioned, we were pleased with our continued strong gross margin performance of 72.8%, with product gross margin of 71.5%, and subscription services gross margin of 74.5%. Our head count increased slightly to approximately 5,400 employees at the end of the quarter. Pure's balance sheet and liquidity remains very strong, including $1.2 billion in cash and investments at the end of Q2. Cash flow from operations during the quarter was $102 million and capital expenditures totaled $55 million. In Q2, we repurchased nearly 600,000 shares of stock returning nearly $22 million to our shareholders. This represents a lower level of repurchase activity than recent quarters, as a result of the fixed trading parameters that were in-place throughout the quarter. We have approximately $190 million remaining on our existing $215 million repurchase authorization. Now turning to guidance. We expect Q3 revenue to be $760 million, representing double-digit growth of over 12% year-over-year. Our Q3 revenue guidance assumes continued strong subscription revenue growth fueled by our Evergreen//One subscription services. We continue to execute on aligning our cost structure with expected demand. The results of our continued operational discipline and the economic benefits we are seeing with our unique architecture of Purity software working directly with flash is reflected in our Q3 operating profit guide of $135 million, or 17.8% operating margin. Our annual revenue guidance we previously communicated remains unchanged and assumes revenue growth in the mid to high-single digits, as we expect significantly stronger year-over-year revenue growth for the second half of FY '24. As a reminder, revenue for our Evergreen//One subscription service offering is recurring and is recognized over time. The sales strength of our Evergreen//One offering through the first half of the year has outperformed our expectations and this momentum is expected to continue throughout the remainder of the year. The success of our sales of Evergreen//One subscription services, has been considered in our annual revenue guidance as the growth of this offering creates a near term headwind to the total revenue growth rate, as revenue is recognized over time. We also continue to assume no significant improvement or worsening of macroeconomic conditions from what we have seen over the last few quarters. Finally, we are increasing our annual operating margin guidance from 15% to 15.5%, driven by our continued operational discipline, as well as the benefits we are seeing as a result of our unmatched flash management technology, powered by Purity software. In closing, treating data storage and management as high technology as demonstrated through our continuous innovation across our portfolio and business models, we have established an extraordinary advantage in reducing power consumption, real estate space, labor and e-waste for our customers. Our business value and total cost of ownership advantages are unmatched against our competitors. With that, I will turn it back to Paul for Q&A. And let me just touch on that last question on order to ship time for FlashBlade//E, consistent with what we see across our portfolio. So no significant difference there. And Pinjalim just to just to add-on to that. I look at the Portworx and cloud native piece of this puzzle is, really a part of the overall set of environments that we see as being impacted by the uptake of AI technology, positively impacted. And so, certainly, number one, AI training infrastructure and environments, we've talked to you a lot about that. Number two, is really the demand to store more and more data in the enterprise, remove the silos and really move more of that cold data into the warm. And then as Charlie says, number three, looking at the application environments that the trend AI models are connected to. If you look at, where a lot of that data is coming into enterprises, it's coming from multiple sources, it is coming from business data, databases, IoT sensors, machine data all over the place. A lot of these applications sets environments, very highly dynamic, very aligned to open source, cloud native technologies. It's also important to realize that, getting these training -- trained AI models deployed and connected to real time systems is ultimately the goal for a lot of these enterprises. And so, when you look at the application environments driving these real time systems that folks want to plug, chat bots or what have you into, again, all very heavily based on and built on cloud-native architectures, open source software and they have the needs for agility, scalability elasticity, that those architectures afford, while at the same time, having the enterprise capabilities that technologies like Portworx can offer. And really that's what we're seeing out there today. And Wamsi, let me touch on the subscription ARR growth definitely pleased with what we saw in terms of subscription ARR growth especially Evergreen//One, which is outperforming our already strong expectations that we had at the beginning of year. And as a reminder, in my prepared remarks, closed Evergreen//One contracts, where the effective service date has not yet started, are excluded from the ARR calculation. And our subscription ARR growth would have been 28% had we included those contracts, where the service date had not begun. And look, is it just, as a result of product revenue being lower for our CapEx sales. We do have less attach of our Evergreen subscription, which is also reflected in our subscription ARR growth rate. Yes. I know this is Kevan and I'll start-off and then have Charlie add-on any more commentary, but it's a good question. And again, we commented on the strength of our subscription ARR, which really has been driven and fueled by our Evergreen//One subscription offering. Now, obviously, with demand being a bit lower on the CapEx side, the attach of Evergreen subscriptions, whether that's forever or foundation, is impacting somewhat our subscription ARR growth rate, which I've talked about a little bit earlier. Now if we look at -- and really that's the only thing going on that. I would highlight, in particular. If you're looking specifically at our subscription revenue growth rate. Do you want to let you know, we've got professional services in that line-item as well. And obviously, that's not growing at the same pace as our subscription offerings. And so, that would be driving your difference that you might be noting. Nothing specific that Mehdi , I would point you to that other than the rich amount of in our portfolio and the opportunity associated with that portfolio across our entire data storage platform. So obviously navigating through this year, I provided a guide for this year and as we navigate through the second-half we will be looking at next year as well."

With that, I'll turn it over to Charlie.\nCharlie Giancarlo: Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our Q1 FY '24 earnings call. Thank you for joining us today. We were pleased with our Q1 performance in what continues overall to be a challenging IT environment. Highlights for the quarter include the highest all-time sales for Evergreen//One, our first sales of FlashBlade//E, which is experiencing the fastest first quarter pipeline growth for any new pure product. Our largest single order since inception of almost 8 digits for our Cloud Block store product and the release of a major upgrade to our FlashArray unified block and file software. We are especially pleased with the customer response to our E product line. The E line is the first and only all-flash storage system that can address the secondary storage market, at competitive prices to 7,200 RPM hard disk systems, but with only 1/10 the power, space, cooling and labor requirements. As I've stated in the past, the days of hard disks are coming to an end. We predict that there will be no new hard disks sold in 5 years. But beyond the benefits of the E product line itself, it enables Pure to now compete for our customers' entire storage environment. It enables Pure for the first time to be our customers' complete storage partner. Something that our customers have been asking for, for years. The operational and economic benefits of Pure's comprehensive storage portfolio are clear and overwhelming and are based on sustainable technology and business model advantages. In March, we gathered our sales team for our annual sales kickoff, an event we had not held in person since 2020. Everyone was energized by both the event and the training we conducted there. This ongoing training focuses on honing sales skills with our expansion into the secondary storage market, advancing our as-a-service offerings and selling in today's environment of constrained IT spending. This valuable training is already bearing fruit and enabling us to reach new customers, better support the needs of current customers and reduced sales cycles, which have lengthened in this economic environment. It's clear that our continued innovation strongly resonates with our customers, whether it is for AI/machine learning, rapid recovery from ransomware, high-performance databases, electronic design automation and video editing traditional or cloud-native applications and now also for secondary storage environments such as content and media stores, enterprise imaging and even traditional backup and archive. We deliver unique outcomes that are highly valuable to our customers in every environment. Compared to our all-flash competitors, we are 10x more reliable. We are 2X to 5X more power and space efficient, and we require 5 to 10x less manual labor to operate, resulting overall in at least 50% lower total cost of ownership. Also, our products never become obsolete and never require forklift upgrades because our Evergreen program provides continual hardware and software upgrades nondisruptively, to the customer's application environment forever. Products we sold 10 years ago are not only still in service, but have been continually modernized to our latest models without disruption or additional customer expense with our Evergreen subscription. These capabilities are based upon 4 unique and sustainable competitive advantages. One, our purity software uniquely works directly with raw flash, while other competitors use more expensive, less efficient and shorter-lived SSDs; two, Pure's highly consolidated product line consisting of our common operating system, Purity and 1 management system Pure1, operating on both a scale-up and the scale-out platform utilizing common direct flash modules, while competitors require many disparate software and hardware platforms to cover the same breadth of use cases; three, Pure's unique Evergreen technology and services, which guarantee that deployed products never become obsolete, never need to be replaced and enable nondisruptive upgrades. And four, Pure's cloud operating model, which enables customers to operate their storage the way that cloud customers operate theirs, highly automated, orchestrated and available as-a-service. As we expected, Evergreen//One is thriving in this economic environment. Sales of Evergreen//One more than year-over-year. As a reminder, Evergreen//One is Pure's Storage as a Service offering that enables customers to access storage entirely through service level agreements with no capital expenditure only paying for capacity as they use it. Customers can place their data on-premise, on Pure-owned infrastructure or on AWS or Azure with Pure's Cloud Block Store. The customer only pays for what they use under a single contract for enterprise-class capabilities for less than what they pay for raw cloud storage. This past quarter, we saw the largest individual sale of Pure Cloud Block Store at almost 8 figures, a Fortune 500 health care organization purchased Cloud Block Store because of its ability to securely store data in the cloud with enterprise features, reduced management overhead and lower TCO. By using Cloud Block Store, the organization is able to significantly reduce their cloud storage spend while getting the most out of their data. Our extraordinary lead in driving power space, labor and e-waste reduction both on-prem and in the cloud has also garnered attention amid increased customer focus on the selection criteria. The continued strength of FlashArray//C and interest in FlashBlade//E speaks to our customers' demand for the TCO benefits of Pure all-flash products over competitive offerings now including both their flash and hard disk systems. In particular, FlashBlade//E consumes approximately 1/10 as much power and space as similar capacity hard disk systems that it replaces, requiring up to 1/10 the labor and generates less than 1/10 the e-waste. Only Pure's direct flash management and operational simplicity is able to deliver this operational performance. As I mentioned, Early interest in FlashBlade//E is off the charts for a new product. FlashBlade//E is the second in a series of products that can compete for the secondary tier and some lower tiers of the storage market entirely dominated today by hard disks. Prior to FlashArray//C and FlashBlade//E, all flash products were only price competitive for high-performance systems and therefore, Pure could only provide products for our customers' Tier 1 storage needs. With the introduction of our E product line, Pure can now compete for customers' entire storage estate, enabling Pure to become their complete storage partner for the first time. For years, customers have asked us for products that could address the remainder of their storage and space. I have now had many customer visits since our introduction of FlashBlade//E with senior IT executives describing our key advantages and our ability to provide flash solutions to their entire storage environment. A common question from these senior executives is why aren't we doing this already. In April, we announced a major update to our FlashArray unified block and file software, representing a significant expansion of our broader file strategy and portfolio. I'm proud to share that we're now able to address customers' file needs across high-performance, general-purpose NAS, VMware over NFS and dozens of other use cases, allowing us to compete for all of a customer's file storage as 8. Best of all, FlashArray customers can simply upgrade to the latest software to get these capabilities without any additional expense. This unified offering was a key component in the largest individual international market win in Pure history last quarter. Touching upon the most recent trends, generative AI and chatGPT has brought artificial intelligence to the top of mind in all of our major customers and has become a focal part of literally every earnings script this quarter. Pure saw the AI opportunity years ago and started innovating in this area with our introduction of FlashBlade in 2017 and then with our AI-ready infrastructure Aerie product co-developed with NVIDIA. We've continued to advance FlashBlade's high-performance parallel architecture, and Pure continues to be the go-to partner for storage on AI projects. For instance, we support more than 10 leading autonomous vehicle development companies in managing and processing the massive amounts of data required for their machine learning activity. In addition to our very successful position with Meta in their AI research supercluster or RSC, the largest AI supercomputer in the world. Pure is the chosen vendor for AI environments across a broad range of industries, including media and entertainment, pharma, health care, aerospace, transportation and financial services. We expect our leading role in AI to continue to expand, but we are equally excited that the requirements for Big Data will drive even more use of high-performance flash for traditional bulk data. As we mentioned last quarter, we expect the current macro environment to continue through this fiscal year, and we continue to operate the company with our usual diligence improving productivity and focusing investment on meaningful innovation and growth. Our as-a-service offerings, including Evergreen//One and Evergreen//Flex and our Pure financing vehicles provide customers with a wide range of economic alternatives to address their business needs. Pure's superior TCO and flexible Evergreen offerings are making a difference in this challenging IT economy. While we saw continuing caution by enterprise and cloud customers in Q1, similar to what we saw in Q4. We also experienced enhanced demand for our most cost-effective studies, especially Evergreen//One. Given all of our advantages, we remain confident that we will continue to increase our market share, outgrow our competitors and pick up even greater momentum, especially as our new products and services gain mind share. I am confident that we are gaining recognition with both customers and prospects that Pure is the company to trust for their future data storage architectures. We are years ahead of the competition in our ability to provide all storage needs with the most consistent, modern and efficient storage solutions. We enjoy a highly sustainable competitive advantage based on the only direct to flash operating system in Purity, a simple, consistent product line with common management, our Evergreen technology to continually upgrade our products nondisruptively to the third state of the art and our ability to provide our customers with a cloud operating model. our new capability to compete for the full range of enterprise storage needs gives us even greater relevance to our enterprise accounts and enables us to deliver a full and far more integrated storage solution to our customers. In closing, I am excited to share that in just a couple of weeks, we'll be hosting our Annual Accelerate User conference in Las Vegas. We're looking forward to seeing customers, partners and analysts from around the world to discuss the future of data storage and management. I'll now turn the call over to Kevan.\nKevan Krysler: Thank you, Charlie, and good afternoon, everyone. In Q1, we achieved revenue of $589 million and operating profit of nearly $20 million, exceeding our expectations. We also set an all-time record of Evergreen//One subscription sales this quarter as demand was exceptional. We were pleased that our U.S. enterprise business exceeded our expectations this quarter. Macro conditions continue to be challenging, consistent with what we saw in Q4. Against this macro backdrop, our sales force and leadership are actively monitoring deals to get ahead of challenges as well as continuing to focus conversations both on our business value and total cost of ownership advantages which are unmatched against our competitors. Our subscription services annual recurring revenue grew 29% year-over-year to $1.2 billion and subscription services revenue of $280 million represented 48% of total revenue. Remaining performance obligations, or RPO, grew 26% year-over-year to $1.8 billion. Similar to the remarks we've made in previous quarters, our RPO included an outstanding commitment with one of our global system integrators. During Q1, this remaining outstanding commitment was fully satisfied with Evergreen//One sales. When excluding the impact of the past outstanding commitment from our global system integrator, RPO grew 31%. Our headcount increased slightly to approximately 5,270 employees in Q1 and and we remain disciplined in managing our costs, including hiring. Incremental investments in headcount remains focused on quota-carrying sales capacity and critical business hires. As I previously mentioned, total revenue in Q1 was $589 million and product revenue was $309 million. As we noted in previous earnings calls, Q1 revenue last year included $60 million of product revenue that was contemplated in the second half of last year. Excluding this impact, Q1 total revenue grew approximately 5%. U.S. revenue for Q1 was $427 million, and international revenue was $162 million. We also acquired 276 new customers during the quarter. We were pleased with our continued strong gross margin performance in Q1 of 72.2% with product gross margins of 70.8% and subscription services gross margin of 73.7%. Q1 operating profit of nearly $20 million exceeded expectations and included higher year-over-year costs for salaries and our first sales kickoff event since 2020. Pure's balance sheet and liquidity remains very strong, including $1.2 billion in cash and investments. In April, we reduced our overall debt paying off $575 million in convertible notes using $475 million in cash and $100 million from our revolving line of credit. Cash flow from operations during the quarter was $173 million and capital expenditures totaled $51 million. In Q1, we repurchased 2.9 million shares of stock, returning nearly $70 million to our shareholders and have approximately $211 million remaining on our existing $250 million repurchase authorization. Now turning to guidance. We are reiterating our annual guidance for FY '24 with revenue growth in the mid- to high single digits and expect an operating margin of 15%. Our annual revenue guidance assumes that macro conditions will continue to be challenging and will be consistent with what we have seen over the last couple of quarters. We expect continued momentum of our Evergreen subscription services in particular, Evergreen//One. The strength of our Evergreen//One offering has been contemplated in our annual revenue guide as the recurring revenue for these services is recognized over time. Also, as Charlie mentioned, early customer response to FlashBlade//E, which became generally available in late April, has exceeded our expectations. Our FY '24 annual revenue guidance that we provided last quarter assumed a modest revenue ramp during the second half of the year from sales of FlashBlade//E. While we are very pleased with the early response to FlashBlade//E, our FY '24 revenue guidance continues to assume a modest revenue ramp during the second half of the year. Moving to Q2 guidance. We expect Q2 revenue of $680 million representing an increase of approximately 5% year-over-year. Our Q2 revenue guidance implies continued strong subscription revenue growth and a slight year-over-year decline in product revenue. We also expect Q2 operating profit of $90 million as we remain focused on profitable growth and ensuring we are appropriately aligning our cost structure with demand. In closing, through our innovation, our competitive advantages are clear and aligned to our customers' focus on both performance and cost. We are uniquely positioned to deliver significant business value while reducing our customers' total cost of ownership, including labor, energy and real estate. It's a pleasure to also invite you to join us for our product and technology-focused Financial Analyst Meeting at Accelerate on June 15, either in person at Las Vegas or virtually through our Investor Relations website. With that, I will turn it back to Paul for Q&A.\nPaul Ziots: Thanks, Kevan. [Operator Instructions] Alex, let's get started.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question for today comes from Amit Daryanani of Evercore ISI.\nAmit Daryanani: Congrats on a really strong print here despite the tough macro environment. Charlie, I was hoping you could talk a little bit more about what are you seeing from an AI infrastructure investment perspective from your customers? You folks obviously have good engagement with Meta that's been doing well, I think. But I would love to hear how your customers really thinking about their storage needs broadly and very specifically around Pure's product portfolio around IRS help to put any dimensions around it? And how do you distinguish yourself from the requirements?\nCharlie Giancarlo: Yes. Thank you, Amit. Good to hear from you. Well, we view AI -- well, we've been doing AI as a great opportunity for us and representing a reasonable portion of our sales now for multiple years, especially with the introduction of our FlashBlade product 5 years ago. And we've continued to expand that area. And we do believe that we are the go-to partner as I mentioned for AI projects, and we literally support well over a half dozen to a dozen different industries in their AI activities. The majority of the AI now continues to be part of what we -- as an industry and what everyone on the call had known of AI for many years, whether that's genomic research or advanced analysis, financial analysis or self-driving cars and so forth. Now what's happening, of course, is every company is looking at large language models, chatGPT, et cetera, trying to determine exactly what it means for them. We've seen some interest in that area, but it still remains a minority. The majority being traditional, much -- if I can use that word, with AI traditional AI projects. But we're most excited by is both the opportunity for a high-performance FlashBlade systems. But frankly, we are at least as excited that customers now more and more are going to want to put their data that is in hold, hard-to-reach hard disk systems and make that available for analysis by putting it in much more higher performance flash-based systems. And both are FlashArray//C and FlashBlade//E are perfect repositories for that. So we think it's coming out at a perfect time. And let me just -- let me go back to Meta. We continue to have an excellent relationship around AI with Meta. They recently fully turned on the first 2 phases of their research supercluster, which they announced a few weeks -- a few weeks back, and we look forward to continuing to work with them on that project as they continue to build it out, but also on other projects that they are contemplating in the other parts of the company. Rob, anything to add?\nRob Lee: No, yes. I think a couple of things. Number one, Amit, as Charlie mentioned, we're very excited about really what we see as two sets of opportunities that AI creates for us and I think are very constructive for Pure supporting the AI training environments themselves as well supporting enterprise customers as they look to connect their data sets to AI-powered applications. One set of demands, which Charlie discussed, is hey, this needs to go in store larger and larger amounts of data. It can't be cold data. And so it's a perfect fit for C and our E products, but then equally so, enterprises are going to need to connect data from all across the organizations and all across different silos of infrastructure into these applications. They can no longer be islands of their own relegated to silos that the infrastructure had held them to. And if you step back from it, those are the hallmarks of a cloud experience for storage and is exactly what we're delivering with the cloud operating model. So net-net, we think this is very constructive for us, both in supporting the high-performance and large-scale training environments certainly with our secondary tier disk takeout product lines, but also in what we're delivering with the cloud operating model.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Meta Marshall of Morgan Stanley.\nMeta Marshall: Maybe first question, you noted that you had had some FlashBlade//E sales have begun. Just wondering if there was any kind of surprise on where that uptake has been. And then maybe as a follow-up question, you noted kind of the 8-figure block store deal. Just wondering kind of how long that deal has been in the works and kind of what were the ultimate decision-making factors for that? Appreciate it.\nCharlie Giancarlo: You bet. Thanks, Meta. In terms of the -- let me start with the Cloud Block Store. As you know, we introduced that product about 2.5 years ago approximately, and continued to work with major customers in terms of their efforts to so called lift and shift their traditional apps into the cloud. . That progress of lift and shifting traditional apps out has probably taken longer than any of our customers expected, perhaps a bit longer than we expected as well. That being said, now that, they -- now that, that has started and they're seeing some of the bills coming back from the cloud vendors for the storage of that, those large amounts of data for traditional apps, now really start to become even more curious about Cloud Block Store. This particular deal, we had talked to them about 1.5 years ago before they moved into the cloud. And they -- at that time, they were so busy moving into the cloud, and they didn't really -- I don't think they really appreciated what it would cost them as they started to deploy a production environment. As they deployed that production environment and started to see the costs, they came back to us and said, \"We really would like to understand better the Cloud Block Store. And I would say from that point where they came back to us to the sale was probably only about 3 months. So a relatively short period of time.\nOperator: Our next question for today comes from Tim Long of Barclays.\nTimothy Long: Charlie, I was hoping you could talk a little bit about visibility. A lot of talk of macro. And obviously, last quarter, there was a little bit more challenging environment, but pretty positive that you guys are keeping the full year here. So can you just touch on kind of how your visibility compared to a few months ago? And what are the kind of factors that can kind of swing the numbers into the second half or end into next fiscal year, maybe from a product standpoint or where there could be upside?\nCharlie Giancarlo: You bet. What we saw -- if I go back to Q4, we saw a fairly sharp degradation midway through Q4. And what we saw in Q1 was, if you will, a stabilization to what we saw at the end of Q4. So it didn't get any better, but it didn't get any worse either. The visibility is basically just the way we're handicapping, if you will, how -- what we see in terms of -- from our sales team and the length of time that we believe accounts will close. And I think our sales teams have become much better at really understanding what the full gamut, if you will, of signatures and approvals that they're going to need to get in each account and therefore, have also become better at handicapping and staging, if you will, of the deals. So I would say that in general, the current environment, we see as stable. We would hope for improvement towards the year, but we're not counting on it at the moment. And I think that generally, we feel that this will be a -- and I'm going to exclude, let's say, surprises in federal issues. But if we see -- we're expecting stabilization through the end of the year and hopefully an improvement towards the end of the year beginning of next.\nKevan Krysler: Tim, I probably would add a couple of things. This is Kevan as well. We did indicate the fact that our enterprise business performed better than expectations. And again, I think that's a testament to our field really adjusting to our customers' buying behavior. So that's a plus for us. I think -- the other two key highlights for us that came across as incremental strengths, if you will, would be Evergreen//One performance, which we alluded to. Again, that strength was much stronger than we were even anticipating and we were already anticipating in this environment. Our Evergreen//One storage as a service sales would be strong coming into this type of environment. And then FlashBlade//E, again, is a highlight for us. Early, but customer response has been fantastic. And Charlie, I don't know if you want to say a few words on FlashBlade//E in terms of what we're seeing there.\nCharlie Giancarlo: Yes. As we mentioned, it's a very fast pipeline build. I've been in front of dozens of customers now and the excitement with customers around this product line and with the prospect of replacing their disks, which are troublesome, with all flash products has been very high. And as I mentioned, I think what's most exciting is that we're seeing customers appreciate the fact that we can address the majority of their storage needs and to be able to do that with the simplicity, the power, the ease and the reliability of Pure products. So that's -- I have to say the enthusiasm that when any one of us go in with the new pitch, if you will, to our customers. that we feel coming out of it is really palpable.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Pinjalim Bora of JPMorgan.\nPinjalim Bora: Great. And congrats on the strong quarter. One question for Kevan. Subscription, obviously, is very strong, and you kind of highlighted the potential headwind to revenue because of that. Is it possible to quantify that? You've kind of beaten the guidance by $29 million, you're kind of keeping the full year, which I appreciate, but I'm sure there is a little bit of conservatism there, too. I'm trying to understand what for the year, what would you kind of circle as a potential year-over-year growth headwind from that Evergreen//One strength?\nKevan Krysler: Yes. Look, we won't get into specifics there, Pinjalim, consistent with our practice of really talking about the subscription portfolio in total as well as from a performance standpoint, we do the same from a product standpoint. But you are thinking about it right in terms of the fact that the Evergreen//One strength we'll see it come through on top line over time, which is a positive in terms of quantifying that. We won't -- we'll let you do the math specifically on that. But again, from a scale perspective as well, we already have over 1/3 of our revenues are subscription. So the headwind isn't as intense as one would expect though it does have a consideration for us, and it has been contemplated in our annual guide, which we reiterated.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Wamsi Mohan of Bank of America.\nWamsi Mohan: Yes. I was wondering, just to clarify, are you embedding anything from Meta in your guide? And as my main question, I want to ask you. We're hearing a lot of strategic buys that are happening in -- now for some areas within memory, particularly in NAND. And wondering how you're thinking about it and potential impact to margins for the rest of fiscal '24? Or maybe a different way to think about the same thing as you are going to see competitors particularly be able to take advantage of this low-cost land environment for maybe a prolonged period of time? Do you think that closes any of the competitive gap at all or pressure to margins in the second half?\nKevan Krysler: Yes. Maybe we can take -- talk about the competitive advantages. First, Charlie, if you want to take that around our direct to flash management advantages, which really, I think, are sustaining. And we'll hit that first, then we'll hit Meta.\nCharlie Giancarlo: Absolutely. Well, the interesting thing here in -- I'm sorry, Wamsi is that we believe that our advantage based on Purity operating system and our continuing advancement of our -- what we call our direct flash modules is going to allow us to accelerate our advantage over SSDs. So I'm going to ask Rob to jump in and give you some detail there. .\nRob Lee: Yes, absolutely. Wamsi, I think we've been pretty clear with our view that disk is -- well, a dead technology spinning, so to speak. And -- but our view on SSDs, frankly isn't that much rosier. We think it's SSDs are going to fall further and further behind. And that's really driven by our ability to distance SSDs with our direct flash technology. If I step back, certainly, SSDs have played an important role in making flash more broadly available, but they're inherently less efficient, more complex, less performance, less reliable and just have overall shorter lifetimes than the systems we can deliver based on our direct flash software technology. And so while we get a lot of benefits today, the issue for SSDs and frankly, our competitive set that are reliant on SSDs is that SSDs are going to find it harder and harder to keep up with the rate of improvement that we're forging down. If we think about it, NAND flash, it's getting harder and harder to work with, that's creating pressure for what the SSD has to do from a technology perspective, trying to build larger capacity SSDs only exacerbates that. And then I think you have an economic barrier around, hey, is there consumer demand that's going to drive the same -- and follow the same type of road map that we're going to drive with our direct flash technology. And so you net it out, I think we're very bullish here that we've got a 3- to 5-year structural and sustained competitive advantage over, frankly, the rest of the field that I think is trapped on SSD technology. And we're going to be pretty aggressive about going after that. And then bringing this back to Meta, right? I think that our engagement in Meta is a great example and proof point of the value that we're able to deliver based on this technology, as we've discussed in prior calls, one of the -- really, the key reason that we won that engagement was our ability -- our solo ability to deliver the balance of performance, cost efficiency as well as power space and cooling savings. And that traces its roots directly back to the direct flash technology.\nKevan Krysler: So then, Wamsi, I do think, just to answer your question specifically around our product gross margins. Look, I think the pricing environment, clearly, we're seeing heightened competitiveness around the pricing environment probably not a lot different than what we've seen historically. That's always been an area where our competitors compete with us. But even despite that, you saw the favorability in product gross margins, which again, is the testament to what Rob and Charlie were talking about specific to our direct to flash management advantages, which, again, I think are sustaining despite what the competition will do from a pricing competitiveness perspective.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Krish Sankar of Cowen.\nEddy Orabi: This is Eddy for Krish on Cowen. And congrats on strong results. Going back to the AI question, of course. Just at a high level, what is the predominant storage solution for AI today? Is it hybrid storage or flash storage, right, when you go to our customer already working on AI applications, what kind of systems do you usually replace a competing old flash solution or a hybrid story system?\nCharlie Giancarlo: Yes, I'll take that. Well, AI systems are typically they're greenfield. So we're not generally replacing. What we are competing with are solely all-flash systems. Hard systems just can't provide the kind of performance necessary for a sophisticated AI environment. . Of course, you still have hard disk systems in there for some analytics environments, where the performance is not generally as required. But for anything that's machine learning or real-time AI-oriented, it's only all-flash systems, and we compete on the basis largely of our FlashBlade product, which has been in place for 5 years now and now augmented by the latest generation FlashBlade.\nRob Lee: Yes, Krish, this is Rob, just to add on to that. As Charlie said, AI earlier in cycle, generally in the training environments are net new and all-flash. I think the broader brownfield opportunity we see is, hey, so what are the large corpuses of data that enterprises have been collecting for sometimes decades. They've been throwing in the corner on hard disk-based systems that have generally been very, very cold and haven't had a need to access that data. Well, now with AI technology, there's now a demand to apply AI or AI applications to those large data sets. Well, now all of a sudden, there's large pools of data need to be accessible. They need to be to a degree of performance. And I think that's where we see a tremendous opportunity for us with especially in our FlashArray//C line.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Shannon Cross of Credit Suisse.\nUnidentified Analyst: I wanted to ask about operating income and margin. Given the outperformance this quarter, I know you didn't really change your guidance for the full year. But I'm wondering, assuming there may be some upside, are there areas that you would look to invest further? Or is this something where if revenue upside grew, we should expect perhaps greater than 15% operating margins through the year given the opportunity for leverage?\nKevan Krysler: Yes, Shannon, I'll take this and let Charlie comment as well. But yes, pleased with, obviously, our Q1 results, including better than expectations, both on top line as well as operating profits. We are continuing to be disciplined in terms of spending, really focusing on key areas and expanding sales capacity and that focus remains. It's not changed from how we're thinking about Q1. So when we look at Q2, we're pleased with our guide. You see the expansion sequentially from Q1 to Q2 in terms of our operating profit and again, reiterating the 15% operating margin for the year, which we feel comfortable with. Charlie, any other commentary you'd have?\nCharlie Giancarlo: Yes, it's a bit early in the year to be speculating, I think, on this topic. What I would say is we think 15% really represents the best compromise, if you will, between continued growth and profitability. And we continue to invest in growth overall as a company. If we -- I would say that that's where our mindset is at the moment, but it's another long 3 quarters ahead of us. So we may -- we'll look downstream before we update you on that.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Sidney Ho of Deutsche Bank.\nSidney Ho: Great. I have a question on subscription revenue. So your subscription ARR and revenue has grown pretty consistently 30% a year. Are there any risk that growth will start to slow down over the next few quarters when product sales are actually going through a correction in the last quarter and maybe the next couple of quarters?\nKevan Krysler: Yes, it's a great question. And look, we don't specifically guide to subscription ARR, I really do view this metric as important in measuring the overall health of our subscription businesses. And look, we've stated back in fiscal 2022 that our 3-year CAGR expectations for subscription ARR would be around 30%, and we're tracking nicely to that expectation. . Like we've noted in Q1, we saw just outstanding strength of our Evergreen//One offering. And obviously, that's really offset any reductions you might have on other Evergreen offerings that might be attached to CapEx sales. So look, I think we're continuing to see strength in terms of our subscription ARR growth. The value of Evergreen is really resonating with our customers due to flexibility that these offerings provide. And of course, there's incredible value for customers in being able to use critical data storage infrastructure that frankly stays modernized and you don't have to pull out and refresh. So therefore, yes, I think we're continuing to see strong subscription growth and ARR growth.\nCharlie Giancarlo: Yes. I tend to think of this number as a stabilizing element in our overall performance as a company and that when the economy slows down, customers are much more oriented towards these as-a-service offerings to be able to save on cash outlays and CapEx. And when the economy is strong and they move to CapEx, we get it with the Evergreen attached subscription. So I think there's some balance there and vary a little bit, but I think it's going to be -- it's a fairly stable number.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jason Ader from William Blair.\nJason Ader: My question is on Portworx. I haven't talked about that 1 in a bit. So I'd love to hear thoughts on, I guess, 2 years in, something like that, how that product is doing? And just what are some of the dynamics out there, some of the puts and takes relative to the point in time when you acquired the asset?\nCharlie Giancarlo: Yes. Portworx had a good quarter, so we're very pleased with the progress overall of Portworx. I would say that the the enterprise market for cloud native applications for stateful cloud-native applications has probably progressed a bit slower in the last year than we had expected early on. . But our expectation is that 5 to 10 years from now, all applications will be designed in a cloud native with containers and Kubernetes. So we're very confident about the future. We remain best-in-class product in that area, according to numerous analyst reports as well as we track sales of competitive products. We're #1 in that space, and we expect that to continue. So overall fees, maybe the market is a little bit slower this past year than we might have expected, but overall, very bullish on the segment.\nRob Lee: Yes. Jason, this is Rob. Let me just add a few thoughts to that. As Charlie mentioned, we saw a strong quarter from Portworx and I would call it, in particular, strength in seeing customers expand with us. And I think that to a degree, this is natural as we see this idea of platform engineering, the evolution of DevOps really starting to take hold. We believe this is driving more customers to look for -- look to Portworx for really the complete enterprise and scale-ready solutions for their cloud native applications. I'll also point out that I think we're starting to hear stories back from customers that, hey, Portworx is saving them a lot of money. So whether that's optimizing -- helping them optimize their virtualization strategy, optimize their cloud storage and compute cost and spend or just speeding up their overall time to market. And so as we've discussed with other elements of the portfolio, I think there is definitely a focus across the board on value that customers are essentially solutions -- our solutions that are able to save customers money in this environment.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Nehal Chokshi of Northland Capital Markets.\nNehal Chokshi: Yes. Congrats on a strong quarter. I wanted to ask about the media and win that you guys cited last week in a press release and specifically you guys the voice recognition modeling cycle in 6 months to 2 weeks, which is effectively been an order of improvement. So a few questions on this presser. First, is this app degenerative AI study and then is the voice recognition modeling another way of saying basically the training period? And then finally, is the typical level of benefits to customers are seeing, i.e., in order of magnitude performance improvement and it sounds like the typical structure that's being completed with is indeed all-flash arrays with the AI if you can sell to.\nKevan Krysler: Multipart question, Nehal. We're going to try to consider it a 1 question and condense the answer. Please go ahead, Charlie.\nCharlie Giancarlo: Yes. As Nehal mentioned, we actually had 2 press releases last quarter associated with -- or recently, I should say, recently with first quarter wins in the AI space, Median and Greater labs. These were releases that these organizations themselves put out. So we're very pleased to see it. In each case, dramatic improvements in the overall speed of training of their various environments. I'm going to have Rob speak in more detail on Media end, which was the folks of your question.\nRob Lee: Nihal, I think what medias and saw is not atypical from customers that are scaling their AI training environments, which is as they started down the AI path, they're doing a lot of training on smaller data sets. These data sets might be sitting directly on the GPU servers. And so at small scale, that works really well. The issue, of course, is, as you know, to produce very good results with AI, you need to apply it to very, very large sets of data and immediately, what customers run into is this challenge of, hey, how do I get a subset of my large, large pool of data, which might be sitting on cold systems over to my GPU servers so I can go and crunch on them and feed them GPUs. And so I think what they saw was again, not atypical, they were spending a ton of time waiting for data to move back and forth between these disparate systems. What Pure FlashBlade was able to do for them is essentially collapse those systems, right, and allow them to train directly off of other shared storage, thus removing a not just long manual steps, but just reducing the overall time to training. And to your first part -- or I guess, maybe the third part of your multipart question. These types of results are, I would say, are not atypical as AI projects start to scale beyond what they're able to achieve with a small-scale infrastructure.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Tom Blakey of KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nTom Blakey: I think I'm going to go back to Portworx as well actually, just the DB announcement that you had in the press release. Just wondering what the driving force there just in terms of market demand was there, where does incrementally bring to Pure and the Portworx the data services platform. any kind of update on details you've relayed into the partnership is Mongo serving in the channel? Is this consumption based, et cetera? And if I could squeeze one more in, I don't know if I heard the answer to question about metal in the fiscal '24 guide from even that would be helpful?\nCharlie Giancarlo: I think we're going to need to take the Meta question. We're running out of time, and we have quite a few people left in the queue. So I'm sorry everybody, but we do need to stick to our policy.\nKevan Krysler: Yes. And then, Tom, on Meta, our annual guide continues to exclude new Meta orders. And in particular, future phases, i.e., Phases three and four of the RC environment. So no changes from our annual guide, which again, we have reiterated this quarter.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Simon Leopold of Raymond James.\nSimon Leopold: I was interested in Charlie's comment about the demise of heart several years out. And just wanted to see what your thinking is or your take on the hard disk technology known as heat-assisted magnetic recording or HAMR, whether that's a competitive threat or how you think about that in the land?\nCharlie Giancarlo: Yes. Absolutely, Simon. Well, look, the density of hard drives will continue to increase. That's a logarithmic curve that hasn't failed for over 40 years. Unfortunately, what's not going to increase is the I/O speed on and off of these disks, which is now becoming more important. What's also not going to change is the overall weight and failure ratios of these devices. And as systems become larger and more dense flash is just accelerating its performance curve beyond hard disk at an amazing rate. So when we say that we're able to replace hard systems that exist today at 1/10 the space power and cooling, even with these new hard disk technology, we're still 5x better, and we'll accelerate beyond that. So I think it's going to be very hard for the hard just to keep up. One last thing to remember is the last refuge for hard disks now is in the secondary and tertiary tier. And now we're able to reach price parity with them at a procurement cost and yet have much lower total cost of ownership and be smaller and be more reliable. So that's the -- there's no other markets that are going to hold revenue for hard disks that flash won't penetrate. And what that means is just lesser revenue and therefore, lesser investment in ongoing development of hard disks. That's also going to be a problem for the vendors. So it's unfortunate I don't hold any malice. But similar to markets in the past, you're just -- when these transitions take place, CDs over vinyl or DVDs over VHS, there's just no stopping progress.\nPaul Ziots: We're going to actually run over by a couple of minutes. We're going to try to get in at these three more questions if we could.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Aaron Rakers of Wells Fargo.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is Jake on for Aaron. I was just hoping you could talk a little bit about your views on component pricing for the rest of the year and maybe its effect on flash bull IDs ramp?\nCharlie Giancarlo: Yes. I would say that we're seeing -- obviously, we've seen a significant drop in flash pricing over the last several quarters. We're expecting the same that you're reading in analyst reports, we're expecting that to stabilize through the remainder of the year. But our economics on FlashBlade//E are really strong and compelling and -- we believe that's -- as we said, we're offering it now at the same price as hard disk systems for nearline, and we expect our improvements in density regardless of flash pricing to allow us to accelerate as we go into next year, meaning that we can penetrate ever deeper into lower and lower cost tiers of disk while maintaining the kind of margins that we expect company. So I hope that answers your question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from David Vogt of UBS.\nDavid Vogt: Great. Charlie, I just wanted to go back to your product road map and how you're seeing to develop going forward. I know you're shipping solutions up to 40 terabytes today. But given the exponential -- the likely exponential growth in data going forward, can you kind of talk through how you're thinking about scaling your business going forward as some of the HDD guys are talking about 50 terabytes and up to 100 terabyte drives getting deployed over the next couple of years. Just would love to get your thoughts on how you're thinking about your product road map?\nCharlie Giancarlo: You bet. You bet. And thank you for the question. Well, we're expecting to deliver a 75 terabyte SSD DFM, right? We provide direct flash modules. We'll provide 75 this year. We expect that to double next year and to double again by the year after that. So it's an incredibly it's not -- we believe that, that's not an ambitious road map. We believe that's eminently doable. And there's -- if you look at the road maps for hard disk vendors, they can't get close to that and certainly not at the same power weight power size space cooling envelope that we'll be fitting in\nRob Lee: Yes. And this is Rob, just to add on to that. To Charlie's point, that road map is -- we have very high confidence in it. It's based on effectively existing technology. We don't -- no new physics needs to be invented to make that happen. And I think that's a road map that, again, it's my earlier discussion, I think lastly distances us from the hard disk road maps, but as well the SSD manufacturers, right? We just do not believe that the SSDs are going to be able to keep pace with where we're headed. And that's one of the reasons why we're so bullish about our advantage here. .\nPaul Ziots: Let's take one more question, please. So this will be the last question.\nOperator: Our final question for today comes from Eric Martinuzzi of Lake Street.\nEric Martinuzzi: Yes. Curious on the CapEx. I'm looking at it year-earlier there for Q1 versus Q1 a year ago. looks like we're up about $18 million or so. I understand you called out the capitalized software investments up a couple of -- what else is driving that increased CapEx spend here in Q1 versus a year ago? And then what are you expecting for Q2?\nKevan Krysler: Great question. And really, there's 2 drivers for that. It's really around our test equipment for new product releases. And obviously, we've come out with FlashBlade//E and we've got a lot of stuff in the work. So we've got some test equipment investments associated with that and then we're moving into our new headquarters. And so we've got some additional CapEx associated with that as well, but again, when we look at it in terms of our CapEx rate, we'll see a little bump this year against as a percentage of revenue, but around 6% to 7% is what we're thinking.\nPaul Ziots: Thank you, Eric. Before we conclude, Charlie has a few comments to make. .\nCharlie Giancarlo: Thank you, Paul, and thank you all for joining us on today's call. We continue to outpace the industry, I think, as you can see from our commentary in innovation and the advantages now in total cost of ownership energy efficiency, price performance are really setting the pace in the data center and really make us the preferred choice now for global organizations. I do thank our employees for their dedication to our partners and suppliers to their ongoing partnership and to our customers for entrusting Pure Storage with their data storage and management needs. And as a reminder, I do -- we all look forward to seeing you at Accelerate, whether that is physical or virtual, so you can hear more about our continued momentum in the future of data storage and the data center. Thank you.\nEnd of Q&A:\nOperator: Thank you. That concludes the Pure Storage First Quarter Fiscal Year 2024 Earnings Conference Call. Thank you for your participation.

            "name": "Rob Lee",
            "content": "No, yes. I think a couple of things. Number one, Amit, as Charlie mentioned, we're very excited about really what we see as two sets of opportunities that AI creates for us and I think are very constructive for Pure supporting the AI training environments themselves as well supporting enterprise customers as they look to connect their data sets to AI-powered applications. One set of demands, which Charlie discussed, is hey, this needs to go in store larger and larger amounts of data. It can't be cold data. And so it's a perfect fit for C and our E products, but then equally so, enterprises are going to need to connect data from all across the organizations and all across different silos of infrastructure into these applications. They can no longer be islands of their own relegated to silos that the infrastructure had held them to. And if you step back from it, those are the hallmarks of a cloud experience for storage and is exactly what we're delivering with the cloud operating model. So net-net, we think this is very constructive for us, both in supporting the high-performance and large-scale training environments certainly with our secondary tier disk takeout product lines, but also in what we're delivering with the cloud operating model. Yes, absolutely. Wamsi, I think we've been pretty clear with our view that disk is -- well, a dead technology spinning, so to speak. And -- but our view on SSDs, frankly isn't that much rosier. We think it's SSDs are going to fall further and further behind. And that's really driven by our ability to distance SSDs with our direct flash technology. If I step back, certainly, SSDs have played an important role in making flash more broadly available, but they're inherently less efficient, more complex, less performance, less reliable and just have overall shorter lifetimes than the systems we can deliver based on our direct flash software technology. And so while we get a lot of benefits today, the issue for SSDs and frankly, our competitive set that are reliant on SSDs is that SSDs are going to find it harder and harder to keep up with the rate of improvement that we're forging down. If we think about it, NAND flash, it's getting harder and harder to work with, that's creating pressure for what the SSD has to do from a technology perspective, trying to build larger capacity SSDs only exacerbates that. And then I think you have an economic barrier around, hey, is there consumer demand that's going to drive the same -- and follow the same type of road map that we're going to drive with our direct flash technology. And so you net it out, I think we're very bullish here that we've got a 3- to 5-year structural and sustained competitive advantage over, frankly, the rest of the field that I think is trapped on SSD technology. And we're going to be pretty aggressive about going after that. And then bringing this back to Meta, right? I think that our engagement in Meta is a great example and proof point of the value that we're able to deliver based on this technology, as we've discussed in prior calls, one of the -- really, the key reason that we won that engagement was our ability -- our solo ability to deliver the balance of performance, cost efficiency as well as power space and cooling savings. And that traces its roots directly back to the direct flash technology. Yes, Krish, this is Rob, just to add on to that. As Charlie said, AI earlier in cycle, generally in the training environments are net new and all-flash. I think the broader brownfield opportunity we see is, hey, so what are the large corpuses of data that enterprises have been collecting for sometimes decades. They've been throwing in the corner on hard disk-based systems that have generally been very, very cold and haven't had a need to access that data. Well, now with AI technology, there's now a demand to apply AI or AI applications to those large data sets. Well, now all of a sudden, there's large pools of data need to be accessible. They need to be to a degree of performance. And I think that's where we see a tremendous opportunity for us with especially in our FlashArray//C line. Yes. Jason, this is Rob. Let me just add a few thoughts to that. As Charlie mentioned, we saw a strong quarter from Portworx and I would call it, in particular, strength in seeing customers expand with us. And I think that to a degree, this is natural as we see this idea of platform engineering, the evolution of DevOps really starting to take hold. We believe this is driving more customers to look for -- look to Portworx for really the complete enterprise and scale-ready solutions for their cloud native applications. I'll also point out that I think we're starting to hear stories back from customers that, hey, Portworx is saving them a lot of money. So whether that's optimizing -- helping them optimize their virtualization strategy, optimize their cloud storage and compute cost and spend or just speeding up their overall time to market. And so as we've discussed with other elements of the portfolio, I think there is definitely a focus across the board on value that customers are essentially solutions -- our solutions that are able to save customers money in this environment. Nihal, I think what medias and saw is not atypical from customers that are scaling their AI training environments, which is as they started down the AI path, they're doing a lot of training on smaller data sets. These data sets might be sitting directly on the GPU servers. And so at small scale, that works really well. The issue, of course, is, as you know, to produce very good results with AI, you need to apply it to very, very large sets of data and immediately, what customers run into is this challenge of, hey, how do I get a subset of my large, large pool of data, which might be sitting on cold systems over to my GPU servers so I can go and crunch on them and feed them GPUs. And so I think what they saw was again, not atypical, they were spending a ton of time waiting for data to move back and forth between these disparate systems. What Pure FlashBlade was able to do for them is essentially collapse those systems, right, and allow them to train directly off of other shared storage, thus removing a not just long manual steps, but just reducing the overall time to training. And to your first part -- or I guess, maybe the third part of your multipart question. These types of results are, I would say, are not atypical as AI projects start to scale beyond what they're able to achieve with a small-scale infrastructure. Yes. And this is Rob, just to add on to that. To Charlie's point, that road map is -- we have very high confidence in it. It's based on effectively existing technology. We don't -- no new physics needs to be invented to make that happen. And I think that's a road map that, again, it's my earlier discussion, I think lastly distances us from the hard disk road maps, but as well the SSD manufacturers, right? We just do not believe that the SSDs are going to be able to keep pace with where we're headed. And that's one of the reasons why we're so bullish about our advantage here. ."

            "name": "Charlie Giancarlo",
            "content": "Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our Q1 FY '24 earnings call. Thank you for joining us today. We were pleased with our Q1 performance in what continues overall to be a challenging IT environment. Highlights for the quarter include the highest all-time sales for Evergreen//One, our first sales of FlashBlade//E, which is experiencing the fastest first quarter pipeline growth for any new pure product. Our largest single order since inception of almost 8 digits for our Cloud Block store product and the release of a major upgrade to our FlashArray unified block and file software. We are especially pleased with the customer response to our E product line. The E line is the first and only all-flash storage system that can address the secondary storage market, at competitive prices to 7,200 RPM hard disk systems, but with only 1/10 the power, space, cooling and labor requirements. As I've stated in the past, the days of hard disks are coming to an end. We predict that there will be no new hard disks sold in 5 years. But beyond the benefits of the E product line itself, it enables Pure to now compete for our customers' entire storage environment. It enables Pure for the first time to be our customers' complete storage partner. Something that our customers have been asking for, for years. The operational and economic benefits of Pure's comprehensive storage portfolio are clear and overwhelming and are based on sustainable technology and business model advantages. In March, we gathered our sales team for our annual sales kickoff, an event we had not held in person since 2020. Everyone was energized by both the event and the training we conducted there. This ongoing training focuses on honing sales skills with our expansion into the secondary storage market, advancing our as-a-service offerings and selling in today's environment of constrained IT spending. This valuable training is already bearing fruit and enabling us to reach new customers, better support the needs of current customers and reduced sales cycles, which have lengthened in this economic environment. It's clear that our continued innovation strongly resonates with our customers, whether it is for AI/machine learning, rapid recovery from ransomware, high-performance databases, electronic design automation and video editing traditional or cloud-native applications and now also for secondary storage environments such as content and media stores, enterprise imaging and even traditional backup and archive. We deliver unique outcomes that are highly valuable to our customers in every environment. Compared to our all-flash competitors, we are 10x more reliable. We are 2X to 5X more power and space efficient, and we require 5 to 10x less manual labor to operate, resulting overall in at least 50% lower total cost of ownership. Also, our products never become obsolete and never require forklift upgrades because our Evergreen program provides continual hardware and software upgrades nondisruptively, to the customer's application environment forever. Products we sold 10 years ago are not only still in service, but have been continually modernized to our latest models without disruption or additional customer expense with our Evergreen subscription. These capabilities are based upon 4 unique and sustainable competitive advantages. One, our purity software uniquely works directly with raw flash, while other competitors use more expensive, less efficient and shorter-lived SSDs; two, Pure's highly consolidated product line consisting of our common operating system, Purity and 1 management system Pure1, operating on both a scale-up and the scale-out platform utilizing common direct flash modules, while competitors require many disparate software and hardware platforms to cover the same breadth of use cases; three, Pure's unique Evergreen technology and services, which guarantee that deployed products never become obsolete, never need to be replaced and enable nondisruptive upgrades. And four, Pure's cloud operating model, which enables customers to operate their storage the way that cloud customers operate theirs, highly automated, orchestrated and available as-a-service. As we expected, Evergreen//One is thriving in this economic environment. Sales of Evergreen//One more than year-over-year. As a reminder, Evergreen//One is Pure's Storage as a Service offering that enables customers to access storage entirely through service level agreements with no capital expenditure only paying for capacity as they use it. Customers can place their data on-premise, on Pure-owned infrastructure or on AWS or Azure with Pure's Cloud Block Store. The customer only pays for what they use under a single contract for enterprise-class capabilities for less than what they pay for raw cloud storage. This past quarter, we saw the largest individual sale of Pure Cloud Block Store at almost 8 figures, a Fortune 500 health care organization purchased Cloud Block Store because of its ability to securely store data in the cloud with enterprise features, reduced management overhead and lower TCO. By using Cloud Block Store, the organization is able to significantly reduce their cloud storage spend while getting the most out of their data. Our extraordinary lead in driving power space, labor and e-waste reduction both on-prem and in the cloud has also garnered attention amid increased customer focus on the selection criteria. The continued strength of FlashArray//C and interest in FlashBlade//E speaks to our customers' demand for the TCO benefits of Pure all-flash products over competitive offerings now including both their flash and hard disk systems. In particular, FlashBlade//E consumes approximately 1/10 as much power and space as similar capacity hard disk systems that it replaces, requiring up to 1/10 the labor and generates less than 1/10 the e-waste. Only Pure's direct flash management and operational simplicity is able to deliver this operational performance. As I mentioned, Early interest in FlashBlade//E is off the charts for a new product. FlashBlade//E is the second in a series of products that can compete for the secondary tier and some lower tiers of the storage market entirely dominated today by hard disks. Prior to FlashArray//C and FlashBlade//E, all flash products were only price competitive for high-performance systems and therefore, Pure could only provide products for our customers' Tier 1 storage needs. With the introduction of our E product line, Pure can now compete for customers' entire storage estate, enabling Pure to become their complete storage partner for the first time. For years, customers have asked us for products that could address the remainder of their storage and space. I have now had many customer visits since our introduction of FlashBlade//E with senior IT executives describing our key advantages and our ability to provide flash solutions to their entire storage environment. A common question from these senior executives is why aren't we doing this already. In April, we announced a major update to our FlashArray unified block and file software, representing a significant expansion of our broader file strategy and portfolio. I'm proud to share that we're now able to address customers' file needs across high-performance, general-purpose NAS, VMware over NFS and dozens of other use cases, allowing us to compete for all of a customer's file storage as 8. Best of all, FlashArray customers can simply upgrade to the latest software to get these capabilities without any additional expense. This unified offering was a key component in the largest individual international market win in Pure history last quarter. Touching upon the most recent trends, generative AI and chatGPT has brought artificial intelligence to the top of mind in all of our major customers and has become a focal part of literally every earnings script this quarter. Pure saw the AI opportunity years ago and started innovating in this area with our introduction of FlashBlade in 2017 and then with our AI-ready infrastructure Aerie product co-developed with NVIDIA. We've continued to advance FlashBlade's high-performance parallel architecture, and Pure continues to be the go-to partner for storage on AI projects. For instance, we support more than 10 leading autonomous vehicle development companies in managing and processing the massive amounts of data required for their machine learning activity. In addition to our very successful position with Meta in their AI research supercluster or RSC, the largest AI supercomputer in the world. Pure is the chosen vendor for AI environments across a broad range of industries, including media and entertainment, pharma, health care, aerospace, transportation and financial services. We expect our leading role in AI to continue to expand, but we are equally excited that the requirements for Big Data will drive even more use of high-performance flash for traditional bulk data. As we mentioned last quarter, we expect the current macro environment to continue through this fiscal year, and we continue to operate the company with our usual diligence improving productivity and focusing investment on meaningful innovation and growth. Our as-a-service offerings, including Evergreen//One and Evergreen//Flex and our Pure financing vehicles provide customers with a wide range of economic alternatives to address their business needs. Pure's superior TCO and flexible Evergreen offerings are making a difference in this challenging IT economy. While we saw continuing caution by enterprise and cloud customers in Q1, similar to what we saw in Q4. We also experienced enhanced demand for our most cost-effective studies, especially Evergreen//One. Given all of our advantages, we remain confident that we will continue to increase our market share, outgrow our competitors and pick up even greater momentum, especially as our new products and services gain mind share. I am confident that we are gaining recognition with both customers and prospects that Pure is the company to trust for their future data storage architectures. We are years ahead of the competition in our ability to provide all storage needs with the most consistent, modern and efficient storage solutions. We enjoy a highly sustainable competitive advantage based on the only direct to flash operating system in Purity, a simple, consistent product line with common management, our Evergreen technology to continually upgrade our products nondisruptively to the third state of the art and our ability to provide our customers with a cloud operating model. our new capability to compete for the full range of enterprise storage needs gives us even greater relevance to our enterprise accounts and enables us to deliver a full and far more integrated storage solution to our customers. In closing, I am excited to share that in just a couple of weeks, we'll be hosting our Annual Accelerate User conference in Las Vegas. We're looking forward to seeing customers, partners and analysts from around the world to discuss the future of data storage and management. I'll now turn the call over to Kevan. Yes. Thank you, Amit. Good to hear from you. Well, we view AI -- well, we've been doing AI as a great opportunity for us and representing a reasonable portion of our sales now for multiple years, especially with the introduction of our FlashBlade product 5 years ago. And we've continued to expand that area. And we do believe that we are the go-to partner as I mentioned for AI projects, and we literally support well over a half dozen to a dozen different industries in their AI activities. The majority of the AI now continues to be part of what we -- as an industry and what everyone on the call had known of AI for many years, whether that's genomic research or advanced analysis, financial analysis or self-driving cars and so forth. Now what's happening, of course, is every company is looking at large language models, chatGPT, et cetera, trying to determine exactly what it means for them. We've seen some interest in that area, but it still remains a minority. The majority being traditional, much -- if I can use that word, with AI traditional AI projects. But we're most excited by is both the opportunity for a high-performance FlashBlade systems. But frankly, we are at least as excited that customers now more and more are going to want to put their data that is in hold, hard-to-reach hard disk systems and make that available for analysis by putting it in much more higher performance flash-based systems. And both are FlashArray//C and FlashBlade//E are perfect repositories for that. So we think it's coming out at a perfect time. And let me just -- let me go back to Meta. We continue to have an excellent relationship around AI with Meta. They recently fully turned on the first 2 phases of their research supercluster, which they announced a few weeks -- a few weeks back, and we look forward to continuing to work with them on that project as they continue to build it out, but also on other projects that they are contemplating in the other parts of the company. Rob, anything to add? You bet. Thanks, Meta. In terms of the -- let me start with the Cloud Block Store. As you know, we introduced that product about 2.5 years ago approximately, and continued to work with major customers in terms of their efforts to so called lift and shift their traditional apps into the cloud. . That progress of lift and shifting traditional apps out has probably taken longer than any of our customers expected, perhaps a bit longer than we expected as well. That being said, now that, they -- now that, that has started and they're seeing some of the bills coming back from the cloud vendors for the storage of that, those large amounts of data for traditional apps, now really start to become even more curious about Cloud Block Store. This particular deal, we had talked to them about 1.5 years ago before they moved into the cloud. And they -- at that time, they were so busy moving into the cloud, and they didn't really -- I don't think they really appreciated what it would cost them as they started to deploy a production environment. As they deployed that production environment and started to see the costs, they came back to us and said, \"We really would like to understand better the Cloud Block Store. And I would say from that point where they came back to us to the sale was probably only about 3 months. So a relatively short period of time. You bet. What we saw -- if I go back to Q4, we saw a fairly sharp degradation midway through Q4. And what we saw in Q1 was, if you will, a stabilization to what we saw at the end of Q4. So it didn't get any better, but it didn't get any worse either. The visibility is basically just the way we're handicapping, if you will, how -- what we see in terms of -- from our sales team and the length of time that we believe accounts will close. And I think our sales teams have become much better at really understanding what the full gamut, if you will, of signatures and approvals that they're going to need to get in each account and therefore, have also become better at handicapping and staging, if you will, of the deals. So I would say that in general, the current environment, we see as stable. We would hope for improvement towards the year, but we're not counting on it at the moment. And I think that generally, we feel that this will be a -- and I'm going to exclude, let's say, surprises in federal issues. But if we see -- we're expecting stabilization through the end of the year and hopefully an improvement towards the end of the year beginning of next. Yes. As we mentioned, it's a very fast pipeline build. I've been in front of dozens of customers now and the excitement with customers around this product line and with the prospect of replacing their disks, which are troublesome, with all flash products has been very high. And as I mentioned, I think what's most exciting is that we're seeing customers appreciate the fact that we can address the majority of their storage needs and to be able to do that with the simplicity, the power, the ease and the reliability of Pure products. So that's -- I have to say the enthusiasm that when any one of us go in with the new pitch, if you will, to our customers. that we feel coming out of it is really palpable. Absolutely. Well, the interesting thing here in -- I'm sorry, Wamsi is that we believe that our advantage based on Purity operating system and our continuing advancement of our -- what we call our direct flash modules is going to allow us to accelerate our advantage over SSDs. So I'm going to ask Rob to jump in and give you some detail there. . Yes, I'll take that. Well, AI systems are typically they're greenfield. So we're not generally replacing. What we are competing with are solely all-flash systems. Hard systems just can't provide the kind of performance necessary for a sophisticated AI environment. . Of course, you still have hard disk systems in there for some analytics environments, where the performance is not generally as required. But for anything that's machine learning or real-time AI-oriented, it's only all-flash systems, and we compete on the basis largely of our FlashBlade product, which has been in place for 5 years now and now augmented by the latest generation FlashBlade. Yes, it's a bit early in the year to be speculating, I think, on this topic. What I would say is we think 15% really represents the best compromise, if you will, between continued growth and profitability. And we continue to invest in growth overall as a company. If we -- I would say that that's where our mindset is at the moment, but it's another long 3 quarters ahead of us. So we may -- we'll look downstream before we update you on that. Yes. I tend to think of this number as a stabilizing element in our overall performance as a company and that when the economy slows down, customers are much more oriented towards these as-a-service offerings to be able to save on cash outlays and CapEx. And when the economy is strong and they move to CapEx, we get it with the Evergreen attached subscription. So I think there's some balance there and vary a little bit, but I think it's going to be -- it's a fairly stable number. Yes. Portworx had a good quarter, so we're very pleased with the progress overall of Portworx. I would say that the the enterprise market for cloud native applications for stateful cloud-native applications has probably progressed a bit slower in the last year than we had expected early on. . But our expectation is that 5 to 10 years from now, all applications will be designed in a cloud native with containers and Kubernetes. So we're very confident about the future. We remain best-in-class product in that area, according to numerous analyst reports as well as we track sales of competitive products. We're #1 in that space, and we expect that to continue. So overall fees, maybe the market is a little bit slower this past year than we might have expected, but overall, very bullish on the segment. Yes. As Nehal mentioned, we actually had 2 press releases last quarter associated with -- or recently, I should say, recently with first quarter wins in the AI space, Median and Greater labs. These were releases that these organizations themselves put out. So we're very pleased to see it. In each case, dramatic improvements in the overall speed of training of their various environments. I'm going to have Rob speak in more detail on Media end, which was the folks of your question. I think we're going to need to take the Meta question. We're running out of time, and we have quite a few people left in the queue. So I'm sorry everybody, but we do need to stick to our policy. Yes. Absolutely, Simon. Well, look, the density of hard drives will continue to increase. That's a logarithmic curve that hasn't failed for over 40 years. Unfortunately, what's not going to increase is the I/O speed on and off of these disks, which is now becoming more important. What's also not going to change is the overall weight and failure ratios of these devices. And as systems become larger and more dense flash is just accelerating its performance curve beyond hard disk at an amazing rate. So when we say that we're able to replace hard systems that exist today at 1/10 the space power and cooling, even with these new hard disk technology, we're still 5x better, and we'll accelerate beyond that. So I think it's going to be very hard for the hard just to keep up. One last thing to remember is the last refuge for hard disks now is in the secondary and tertiary tier. And now we're able to reach price parity with them at a procurement cost and yet have much lower total cost of ownership and be smaller and be more reliable. So that's the -- there's no other markets that are going to hold revenue for hard disks that flash won't penetrate. And what that means is just lesser revenue and therefore, lesser investment in ongoing development of hard disks. That's also going to be a problem for the vendors. So it's unfortunate I don't hold any malice. But similar to markets in the past, you're just -- when these transitions take place, CDs over vinyl or DVDs over VHS, there's just no stopping progress. Yes. I would say that we're seeing -- obviously, we've seen a significant drop in flash pricing over the last several quarters. We're expecting the same that you're reading in analyst reports, we're expecting that to stabilize through the remainder of the year. But our economics on FlashBlade//E are really strong and compelling and -- we believe that's -- as we said, we're offering it now at the same price as hard disk systems for nearline, and we expect our improvements in density regardless of flash pricing to allow us to accelerate as we go into next year, meaning that we can penetrate ever deeper into lower and lower cost tiers of disk while maintaining the kind of margins that we expect company. So I hope that answers your question. You bet. You bet. And thank you for the question. Well, we're expecting to deliver a 75 terabyte SSD DFM, right? We provide direct flash modules. We'll provide 75 this year. We expect that to double next year and to double again by the year after that. So it's an incredibly it's not -- we believe that, that's not an ambitious road map. We believe that's eminently doable. And there's -- if you look at the road maps for hard disk vendors, they can't get close to that and certainly not at the same power weight power size space cooling envelope that we'll be fitting in Thank you, Paul, and thank you all for joining us on today's call. We continue to outpace the industry, I think, as you can see from our commentary in innovation and the advantages now in total cost of ownership energy efficiency, price performance are really setting the pace in the data center and really make us the preferred choice now for global organizations. I do thank our employees for their dedication to our partners and suppliers to their ongoing partnership and to our customers for entrusting Pure Storage with their data storage and management needs. And as a reminder, I do -- we all look forward to seeing you at Accelerate, whether that is physical or virtual, so you can hear more about our continued momentum in the future of data storage and the data center. Thank you."

            "name": "Kevan Krysler",
            "content": "Thank you, Charlie, and good afternoon, everyone. In Q1, we achieved revenue of $589 million and operating profit of nearly $20 million, exceeding our expectations. We also set an all-time record of Evergreen//One subscription sales this quarter as demand was exceptional. We were pleased that our U.S. enterprise business exceeded our expectations this quarter. Macro conditions continue to be challenging, consistent with what we saw in Q4. Against this macro backdrop, our sales force and leadership are actively monitoring deals to get ahead of challenges as well as continuing to focus conversations both on our business value and total cost of ownership advantages which are unmatched against our competitors. Our subscription services annual recurring revenue grew 29% year-over-year to $1.2 billion and subscription services revenue of $280 million represented 48% of total revenue. Remaining performance obligations, or RPO, grew 26% year-over-year to $1.8 billion. Similar to the remarks we've made in previous quarters, our RPO included an outstanding commitment with one of our global system integrators. During Q1, this remaining outstanding commitment was fully satisfied with Evergreen//One sales. When excluding the impact of the past outstanding commitment from our global system integrator, RPO grew 31%. Our headcount increased slightly to approximately 5,270 employees in Q1 and and we remain disciplined in managing our costs, including hiring. Incremental investments in headcount remains focused on quota-carrying sales capacity and critical business hires. As I previously mentioned, total revenue in Q1 was $589 million and product revenue was $309 million. As we noted in previous earnings calls, Q1 revenue last year included $60 million of product revenue that was contemplated in the second half of last year. Excluding this impact, Q1 total revenue grew approximately 5%. U.S. revenue for Q1 was $427 million, and international revenue was $162 million. We also acquired 276 new customers during the quarter. We were pleased with our continued strong gross margin performance in Q1 of 72.2% with product gross margins of 70.8% and subscription services gross margin of 73.7%. Q1 operating profit of nearly $20 million exceeded expectations and included higher year-over-year costs for salaries and our first sales kickoff event since 2020. Pure's balance sheet and liquidity remains very strong, including $1.2 billion in cash and investments. In April, we reduced our overall debt paying off $575 million in convertible notes using $475 million in cash and $100 million from our revolving line of credit. Cash flow from operations during the quarter was $173 million and capital expenditures totaled $51 million. In Q1, we repurchased 2.9 million shares of stock, returning nearly $70 million to our shareholders and have approximately $211 million remaining on our existing $250 million repurchase authorization. Now turning to guidance. We are reiterating our annual guidance for FY '24 with revenue growth in the mid- to high single digits and expect an operating margin of 15%. Our annual revenue guidance assumes that macro conditions will continue to be challenging and will be consistent with what we have seen over the last couple of quarters. We expect continued momentum of our Evergreen subscription services in particular, Evergreen//One. The strength of our Evergreen//One offering has been contemplated in our annual revenue guide as the recurring revenue for these services is recognized over time. Also, as Charlie mentioned, early customer response to FlashBlade//E, which became generally available in late April, has exceeded our expectations. Our FY '24 annual revenue guidance that we provided last quarter assumed a modest revenue ramp during the second half of the year from sales of FlashBlade//E. While we are very pleased with the early response to FlashBlade//E, our FY '24 revenue guidance continues to assume a modest revenue ramp during the second half of the year. Moving to Q2 guidance. We expect Q2 revenue of $680 million representing an increase of approximately 5% year-over-year. Our Q2 revenue guidance implies continued strong subscription revenue growth and a slight year-over-year decline in product revenue. We also expect Q2 operating profit of $90 million as we remain focused on profitable growth and ensuring we are appropriately aligning our cost structure with demand. In closing, through our innovation, our competitive advantages are clear and aligned to our customers' focus on both performance and cost. We are uniquely positioned to deliver significant business value while reducing our customers' total cost of ownership, including labor, energy and real estate. It's a pleasure to also invite you to join us for our product and technology-focused Financial Analyst Meeting at Accelerate on June 15, either in person at Las Vegas or virtually through our Investor Relations website. With that, I will turn it back to Paul for Q&A. Tim, I probably would add a couple of things. This is Kevan as well. We did indicate the fact that our enterprise business performed better than expectations. And again, I think that's a testament to our field really adjusting to our customers' buying behavior. So that's a plus for us. I think -- the other two key highlights for us that came across as incremental strengths, if you will, would be Evergreen//One performance, which we alluded to. Again, that strength was much stronger than we were even anticipating and we were already anticipating in this environment. Our Evergreen//One storage as a service sales would be strong coming into this type of environment. And then FlashBlade//E, again, is a highlight for us. Early, but customer response has been fantastic. And Charlie, I don't know if you want to say a few words on FlashBlade//E in terms of what we're seeing there. Yes. Look, we won't get into specifics there, Pinjalim, consistent with our practice of really talking about the subscription portfolio in total as well as from a performance standpoint, we do the same from a product standpoint. But you are thinking about it right in terms of the fact that the Evergreen//One strength we'll see it come through on top line over time, which is a positive in terms of quantifying that. We won't -- we'll let you do the math specifically on that. But again, from a scale perspective as well, we already have over 1/3 of our revenues are subscription. So the headwind isn't as intense as one would expect though it does have a consideration for us, and it has been contemplated in our annual guide, which we reiterated. Yes. Maybe we can take -- talk about the competitive advantages. First, Charlie, if you want to take that around our direct to flash management advantages, which really, I think, are sustaining. And we'll hit that first, then we'll hit Meta. So then, Wamsi, I do think, just to answer your question specifically around our product gross margins. Look, I think the pricing environment, clearly, we're seeing heightened competitiveness around the pricing environment probably not a lot different than what we've seen historically. That's always been an area where our competitors compete with us. But even despite that, you saw the favorability in product gross margins, which again, is the testament to what Rob and Charlie were talking about specific to our direct to flash management advantages, which, again, I think are sustaining despite what the competition will do from a pricing competitiveness perspective. Yes, Shannon, I'll take this and let Charlie comment as well. But yes, pleased with, obviously, our Q1 results, including better than expectations, both on top line as well as operating profits. We are continuing to be disciplined in terms of spending, really focusing on key areas and expanding sales capacity and that focus remains. It's not changed from how we're thinking about Q1. So when we look at Q2, we're pleased with our guide. You see the expansion sequentially from Q1 to Q2 in terms of our operating profit and again, reiterating the 15% operating margin for the year, which we feel comfortable with. Charlie, any other commentary you'd have? Yes, it's a great question. And look, we don't specifically guide to subscription ARR, I really do view this metric as important in measuring the overall health of our subscription businesses. And look, we've stated back in fiscal 2022 that our 3-year CAGR expectations for subscription ARR would be around 30%, and we're tracking nicely to that expectation. . Like we've noted in Q1, we saw just outstanding strength of our Evergreen//One offering. And obviously, that's really offset any reductions you might have on other Evergreen offerings that might be attached to CapEx sales. So look, I think we're continuing to see strength in terms of our subscription ARR growth. The value of Evergreen is really resonating with our customers due to flexibility that these offerings provide. And of course, there's incredible value for customers in being able to use critical data storage infrastructure that frankly stays modernized and you don't have to pull out and refresh. So therefore, yes, I think we're continuing to see strong subscription growth and ARR growth. Multipart question, Nehal. We're going to try to consider it a 1 question and condense the answer. Please go ahead, Charlie. Yes. And then, Tom, on Meta, our annual guide continues to exclude new Meta orders. And in particular, future phases, i.e., Phases three and four of the RC environment. So no changes from our annual guide, which again, we have reiterated this quarter. Great question. And really, there's 2 drivers for that. It's really around our test equipment for new product releases. And obviously, we've come out with FlashBlade//E and we've got a lot of stuff in the work. So we've got some test equipment investments associated with that and then we're moving into our new headquarters. And so we've got some additional CapEx associated with that as well, but again, when we look at it in terms of our CapEx rate, we'll see a little bump this year against as a percentage of revenue, but around 6% to 7% is what we're thinking."
