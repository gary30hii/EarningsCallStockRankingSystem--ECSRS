Additionally, the following senior management team members will be available for the Q&A session, Pat McDonie, President, Gathering and Processing; Scott Pryor, President, Logistics and Transportation; and Bobby Muraro, Chief Commercial Officer. And with that I will now turn the call over to Matt.\nMatt Meloy: Thanks, Sanjay and good morning. 2020 had its ups and downs, but it ended up being a really good year for Targa. Record EBITDA, record volumes, but the thing I'm most proud of is how our Targa team responded to the numerous challenges throughout the year, including COVID-19. And now, with the recent cold weather that affected Texas and many other states, 2021 has arrived with its own challenges. Our employees have done a tremendous job, working in very difficult conditions, many without power, heat and water in their home. So, I'd like to thank Targa employees for all their hard work and dedication. We are exceptionally proud of our Targa team, who manage through these extreme conditions, and continue to operate our facilities safely. The most recent winter storm impacted, both our gathering and processing and downstream operations. Over the trailing 10 days, we experienced on average, a 50% reduction across our G&P and downstream system volumes. Volumes are continuing to ramp and current rates have since returned to around 90% of pre-severe weather levels. This overall event is still relatively short-term in nature, and we are comfortable with the full year 2021 guidance that we published last week. Our long-term business outlook continues to be strong. Let's now turn to 2020 highlights. Our overall business performed very well, led by our position in the Permian Basin and our integrated NGL platform. Full year, 2020 adjusted EBITDA of $1.64 billion, exceeded the top end of our guidance range and was within our initial range, presented in early 2020. We believe, that our key strategic efforts around recontracting to add fees in gathering and processing, reducing growth capital spending, identifying opportunities to reduce operating and G&A expenses, reducing our dividend and focusing on integrated opportunities, position us for a successful 2021 and beyond. In 2020, we completed several major projects on time and on budget, including two processing plants in the Permian, two fractionation trains in Mont Belvieu, the phased expansion of our LPG export capabilities and the extension of our Grand Prix pipeline into Central Oklahoma. These expansions position Targa to benefit from increasing operating leverage moving forward. Our total net growth capital spending for 2020 was about $600 million, which was about $100 million below, the bottom end of our range, driven by the high grading of growth opportunities and a huge effort by our engineers and operators to be creative and capital efficient.  In 2020, increasing EBITDA and reduced growth capital spending resulted in improving leverage metrics and we exited 2020 with reported leverage of 4.7 times, a meaningful reduction from the 5.5 times leverage to end 2019.  Higher EBITDA and lower growth CapEx also provided additional flexibility to be opportunistic throughout the year, which resulted in us buying back publicly-traded notes, common equity and a small piece of the TRC preferred shares all at very attractive prices.  Looking ahead, we estimate full year 2021 adjusted EBITDA to be between 1.65 -- $1.675 billion and $1.775 billion. Net growth capital spending in 2021 will be significantly lower, which we estimate to be between $350 million and $450 million, positioning us to generate increasing free cash flow after dividend to continue to reduce leverage.  We expect to end 2021 with reported leverage of around 4.25 times. This guidance is inclusive of our limited exposure from some of the recent government actions around activity on federal lands with less than 5% of Targa's Permian volumes currently from affected areas.  Let's now turn to our operational performance and business outlook. Starting in the Permian, during 2020 our systems across the Midland and Delaware Basins demonstrated significant resiliency despite reduced activity levels and temporary shut-ins, which impacted the industry.  Targa's 2020 Permian inlet volumes increased 19% over 2019 and we expect to benefit from this positive momentum as we move through 2021. During the fourth quarter, we took a number of our plants in the Permian Midland down for maintenance and this has allowed for improved NGL recoveries across our system.  We are seeing increasing activity levels across both our Midland and Delaware footprints. For 2021, we expect our average total Permian inlet volumes to increase between 5% and 10% over 2020.  With our Permian Midland system running close to capacity our new 200 million cubic feet per day Heim plant will be much needed and remains on track to begin operations during the fourth quarter of 2021 and we currently have adequate processing capacity in Permian Delaware to accommodate our anticipated growth in 2021.  The supply growth from our Permian G&P systems will continue to drive increasing volumes through our Grand Prix pipeline and our fractionation complex in Mont-Bellevue. In addition to incremental supply available to move across our LPG export facility.  Moving on to the Badlands, our gas volumes during the fourth quarter sequentially increased 4% and our crude volumes were flat relative to the third quarter. We are seeing activity levels and completions increase across our system, which is a positive sign.  Turning to our Central region, which continues to largely be in decline gas inlet volumes in the fourth quarter declined 5% over the third quarter. We continue to have some shut-in volumes in South Oak, which we expect to come back online in the first half of 2021.  Overall, we expect volumes across our central systems to be lower in 2021 relative to 2020. For 2021, we estimate the volume growth in our Permian region to offset anticipated declines across our central regions and estimate our total field G&P inlet volumes in 2021 to be flat year-over-year.  The durability of our Gathering and Processing segment margin has strengthened as we have reduced our commodity exposure by adding fees and fee floors to our G&P contracts. Our Permian G&P business is now approximately 65% fee-based. And overall, we estimate about 85% fee-based margin across all of Targa for 2021.  The financial performance of our G&P segment is now more driven by volume throughput and fees as opposed to direct commodity prices, which was evidenced in our 2020 results. With the fee floor arrangements we have in place, we will continue to benefit as prices rise.  Shifting to our Logistics and Transportation segment, our Grand Prix pipeline continues to perform very well. Fourth quarter throughput volumes on Grand Prix sequentially increased 18% driven by increasing NGL production from Targa's Permian plants including our new gateway plant.  Our Grand Prix extension in the Central Oklahoma began operations at the end of the fourth quarter. We expect strong performance on Grand Prix to continue throughout 2021 and estimate deliveries into Mont-Bellevue to increase 25% or more over 2020 average throughput.  At our fractionation complex in Mont Belvieu, fourth quarter fractionation volumes remained strong and also benefited from working down inventory we built as a result of our scheduled maintenance and upgrades performed during the third quarter at our facilities. Our LPG export services business at Galena Park continued to perform well, as we moved the Targa record 11.3 million barrels per month during the fourth quarter, benefiting from a full quarter of our recently completed phase expansion in addition to capturing some short-term volumes during the fourth quarter driven by strong fundamentals, and the outlook for full 2021 remains strong. In the past, we have talked about capacity at our export facility to be about 15 million barrels per month. Now that we've gone through a full quarter of operations following our expansion and to appropriately manage expectations going forward, we think that our effective working capacity at Galena Park is about 12.5 million barrels per month. There is potential to exceed that for a given month if we load more butanes, but we think that up to 12.5 million barrels per month is a better representation of our overall working capacity. As we look forward, we are in a position where we expect to have the ability to capture growth opportunities from the Permian without having to spend much incremental CapEx on Grand Prix fractionation or LPG export facilities. This puts Targa in a position to generate strong returns going forward and increasing free cash flow after dividends available to reduce debt and further strengthen our financial position. With our premier integrated asset position and our talented employees Targa is well positioned for the longer-term. With that, I will now turn the call over to Jen.\nJen Kneale: Thanks Matt. Targa's reported quarterly adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $438 million, increasing 5% over the third quarter. During the fourth quarter, Targa generated free cash flow of $215 million. Higher sequential operating expenses were primarily attributable to certain one-time hurricane repairs and integrity spending during the fourth quarter, and additional assets being fully online. Higher G&A expenses were attributable to higher compensation and legal costs. Our full year 2020 reported adjusted EBITDA was $1.64 billion, exceeding the high end of our financial guidance range and we generated $575 million of free cash flow in the year. Through extensive cost reduction efforts, in 2020 we achieved significant aggregate expense savings versus our plan and we expect many of these savings to carry forward into 2021 and beyond particularly related to labor. Looking to 2021, we do expect operating and G&A expenses to be modestly higher than 2020, largely from additional assets and service that will drive both additional OpEx and ad valorem costs and also higher insurance costs. Greater volume throughput across our system will also result in higher costs. We remain significantly hedged for 2021 and continue to add hedges for 2021 and beyond. Relative to when we last reported in November, we added incremental hedges beyond our programmatic levels across most commodities, as we benefited from higher prices particularly in the prompt year. You can find our usual hedge disclosures in our earnings supplement presentation. During the fourth quarter and through the start of this year, we've continued to make progress on another one of our priorities; capital structure simplification. In the fourth quarter we redeemed our $125 million of 9% preferred units at CRP and will benefit from interest and administrative cost savings. We also purchased at par approximately $46 million of our 9.5% preferred shares at TRC, which become callable at 110% of par in March of 2021, so benefited from a discounted price and interest savings. In both the fourth quarter and thus far in 2021, we are continuing to manage our liquidity position. We issued $1 billion of new senior notes due in 2032 at an attractive 4% coupon. This allows us to push our maturity stack and generate interest savings and we currently have about $2.7 billion of available liquidity providing significant flexibility looking forward. Our consolidated reported debt-to-EBITDA ratio was approximately 4.7 times. As Matt mentioned, our progress on improving our leverage ratio is well underway improving from 5.5 times at the end of 2019 to 4.7 times at the end of 2020 to an expectation of around 4.25 times at the end of 2021. As we move towards our long-term consolidated leverage ratio target of three to four times. Since our November earnings call disclosure, we repurchased an additional approximately 980,000 shares of common stock under our $500 million share repurchase program. In total, we have repurchased approximately $92 million of common shares, at an average price of $16.68 per share. We received a lot of positive feedback from our additional DevCo disclosures in November, and have no changes to the underlying assumptions that we presented then. Our base case continues to be a full repurchase of the DevCo joint ventures in the first quarter of 2022, which would create attractive EBITDA growth in 2022 over 2021, and be an approximately leverage-neutral transaction. Building off of our strong performance in 2020 and Matt's detail on our operating performance expectations for 2021, we estimate full year 2021 adjusted EBITDA to increase 5% over 2020 based on the midpoint of our range. Our growth capital spending for 2021 will be meaningfully lower, as we completed substantially all of our remaining major projects in 2020. We estimate 2021 net growth CapEx to be between $350 million and $450 million, and net maintenance CapEx for 2021 of approximately $130 million. As mentioned, we expect to end 2021 with reported leverage of around 4.25 times, based on the midpoint of our 2021 EBITDA and CapEx estimates. Our consolidated leverage ratio will improve both from an expectation of higher EBITDA plus lower debt, as we expect to prioritize available free cash flow for debt repayment. We do not expect to be a significant cash taxpayer through at least 2024, based on current rules and our expectations for earnings and growth capital spending. There are no changes to our approach to capital allocation in 2021. Our priorities continue to be: one, improving our leverage ratios; and two, simplifying our corporate structure. In 2020, we were able to allocate capital to different opportunities that were presented to us, repurchasing debt, common shares and TRC preferred shares, plus redeeming the TRP preferred and looking forward, we will continue to be opportunistic as our expectation of strong performance will provide us with flexibility. For additional details related to our estimated 2021 outlook, please review our earnings supplement slides that accompany our webcast this morning, and which are also posted to the Investor's page of our website. Finally, I would like to echo Matt's comments that our business is performing very well across difficult periods, and my thank you to every Targa employee as we are so extremely proud of the continued exceptional performance of our entire Targa team. And with that, I will turn the call back to Sanjay.\nSanjay Lad: Thanks Jen. We kindly ask that you limit to one question and one follow-up and re-enter the Q&A line up, if you have additional questions. Cherry, would you please open the lines for Q&A?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Jeremy Tonet from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\nJeremy Tonet: Hi. Good morning. Hope everyone is well.\nMatt Melo: Hey, good morning, Jeremy.\nJeremy Tonet: Thanks. Just want to touch base on the guidance as you laid it out here. I was just trying to get a feel for the shape of the guidance over the year, if the second half kind of steps up over the first half year. And just want to think about if, it looks like the guidance might have been formed kind of at the end of last year and you provided the commodity price sensitivity, so we can bridge that to the strip and we can walk it up for the current commodity prices. But I was just curious, I guess, if it was set back then commodity prices have moved up have conversations with producers changed over that time period? Do you see the potential for maybe more activity than when you formulated the guidance at that point?\nMatt Melo: Yeah. Hey, Jeremy. Yeah. When we pulled together the guidance what's driving the growth is largely projects coming online throughout 2020 getting full year credit for that. And then, we're also anticipating 5% to 10% growth in the Permian. As volumes grow in the Permian, we'll be able to capture a fee for gathering and processing, but then also capturing the majority of those liquids down Grand Prix frac and then driving more exports. So I think as volumes trend higher across the Permian that's going to move growth generally in that direction throughout the year. You've seen in the past, we have had some seasonal impacts from our wholesale propane business and others, which do come into add margin in Q4 and Q1, relative to Q2 and Q3. But generally speaking, we're going to see a growth trajectory for Targa.\nJeremy Tonet: Great. Thanks. And just want to jump on to the comments as far as long-term leverage being three to four times, and if you're exiting this year 4.25 presumably. You, kind of, get to that three to four range at some point next year. And I was just wondering, how you think about the company at that point with regards to potentially reaching an investment-grade rating, or increasing dividend, or pressing down leverage lower? Just wanted to see once you get into that range, how you think about moving forward at that point?\nJen Kneale: Good morning, Jeremy, this is Jen. I think from our perspective we've been very transparent on becoming investment grade is also a priority of ours one that we think will occur naturally just given the projection of our business. So I think you're exactly right. We feel like we'll exit 2021 in very good shape. And that means that leverage should move into that long-range target when we get into 2022. I think given all of the uncertainty that we've all lived through over the last year plus in commodity markets, Matt and I have a preference for leverage to be lower than sort of getting to four times and staying around four times. But ultimately we'll have to see does that mean we're comfortable between 3.5 to four times, or would we like to move leverage lower? And that will also partially be dependent on opportunities we're seeing to continue to invest growth capital to engage in share repurchases et cetera. So we'll continue to evaluate as we move through time. But I think that we feel like we're exceptionally well-positioned as we look at the guidance and what it will mean for where we exit this year and what that will translate into going forward for the long-term.\nJeremy Tonet: That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Tristan Richardson from Truist Securities. Your line is now open.\nTristan Richardson: Hey good morning guys. Just to maybe follow-up on the previous question. I think we're, kind of, consistently hearing from midstream players that the outlook today will encourage producer activity throughout the year that suggests upside from budgets that may have been prepared previously. Does the high end of the guide incorporate that assumption for just improved activity beyond what we're seeing today, or is the high end of the guide just really kind of on the commodity price assumptions you're seeing today, and on sort of current customer behavior you're seeing today?\nMatt Meloy: Yeah. Hey, good morning Tristan. Yeah, I would say when we put this together it had a $50 crude oil environment in it. I think as we look at producer expectations, we are hearing from -- especially our larger producer customers more discipline around maintaining their plans and drilling plans for the year even in the face of increasing commodity prices. That said we have seen the rig count move up. We have seen frac crew\u2019s increase steadily. So to the extent we're meaningfully above that there could be some upside if prices hold here and stay like this throughout the year. I think that the incremental volumes at least on our system would come likely more from the small mid-cap producers who decide to add a rig or increase their activity as they generate more cash flow. And then we could also see some additional upside up in the Badlands, up in the Bakken area. If prices -- it is more price-sensitive up there. So we could see some more potential upside if prices are well in excess of our planning assumption.\nTristan Richardson: That's helpful Matt. And then just really briefly the follow-up I guess would be, is it too early to generally quantify the magnitude of the disruption we've seen over the past couple of weeks, or there's just a general framework or the way to think about the magnitude of what occurred and how that may translate to the guidance?\nMatt Meloy: Sure. I'd say, we are continuing to assess that. We're still ramping up. As I've said in the script we're about at 90% of pre-storm levels. So we're not back to where we were before yet. And part of quantification of that as we look through our assets -- over the last 10 days we were about at kind of an average of 50% rates across most of our businesses, which is really significant compared to winter storms we've experienced in the past. But when we look across our businesses, across our systems we're comfortable that that was a short-term event and we're still comfortable with our annual guidance that we provided. \nTristan Richardson: Make sense. Thank you guys very much.\nMatt Meloy: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Shneur Gershuni from UBS. Your line is now open.\nShneur Gershuni: Hi. Good morning, guys. Before I get to my two questions just want to confirm something you said to Tristan's first question. Did you say there was upside to the range or upside within the range for the outcomes that you talked about? \nMatt Meloy: Hey, Shneur. Good morning. Yes, I think, as I talked about it it's -- we did prepare that late last year in a, kind of, $50 crude world $0.55 NGL world. To the extent we're meaningful above that for extended period of time there could be more volumes than our range that we gave. It's still -- we're here in February and what we've experienced so far this year is some negatives to that right with the freeze offs and things that we saw early this year. So I think we're still comfortable with the 5% to 10% range we gave in the Permian, but it's still early in the year. \nShneur Gershuni: Okay. I appreciate that. Just wanted to focus on the recent debt raise that you did at the beginning of February. Originally you came to market for $500 million and then it was upside to $1 billion. I think you got 4% rates on it which seemed very attractive. I want to be careful not to use that we're prefunding as cash is ultimately fungible. But does this create added financial flexibility when thinking about Targa in terms of what you have in the upcoming year? Does it allow you to more easily finance the DevCo when the MOIC and the IRR cross at some point late this year or early next year? Just wondering if you can give us some thoughts around that?\nJen Kneale: Good morning, Shneur. This is Jen. I mean, absolutely it provides us with additional flexibility. And so by being able to term out additional debt, free up our revolvers as well as clean up some other series of notes that were callable just increases the flexibility that we have. We've got $2.7 billion of available liquidity. I wouldn't say that this is us trying to do something in advance of taking out the DevCos in Q1 of 2022, it's us being opportunistic. And we thankfully have benefited from a very robust high-yield market. So the opportunity to be able to issue $1 billion at 4% in our view was something that we wanted to utilize and do. So our prior assumptions may have been that we access the debt markets later in the year. Now we've been able to do that at again a very attractive rate earlier than we may have been assuming under prior scenarios. \nShneur Gershuni: Yes. Thank you for that. And for my official follow-up question just when, sort of, thinking about the drivers within your guidance for this year is it possible to rank order in terms of impact? What would drive you to the upper end? Is it specifically volumes through G&P? Is it volumes on Grand Prix, or should we be thinking downstream? Which one would give you the biggest impact in terms of moving towards the upper end? \nMatt Meloy: Yes, Shneur. As we think about variability within our range I think, for us the impact really starts for volumes out in the Permian because we're going to capture a G&P fee and then that does translate into Grand Prix volumes fractionation volumes and ultimately export volume. So if we're on the strong side of that or if things ramp a little higher out there that would be additional margin for us or additional EBITDA for us. I'd also say there's -- we have seen variability in what producers have told us and they've actually come back maybe even stronger than our initial expectations up in the Badlands. So to the extent there's more activity up there that could be some upside for us as well. \nJen Kneale: And then on price Shneur certainly to the extent that we continue to see prices at these levels or higher we would benefit. As Matt said in his scripted comments, we do have fee floors in a number of our G&P contracts. So recent prices are higher then that may create some margin uplift beyond what was assumed in the various scenarios underpinning our guidance range. \nShneur Gershuni: Perfect. Thank you very much for that. Appreciate it. And please stay safe and stay warm.\nJen Kneale: Thank you.\nMatt Meloy: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ujjwal Pradhan from Bank of America. Your line is now open.\nUjjwal Pradhan: Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to touch on your 2021 CapEx budget of $350 million to $450 million and the components of that. Other than well connect and the Heim plant invest spending, is there anything else baked into that budget? And maybe if you can speak to the range as well? \nMatt Meloy: Sure. Yes the major project in there is the Heim plant which is about $90 million. Most of that $90 million is in 2021. The rest would relate to fields growth that's compression pipelines bringing additional volumes to our processing facilities. And so, I'd say the range would also correlate to the range of our expected growth out in the Permian. If we get a little bit more growth out there and we're at the high side, it's likely going to come with more additional field level CapEx out there as well. So that's why we gave a range. We have some additional growth spending for additional connectivity around Belvieu as we're growing volumes. We have additional capital in there for that as well. It's not a \u2013 those aren't -- we don't usually call those out but there's some smaller items that aggregate some amount of capital there in the downstream as well. So if there's more activity more volumes you could have more connections downstream and also more capital spending on the G&P side. \nUjjwal Pradhan: Thanks Matt. And as a follow-up I wanted to get your latest thoughts on midstream M&A. Certainly we have seen some activity materialize recently including a transaction in the Mid-Con. What is Targa's latest thoughts on potentially being a buyer or a seller of assets? And more likely how you think about potentially divesting some of the declining G&P based assets? \nMatt Meloy: Yes. I'd say our view on that really hasn't changed. We have seen some activity from others. We have a really good position stand-alone being able to invest organically in our Permian footprint. We have millions of acres dedicated to us really good producer customers and relationship that's going to provide us with growth for years to come. So we don't feel like we have a need or we have to go out and fill a hole or acquire something. We have a really good position on the G&P side and our NPL side of the business. So we'll be opportunistic. We'd continue to look if there's some opportunities that line up with the overall targets and metrics that we talked about earlier. We want to continue to deleverage generate free cash flow and the like. So if we can find some acquisitions that fit into that and compete with our organic growth spending I think we'd continue to take a hard look at those. But it's a pretty high hurdle for that to actually occur. So I think most of what you're going to see here at least in the short medium term it's going to be us focused on organic growth. \nUjjwal Pradhan: Appreciate your comments. Thanks Matt.\nMatt Meloy: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Christine Cho from Barclays. Your line is now open.\nChristine Cho: Thank you. Good morning. So if I could follow-up to Tristan's question about the weather impact and recognizing that you're still comfortable with the guidance range, but I just want to maybe understand how things in operations actually work. So you're highly hedged for natural gas this year. And as we think about the weather events last week, is there a scenario in which you still have to deliver the gas and with your plants offline, you're actually short gas and you actually have to buy it in the open market, or do you have gas in storage that would make that scenario unlikely, or was the price upside for volumes coming out of the plants that were still online more than offsetting that? Like how should I think about that? \nMatt Meloy: Sure. Yes. As it relates to the weather impact on our corporate hedges, so two things; one, we have cushion to the volumes that we hedge. So when we hedge it's an -- it'd be a monthly volume amount. So as we were down -- as we were down it would eat into that cushion that we have. So we talked about hedging 90% of our volumes for 2021. So we have some cushion for instances like these. Also when we hedge we're hedging versus first a month. So the huge price spike that you saw was cash or spot market our hedges are not settled against the cash or spot market. They're hedged against first a month and those were relatively normal prices. So relative to our hedging program, we don't see a big minus or plus there.\nChristine Cho: Okay. Helpful. And then in fourth quarter, I believe some of the NGLs that were moving on third-party pipes moved on to your pipes. Did you get a full quarter impact from that, or is there some spillover into 1Q? And then I think there's still some more volumes that will migrate onto your system over the next several years. But would you be able to quantify how much we should expect in future years, or just any other color that would help us frame how we should think about it?\nMatt Meloy: Yeah. So we've -- since Grand Prix has been in operation, we've continued as contracts roll move volumes from other pipelines on to ours. We did have some of that here in the back half of last year. And we're going to over the next several years kind of have some more, right? So we're not giving specific clarity on the amount or size or when those happen, but just kind of talk generally. And so we did have some of that in the back half of 2021. I think as we go forward here for the short medium term most of what we have in terms of Grand Prix growth is going to be from organic growth across our footprint and from third-party customers where we have commitments and acreage dedications.\nJen Kneale: And part of why we gave guidance Christine on Grand Prix is just because it's ramped so rapidly, since it came into service. It's generally not our practice to give single asset guidance. But for this one we thought it was important when you looked at 2021 relative to 2020 just because we did have a rapid ramp as we moved through really the pipe coming in service in late 2019.\nChristine Cho: So it sounds like the fourth quarter number is a good starting point and we just layer on whatever growth we expect from the Permian for you guys? Is that kind of accurate?\nMatt Meloy: I'd say that's a reasonable assumption. We're -- there's always some amount of transportation volumes that we have that are on shorter term. But those come and go. And so we think starting with Q4 and then building on some growth is a reasonable expectation. We could have some pluses or minuses from shorter-term volume and more.\nChristine Cho: Got it. Thank you.\nMatt Meloy: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Spiro Dounis from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.\nSpiro Dounis: Matt, hey, Jen. Just wanted to follow-up on ethane recovery just to get a sense of how much that could be a tailwind into 2021. I know last year for a good portion of it I think you were fully recovering the Permian, not sure what the case was in other basins. But just curious, how you're thinking about that potential tailwind in 2021, how much of that's incorporated in the guidance? \nMatt Meloy: Sure. Yeah. In terms of ethane recovery, we have done a lot of work on our processing plants out in West Texas to basically be able to recover more ethane. So as that work was kind of getting done and wrapping up last year, we still have some more to do that could increase recoveries on our G&P system and bring incremental volumes down Grand Prix and frac. So I'd say there's some potential for upside, but we've been for the most part in recovery on most of our processing within GMP, not all of it, but within most. So there will be some upside from just better mechanical recoveries from us doing maintenance work on our processing plants.\nSpiro Dounis: Okay. Understood. That's helpful. And Jen second one is for you. Just with respect to the DevCo interest. I know you're not changing any of your base case assumptions. But and I think one of the data points you provided at last quarter's call was an implied acquisition multiple in the five to six time range. It seems like market has tightened considerably since then has improved since then. Things seem to be going well. So just curious splitting hairs in a little bit, but just curious if that multiple is trending closer to the 5times as opposed to the 6 times at this point?\nJen Kneale: I think when you think about the three assets that are in the DevCos you've had GCX which is essentially take-or-pay residue pipeline, you've got our frac train that essentially has been running well utilized since it came in service. So you're really pointing at Grand Prix to potentially say is it performing better this quarter versus our expectations when we put that out in November. I mean, I'd say that it's not a material change. We have had very robust expectations for Grand Prix and it's absolutely continuing to deliver as a game-changer for our company. But I wouldn't say that there's a material change there such that you should be thinking that it's altering our base case assumptions Spiro. \nSpiro Dounis: Understood. Helpful color. Thanks everybody. Be well.\nMatt Meloy: Hey thank you.\nJen Kneale: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes through the line of Keith Stanley from Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.\nKeith Stanley: Hi thanks. First question just curious the outlook you guys see for LPG exports. We saw really good growth in the second half of the year with the expansion. Curious how much of the volumes we saw especially in Q4 have to do with favorable winter -- kind of a favorable winter season globally versus how much you expect that that level of exports could really be sustained through the year with new contracts and I guess the markets staying strong?\nMatt Meloy: Yes sure. On the export side, we really did have a favorable export market in Q4. You saw us kind of have record results over 11 million barrels. I think longer term a lot of the fundamentals that set up a strong Q4 are going to be there over the longer term. But here in the first quarter you've seen some headwinds related to weather impacts propane ship availability, you have had some issues here in the first quarter. I think those are going to work themselves out over time as supply kind of comes back on the Y-grade NGL side as we're making more propane it's going to have to hit the water and clear. So, I think going forward, longer term expectations are very good for exports. There will be some weakness or softness in the first quarter.\nKeith Stanley: Great. And second question just on a follow-up on what happened last week in Texas. First just how do you buy electricity in Texas? Is it mainly through sort of market prices, or do you have fixed rate contracts or hedges for most of your needs? And then just clarifying all the comments on the call so far. It sounds like the impacts of the events last week it's primarily just short-term volume impacts on your assets being down for this period and that's really primarily what we're looking at.\nMatt Meloy: Yes. Sure. I mean as it relates to the weather impacts, I really don't want to get into specifics on how -- I mean it's different for different assets. Different in downstream than it is on G&P. We have a number of arrangements on electricity. But when we look at the total how we buy electricity how volumes have moved across all of our footprint we're comfortable with our guidance range. So, I think that's where we stand on the kind of in aggregate impacts on the weather. \nKeith Stanley: Thanks.\nMatt Meloy: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Pearce Hammond from Simmons Energy. Your line is now open.\nPearce Hammond: Good morning. Just one question from me. I'm just curious do you see any new business opportunities for Targa related to the energy transition to capitalize on Targa's core competencies whether that be in carbon capture storage hydrogen whatever have related to the energy transition? Thank you.\nMatt Meloy: Sure. Absolutely. Yes. As it relates to new business opportunities I think first we'd look -- I just want to reiterate that natural gas, NGLs, LPGs we think this business is going to be around for a long time for decades to come. But with that said we are continuing to look at other opportunities. We think we have time to evaluate those to see if any of those make sense for Targa. But we are right now actively looking at whether we want to participate in renewable projects wind and solar. So, we're evaluating those. They don't necessarily have to be from a capital position. We can participate in those as an off-take because we are a large purchaser of electricity. So, we can support those projects without necessarily putting capital into those projects. So, we're looking to see how we can be a part of that kind of renewable solution there. And as it relates to carbon capture I'd say there are some opportunities for us in that area that would fit our core competences laying pipeline gathering and aggregating CO2. So, we are looking at some of those projects as well. I'd say stay tuned. There's more to come there. There is more to come on that and we do have some time to kind of continue to evaluate about what is our role going to be in that. It doesn't necessarily have to be from a capital position. If we're going to spend capital, we need to earn a good return on that. But there are other ways to participate in those projects as well.\nPearce Hammond: Okay. Thank you very much Matt for the helpful answer.\nMatt Meloy: Sure. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Blum from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.\nMichael Blum: Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Just want to follow-up on the LPG export question. In particular, just wanted to better understand the impact for the last couple of weeks with the freezing weather, is that a -- is this just a -- I wanted to understand I guess, the better -- really the operational impacts? And is it really very short-term and now things are back up, or I guess I'm looking for more like a real-time look into how that business is recovering this week.\nScott Pryor: Hey, Michael, this is Scott. Let me just, I guess complement some of the things that Matt was saying earlier. When you look at the fourth quarter, for instance, the 11.3 million barrels that we had across the dock during that quarter, certainly benefited from our phased-in expansion, which was inclusive of our third refrigeration unit at Galena Park. But it also benefited from cold weather really across the globe, especially in the Far East. And then of course, we were able to squeeze in a number of spot cargoes during that fourth quarter. So in aggregate, we had a lot of benefit in the quarter that put us over that 11 million barrels. When we look at the first quarter, as Matt alluded to, we've had some FOB delays during the first half of this quarter. Certainly the weather event last week had an impact to our operations. But we've made great progress in putting the facility back online. So we are back to loading cargoes at this point. This -- obviously though the event tightens up our schedule for our term lifters. So the opportunity for spot cargoes that we saw similar in the fourth quarter is tougher. But we still -- when we look at the long term view of the facility, both for 2021 and beyond, the fundamental stack up very positively in our favor.\nMichael Blum: Great. And then, just one follow-up to that. In terms of the, what's going on in the congestion at the Panama Canal, do you see that as just a short-term issue that gets resolved, or do you think that's a longer-term issue and maybe changes some of the routes permanently for LPG cargoes?\nScott Pryor: We've seen a number of delays throughout the second half of last year as things started tightening up at the Panama Canal. The expansion obviously that took a number of years to put in place, but has been in place for a few years now certainly helped transit times, both for LPGs as well as larger cargoes transiting the canal. With that said, LPG has had some difficulties and has had a number of delays during that second half of the year. We have seen improvement during the back half of the fourth quarter. You've seen charter rates that have come down significantly over the course of the last four weeks. So things are improving. But, I think there's always a decision to make for the vessel owners. Do they take the transit through the Panama Canal, or do they go ahead and move around the Cape of Good Hope? So those are always decisions that can be made and depends upon what the delays look like, what the transit times look like relative to the markets they're going to. So, those are decisions that are made periodically throughout various quarters and months.\nMichael Blum: Great, thank you very much.\nScott Pryor: Thank you, Michael.\nMatt Meloy: Okay. Thank you, Michael.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of James Carreker from U.S. Capital Advisors. Your line is now open.\nJames Carreker: Hi, guys. Thanks for the questions. Just wondering if you guys might talk about just the Permian outlook and the potential for new plants there. You've obviously got the Heim plant coming in later this year. What could the time line be for the next plant there? And can you kind of compare that to how much remaining capacity is out in the Delaware? And what would be the time line to potentially needing something on the Delaware side?\nMatt Meloy: Yes. Sure. Thanks for the question, James. As we look through out at the Permian, every time we brought a plant on, it's been fully utilized relatively quickly. We would expect the same to occur when we have the Heim plant later this year. So I think as we see volumes, how they respond, coming back from these recent weather events, but also what the volumes look like relative to the commodity price environment we're in. Kind of in the first part of this year, I think we'll be likely making a decision of do we need another plant? Maybe that slips to the back half of this year. But I think at some point in this year we'll have enough visibility to say, well, we think not only Heim is going to be full, but we need to add another plant. And we've already been evaluating options to add another one, another plant out there, whether it's moving another one of our plants from another area we have, or putting in a new plant. We're evaluating that to see what the best option is for Targa. This would be a really good add for us, adding additional processing in the Permian Midland when you get the G&P fee and then a transport frac and more volumes for export, really good economics for us. Now that we've got the capital in place on the downstream side of things. So a really good return for us, as volumes continue to grow out in the Midland. And on the Delaware side, with bringing on Falcon and Peregrine, it feels like we have more time more runway out there. So we're just going to continue to evaluate those volumes. There's also some excess capacity out there from other processors as well. So even if volumes ramp and we needed more capacity, we could even look at potential off loads, if it needed to bridge a gap for us there as we're building a new plant. So we have more flexibility out there. The capacity on the Midland side, just all around is tighter. \nJames Carreker: Got you. I appreciate that color. And then, I guess, switching topics a bit, just on ESG. A lot of producers are now committing to reducing GHG emissions and intensity, just any thoughts for you guys about putting some emissions reductions targets out there this year or sometime in the near future?\nMatt Meloy: Yes. I mean that is something we know it's been talked about quite a bit. A number of producers and other midstreamers have put targets out there. I'd say, that's something that we are taking a hard look at internally, amongst the management team and with our Board about what if any targets and goals we want internally and externally. So I'd say, we're in the evaluation process of that of, kind of, what the goals would be and how we'd articulate those, but we are working to reduce our overall emissions and continuing to kind of improve our metrics on flaring and emissions across the board, while we're evaluating what the best goals would be.\nJames Carreker: Thanks.\nMatt Meloy: Yes. Thank you.\nOperator: Our last question comes from the line of Shneur Gershuni from UBS. Your line is now open.\nShneur Gershuni: Hi, guys. Sorry for the follow-up question here. I just wanted to go back to the response on asset sales and divestments and so forth. It just sort of seems like the PE market is starting to heat up again. Any specific thoughts around the Badlands asset maybe sell it -- the balance of it or GCF for the Louisiana frac, just sort of like, get to a point where you're completely focused on the Permian system that you described earlier about the integrated benefits of it?\nJen Kneale: Shneur, this is Jen. I think that, we're very pleased that we sold the 45% interest in the Badlands to GSO when we did and they've been a great partner of ours. So we like the Bakken exposure that we have at this point in time. And do you think particularly when you look at what crude prices are beginning to look like for the next several years, hopefully there's even more upside there than we're currently forecasting. So we don't have any active processes underway related to asset sales. We've been very open upon acquiring the DevCos one of the assets that may make sense for us to consider selling would be something like our interest in Gulf Coast Express, where we are not the operator and we are not the majority owner. So I think something like that is more consistent with how we've talked publicly about potential divestitures. But clearly, part of our job is to look at any opportunities to liquidate any assets. But, again, we don't have any active processes underway right now.\nShneur Gershuni: All right. Perfect. Thank you very much. Appreciate the clarification and have a great day.\nJen Kneale: Thanks, Shneur. You too.\nOperator: I am showing no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the conference back to Sanjay Lad.\nSanjay Lad: We thank everyone that was on the call this morning and we appreciate your interest in Targa Resources. The IR team will be available for any follow-up questions you may have. Thank you and have a great day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you all for your participation and have a wonderful day. You may all disconnect.",

            "content": "Hey, good morning, Jeremy. Yeah. Hey, Jeremy. Yeah. When we pulled together the guidance what's driving the growth is largely projects coming online throughout 2020 getting full year credit for that. And then, we're also anticipating 5% to 10% growth in the Permian. As volumes grow in the Permian, we'll be able to capture a fee for gathering and processing, but then also capturing the majority of those liquids down Grand Prix frac and then driving more exports. So I think as volumes trend higher across the Permian that's going to move growth generally in that direction throughout the year. You've seen in the past, we have had some seasonal impacts from our wholesale propane business and others, which do come into add margin in Q4 and Q1, relative to Q2 and Q3. But generally speaking, we're going to see a growth trajectory for Targa."

            "name": "Jen Kneale",
            "content": "Thanks Matt. Targa's reported quarterly adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $438 million, increasing 5% over the third quarter. During the fourth quarter, Targa generated free cash flow of $215 million. Higher sequential operating expenses were primarily attributable to certain one-time hurricane repairs and integrity spending during the fourth quarter, and additional assets being fully online. Higher G&A expenses were attributable to higher compensation and legal costs. Our full year 2020 reported adjusted EBITDA was $1.64 billion, exceeding the high end of our financial guidance range and we generated $575 million of free cash flow in the year. Through extensive cost reduction efforts, in 2020 we achieved significant aggregate expense savings versus our plan and we expect many of these savings to carry forward into 2021 and beyond particularly related to labor. Looking to 2021, we do expect operating and G&A expenses to be modestly higher than 2020, largely from additional assets and service that will drive both additional OpEx and ad valorem costs and also higher insurance costs. Greater volume throughput across our system will also result in higher costs. We remain significantly hedged for 2021 and continue to add hedges for 2021 and beyond. Relative to when we last reported in November, we added incremental hedges beyond our programmatic levels across most commodities, as we benefited from higher prices particularly in the prompt year. You can find our usual hedge disclosures in our earnings supplement presentation. During the fourth quarter and through the start of this year, we've continued to make progress on another one of our priorities; capital structure simplification. In the fourth quarter we redeemed our $125 million of 9% preferred units at CRP and will benefit from interest and administrative cost savings. We also purchased at par approximately $46 million of our 9.5% preferred shares at TRC, which become callable at 110% of par in March of 2021, so benefited from a discounted price and interest savings. In both the fourth quarter and thus far in 2021, we are continuing to manage our liquidity position. We issued $1 billion of new senior notes due in 2032 at an attractive 4% coupon. This allows us to push our maturity stack and generate interest savings and we currently have about $2.7 billion of available liquidity providing significant flexibility looking forward. Our consolidated reported debt-to-EBITDA ratio was approximately 4.7 times. As Matt mentioned, our progress on improving our leverage ratio is well underway improving from 5.5 times at the end of 2019 to 4.7 times at the end of 2020 to an expectation of around 4.25 times at the end of 2021. As we move towards our long-term consolidated leverage ratio target of three to four times. Since our November earnings call disclosure, we repurchased an additional approximately 980,000 shares of common stock under our $500 million share repurchase program. In total, we have repurchased approximately $92 million of common shares, at an average price of $16.68 per share. We received a lot of positive feedback from our additional DevCo disclosures in November, and have no changes to the underlying assumptions that we presented then. Our base case continues to be a full repurchase of the DevCo joint ventures in the first quarter of 2022, which would create attractive EBITDA growth in 2022 over 2021, and be an approximately leverage-neutral transaction. Building off of our strong performance in 2020 and Matt's detail on our operating performance expectations for 2021, we estimate full year 2021 adjusted EBITDA to increase 5% over 2020 based on the midpoint of our range. Our growth capital spending for 2021 will be meaningfully lower, as we completed substantially all of our remaining major projects in 2020. We estimate 2021 net growth CapEx to be between $350 million and $450 million, and net maintenance CapEx for 2021 of approximately $130 million. As mentioned, we expect to end 2021 with reported leverage of around 4.25 times, based on the midpoint of our 2021 EBITDA and CapEx estimates. Our consolidated leverage ratio will improve both from an expectation of higher EBITDA plus lower debt, as we expect to prioritize available free cash flow for debt repayment. We do not expect to be a significant cash taxpayer through at least 2024, based on current rules and our expectations for earnings and growth capital spending. There are no changes to our approach to capital allocation in 2021. Our priorities continue to be: one, improving our leverage ratios; and two, simplifying our corporate structure. In 2020, we were able to allocate capital to different opportunities that were presented to us, repurchasing debt, common shares and TRC preferred shares, plus redeeming the TRP preferred and looking forward, we will continue to be opportunistic as our expectation of strong performance will provide us with flexibility. For additional details related to our estimated 2021 outlook, please review our earnings supplement slides that accompany our webcast this morning, and which are also posted to the Investor's page of our website. Finally, I would like to echo Matt's comments that our business is performing very well across difficult periods, and my thank you to every Targa employee as we are so extremely proud of the continued exceptional performance of our entire Targa team. And with that, I will turn the call back to Sanjay. Good morning, Jeremy, this is Jen. I think from our perspective we've been very transparent on becoming investment grade is also a priority of ours one that we think will occur naturally just given the projection of our business. So I think you're exactly right. We feel like we'll exit 2021 in very good shape. And that means that leverage should move into that long-range target when we get into 2022. I think given all of the uncertainty that we've all lived through over the last year plus in commodity markets, Matt and I have a preference for leverage to be lower than sort of getting to four times and staying around four times. But ultimately we'll have to see does that mean we're comfortable between 3.5 to four times, or would we like to move leverage lower? And that will also partially be dependent on opportunities we're seeing to continue to invest growth capital to engage in share repurchases et cetera. So we'll continue to evaluate as we move through time. But I think that we feel like we're exceptionally well-positioned as we look at the guidance and what it will mean for where we exit this year and what that will translate into going forward for the long-term. Good morning, Shneur. This is Jen. I mean, absolutely it provides us with additional flexibility. And so by being able to term out additional debt, free up our revolvers as well as clean up some other series of notes that were callable just increases the flexibility that we have. We've got $2.7 billion of available liquidity. I wouldn't say that this is us trying to do something in advance of taking out the DevCos in Q1 of 2022, it's us being opportunistic. And we thankfully have benefited from a very robust high-yield market. So the opportunity to be able to issue $1 billion at 4% in our view was something that we wanted to utilize and do. So our prior assumptions may have been that we access the debt markets later in the year. Now we've been able to do that at again a very attractive rate earlier than we may have been assuming under prior scenarios. And then on price Shneur certainly to the extent that we continue to see prices at these levels or higher we would benefit. As Matt said in his scripted comments, we do have fee floors in a number of our G&P contracts. So recent prices are higher then that may create some margin uplift beyond what was assumed in the various scenarios underpinning our guidance range. Thank you. And part of why we gave guidance Christine on Grand Prix is just because it's ramped so rapidly, since it came into service. It's generally not our practice to give single asset guidance. But for this one we thought it was important when you looked at 2021 relative to 2020 just because we did have a rapid ramp as we moved through really the pipe coming in service in late 2019. I think when you think about the three assets that are in the DevCos you've had GCX which is essentially take-or-pay residue pipeline, you've got our frac train that essentially has been running well utilized since it came in service. So you're really pointing at Grand Prix to potentially say is it performing better this quarter versus our expectations when we put that out in November. I mean, I'd say that it's not a material change. We have had very robust expectations for Grand Prix and it's absolutely continuing to deliver as a game-changer for our company. But I wouldn't say that there's a material change there such that you should be thinking that it's altering our base case assumptions Spiro. Thank you. Shneur, this is Jen. I think that, we're very pleased that we sold the 45% interest in the Badlands to GSO when we did and they've been a great partner of ours. So we like the Bakken exposure that we have at this point in time. And do you think particularly when you look at what crude prices are beginning to look like for the next several years, hopefully there's even more upside there than we're currently forecasting. So we don't have any active processes underway related to asset sales. We've been very open upon acquiring the DevCos one of the assets that may make sense for us to consider selling would be something like our interest in Gulf Coast Express, where we are not the operator and we are not the majority owner. So I think something like that is more consistent with how we've talked publicly about potential divestitures. But clearly, part of our job is to look at any opportunities to liquidate any assets. But, again, we don't have any active processes underway right now. Thanks, Shneur. You too."

            "name": "Matt Meloy",
            "content": "Thanks, Sanjay and good morning. 2020 had its ups and downs, but it ended up being a really good year for Targa. Record EBITDA, record volumes, but the thing I'm most proud of is how our Targa team responded to the numerous challenges throughout the year, including COVID-19. And now, with the recent cold weather that affected Texas and many other states, 2021 has arrived with its own challenges. Our employees have done a tremendous job, working in very difficult conditions, many without power, heat and water in their home. So, I'd like to thank Targa employees for all their hard work and dedication. We are exceptionally proud of our Targa team, who manage through these extreme conditions, and continue to operate our facilities safely. The most recent winter storm impacted, both our gathering and processing and downstream operations. Over the trailing 10 days, we experienced on average, a 50% reduction across our G&P and downstream system volumes. Volumes are continuing to ramp and current rates have since returned to around 90% of pre-severe weather levels. This overall event is still relatively short-term in nature, and we are comfortable with the full year 2021 guidance that we published last week. Our long-term business outlook continues to be strong. Let's now turn to 2020 highlights. Our overall business performed very well, led by our position in the Permian Basin and our integrated NGL platform. Full year, 2020 adjusted EBITDA of $1.64 billion, exceeded the top end of our guidance range and was within our initial range, presented in early 2020. We believe, that our key strategic efforts around recontracting to add fees in gathering and processing, reducing growth capital spending, identifying opportunities to reduce operating and G&A expenses, reducing our dividend and focusing on integrated opportunities, position us for a successful 2021 and beyond. In 2020, we completed several major projects on time and on budget, including two processing plants in the Permian, two fractionation trains in Mont Belvieu, the phased expansion of our LPG export capabilities and the extension of our Grand Prix pipeline into Central Oklahoma. These expansions position Targa to benefit from increasing operating leverage moving forward. Our total net growth capital spending for 2020 was about $600 million, which was about $100 million below, the bottom end of our range, driven by the high grading of growth opportunities and a huge effort by our engineers and operators to be creative and capital efficient.  In 2020, increasing EBITDA and reduced growth capital spending resulted in improving leverage metrics and we exited 2020 with reported leverage of 4.7 times, a meaningful reduction from the 5.5 times leverage to end 2019.  Higher EBITDA and lower growth CapEx also provided additional flexibility to be opportunistic throughout the year, which resulted in us buying back publicly-traded notes, common equity and a small piece of the TRC preferred shares all at very attractive prices.  Looking ahead, we estimate full year 2021 adjusted EBITDA to be between 1.65 -- $1.675 billion and $1.775 billion. Net growth capital spending in 2021 will be significantly lower, which we estimate to be between $350 million and $450 million, positioning us to generate increasing free cash flow after dividend to continue to reduce leverage.  We expect to end 2021 with reported leverage of around 4.25 times. This guidance is inclusive of our limited exposure from some of the recent government actions around activity on federal lands with less than 5% of Targa's Permian volumes currently from affected areas.  Let's now turn to our operational performance and business outlook. Starting in the Permian, during 2020 our systems across the Midland and Delaware Basins demonstrated significant resiliency despite reduced activity levels and temporary shut-ins, which impacted the industry.  Targa's 2020 Permian inlet volumes increased 19% over 2019 and we expect to benefit from this positive momentum as we move through 2021. During the fourth quarter, we took a number of our plants in the Permian Midland down for maintenance and this has allowed for improved NGL recoveries across our system.  We are seeing increasing activity levels across both our Midland and Delaware footprints. For 2021, we expect our average total Permian inlet volumes to increase between 5% and 10% over 2020.  With our Permian Midland system running close to capacity our new 200 million cubic feet per day Heim plant will be much needed and remains on track to begin operations during the fourth quarter of 2021 and we currently have adequate processing capacity in Permian Delaware to accommodate our anticipated growth in 2021.  The supply growth from our Permian G&P systems will continue to drive increasing volumes through our Grand Prix pipeline and our fractionation complex in Mont-Bellevue. In addition to incremental supply available to move across our LPG export facility.  Moving on to the Badlands, our gas volumes during the fourth quarter sequentially increased 4% and our crude volumes were flat relative to the third quarter. We are seeing activity levels and completions increase across our system, which is a positive sign.  Turning to our Central region, which continues to largely be in decline gas inlet volumes in the fourth quarter declined 5% over the third quarter. We continue to have some shut-in volumes in South Oak, which we expect to come back online in the first half of 2021.  Overall, we expect volumes across our central systems to be lower in 2021 relative to 2020. For 2021, we estimate the volume growth in our Permian region to offset anticipated declines across our central regions and estimate our total field G&P inlet volumes in 2021 to be flat year-over-year.  The durability of our Gathering and Processing segment margin has strengthened as we have reduced our commodity exposure by adding fees and fee floors to our G&P contracts. Our Permian G&P business is now approximately 65% fee-based. And overall, we estimate about 85% fee-based margin across all of Targa for 2021.  The financial performance of our G&P segment is now more driven by volume throughput and fees as opposed to direct commodity prices, which was evidenced in our 2020 results. With the fee floor arrangements we have in place, we will continue to benefit as prices rise.  Shifting to our Logistics and Transportation segment, our Grand Prix pipeline continues to perform very well. Fourth quarter throughput volumes on Grand Prix sequentially increased 18% driven by increasing NGL production from Targa's Permian plants including our new gateway plant.  Our Grand Prix extension in the Central Oklahoma began operations at the end of the fourth quarter. We expect strong performance on Grand Prix to continue throughout 2021 and estimate deliveries into Mont-Bellevue to increase 25% or more over 2020 average throughput.  At our fractionation complex in Mont Belvieu, fourth quarter fractionation volumes remained strong and also benefited from working down inventory we built as a result of our scheduled maintenance and upgrades performed during the third quarter at our facilities. Our LPG export services business at Galena Park continued to perform well, as we moved the Targa record 11.3 million barrels per month during the fourth quarter, benefiting from a full quarter of our recently completed phase expansion in addition to capturing some short-term volumes during the fourth quarter driven by strong fundamentals, and the outlook for full 2021 remains strong. In the past, we have talked about capacity at our export facility to be about 15 million barrels per month. Now that we've gone through a full quarter of operations following our expansion and to appropriately manage expectations going forward, we think that our effective working capacity at Galena Park is about 12.5 million barrels per month. There is potential to exceed that for a given month if we load more butanes, but we think that up to 12.5 million barrels per month is a better representation of our overall working capacity. As we look forward, we are in a position where we expect to have the ability to capture growth opportunities from the Permian without having to spend much incremental CapEx on Grand Prix fractionation or LPG export facilities. This puts Targa in a position to generate strong returns going forward and increasing free cash flow after dividends available to reduce debt and further strengthen our financial position. With our premier integrated asset position and our talented employees Targa is well positioned for the longer-term. With that, I will now turn the call over to Jen. Yeah. Hey, good morning Tristan. Yeah, I would say when we put this together it had a $50 crude oil environment in it. I think as we look at producer expectations, we are hearing from -- especially our larger producer customers more discipline around maintaining their plans and drilling plans for the year even in the face of increasing commodity prices. That said we have seen the rig count move up. We have seen frac crew's increase steadily. So to the extent we're meaningfully above that there could be some upside if prices hold here and stay like this throughout the year. I think that the incremental volumes at least on our system would come likely more from the small mid-cap producers who decide to add a rig or increase their activity as they generate more cash flow. And then we could also see some additional upside up in the Badlands, up in the Bakken area. If prices -- it is more price-sensitive up there. So we could see some more potential upside if prices are well in excess of our planning assumption. Sure. I'd say, we are continuing to assess that. We're still ramping up. As I've said in the script we're about at 90% of pre-storm levels. So we're not back to where we were before yet. And part of quantification of that as we look through our assets -- over the last 10 days we were about at kind of an average of 50% rates across most of our businesses, which is really significant compared to winter storms we've experienced in the past. But when we look across our businesses, across our systems we're comfortable that that was a short-term event and we're still comfortable with our annual guidance that we provided. Okay. Thank you. Hey, Shneur. Good morning. Yes, I think, as I talked about it it's -- we did prepare that late last year in a, kind of, $50 crude world $0.55 NGL world. To the extent we're meaningful above that for extended period of time there could be more volumes than our range that we gave. It's still -- we're here in February and what we've experienced so far this year is some negatives to that right with the freeze offs and things that we saw early this year. So I think we're still comfortable with the 5% to 10% range we gave in the Permian, but it's still early in the year. Yes, Shneur. As we think about variability within our range I think, for us the impact really starts for volumes out in the Permian because we're going to capture a G&P fee and then that does translate into Grand Prix volumes fractionation volumes and ultimately export volume. So if we're on the strong side of that or if things ramp a little higher out there that would be additional margin for us or additional EBITDA for us. I'd also say there's -- we have seen variability in what producers have told us and they've actually come back maybe even stronger than our initial expectations up in the Badlands. So to the extent there's more activity up there that could be some upside for us as well. Okay. Thank you. Sure. Yes the major project in there is the Heim plant which is about $90 million. Most of that $90 million is in 2021. The rest would relate to fields growth that's compression pipelines bringing additional volumes to our processing facilities. And so, I'd say the range would also correlate to the range of our expected growth out in the Permian. If we get a little bit more growth out there and we're at the high side, it's likely going to come with more additional field level CapEx out there as well. So that's why we gave a range. We have some additional growth spending for additional connectivity around Belvieu as we're growing volumes. We have additional capital in there for that as well. It's not a \u2013 those aren't -- we don't usually call those out but there's some smaller items that aggregate some amount of capital there in the downstream as well. So if there's more activity more volumes you could have more connections downstream and also more capital spending on the G&P side. Yes. I'd say our view on that really hasn't changed. We have seen some activity from others. We have a really good position stand-alone being able to invest organically in our Permian footprint. We have millions of acres dedicated to us really good producer customers and relationship that's going to provide us with growth for years to come. So we don't feel like we have a need or we have to go out and fill a hole or acquire something. We have a really good position on the G&P side and our NPL side of the business. So we'll be opportunistic. We'd continue to look if there's some opportunities that line up with the overall targets and metrics that we talked about earlier. We want to continue to deleverage generate free cash flow and the like. So if we can find some acquisitions that fit into that and compete with our organic growth spending I think we'd continue to take a hard look at those. But it's a pretty high hurdle for that to actually occur. So I think most of what you're going to see here at least in the short medium term it's going to be us focused on organic growth. Thank you. Sure. Yes. As it relates to the weather impact on our corporate hedges, so two things; one, we have cushion to the volumes that we hedge. So when we hedge it's an -- it'd be a monthly volume amount. So as we were down -- as we were down it would eat into that cushion that we have. So we talked about hedging 90% of our volumes for 2021. So we have some cushion for instances like these. Also when we hedge we're hedging versus first a month. So the huge price spike that you saw was cash or spot market our hedges are not settled against the cash or spot market. They're hedged against first a month and those were relatively normal prices. So relative to our hedging program, we don't see a big minus or plus there. Yeah. So we've -- since Grand Prix has been in operation, we've continued as contracts roll move volumes from other pipelines on to ours. We did have some of that here in the back half of last year. And we're going to over the next several years kind of have some more, right? So we're not giving specific clarity on the amount or size or when those happen, but just kind of talk generally. And so we did have some of that in the back half of 2021. I think as we go forward here for the short medium term most of what we have in terms of Grand Prix growth is going to be from organic growth across our footprint and from third-party customers where we have commitments and acreage dedications. I'd say that's a reasonable assumption. We're -- there's always some amount of transportation volumes that we have that are on shorter term. But those come and go. And so we think starting with Q4 and then building on some growth is a reasonable expectation. We could have some pluses or minuses from shorter-term volume and more. Okay. Thank you. Sure. Yeah. In terms of ethane recovery, we have done a lot of work on our processing plants out in West Texas to basically be able to recover more ethane. So as that work was kind of getting done and wrapping up last year, we still have some more to do that could increase recoveries on our G&P system and bring incremental volumes down Grand Prix and frac. So I'd say there's some potential for upside, but we've been for the most part in recovery on most of our processing within GMP, not all of it, but within most. So there will be some upside from just better mechanical recoveries from us doing maintenance work on our processing plants. Hey thank you. Yes sure. On the export side, we really did have a favorable export market in Q4. You saw us kind of have record results over 11 million barrels. I think longer term a lot of the fundamentals that set up a strong Q4 are going to be there over the longer term. But here in the first quarter you've seen some headwinds related to weather impacts propane ship availability, you have had some issues here in the first quarter. I think those are going to work themselves out over time as supply kind of comes back on the Y-grade NGL side as we're making more propane it's going to have to hit the water and clear. So, I think going forward, longer term expectations are very good for exports. There will be some weakness or softness in the first quarter. Yes. Sure. I mean as it relates to the weather impacts, I really don't want to get into specifics on how -- I mean it's different for different assets. Different in downstream than it is on G&P. We have a number of arrangements on electricity. But when we look at the total how we buy electricity how volumes have moved across all of our footprint we're comfortable with our guidance range. So, I think that's where we stand on the kind of in aggregate impacts on the weather. Thank you. Sure. Absolutely. Yes. As it relates to new business opportunities I think first we'd look -- I just want to reiterate that natural gas, NGLs, LPGs we think this business is going to be around for a long time for decades to come. But with that said we are continuing to look at other opportunities. We think we have time to evaluate those to see if any of those make sense for Targa. But we are right now actively looking at whether we want to participate in renewable projects wind and solar. So, we're evaluating those. They don't necessarily have to be from a capital position. We can participate in those as an off-take because we are a large purchaser of electricity. So, we can support those projects without necessarily putting capital into those projects. So, we're looking to see how we can be a part of that kind of renewable solution there. And as it relates to carbon capture I'd say there are some opportunities for us in that area that would fit our core competences laying pipeline gathering and aggregating CO2. So, we are looking at some of those projects as well. I'd say stay tuned. There's more to come there. There is more to come on that and we do have some time to kind of continue to evaluate about what is our role going to be in that. It doesn't necessarily have to be from a capital position. If we're going to spend capital, we need to earn a good return on that. But there are other ways to participate in those projects as well. Sure. Thank you. Okay. Thank you, Michael. Yes. Sure. Thanks for the question, James. As we look through out at the Permian, every time we brought a plant on, it's been fully utilized relatively quickly. We would expect the same to occur when we have the Heim plant later this year. So I think as we see volumes, how they respond, coming back from these recent weather events, but also what the volumes look like relative to the commodity price environment we're in. Kind of in the first part of this year, I think we'll be likely making a decision of do we need another plant? Maybe that slips to the back half of this year. But I think at some point in this year we'll have enough visibility to say, well, we think not only Heim is going to be full, but we need to add another plant. And we've already been evaluating options to add another one, another plant out there, whether it's moving another one of our plants from another area we have, or putting in a new plant. We're evaluating that to see what the best option is for Targa. This would be a really good add for us, adding additional processing in the Permian Midland when you get the G&P fee and then a transport frac and more volumes for export, really good economics for us. Now that we've got the capital in place on the downstream side of things. So a really good return for us, as volumes continue to grow out in the Midland. And on the Delaware side, with bringing on Falcon and Peregrine, it feels like we have more time more runway out there. So we're just going to continue to evaluate those volumes. There's also some excess capacity out there from other processors as well. So even if volumes ramp and we needed more capacity, we could even look at potential off loads, if it needed to bridge a gap for us there as we're building a new plant. So we have more flexibility out there. The capacity on the Midland side, just all around is tighter. Yes. I mean that is something we know it's been talked about quite a bit. A number of producers and other midstreamers have put targets out there. I'd say, that's something that we are taking a hard look at internally, amongst the management team and with our Board about what if any targets and goals we want internally and externally. So I'd say, we're in the evaluation process of that of, kind of, what the goals would be and how we'd articulate those, but we are working to reduce our overall emissions and continuing to kind of improve our metrics on flaring and emissions across the board, while we're evaluating what the best goals would be. Yes. Thank you."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today Mr. Sanjay Lad. Thank you. Please go ahead.\nSanjay Lad: Thank you, Mitchell. Good morning, and welcome to the Third Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call for Targa Resources Corp.

Additionally, the following senior management team members will also be available for Q&A. Pat McDonie, President, Gathering and Processing; Scott Pryor, President, Logistics and Transportation; and Bobby Muraro, Chief Commercial Officer. And with that I will now turn the call over to Matt.\nMatt Meloy: Thanks, Sanjay. Before we get into quarterly results, I would like to say how proud we are of our employees who safely navigated through an active gulf coast hurricane season during the third quarter. While the overall financial impact to Targa was minimal, we had many employees impacted personally and our heartfelt thoughts go out to them and their families I am also proud of our collective efforts and continuing to respond to the challenges associated with COVID-19 and would like to thank all of our employees for their continued focus and diligence in managing our operations very successfully through an incredibly difficult year. Turning to our business results, we had a strong third quarter as we continue to benefit from the strength of our Permian footprint and our integrated asset position. Our strong operational performance combined with reduced capital spending and the significant progress on reducing costs are driving increasing free cash flow which positions us to continue to execute on our long-term strategy of reducing leverage over time. 2020 has undoubtedly been a challenging year, but we believe that our key strategic efforts around our re-contracting and gathering and processing, reducing growth capital spending, identifying opportunities to reduce operating and G&A expenses and focusing on integrated opportunities position us for a successful 2020 and beyond. Based on our strong performance with EBITDA projected to be at the high end and capital spending at the low end of our range, we saw an opportunity to put in place a 500 million share repurchase program and still continue to reduce leverage overtime. We are always looking for opportunities around market dislocations and we believe we have the financial strength and business profile to execute on both. Let's now discuss the business environment and our operational performance. Starting in the Permian as a result of the quicker than anticipated rebounded prices and related producer activity across our Permian systems, our inlet volumes are on track to grow close to our initial 2020 plan pointing to a strong 2020 exit and positioning us well going into next year. Our overall Permian volumes increased 9% compared to the second quarter and our third quarter volumes grew 8% when compared to the first quarter average while the overall basin experienced a 2% decline in associated gas production over this period. This points to the strength of our overall footprint in the Permian continuing to outperform basin-wide results. Our new gateway plant commenced operations in early August and the addition of this incremental processing capacity has allowed for improved NGL recoveries across our system. With gateway already highly utilized we are in need of additional capacity in the midland basin. With our continued focus on managing capital spending and our need for incremental capacity in Permian midland to accommodate increasing production we are moving our Longhorn plant from North Texas. We are also renaming the plant to the Heim plant after Targa's Founding Chief Operating Officer Mike Heim. This 200 million cubic feet per day plan is expected to begin operations during the fourth quarter of 2021 and is expected to cost approximately 90 million. The Heim plant will drive attractive returns for Targa as a result of the significant capital savings combined with the incremental fee based margin earned to our logistics and transportation assets. This type of spending is in line with our strategy going forward to focus our capital allocation on high returning projects that leverage our integrated mid-stream platform. Moving on to the Badlands, our gas volume rebounded during the third quarter and we're up 23% over the second quarter. Across our Badlands crude system volumes were down 7% sequentially as certain volumes remain temporarily shut in during the third quarter. However, we are seeing some incremental production volumes return in the fourth quarter. Turning to our central region which continues to largely be in decline gas inlet volumes in the third quarter declined 9% over the second quarter. We continue to have some shut-in volumes in South Oak which we expect to come back online in 2021.  Despite declines across our central regions, our third quarter total field G&P volumes increased 4 sequentially led by our Permian region. The durability of our gathering and processing segment margin has strengthened as we have reduced our commodity exposure by adding fees and fee floors to our G&P contracts. Our Permian G&P business is now approximately 60% fee based which is a significant improvement from around 35% fee based in 2018 and overall we are about 80% fee based across all of Targa. The financial performance of our G&P segment is now more driven by volume throughput and fees as opposed to direct commodity prices which is evidence in our year-to-date results and will serve us well going forward as we are more insulated from lower commodity price environments, but would still continue to benefit when prices rise. Shifting to our logistics and transportation segment, our Grand Prix pipeline continues to perform very well. Third quarter throughput volumes on Grand Prix increased 18% driven by increasing NGL production from Targa's Permian plants including our new gateway plant and from our third party customers. We completed the first phase of pump station additions on Grand Prix increasing our transport capacity to approximately 400,000 barrels per day from the Permian basin. At our fractionation complex in Mont-Bellevue third quarter fractionation volumes were impacted by scheduled maintenance and upgrades at our facilities. As a result of the scheduled maintenance we expect higher volumes during the fourth quarter as we work off the associated inventory. Frac Train 8 commenced operations in Mont-Bellevue in September providing us with increased operational flexibility. Our Grand Prix extension into central Oklahoma is on track to be operational by the end of the fourth quarter where it will connect with Williams\u2019s new Bluestem pipeline. Our LPG export business at Galena Park continued to perform well as we moved a Targo record 9.5 million barrels per month during the third quarter. We expect our LPG export volumes to be higher in the fourth quarter as we'll benefit from a full quarter contribution of our recently completed phase expansion. As we look forward, we are in a position where we expect to have the ability to capture growth volumes from the Permian without having to spend much incremental CapEx on Grand Prix, fractionation or LPG export facilities. This puts Targa in a position to generate strong returns going forward as increasing free cash flow after dividends available to reduce debt and further strengthen our financial position. In September, we released our second annual sustainability report which highlights Targa's advancements in the areas of ESG and safety. With our premier integrated asset position and our talented employees Targa is well positioned for the longer term. With that I will now turn the call over to Jen. \nJen Kneale: Thanks Matt. Targa's reported quarterly adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter was $419 million increasing 19% over the second quarter. During the third quarter, Targa generated free cash flow of $189 million or $143 million of free cash flow after dividends to our preferred and common shareholders. We continue to focus on our cost production efforts resulting in essentially flat aggregate G&A and OpEx in Q3 versus Q2 despite new assets being placed in service. Looking towards the fourth quarter, we expect OpEx and G&A to be higher while we are very tightly managing our costs we are benefiting from increasing throughput particularly in the Permian through our downstream assets and we will also have more assets in service for the full quarter. Managing our costs continues to be a huge organizational focus and we appreciate the continued efforts of all of our employees. As matt described, our fee based margin continues to increase backed by our significant progress to increase fee margin and fee floors in our G&P business combined with increasing volumes moving through our logistics and transportation assets. We remain significantly hedged for the balance of year 2020 and for full year 2021 and you can find our usual hedge disclosures in our earnings supplement presentation. We continue to estimate 2020 net growth CapEx to be around $700 million with about $520 million of net spending through the third quarter. We now estimate 2020 net maintenance CapEx to be approximately $110 million. On a debt compliance basis, TRP's leverage ratio at the end of the third quarter was approximately 4.1 times versus a compliance covenant of 5.5 times. Our consolidated reported debt to EBITDA ratio was approximately 4.8 times as we continue on the deleveraging path that we expected entering 2020 given most of our major growth capital projects are now online. During the third quarter we successfully issued $1 billion of 4% and 7% to 8% senior notes due 2031. This was essentially a debt for debt exchange as we were able to use the net proceeds to take out our six and three-quarters percent senior notes due 2024 and redeem our five and a quarter percent notes due May 2023 providing significant annual interest savings. We also announced this morning that we recently closed on the sale of our assets in Channelview, Texas which includes our crude and condensate splitter for net proceeds of $58 million. Pro forma for the five and a quarter notes redemption and the sale of the Channelview assets we have about $2.1 billion of available liquidity. As Matt discussed, in early October we announced a $500 million share repurchase program. As of November 2nd, we have repurchased 4.5 million common shares representing about 2% of common shares outstanding for a total net cost of $74 million. Our long-term strategy to reduce leverage and simplify our capital structure is unchanged by our share repurchase program. Over the long term we are targeting leverage of three to four times on a consolidated basis. Over the last several months, we have received questions around our DevCo joint ventures and our strategy for repurchasing our interests in those assets. This morning we publish a slide in our earnings supplement and investor presentation that we hope is helpful and provides incremental clarity around the structure and the performance of the assets. If we assume that we repurchase the DevCo JVs in a single tranche in the first quarter of 2022, which is the representative scenario presented on slide 5 of the earnings supplement the repurchase price is between $900 million to $950 million is an estimate of five to six times multiple on asset EBITDA and the repurchase would be close to leverage neutral. Repurchasing the entirety of the DevCo in the first quarter of 2022 is our current base case assumption and we expect to have plenty of available liquidity to fund the full repurchase. We retain the flexibility to take out the DevCo in tranches and/or to change the timing of takeout but the base case assumption running through our plan is a full takeout at the low double digit fixed IRR in Q1, 2022 which again would be close to leverage neutral. Finally, I would like to echo Matt's comments that our business is performing very well across a difficult year and we are so proud of the exceptional performance of our entire Targa team. Given our performance and the actions that we have taken this year, we expect to exit 2022 in a strong position with a very bright outlook. And with that I'll turn the call back to Sanjay. \nSanjay Lad: Great, we kindly ask that you limit the two questions and re-enter the Q&A line up if you have additional questions. Mitchell would you please open the lines for Q&A?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from a line of Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hey good morning guys. This is James on for Jeremy. I hope you guys are doing well. I just wanted to start with the 2021 outlook and as it relates to 4Q obviously with all your growth projects mostly in service now, it seems in the gathering business volumes are kind of normalizing. Is 4Q kind of a good run rate for 2021? It seems there is some growth maybe on Grand Prix, but largely speaking do you think 4Q can be a good benchmark going forward?\nMatt Meloy: Yes. Good morning. Yes, as we look at 2021, I think we're encouraged by the strong performance that we've seen in the back half of this year especially across our Permian footprint. So those volumes continue to be resilient, showing good growth this quarter and I think that sets us up well going into 2021. So we anticipate giving 2021 CapEx and EBITDA guidance in February. I think when you look across some of the pluses and minuses I think in this price environment we still see some growth in the Permian. You've got still strong producer activity on our system with higher GURs is going to set us up well, but we do have declines that are happening in the central area as well. So there is some, we need to get through the planning process and see how those kind of shake out as we get into 2021 but those are some of the pluses and minuses.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got it. That's helpful. And then maybe just shifting over to the recent upstream M&A, I just wanted to get your broader thoughts there in terms of implications to Targa and also if Targa would be interested in anything on the market at this point obviously you have a lot going on with the buybacks and deleveraging but if there's anything that you guys would consider going after here?\nMatt Meloy: Sure. So yes I guess we'll handle that in two parts. First on the consolidation on the upstream, we have seen a lot of that. I'm going to hand it over to Robert Muraro our Chief Commercial Officer who kind of gives some perspective about how that may impact us.\nRobert Muraro: This is Bob. So when we look at all the transactions that have happened recently and thinking about the parties that are doing, it's obviously different party by party. But, when you look at most of the transactions that have occurred we have great relationships on both sides of those tables and the consolidators, the buyers are people that we work with every day all day. So it's one of those things where we hate to see management teams go that we love, but the acquirers are ones we do a lot of work with that we have great relationships with as well. So we don't see a big detriment there and then as you start to think about those companies getting bigger as a general rule or tendency they tend to go with the guys on the midstream side that have more integrated platforms and a bigger balance sheet to work through the tough times and so we think that being directionally positive for us as the big guys start to rollout some of the smaller guys. Again we have great relationships with almost all of them that we've seen acquire and so we're excited about kind of what those integrations come, what comes from those integrations.\nMatt Meloy: Yes. Well said Bob and then on the consolidation and what it looks like on the midstream side, I'd say for us we're really focused on our integrated platform, focusing our investment on organic growth. We're not lacking a key piece of the puzzle that we're really looking to bolt on or that would make Targa complete, we have an integrated platform. We have a really good Permian position and so we're in a strong position as we look forward multiple years really just servicing the existing assets and customers that we have. So we're going to be focused on organic growth. There is a pretty high hurdle for us to go look at something that would be a bolt on.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay, great. Thanks for the color. In interest of time I'll leave it there. Thank you. \nMatt Meloy: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Christine Cho with Barclays. Please go ahead. \nChristine Cho: Good morning. Maybe if I can follow up on that M&A question. Some of the combinations where there have been a couple of combinations where both the acquirer and Targa are notable customers on your system. How do we think about what the impact of that would be? Is the initial thought that the cost savings is going to enable more production with the same amount of spending or does the pro forma entity just pocket the savings and could there be other commercial opportunities as it relates to either new contracts or modifying existing ones?\nMatt Meloy: Yes. I'd say as it relates to where they're both large customers of ours and to Bob's point we've had good relationships with really all parties involved there. I think it's going to have to play out overtime for, is there a change in how they're looking at, what their reinvestment is, how many rigs they're going to have on the acreage and how they're going to allocate capital. But, I think to Bobby's point is, over the longer term as these companies get larger flow assurance being connected to a scale, system like we have we think over the longer term is going to be beneficial. We don't see any real big impacts near term. It's going to be over the longer term how it plays out I think.\nChristine Cho: I see, okay. And then just moving on to the DevCo buybacks, I understand this slide that you have there is illustrative. But, I do think that in your prepared remarks you mentioned that your base case is, divide all in one tranche in 22. Can you just talk about like you're thinking behind that buying it in one tranche versus buying it in pieces, and is the desire to buy it in one tranche because like the acquisition multiple is as a function of EBITDA is better the longer you wait or wanting it to be at least leverage neutral and you think that is best in 2022 or are there just other factors that we should be thinking about?\nJen Kneale: Sure Christine. This is Jen. I think there are a lot of factors that will go into our decision ultimately on how we take it out. That's the simplifying assumption that we're making which is that we take it out in a full single tranche in Q1 of 2022, which given our expectations for the performance of the assets is one that structure crosses over from where we would be repaying Stone Peak a multiple on invested capital versus an IRR. So we said in our prepared remarks that with that Q1, 2022 takeout assumption, you would be paying the fixed IRR on that takeout. So one that's a benefit to us. If we take it out earlier we would be paying multiple. If we wait longer, it's a lower cost to us ultimately as we take it out at that fixed IRR. So I think that that's an important element of our decision making. I think ultimately we'll see how the business performs through next year and if it makes sense for us to use some of our available free cash flow after dividends to take out a tranche or tranches early, then that's certainly an option. But, I think the point that we were trying to make with that slide and with our additional disclosures in our scripted remarks was that we could take it out in a single tranche in the first quarter of 2022, and given the strong EBITDA performance of those assets it's essentially a leverage neutral transaction. So it becomes much more a liquidity decision really than a leveraged decision and for us we expect to have significant liquidity over that horizon which is also what gives us that flexibility to be able to take out the full DevCo in a single tranche, if we wanted to. But again, we do have the flexibility to do it in pieces. We have the flexibility to wait longer and we have a lot of flexibility and that's one of the reasons that we liked the structure so much when we entered into the transaction with Stone Peak.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got it. That was helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Michael Blum with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. \nMichael Blum: Great. Good morning everyone. I wanted to go back to your comments. Your updated contracted G&P fee based cash flows. Just wanted to clarify, did you add a fee floor to your existing POP contracts are these actual conversions from POP to fee and then the other part of that question is kind of where is this all in the Permian or is it somewhere else?\nMatt Meloy: Sure. Good morning Michael. Yes so for the G&P contract, I'd say it's a combination. It's largely in the Permian is where we're having, I'd say the most successful, we're continuing to invest for our customers and needing to protect the underlying investment. So in some cases it's adding a fee floor to contracts and others, as we look forward and get extensions and renewals and others where changing POPs and making it fee-based with POP or putting in floors for POP, it's a combo of all of those things and it depends on the customer relationship and what they prefer. We can be flexible on it. What we're really just trying to do is making sure we can protect. So, the underlying investment so we can continue to service our customers and hook up wells in the line.\nMichael Blum: Okay, great. And then, second question I wanted to ask was just around asset sales. Obviously here you've got another one done. The question is are there any other meaningful potential asset divestitures that you could look at or do you think you've kind of exhausted that at this point?\nJen Kneale: There's nothing Michael that we're actively considering selling at this point-in-time. The one asset that you had visibility to previously because we spoke about it publicly what's the potential divestiture of our Midland crude business. After we announced that we had successfully sold the Delaware crude business. So, again there is an active process underway but that's at least an asset new type visibility to us considering selling before. Other than that, as we look across the asset portfolio, I wouldn\u2019t say that there are any significant assets in particular to your specific question that we would consider selling at this point-in-time. But of course everything has to be on the table at all times so to the extent that we get any reverse enquiry around different asset or different positions. We would certainly consider those.\nMichael Blum: Great. Thank you, very much.\nJen Kneale: Thanks, Michael.\nMatt Meloy: Yes, thanks Michael.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Tristan Richardson with Truist Securities. Please go ahead.\nTristan Richardson: Hi, good morning. Really appreciate the comments on how the joint ventures could play out. I think that's helpful for all of us. Just a quick question. Thoughts on the Midland and just thinking about some of your customers talking about seeing some slight incremental growth next year. Towards your thoughts on the ramp of the relocated plants and to the extent if you remain highly utilized in the Midland, you could see CapEx next year perhaps exceed some of maybe your just general comments that you guys have made in the past about future CapEx.\nMatt Meloy: Sure. I'd say in terms of the ramp and the volume, in the past when we brought on plants out in the Permian Midland really starting back with Joyce Johnson and Brooke. Now gateway, is and we bring an incremental plan on, it's typically pre-highly utilized fairly quickly. I think that would be our expectation with this current plant. We bring it on, it's going to be highly utilized. And we pointed to about $90 million of CapEx for this, that's going to for the most part almost all of it's going to be next year in 2021 with a little bit of spending this year. As you look forward to CapEx next year, we pointed this year to the low end around $700 million for this year. I would expect 2021 to be meaningfully less. Even with the addition of that Heim Plant, meaningfully less in 2021 than 2020. We're still working through the budgeting, working through what our producers sign with the compression and pipeline needs and that's going to be but I would expect this is even with the Heim Plant be meaningfully less than this year's CapEx.\nTristan Richardson: I appreciate it. And then, just thinking about the longer-term leverage target. I'm just balancing that between Targa's having been very active on the repurchase lately. Could we see repurchase become a regular fixture of the capital allocation. Whether that'd be targeted or programmatic over time or is the priority in the medium term to really prefund any DevCo scenario with free cash flow and added distributions.\nJen Kneale: Good morning, Tristan, this is Jen. I think for us, we really try to be very deliberate with the words that we used when we announced the share repurchase program. And really try to liken it to the opportunity that we saw earlier this year around being able to repurchase some of our debt. And what we saw were very attractive prices. For us this year, repurchase program is an opportunity in our view to benefit from what we perceive as a market dislocation. And so, as we look forward beyond the $500 million program that we announced. We'll be continuing to look at the best ways to return capital to our shareholders. We clearly are very much focused on the deleveraging plan and we don\u2019t view the share repurchase program as a departure from that in any way shape or form. So, we will continue on that path to deleveraging. I think an important part of trying to articulate that deleveraging story was around the debt cost because it sounded like there were some broad market concerns that that was going to add significant incremental leverage to the target system. So, we try to provide clarity around that today, that we don\u2019t view that as a departure either from that long-term deleveraging plan. I think ultimately we've made a lot of progress on a lot of strategic initiatives in term of adding fee based margin in the GMP business. In terms of rationalizing our capital spending, rationalizing costs et cetera. And I think all of that plus the strong operational performance of our assets this year has just provided us with a lot of flexibility. And so, hopefully we'll be able to continue to realize our flexibility as we look forward while continuing on that deleveraging path.\nTristan Richardson: I appreciate it Jen. Thank you guys, very much.\nMatt Meloy: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Ujjwal Pradhan with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nUjjwal Pradhan: Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to begin with the little part of your M&A commentary specific to midstream sector. Matt, so this year you have made good progress under recent cost while maintaining your significant operating leverage in the Permian. One could argue that you could achieve more of the same potentially to synergies from merger if you call transactions maybe in your core reasons and further expand that integrated profile. Have you or would you consider such opportunities?\nMatt Meloy: Yes. I'd say we'll always consider and look at other opportunities that could make sense for us over the long-term. And could there be something with significant synergy potential which look attractive to us I guess theoretically. But when I think we feel pretty proud of our Permian position in our asset position. And so, if there was anything like that, MLE's or others, it would have to be very attractive for us to be issuing TRGP here for someone given our strong Permian position in our outlook. So, I guess any of those are not off the table, we're trying to be smart about all those things. Look at those things, we just feel like we're in a really good position without doing that trend any kind of transaction like that. And just execute on our business plan, focus on what we have in front of us. And it's going to deliver very good returns to our shareholders over time. And then announcing the share repurchase here recently, I think it's evident of how strong we feel about TRGP in our business outlook.\nUjjwal Pradhan: Thanks for that, Matt, very helpful. And my second follow-up is to your cons around potential asset sales in the future, appreciate all the comments you made earlier question. But as we think about your non-Permian GMP systems which are in basins with the material and declining profile. Could you maybe talk about the cash flow profile of some of those systems and made up in the market for such assets at the moment? Thank you.\nJen Kneale: I think to start, we're 1) very pleased that we were able to sell a 45% interest in our Bakken assets for $1.6 billion when we did. And I think that that transaction highlighted at least that point-in-time. Our willingness to really core up around what we consider sort of our bread and butter which is Permian through all of our downstream assets. But we do have other assets that I think also importantly bring a lot of additional benefits to us in terms of also brining volumes further through our downstream assets as well. So, really what you've seen as liquidated at this point are assets just haven\u2019t in our view made sense for us to earn over the longer term and it made sense for somebody else to own. As we look across the cash flow profile, the assets that we have, again I think we're very comfortable with the Bakken exposure that we have right now. Those assets are continuing to perform well better in the third quarter than the second quarter. And better expectations as we look forward for those assets. I think on the Midland side, our teams have done a wonderful job of trying to extract savings from those assets and really optimized the positions that we have in trying to get more volume further through our downstream assets et cetera to make that more of an attractive cash flow profile than it would otherwise be. I think the moving of the Heim Plant highlights our engineering teams creativity to look around our asset footprints where we may have declining volumes and say is there a better higher use for certain assets. And that's a high visibility version of an asset moving. But we're looking all the time at the compression in one area that is less utilized they need to be moved to the Permian for example could be more highly utilized. So, hats off to our engineering and operations teams that are focused on that as well. I think ultimately we're very comfortable with the asset portfolio that we have. And ultimately we'll continue to look at whether we're the right long-term owner of assets. That's part of our job but again we're very comfortable with the assets that we have and the cash flow profile of those assets.\nUjjwal Pradhan: Got it, very helpful. Thank you, Jen.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Shneur Gershuni with UBS. Please go ahead.\nShneur Gershuni: Hi, good morning everyone. So, to go back to the DevCo. But just kind of wanted to understand a couple of things. But first, really appreciate the transparency in these slides that you've put out today. I'm trying to understand is your benefit in timing from acquiring the DevCo. It's sort I think about the IRR calculation and so forth in the fact that the distributions that get paid out as reducing that, you need to purchase, if I understand that correctly. What does the timing of ramping let's say a Grand Prix sort of changed here IRR thought process as to how the timing should be as. I was wondering if you could sort of walkthrough how the assets ramp. Does that change your timing on when you want to acquire the asset?\nJen Kneale: Shneur, this is Jen. I think that the EBITDA generation of assets is clearly a very important barrier for all that we're considering in when and makes sense to take out the structure and repurchase those interest. So, I think you're exactly right to the extent that those assets are performing very well which they are. And we've got good visibility I think to continued excellent performance from the assets that were included in the DevCo. Then we get to that sort of multiples of IRR calc change more quickly. And it makes more sense for us to potentially take it our earlier as a result of that. Everything that we put out this morning was just to try to provide a lot more clarity. One, its Stonepeak is benefiting from good quarter-over-quarter distribution as a result of the performance of those assets and so ultimately that reduces the overall end payment that we need to make to the important point that from our point-of-view it's not a significantly leveraging transaction in any way shape or form. It's again really more about liquidity than anything else. And ultimately I think that our continued strong performance across Targa is helping us to feel like we've got more flexibility to potentially move more quickly on taking out those DevCo interest. But a key element of the structure is definitely when it flips from that multiple to IRR and that's a key area both that we are considering when we thought about the base case that we were going to present today for one we are thinking about taking it on.\nShneur Gershuni: That makes perfect sense. So, I guess does that sort of drive also into your thought process around when you buy back your stock. As well also is it kind of like stock it at certain price and you sort of measure it again versus buying chunks of the DevCo. Is that kind of the way to be thinking about that as well also?\nJen Kneale: I think for us right now, clearly the share repurchase program is again a view on the market dislocation and so that's why we need quickly to put a program in early October and that's why you've seen us to be active under that program already. So, as we look forward, I think it's really the performance of our assets that reduce capital spending that has given us the flexibility to put in that share repurchase program and to already be successful repurchasing shares under it. And so, we'll be continuing to look each quarter what's the best use of our free cash flow, what's the best use of our liquidity. Positions us best for creating long-term shareholder value and we'll be making the decisions on what and when to repurchase and or to pay down on the debt side as a result of all of those variables.\nShneur Gershuni: Okay.\nMatt Meloy: And just to add to that too. As Jen said earlier, our repurchasing of the debt, that was more about liquidity. So, it's not we need to do one at the expense of the other. We have enough liquidity to repurchase shares. We have enough liquidity to go on to repurchase DevCo's. So, when we repurchase the DevCo's, it's going to be leveraged neutral, maybe slightly leveraging but pretty much leverage neutral. So, one doesn\u2019t go with the expense of the other necessarily.\nShneur Gershuni: Yes. That makes perfect sense. And I think given that you're obviously focused on getting leverage down and you see this kind of a leverage neutral transaction. I mean, do you see an opportunity if not finance more than 50% of it actually using that. Just sort of given the trajectory that you're on. Is that an option that you would consider at that time?\nJen Kneale: Our profile is significantly increasing free cash flow as we look out over the horizon. We also have a lot of liquidity. So, ultimately it would depend on that quarter how exactly we execute on whether it's drawn all under the revolver or we're using available free cash flow. I would expect it to be combination, Shneur.\nShneur Gershuni: Alright, perfect. Really appreciate the color today and I wish all a safe day.\nMatt Meloy: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Colton Bean with Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Please go ahead.\nColton Bean: Good morning. So Matt, just wanted to quickly clarify some of the comments there on 2021. I think you had previously steered towards a range of about $200 million on capital spend. Can you just clarify whether there was any consideration of processing CapEx in that number or if time would be fully incremental to that?\nMatt Meloy: Sure. Yes, good morning Colton. For 2021, we gave a $200 million number that was in the kind of downturn in the second quarter. And it would it assumed a very kind of base level modest level of spending. Kind of the very I'd say downside case or low side case for that. And it did not have any incremental processing. So, the 90 would be incremental for that. Yes, as we're going through the budgeting and looking through what we expect for 2021, I would expect there to be more kind of base level spending relative to that 200 and then you'd add the $90 million of processing on top of that. Those are going to be right now it could be somewhere in between the 200 and 700. We do think it's going to be significantly less than the 700. So, I'm not trying to imply, we think it's going to be approaching that number at all. It's going to be significantly less than the 700. But I would expect it to be more than the 200.\nColton Bean: And you said it, and that's helpful. And then maybe a question for Scott. It looks like the TNF unit margins actually rebounded pretty strongly here back up close to Q1 levels despite lower volumes coming out of the mid count which I think is a little bit higher margin business. So, any specific drivers to point to on the margin improvement?\nScott Pryor: I think really for us when you look at the volumes that crossed our system. We have done a good job of contracting TNF across our entire system. Obviously led by production coming from our Permian Basin from our own GMP assets. I think that that was that's going to continue. You can see the ramp up that we've had fractionation side. They had been of or Train 7 earlier this year and now they added to the Train 8 in the latter part of the third quarter. Now, so we'll continue to see that. We do believe that our volumes are going to be up in the fourth quarter as we work across the inventory. So, I think overall, margins are still its highly competitive out there. But we've done a good job of really marketing our assets showing that we've got flexibility on our system. Then we can perform very well and reliable for our customers. So, I think that is going to continue to drive margins to our business not only on our Frac business, but our transportation on Grand Prix as well as it leads to the export business.\nColton Bean: Got it, I appreciate the time.\nMatt Meloy: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of TJ Schultz with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nTJ Schultz: Hey. So, just a question had most of my follow-up on the DevCo. So, maybe just one clarification. Is that five to six times multiple reflective of run rate EBITDA at the beginning of 2022 or what period does that reflect? If that may give a sense of the ramp in those assets you're expecting in your base case assumption on timing. Thanks.\nJen Kneale: It's reflective of run rate EBITDA at that repurchase timing assumption TJ, so Q1 2022.\nTJ Schultz: Okay great, thanks Jen.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Keith Stanley with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nKeith Stanley: Hi, thanks. First question on the LPG exports and the volumes you saw on the quarter. And I think you said you expected to be even higher in Q4. Should we think of that as mostly tied to greater long-term contracts with the facility expansion? Or is it partially better taking in some good short-term opportunities. Just curious if Q3 Q4 is a good run rate for LPG export.\nMatt Meloy: So, when we look at the export business. Certainly, we had a very strong quarter averaging a 9.5 million barrels per month. We do expect the fourth quarter to be even stronger. We had a partial quarter on our phased and expansion which was inclusive of our new refrigeration unit at Galena Park at our export facility. So, getting the full benefit of a fourth quarter. We expect the volumes to be up as a result of that. With that said, also the additive of that phased and expansion we brought on new contracts. So, we are highly contracted, we expect the volumes to be stronger in the fourth quarter. The market is still has a strong demand for products across the globe with continued focus on the east. And so, we look at that and say well we're highly contracted. But we will continue to look for every opportunity to squeeze cargoes in between the contracted cargoes that we have and being very reliable to those term contracts and liftings that we have. But we'll look for every opportunity to optimize and in between those.\nKeith Stanley: Thanks. And second question. Just to clarify, would you look to repay debt with free cash flow over the next couple of year? It's I don\u2019t think the company has any debt maturities for several years. So, is that an option or is it more likely you could be building up cash for the eventual DevCo buying, thanks.\nJen Kneale: No Keith, to the extent that we've got maturities that are callable. For example, we could use available free cash flow to reduce the overall quantum of debt that we have by using that free cash flow to potentially call different series of notes. We also do expect some continuing spending and sort of the extent that we've got any liquidity drawn on the revolver which we currently do at small borrowings at both TRP and TRC. Then we'll be using available free cash flow to reduce debt at those revolvers as well which would just reduce again in the overall amount of debt that we have in our system.\nKeith Stanley: Thank you.\nMatt Meloy: Keith, thank you.\nOperator: Your final question is from the line of Timm Schneider with Citi. Please go ahead.\nTimm Schneider: Hey, thanks for all the color, guys. Just a real quick one follow-up on the LPG export side. You mentioned that east has been pretty strong. Just wondering what is driving that, who is your customer on the other side here as the trading house is this end users kind of also curious as to what you're seeing in Europe, in South America or your views as we kind of get into 2021.\nMatt Meloy: Sure. When you look at the growth to the east, a lot of that growth is still driven by China and by India. And certainly when you look at China, there the continued growth and expected growth over the next several years is going to continue to be focused on PDH plants. Propane Dehydrogenation plants. In India, it's really more of a domestic queue. And as the state of India continues to really improve its infrastructure, there is still several billion people obviously in India and many of those are without an appropriate energy source. And so, the ability to put the infrastructure in place by other parties to get this clean burning source of fuel into India is really where we see a lot of growth. So, India and China are going to continue to be the primary source of growth that we see in the east. We've also seeing good demand in Europe, you mentioned that some of that comes more on the backs of refinery shut downs and the need in petrochemical plants where we've seen some movements in butane and other products. So again, global demand continues to grow. There is a need for a clean burning energy source which is propane and butane, much better than the use of coal or other solid waste material. So, we think the horizon looks very good for continued growth and a lot of that incremental demand is going to come from the U.S. where the production continues to climb.\nTimm Schneider: Got it. Thank you.\nMatt Meloy: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Now we'll turn the call back over to Mr. Sanjay Lad.\nSanjay Lad: Great. Thanks to everyone that was on the call this morning.

But, when you look at most of the transactions that have occurred we have great relationships on both sides of those tables and the consolidators, the buyers are people that we work with every day all day. So it's one of those things where we hate to see management teams go that we love, but the acquirers are ones we do a lot of work with that we have great relationships with as well. So we don't see a big detriment there and then as you start to think about those companies getting bigger as a general rule or tendency they tend to go with the guys on the midstream side that have more integrated platforms and a bigger balance sheet to work through the tough times and so we think that being directionally positive for us as the big guys start to rollout some of the smaller guys. Again we have great relationships with almost all of them that we've seen acquire and so we're excited about kind of what those integrations come, what comes from those integrations."

            "content": "Thanks Matt. Targa's reported quarterly adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter was $419 million increasing 19% over the second quarter. During the third quarter, Targa generated free cash flow of $189 million or $143 million of free cash flow after dividends to our preferred and common shareholders. We continue to focus on our cost production efforts resulting in essentially flat aggregate G&A and OpEx in Q3 versus Q2 despite new assets being placed in service. Looking towards the fourth quarter, we expect OpEx and G&A to be higher while we are very tightly managing our costs we are benefiting from increasing throughput particularly in the Permian through our downstream assets and we will also have more assets in service for the full quarter. Managing our costs continues to be a huge organizational focus and we appreciate the continued efforts of all of our employees. As matt described, our fee based margin continues to increase backed by our significant progress to increase fee margin and fee floors in our G&P business combined with increasing volumes moving through our logistics and transportation assets. We remain significantly hedged for the balance of year 2020 and for full year 2021 and you can find our usual hedge disclosures in our earnings supplement presentation. We continue to estimate 2020 net growth CapEx to be around $700 million with about $520 million of net spending through the third quarter. We now estimate 2020 net maintenance CapEx to be approximately $110 million. On a debt compliance basis, TRP's leverage ratio at the end of the third quarter was approximately 4.1 times versus a compliance covenant of 5.5 times. Our consolidated reported debt to EBITDA ratio was approximately 4.8 times as we continue on the deleveraging path that we expected entering 2020 given most of our major growth capital projects are now online. During the third quarter we successfully issued $1 billion of 4% and 7% to 8% senior notes due 2031. This was essentially a debt for debt exchange as we were able to use the net proceeds to take out our six and three-quarters percent senior notes due 2024 and redeem our five and a quarter percent notes due May 2023 providing significant annual interest savings. We also announced this morning that we recently closed on the sale of our assets in Channelview, Texas which includes our crude and condensate splitter for net proceeds of $58 million. Pro forma for the five and a quarter notes redemption and the sale of the Channelview assets we have about $2.1 billion of available liquidity. As Matt discussed, in early October we announced a $500 million share repurchase program. As of November 2nd, we have repurchased 4.5 million common shares representing about 2% of common shares outstanding for a total net cost of $74 million. Our long-term strategy to reduce leverage and simplify our capital structure is unchanged by our share repurchase program. Over the long term we are targeting leverage of three to four times on a consolidated basis. Over the last several months, we have received questions around our DevCo joint ventures and our strategy for repurchasing our interests in those assets. This morning we publish a slide in our earnings supplement and investor presentation that we hope is helpful and provides incremental clarity around the structure and the performance of the assets. If we assume that we repurchase the DevCo JVs in a single tranche in the first quarter of 2022, which is the representative scenario presented on slide 5 of the earnings supplement the repurchase price is between $900 million to $950 million is an estimate of five to six times multiple on asset EBITDA and the repurchase would be close to leverage neutral. Repurchasing the entirety of the DevCo in the first quarter of 2022 is our current base case assumption and we expect to have plenty of available liquidity to fund the full repurchase. We retain the flexibility to take out the DevCo in tranches and/or to change the timing of takeout but the base case assumption running through our plan is a full takeout at the low double digit fixed IRR in Q1, 2022 which again would be close to leverage neutral. Finally, I would like to echo Matt's comments that our business is performing very well across a difficult year and we are so proud of the exceptional performance of our entire Targa team. Given our performance and the actions that we have taken this year, we expect to exit 2022 in a strong position with a very bright outlook. And with that I'll turn the call back to Sanjay. Sure Christine. This is Jen. I think there are a lot of factors that will go into our decision ultimately on how we take it out. That's the simplifying assumption that we're making which is that we take it out in a full single tranche in Q1 of 2022, which given our expectations for the performance of the assets is one that structure crosses over from where we would be repaying Stone Peak a multiple on invested capital versus an IRR. So we said in our prepared remarks that with that Q1, 2022 takeout assumption, you would be paying the fixed IRR on that takeout. So one that's a benefit to us. If we take it out earlier we would be paying multiple. If we wait longer, it's a lower cost to us ultimately as we take it out at that fixed IRR. So I think that that's an important element of our decision making. I think ultimately we'll see how the business performs through next year and if it makes sense for us to use some of our available free cash flow after dividends to take out a tranche or tranches early, then that's certainly an option. But, I think the point that we were trying to make with that slide and with our additional disclosures in our scripted remarks was that we could take it out in a single tranche in the first quarter of 2022, and given the strong EBITDA performance of those assets it's essentially a leverage neutral transaction. So it becomes much more a liquidity decision really than a leveraged decision and for us we expect to have significant liquidity over that horizon which is also what gives us that flexibility to be able to take out the full DevCo in a single tranche, if we wanted to. But again, we do have the flexibility to do it in pieces. We have the flexibility to wait longer and we have a lot of flexibility and that's one of the reasons that we liked the structure so much when we entered into the transaction with Stone Peak. There's nothing Michael that we're actively considering selling at this point-in-time. The one asset that you had visibility to previously because we spoke about it publicly what's the potential divestiture of our Midland crude business. After we announced that we had successfully sold the Delaware crude business. So, again there is an active process underway but that's at least an asset new type visibility to us considering selling before. Other than that, as we look across the asset portfolio, I wouldn't say that there are any significant assets in particular to your specific question that we would consider selling at this point-in-time. But of course everything has to be on the table at all times so to the extent that we get any reverse enquiry around different asset or different positions. We would certainly consider those. Thanks, Michael. Good morning, Tristan, this is Jen. I think for us, we really try to be very deliberate with the words that we used when we announced the share repurchase program. And really try to liken it to the opportunity that we saw earlier this year around being able to repurchase some of our debt. And what we saw were very attractive prices. For us this year, repurchase program is an opportunity in our view to benefit from what we perceive as a market dislocation. And so, as we look forward beyond the $500 million program that we announced. We'll be continuing to look at the best ways to return capital to our shareholders. We clearly are very much focused on the deleveraging plan and we don't view the share repurchase program as a departure from that in any way shape or form. So, we will continue on that path to deleveraging. I think an important part of trying to articulate that deleveraging story was around the debt cost because it sounded like there were some broad market concerns that that was going to add significant incremental leverage to the target system. So, we try to provide clarity around that today, that we don't view that as a departure either from that long-term deleveraging plan. I think ultimately we've made a lot of progress on a lot of strategic initiatives in term of adding fee based margin in the GMP business. In terms of rationalizing our capital spending, rationalizing costs et cetera. And I think all of that plus the strong operational performance of our assets this year has just provided us with a lot of flexibility. And so, hopefully we'll be able to continue to realize our flexibility as we look forward while continuing on that deleveraging path. I think to start, we're 1) very pleased that we were able to sell a 45% interest in our Bakken assets for $1.6 billion when we did. And I think that that transaction highlighted at least that point-in-time. Our willingness to really core up around what we consider sort of our bread and butter which is Permian through all of our downstream assets. But we do have other assets that I think also importantly bring a lot of additional benefits to us in terms of also brining volumes further through our downstream assets as well. So, really what you've seen as liquidated at this point are assets just haven't in our view made sense for us to earn over the longer term and it made sense for somebody else to own. As we look across the cash flow profile, the assets that we have, again I think we're very comfortable with the Bakken exposure that we have right now. Those assets are continuing to perform well better in the third quarter than the second quarter. And better expectations as we look forward for those assets. I think on the Midland side, our teams have done a wonderful job of trying to extract savings from those assets and really optimized the positions that we have in trying to get more volume further through our downstream assets et cetera to make that more of an attractive cash flow profile than it would otherwise be. I think the moving of the Heim Plant highlights our engineering teams creativity to look around our asset footprints where we may have declining volumes and say is there a better higher use for certain assets. And that's a high visibility version of an asset moving. But we're looking all the time at the compression in one area that is less utilized they need to be moved to the Permian for example could be more highly utilized. So, hats off to our engineering and operations teams that are focused on that as well. I think ultimately we're very comfortable with the asset portfolio that we have. And ultimately we'll continue to look at whether we're the right long-term owner of assets. That's part of our job but again we're very comfortable with the assets that we have and the cash flow profile of those assets. Shneur, this is Jen. I think that the EBITDA generation of assets is clearly a very important barrier for all that we're considering in when and makes sense to take out the structure and repurchase those interest. So, I think you're exactly right to the extent that those assets are performing very well which they are. And we've got good visibility I think to continued excellent performance from the assets that were included in the DevCo. Then we get to that sort of multiples of IRR calc change more quickly. And it makes more sense for us to potentially take it our earlier as a result of that. Everything that we put out this morning was just to try to provide a lot more clarity. One, its Stonepeak is benefiting from good quarter-over-quarter distribution as a result of the performance of those assets and so ultimately that reduces the overall end payment that we need to make to the important point that from our point-of-view it's not a significantly leveraging transaction in any way shape or form. It's again really more about liquidity than anything else. And ultimately I think that our continued strong performance across Targa is helping us to feel like we've got more flexibility to potentially move more quickly on taking out those DevCo interest. But a key element of the structure is definitely when it flips from that multiple to IRR and that's a key area both that we are considering when we thought about the base case that we were going to present today for one we are thinking about taking it on. I think for us right now, clearly the share repurchase program is again a view on the market dislocation and so that's why we need quickly to put a program in early October and that's why you've seen us to be active under that program already. So, as we look forward, I think it's really the performance of our assets that reduce capital spending that has given us the flexibility to put in that share repurchase program and to already be successful repurchasing shares under it. And so, we'll be continuing to look each quarter what's the best use of our free cash flow, what's the best use of our liquidity. Positions us best for creating long-term shareholder value and we'll be making the decisions on what and when to repurchase and or to pay down on the debt side as a result of all of those variables. Our profile is significantly increasing free cash flow as we look out over the horizon. We also have a lot of liquidity. So, ultimately it would depend on that quarter how exactly we execute on whether it's drawn all under the revolver or we're using available free cash flow. I would expect it to be combination, Shneur. It's reflective of run rate EBITDA at that repurchase timing assumption TJ, so Q1 2022. No Keith, to the extent that we've got maturities that are callable. For example, we could use available free cash flow to reduce the overall quantum of debt that we have by using that free cash flow to potentially call different series of notes. We also do expect some continuing spending and sort of the extent that we've got any liquidity drawn on the revolver which we currently do at small borrowings at both TRP and TRC. Then we'll be using available free cash flow to reduce debt at those revolvers as well which would just reduce again in the overall amount of debt that we have in our system."

            "name": "Matt Meloy",
            "content": "Thanks, Sanjay. Before we get into quarterly results, I would like to say how proud we are of our employees who safely navigated through an active gulf coast hurricane season during the third quarter. While the overall financial impact to Targa was minimal, we had many employees impacted personally and our heartfelt thoughts go out to them and their families I am also proud of our collective efforts and continuing to respond to the challenges associated with COVID-19 and would like to thank all of our employees for their continued focus and diligence in managing our operations very successfully through an incredibly difficult year. Turning to our business results, we had a strong third quarter as we continue to benefit from the strength of our Permian footprint and our integrated asset position. Our strong operational performance combined with reduced capital spending and the significant progress on reducing costs are driving increasing free cash flow which positions us to continue to execute on our long-term strategy of reducing leverage over time. 2020 has undoubtedly been a challenging year, but we believe that our key strategic efforts around our re-contracting and gathering and processing, reducing growth capital spending, identifying opportunities to reduce operating and G&A expenses and focusing on integrated opportunities position us for a successful 2020 and beyond. Based on our strong performance with EBITDA projected to be at the high end and capital spending at the low end of our range, we saw an opportunity to put in place a 500 million share repurchase program and still continue to reduce leverage overtime. We are always looking for opportunities around market dislocations and we believe we have the financial strength and business profile to execute on both. Let's now discuss the business environment and our operational performance. Starting in the Permian as a result of the quicker than anticipated rebounded prices and related producer activity across our Permian systems, our inlet volumes are on track to grow close to our initial 2020 plan pointing to a strong 2020 exit and positioning us well going into next year. Our overall Permian volumes increased 9% compared to the second quarter and our third quarter volumes grew 8% when compared to the first quarter average while the overall basin experienced a 2% decline in associated gas production over this period. This points to the strength of our overall footprint in the Permian continuing to outperform basin-wide results. Our new gateway plant commenced operations in early August and the addition of this incremental processing capacity has allowed for improved NGL recoveries across our system. With gateway already highly utilized we are in need of additional capacity in the midland basin. With our continued focus on managing capital spending and our need for incremental capacity in Permian midland to accommodate increasing production we are moving our Longhorn plant from North Texas. We are also renaming the plant to the Heim plant after Targa's Founding Chief Operating Officer Mike Heim. This 200 million cubic feet per day plan is expected to begin operations during the fourth quarter of 2021 and is expected to cost approximately 90 million. The Heim plant will drive attractive returns for Targa as a result of the significant capital savings combined with the incremental fee based margin earned to our logistics and transportation assets. This type of spending is in line with our strategy going forward to focus our capital allocation on high returning projects that leverage our integrated mid-stream platform. Moving on to the Badlands, our gas volume rebounded during the third quarter and we're up 23% over the second quarter. Across our Badlands crude system volumes were down 7% sequentially as certain volumes remain temporarily shut in during the third quarter. However, we are seeing some incremental production volumes return in the fourth quarter. Turning to our central region which continues to largely be in decline gas inlet volumes in the third quarter declined 9% over the second quarter. We continue to have some shut-in volumes in South Oak which we expect to come back online in 2021.  Despite declines across our central regions, our third quarter total field G&P volumes increased 4 sequentially led by our Permian region. The durability of our gathering and processing segment margin has strengthened as we have reduced our commodity exposure by adding fees and fee floors to our G&P contracts. Our Permian G&P business is now approximately 60% fee based which is a significant improvement from around 35% fee based in 2018 and overall we are about 80% fee based across all of Targa. The financial performance of our G&P segment is now more driven by volume throughput and fees as opposed to direct commodity prices which is evidence in our year-to-date results and will serve us well going forward as we are more insulated from lower commodity price environments, but would still continue to benefit when prices rise. Shifting to our logistics and transportation segment, our Grand Prix pipeline continues to perform very well. Third quarter throughput volumes on Grand Prix increased 18% driven by increasing NGL production from Targa's Permian plants including our new gateway plant and from our third party customers. We completed the first phase of pump station additions on Grand Prix increasing our transport capacity to approximately 400,000 barrels per day from the Permian basin. At our fractionation complex in Mont-Bellevue third quarter fractionation volumes were impacted by scheduled maintenance and upgrades at our facilities. As a result of the scheduled maintenance we expect higher volumes during the fourth quarter as we work off the associated inventory. Frac Train 8 commenced operations in Mont-Bellevue in September providing us with increased operational flexibility. Our Grand Prix extension into central Oklahoma is on track to be operational by the end of the fourth quarter where it will connect with Williams's new Bluestem pipeline. Our LPG export business at Galena Park continued to perform well as we moved a Targo record 9.5 million barrels per month during the third quarter. We expect our LPG export volumes to be higher in the fourth quarter as we'll benefit from a full quarter contribution of our recently completed phase expansion. As we look forward, we are in a position where we expect to have the ability to capture growth volumes from the Permian without having to spend much incremental CapEx on Grand Prix, fractionation or LPG export facilities. This puts Targa in a position to generate strong returns going forward as increasing free cash flow after dividends available to reduce debt and further strengthen our financial position. In September, we released our second annual sustainability report which highlights Targa's advancements in the areas of ESG and safety. With our premier integrated asset position and our talented employees Targa is well positioned for the longer term. With that I will now turn the call over to Jen. Yes. Good morning. Yes, as we look at 2021, I think we're encouraged by the strong performance that we've seen in the back half of this year especially across our Permian footprint. So those volumes continue to be resilient, showing good growth this quarter and I think that sets us up well going into 2021. So we anticipate giving 2021 CapEx and EBITDA guidance in February. I think when you look across some of the pluses and minuses I think in this price environment we still see some growth in the Permian. You've got still strong producer activity on our system with higher GURs is going to set us up well, but we do have declines that are happening in the central area as well. So there is some, we need to get through the planning process and see how those kind of shake out as we get into 2021 but those are some of the pluses and minuses. Sure. So yes I guess we'll handle that in two parts. First on the consolidation on the upstream, we have seen a lot of that. I'm going to hand it over to Robert Muraro our Chief Commercial Officer who kind of gives some perspective about how that may impact us. Yes. Well said Bob and then on the consolidation and what it looks like on the midstream side, I'd say for us we're really focused on our integrated platform, focusing our investment on organic growth. We're not lacking a key piece of the puzzle that we're really looking to bolt on or that would make Targa complete, we have an integrated platform. We have a really good Permian position and so we're in a strong position as we look forward multiple years really just servicing the existing assets and customers that we have. So we're going to be focused on organic growth. There is a pretty high hurdle for us to go look at something that would be a bolt on. Okay. Thank you. Yes. I'd say as it relates to where they're both large customers of ours and to Bob's point we've had good relationships with really all parties involved there. I think it's going to have to play out overtime for, is there a change in how they're looking at, what their reinvestment is, how many rigs they're going to have on the acreage and how they're going to allocate capital. But, I think to Bobby's point is, over the longer term as these companies get larger flow assurance being connected to a scale, system like we have we think over the longer term is going to be beneficial. We don't see any real big impacts near term. It's going to be over the longer term how it plays out I think. Sure. Good morning Michael. Yes so for the G&P contract, I'd say it's a combination. It's largely in the Permian is where we're having, I'd say the most successful, we're continuing to invest for our customers and needing to protect the underlying investment. So in some cases it's adding a fee floor to contracts and others, as we look forward and get extensions and renewals and others where changing POPs and making it fee-based with POP or putting in floors for POP, it's a combo of all of those things and it depends on the customer relationship and what they prefer. We can be flexible on it. What we're really just trying to do is making sure we can protect. So, the underlying investment so we can continue to service our customers and hook up wells in the line. Yes, thanks Michael. Sure. I'd say in terms of the ramp and the volume, in the past when we brought on plants out in the Permian Midland really starting back with Joyce Johnson and Brooke. Now gateway, is and we bring an incremental plan on, it's typically pre-highly utilized fairly quickly. I think that would be our expectation with this current plant. We bring it on, it's going to be highly utilized. And we pointed to about $90 million of CapEx for this, that's going to for the most part almost all of it's going to be next year in 2021 with a little bit of spending this year. As you look forward to CapEx next year, we pointed this year to the low end around $700 million for this year. I would expect 2021 to be meaningfully less. Even with the addition of that Heim Plant, meaningfully less in 2021 than 2020. We're still working through the budgeting, working through what our producers sign with the compression and pipeline needs and that's going to be but I would expect this is even with the Heim Plant be meaningfully less than this year's CapEx. Okay, thank you. Yes. I'd say we'll always consider and look at other opportunities that could make sense for us over the long-term. And could there be something with significant synergy potential which look attractive to us I guess theoretically. But when I think we feel pretty proud of our Permian position in our asset position. And so, if there was anything like that, MLE's or others, it would have to be very attractive for us to be issuing TRGP here for someone given our strong Permian position in our outlook. So, I guess any of those are not off the table, we're trying to be smart about all those things. Look at those things, we just feel like we're in a really good position without doing that trend any kind of transaction like that. And just execute on our business plan, focus on what we have in front of us. And it's going to deliver very good returns to our shareholders over time. And then announcing the share repurchase here recently, I think it's evident of how strong we feel about TRGP in our business outlook. And just to add to that too. As Jen said earlier, our repurchasing of the debt, that was more about liquidity. So, it's not we need to do one at the expense of the other. We have enough liquidity to repurchase shares. We have enough liquidity to go on to repurchase DevCo's. So, when we repurchase the DevCo's, it's going to be leveraged neutral, maybe slightly leveraging but pretty much leverage neutral. So, one doesn't go with the expense of the other necessarily. Okay, thank you. Sure. Yes, good morning Colton. For 2021, we gave a $200 million number that was in the kind of downturn in the second quarter. And it would it assumed a very kind of base level modest level of spending. Kind of the very I'd say downside case or low side case for that. And it did not have any incremental processing. So, the 90 would be incremental for that. Yes, as we're going through the budgeting and looking through what we expect for 2021, I would expect there to be more kind of base level spending relative to that 200 and then you'd add the $90 million of processing on top of that. Those are going to be right now it could be somewhere in between the 200 and 700. We do think it's going to be significantly less than the 700. So, I'm not trying to imply, we think it's going to be approaching that number at all. It's going to be significantly less than the 700. But I would expect it to be more than the 200. Okay, thank you. So, when we look at the export business. Certainly, we had a very strong quarter averaging a 9.5 million barrels per month. We do expect the fourth quarter to be even stronger. We had a partial quarter on our phased and expansion which was inclusive of our new refrigeration unit at Galena Park at our export facility. So, getting the full benefit of a fourth quarter. We expect the volumes to be up as a result of that. With that said, also the additive of that phased and expansion we brought on new contracts. So, we are highly contracted, we expect the volumes to be stronger in the fourth quarter. The market is still has a strong demand for products across the globe with continued focus on the east. And so, we look at that and say well we're highly contracted. But we will continue to look for every opportunity to squeeze cargoes in between the contracted cargoes that we have and being very reliable to those term contracts and liftings that we have. But we'll look for every opportunity to optimize and in between those. Keith, thank you. Sure. When you look at the growth to the east, a lot of that growth is still driven by China and by India. And certainly when you look at China, there the continued growth and expected growth over the next several years is going to continue to be focused on PDH plants. Propane Dehydrogenation plants. In India, it's really more of a domestic queue. And as the state of India continues to really improve its infrastructure, there is still several billion people obviously in India and many of those are without an appropriate energy source. And so, the ability to put the infrastructure in place by other parties to get this clean burning source of fuel into India is really where we see a lot of growth. So, India and China are going to continue to be the primary source of growth that we see in the east. We've also seeing good demand in Europe, you mentioned that some of that comes more on the backs of refinery shut downs and the need in petrochemical plants where we've seen some movements in butane and other products. So again, global demand continues to grow. There is a need for a clean burning energy source which is propane and butane, much better than the use of coal or other solid waste material. So, we think the horizon looks very good for continued growth and a lot of that incremental demand is going to come from the U.S. where the production continues to climb. Okay, thank you."

Pat McDonie, President, Gathering and Processing; Scott Pryor, President, Logistics and Transportation; and Bobby Muraro, Chief Commercial Officer. I will now turn the call over to Matt.\nMatt Meloy: Thanks, Sanjay. During the second quarter, we navigated the challenges and impacts related to COVID-19 extremely well across our organization. We remain highly focused on employee safety, while efficiently operating our facilities. And have experienced no material impact to our operations. I would like to extend a thank you to all our employees for their continuous efforts to keep their colleagues and family safe. We appreciate all that you do on behalf of the Targa team, including delivering and maintaining first-class service to our customers. We had a strong second quarter, despite impacts from reduced demand and lower crude oil prices, which resulted in producers temporarily curtailing production and meaningfully reducing their activity levels. We have seen a quicker than anticipated rebound in prices and related producer activity, and forecasted activity for the remainder of 2020. Our overall Permian gathering and processing position performed well and our Midland system even showed sequential increase in the second quarter. This sets us up well for the second half of the year as we expect to benefit from stronger production across the Permian. We also benefited from our NGL storage position in the contango price structure, which existed for much of the second quarter. We expect to see those benefits show up in our margin throughout the remainder of the year. We made significant progress on reducing costs across Targa and expect to continue to benefit from these cost-reduction measures. And our free cash flow profile is improving and should continue to improve going forward, as our capital spending comes down and our cash flow remains strong. As we look forward, we are in a position where we expect to have the ability to capture growth volumes from the Permian without having to spend incremental CapEx on Grand Prix, fractionation or LPG export facilities, and we have excess processing capacity in the Delaware. This puts Targa in the position to delever and generate strong returns going forward. Now a bit more color on the shut-ins that occurred in the second quarter. On our previous earnings call, we estimated the potential impacts related to our producer customer shutting in production. We saw a trough in production across our G&P systems in May and these declines were consistent with our estimates of about a 10% reduction in the Permian due to shut-ins. In the Permian the impact was less pronounced across our Permian Midland system than our Permian Delaware system. We also experienced some declines in the Delaware, due to some third-party on-load gas coming off the system during the second quarter. Despite the temporary shut-in production and reduced activity levels quarterly inlet volumes across our aggregate Permian footprint declined only 1% sequentially. We have seen almost all volumes on our Midland and Delaware systems that were temporarily shut-in come back online. And we are continuing to see our volumes in Permian and Midland prove to be resilient. We are pleased to have our gateway plant online ahead of schedule, placing this asset in service early even through the challenges presented by COVID-19 is outstanding performance by our Targa team. With gateway online, we are currently processing volumes at higher levels than our March levels in the Permian Midland. The addition of gateway enhances our operational flexibility to move volumes across our system from other plants that we're running over nameplate. This allows us to enhance NGL recoveries and perform maintenance across our system footprint. Moving on to the Badlands. During May, we saw shut-in production impact our gas volumes by around 40%, which was at the high end of our previous estimate. Our gas volumes for July have since rebounded and are up significantly over the second quarter average. Across our Badlands crude system, we continue to have some production that remains shut in, but expect additional volumes to return as we continue to move through the third quarter. Turning to our Central region, which has already largely been decline, gas inlet volumes in the second quarter declined 15% sequentially, primarily driven by greater-than-expected shut-in production on our South Oak system and we also had some on-load gas expire. Despite the historically low commodity price environment, the durability of our G&P segment margin has strengthened as we have reduced our commodity exposure by adding fees and fee floors to our G&P contracts. The financial performance of our G&P segment is now more driven by volume throughput and fees as opposed to direct commodity prices, which is evidenced in our year-to-date results and will serve us well going forward. With fee floors, we also will benefit as prices begin to rise. Shifting to our logistics and transportation segment. Throughput volumes on our Grand Prix pipeline and at our fractionation complex in Mont Belvieu were slightly lower sequentially as a result of lower inlet volumes from production shut-ins and reduced activity across our G&P systems. But now with most of the shut-in production back online and the recent start-up of our gateway plant, we are currently seeing higher volumes through Grand Prix and our fractionation assets. We remain on track to bring Frac Train 8 online later in the third quarter as well as our Grand Prix extension in the Central Oklahoma in the first quarter of 2021, where it will connect with William's new Bluestem pipeline. Our LPG export services business at Galena Park continued to perform well during the second quarter. Sequentially volumes during the second quarter were slightly lower as a result of scheduled downtime to tie in the phase expansion at our LPG export facility. We recently completed our Galena Park expansion in early August and expect our LPG export volumes to be higher in the second half of this year as we are highly contracted for the balance of the year and beyond. While the majority of shut-in production has returned and activity levels begin to pick back up, there remains a level of uncertainty for the second half of 2020 around the pace of demand and commodity price recovery due to COVID-19. However, our assets are performing very well. And given we are more than six months through the year and have more visibility today than we had back in March, April or May, we are revising the bottom end of our estimated full year 2020 adjusted EBITDA range higher and the updated range is now $1.5 billion to $1.625 billion. Spending related to our announced major capital project is largely complete and Targa is well positioned to meaningfully benefit as business conditions strengthen. With our best-in-class Permian supply position, driving increasing volumes through our integrated midstream system. We remain focused on continued capital and operating cost discipline and combined with the strategic measures we executed earlier this year, we expect to generate positive free cash flow after dividends in the second half of 2020 based on our revised full year adjusted EBITDA estimate. While there may be some uncertainty in global commodity markets related to the coronavirus and other macro factors there is strength in what we can see for Targa's core business, positioning us exceptionally well for the longer term. With that I'll now turn the call over to Jen to discuss Targa's results for the second quarter and other finance-related matters.\nJen Kneale: Thanks, Matt. Targa's reported quarterly adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter was $351 million. As Matt discussed, our results for the second quarter were impacted by the low commodity price environment and temporary production curtailments and reduced producer activity which resulted in lower volumes across our Gathering and Processing and logistics and transportation systems offset by our significant efforts to reduce costs. In our logistics and transportation segment, while second quarter Grand Prix, fractionation and LPG export volumes were modestly lower, when compared to the first quarter, the sequential decline in segment operating margin was driven by lower marketing and other. Seasonality in our wholesale marketing businesses, combined with less optimization margin realized in our marketing businesses during the second quarter, accounted for about half of the sequential decline in segment operating margin. We are very proud of the entire Targa organization's efforts to manage operating and general and administrative expenses lower. As we said on our second quarter call, we expected to have aggregate operating and G&A expense savings of approximately $100 million relative to our plan and we now expect to meaningfully exceed $100 million in 2020. Looking forward, quarterly operating expenses in each segment are estimated to be modestly higher in the third and fourth quarters when compared to the second quarter, as new facilities begin operations in both our G&P and L&T segments. Turning to hedging. Based on a range of current estimates of producer customer activity levels, we remain substantially hedged for 2020. We have hedged approximately 85% to 95% of natural gas, approximately 80% to 90% of condensate and approximately 75% to 85% of NGLs. Supplemental hedge disclosures including 2021 hedge percentages by commodity can be found in our earnings and supplement presentation on our website. Related to counterparty risk, we have had no material credit losses and remain focused on monitoring and managing our credit exposure. We have a large diversified customer base across our operating businesses, which includes large integrated customers, other investment-grade counterparties and customers that are required to provide credit protection. Our 2020 net growth CapEx estimate range remains between $700 million to $800 million and our 2020 net maintenance CapEx estimate continues to be approximately $130 million. We have spent about $400 million of net growth CapEx through the first two quarters with growth CapEx spending expected to continue to trend lower as we move through the second half of the year with free cash flow increasing. We had over $2.1 billion of available liquidity as of June 30 and have no near-term maturities of senior notes or credit facilities with the earliest maturity occurring in May 2023. On a debt compliance basis TRC's leverage ratio at the end of the second quarter was approximately 4.1 times versus a compliance covenant of 5.5 times. Our consolidated reported debt-to-EBITDA ratio was approximately 4.9 times. With our premier integrated asset position and our talented employees Targa is well positioned for the longer term. As business fundamentals improve, we expect to generate increasing free cash flow after dividends that will be available to reduce debt and further strengthen our balance sheet profile. Our business is performing very well across a difficult year and we are so proud of the exceptional performance of our employees. Given the actions that we have taken and will continue to take this year, we expect to exit 2020 in a strong position with increasing flexibility. Lastly, before we turn the call over to Q&A, we wanted to provide an update that we are on track to publish our 2019 sustainability report during the third quarter and will include enhanced disclosures around our framework of policies, practices and systems in the areas of safety, environmental, social and governance. And with that operator, please open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] \nSanjay Lad: And we kindly ask that you limit to two questions and reenter the Q&A line up if you have additional questions.\nOperator: Your first question comes from the line of Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hey, good morning, guys. This is James [ph] on for Jeremy. Maybe I could start off with a two-part question on the logistics side of the business. Your Grand Prix volumes looked pretty resilient during the quarter, I assume better than what you guys had originally anticipated. But just through July, what are you guys seeing on that pipeline? And maybe relative to 1Q volumes, if you can \u2013 or do you expect to surpass that level in 3Q and then the cadence in the 4Q? And then the second part is just looking out at 2021 I understand, it's very early but just with the dock expansion now online, do you see the business mix shifting to the logistics side in 2021 versus 2020 or historically?\nMatt Meloy: Good morning. Yes, I'll answer the first one just about Grand Prix and then go to the other one. Yes, the Grand Prix volumes we are seeing some strength. I'd say with gateway coming on and just the resilience that we're seeing in the Permian. With that plant coming on volumes are continuing to ramp. I'd say we've been pleasantly surprised with how that assets performed, the volumes going through it and our ability to enhance recoveries across that asset and the rest of our Permian footprint is going to continue to drive better recoveries going forward. So on a recovery basis, I think we feel good about the outlook for moving those volumes down Grand Prix and just from the overall volume uplift we're going to get from putting gateway on. Both of those things are going to drive more volumes on Grand Prix. So I think it's kind of happening real-time, as we're ramping up gateway. But I think we're pretty optimistic about the volume profile for gateway through the back half of the year and then into 2021. Now in terms of business mix and how that's shifting, yes, I'd say with Grand Prix going to continue to ramp volumes fractionation export and the investments we made on the downstream side. I would say that over time, partially dependent on commodity prices. But yes, we see more of the business mix shifting to downstream in terms of percentage operating margin than G&P. But we expect to have really growth in both areas over time.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great. Thanks for the color. And then just my second question, I'm just looking at Slide 29 in the updated presentation this morning. And just looking at the South Texas footprint, obviously look there's a few less rigs there from your last kind of slide presentation not surprisingly but just asking for an update on maybe Sanchez's activity on the footprint and how it's progressing with your expectations?\nMatt Meloy: Sure. On the South Texas footprint really amongst the whole Eagle Ford, there's not a lot of activity out there. We actually didn't see a whole lot of volume shut in on that system but there's just really not a lot of activity. So you've seen volumes move down. We are getting some indications from producers that some activity could start picking up here. So there remains an opportunity for kind of stemming the decline and maybe going the other way here as we kind of get into the back half of the year. But we really haven't seen a lot of progress made in terms of volumes here recently. But there is some \u2013 there is some opportunity for those volumes to perform a little bit better as we go forward.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got it. Thanks for the questions.\nMatt Meloy: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Tristan Richardson with Truist Securities.\nTristan Richardson: Hi. Good morning guys. I really appreciate all the comments you've given around what you're seeing in the second half or volumes. I mean, I guess kind of taking that commentary -- some of the commentary from your large customers about reinvestment rates, and then balancing in some natural decline in some of the other basins. Can you talk a little bit about exit rates for the year, now that curtailed volumes are back to exit rates look to be above 2Q and more in line with what you're seeing in July or August, or is decline comes in do we start to get back to more what you saw in 2Q?\nMatt Meloy: I'd say, for that we're -- we've had good discussions with our producers. And we're getting more visibility around their plans for 2020. So I'd say in the incremental data points, we're getting there continue to be more and more positive in more and more conversations we have. So it would be our expectation that, out in the Permian that from here would not surprise me if we had some growth, from where we are today, through the end of the year, in the Permian. We still have a range in our EBITDA guidance, because it's still -- there's still certainly some uncertainty there. But I'd say the most recent data points, we're getting are more supportive, of having really growth from this point going forward in the Permian.\nTristan Richardson: That's great. Thanks, Matt. And then, just on the cost side of things. Jen, you talked about some of the $100 million of incremental versus expectations. I mean certainly, new assets coming online in the second half we'll see some ramp, but curious about just sort of the concept of cost reduction permanence, as you look out into 2021 and beyond?\nJen Kneale: I think, Tristan that we've done an excellent job of taking costs out really across the board. The focus of our organization whether it be, supply chain every operations person every group involved in G&A savings. It's just been a really remarkable effort, when we compare that $100 million of cost savings which we now expect to be, that's relative to our plan as we approach this year. And so I think that, we see good permanence from a lot of those cost savings partially because our expectations are that activity levels may be reduced versus where we were before. So our need to hire additional personnel and things like that. Some of that I expect will be permanent in terms of cost savings. Our management of other operating costs around production, we are doing a very good job of managing those with each and every supplier and we'll continue to be focused on that. But as we see volumes increase across our systems, those costs may be a little bit harder to maintain the Permian of. But we're working very diligently to try to do that.\nTristan Richardson: It's great. Thank you guys very much.\nMatt Meloy: Hey thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Christine Cho with Barclays.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi. Good morning. This is Mark on for Christine. So Permian volumes held up better than what we would have thought and better than some of your peers. Could you just talk through, what were the potential drivers of that? Did your customers just have better storage positions or sales agreements on the crude side, that enable them to keep falling, or were there other factors that played a part and just the impact from less shut-in?\nMatt Meloy: I think, we continue to just see the resiliency of our Permian Midland system. When we add plants there are more volumes that usually come in to fill those up relatively quickly. If there's other wells that are being shut in maybe it lower some pressures and we see it come from other parts of the system. So I think we benefit from just having a really large footprint on the Permian Midland side, with really high-quality, well capitalized good producers as well. So I would say on average we would expect them to outperform the Basin. And we've seen that continue to prove out. So I think it's a combination of a number of factors. I think it's the footprint system we have, but it's also the really strong producers we have behind our systems.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got it. That's helpful. And then recognizing things are still pretty dynamic on the producer side. But just how should we think about CapEx for next year? Last quarter I think you gave a rough estimate for about $200 million in growth CapEx, but with activity holding up better across your acreage, should we still think that's a good number?\nMatt Meloy: Yeah. So for CapEx as we look forward if you look through the remainder of this year really the most of the large capital projects are coming on and going to be completed this year, adding the fractionation trains, export facilities and processing plants. As you look out into 2021, we have the completion of our Grand Prix extension up into Oklahoma in the first quarter but we don't have any large-scale projects announced to come online in 2021. So we'd expect that CapEx, when you look to our recent history to be much lower than the amount we've spent over the previous several years. We have capacity on Grand Prix. So as volumes ramp we'll be able to just move those volumes down Grand Prix. We have capacity in our fractionation and export. So we're really set up pretty well to be able to capture some growth volumes. Whether it's in 2021 or 2022, going forward to capture those growth volumes, with really not much more incremental investment on the downstream side of the business. So then it's on the G&P side where we'll have a regular field and compression and other spending we'll need to have to gather those volumes to the plants. And as I noted in my comments is we have excess capacity in the Delaware side. So with Peregrine coming on, we do have processing out there. So it really comes to on the G&P side. I'd say the next processing plant we have visibility to if there is some growth is again in the Permian Midland where we've seen strength. So it would be a processing plant on the Permian Midland side, which depending on how volumes move as we go through the remainder of this year there could be a need for another plant out there. And we're already trying to be even more capital efficient with the way we do that. So we're looking internally is there a potential plant we could move from another area that's underutilized. Repurpose that and move it out into the Permian Midland when and if it's needed out there. And so we're already looking at that. And if we do that and be significantly less capital than a new build get-out capital that we've had for the recent $250 million day plants we put in.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks.\nMatt Meloy: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Colton Bean with Tudor Pickering Holt.\nColton Bean: Good morning. So, maybe just a follow-up on the capital question there with a slightly longer-dated lens. I think we've seen a few of the large Permian producers highlighted growth cap even in the event of a much higher oil price. So, obviously, still a long way out, but do you see next year's capital budget as a decent marker for 22-plus if growth was in line with that mid- single-digit type commentary?\nMatt Meloy: I'd say as we look out over multi-years, what we see is the addition of processing plants likely just going to be in the Permian. On the Midland side likely there\u2019ll be more plants there than the Delaware just kind of given where current volumes are relative to capacity. So it's putting in a processing plant on the Permian side shouldn't need much more capital on Grand Prix as we have capacity on that pipe. It will be just adding some pumps, but those are relatively small amounts of capital. And then is when we're going to need another fractionator after Train 8. So part of it will be the timing of what that growth looks like in 2021 and when we'll need to green light Train 9 on the fractionation. And does that fall into 2022 -- does it fall into 2020? When do we need that? How much growth is there in 2021 and 2022? But it's going to average out, one year we might be putting one in and other year we may not right? So it's going to depend on when we put in those processing plants and fractionation facilities.\nColton Bean: Got it. And then just on the NGL marketing downtick, I understand the wholesale seasonality. Can you speak to the optimization side of that? And how do you expect that to play out through the back half of the year?\nMatt Meloy: Sure. So we had -- if you look sequentially our marketing margin was down in the second quarter versus the first. We pointed to our wholesale marketing, which is normal seasonality that we had every year in that business. But we also -- it was actually a relatively good quarter for us on the NGL marketing front. But the margin really won't be realized until later quarters as there was significant contango on some of the NGL products. We're able to purchase store put into storage and we'll realize those margins as we go forward. So we factor that into our updated guidance. And so we'll reap those benefits as we realize those contango trades.\nColton Bean: Great. I appreciate that.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Kyle May with Capital One Securities.\nKyle May: Good morning. I appreciate still a lot of uncertainty ahead. But just wondering if you can talk about some of the different factors that could put you at one end or the other of your revised guidance for this year?\nMatt Meloy: Sure. At this point in the year it really is less about I'd say commodity prices. We gave commodity prices with our updated guidance. But given our hedge position and our fee base positionm it is less about commodity prices and it really is more about volumes. So we've had positive signs from the producers in the Permian. Let's see how that plays out through the rest of the year. So I think there's still some potential variability in what the volumes look like for the Permian from now to the rest of the year. And then we also still have some shut-ins up in the Badlands and we have some shut-ins in the South Oak segment. And so there are some signs that those are going to be coming on. When those come on, do they fully come back on? That's another variable. So to be the return of shut-in production in our Central region combined with Permian volumes and what the growth profile looks like from now to the end of the year.\nJen Kneale: I think, Kyle there's also uncertainty around COVID as we all know. And so we're also being conservative factoring what we don't know into account. So we've got great visibility, I think from our producers or certainly increased visibility versus where we were for back half of the year performance, which gives us a lot of confidence when we think about the strength and resiliency of our footprint. But there is just continued uncertainty around COVID. And so we're trying to factor some of that conservatism in as well.\nKyle May: Got it. That's very helpful. And as my follow-up, it seems like we've seen a little bit more stability in the last month or so. And wanted to get your latest thoughts around the M&A landscape and if you see any opportunity for Targa to make any changes that could improve the balance sheet?\nMatt Meloy: Yeah. So our focus and we mentioned it in our script multiple times is really on free cash flow after dividends and wanting to delever. We have a lot of really good organic projects adding -- picking up volumes through our Midland system, our Delaware system picking up the transport frac and export as we move the molecule downstream those are going to be really good returns for us. So our focus really is on -- if there's spending to do it's on organic spending in and around our footprint for our existing customers and add-on customers in and around our footprint. That is going to be our focus right now because our leverage is headed in the right direction, but we still want our leverage to move even lower.\nKyle May: Got it. Thanks a lot.\nA \u2013 Matt Meloy: Thank you.\nOperator: Your final question comes from the line of Sunil Sibal with Seaport Global.\nSunil Sibal : Hi. Good morning, everybody and hope everybody is safe. So first bookkeeping question for me. So it seems like when I look at the equity earnings for the non-controlling interest about $96 million and then another $13 million or of DD&A. So it seems like that was a drag of about $110 million on EBITDA for the quarter. So I was just curious was there any kind of onetime item in there which impacted that number, or is that kind of a run rate kind of a number? Obviously, some assets are ramping up?\nJen Kneale : We can dig into it some more and come back to you, but I don't believe there was anything that I'd characterize as onetime in nature there, Sunil.\nA \u2013 Matt Meloy: That's right. And maybe just to support Jen, Sunil. I think if you look to fourth quarter -- first quarter 2019, '20 and then the current quarter here the non-controlling interest cutback the EBITDA has been around kind of $100 million, $110 million. That was consistent last quarter as well. If you adjust for the impairment and DD&A.\nSunil Sibal : Okay. Got it. And then on the fractionation side understand that Q2 numbers had some noise in there. But now you're bringing on another fraction withdrawals online. So I was just kind of curious how should we be thinking about the volumes there? When would you expect those -- your full fractionation capacity to be kind of 80% or so utilized? Any thoughts there?\nA \u2013 Matt Meloy: Yes. So right now, we have excess fractionation capacity. And then Train eight is going to be coming online. But again, with bringing on gateway we have been able to enhance our recoveries out in the Permian and do some maintenance and other things we would expect more NGLs from here going forward. And some growth in the Permian and from our third-party customers as those contracts kick in and ramp up over time.  So we still have a positive outlook for being able to utilize our fractionation capacity. But the timing of when it will be full and when we'll need another fractionation facility it really will depend on, as we kind of exit 2020 what the growth outlook is from our producer customers in 2021 and beyond. We're really just now kind of getting some of those indications from our customers. We don't have nearly as many data points for 2021 and beyond as we do for 2020. But I will say the early indications from some of our producer customers have been positive, I'd say relative to maybe our expectations even just a few weeks or a few months ago. So we are seeing positive indications for 2021 and beyond but it's still pretty early. To give you kind of a firm timeline there.\nSunil Sibal : Okay. Got it. Thanks for all the color guys.\nA \u2013 Matt Meloy: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: There are no additional questions at this time. I would like to turn the call over to Sanjay Lad for closing remarks.\nSanjay Lad: Thank you, Hope. Well thank everyone that was on the call this morning and we appreciate your interest in Targa Resources. We will be available for any follow-up questions you may have. Thank you and have a great day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference call. You may now all disconnect.",

            "name": "Jen Kneale",
            "content": "Thanks, Matt. Targa's reported quarterly adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter was $351 million. As Matt discussed, our results for the second quarter were impacted by the low commodity price environment and temporary production curtailments and reduced producer activity which resulted in lower volumes across our Gathering and Processing and logistics and transportation systems offset by our significant efforts to reduce costs. In our logistics and transportation segment, while second quarter Grand Prix, fractionation and LPG export volumes were modestly lower, when compared to the first quarter, the sequential decline in segment operating margin was driven by lower marketing and other. Seasonality in our wholesale marketing businesses, combined with less optimization margin realized in our marketing businesses during the second quarter, accounted for about half of the sequential decline in segment operating margin. We are very proud of the entire Targa organization's efforts to manage operating and general and administrative expenses lower. As we said on our second quarter call, we expected to have aggregate operating and G&A expense savings of approximately $100 million relative to our plan and we now expect to meaningfully exceed $100 million in 2020. Looking forward, quarterly operating expenses in each segment are estimated to be modestly higher in the third and fourth quarters when compared to the second quarter, as new facilities begin operations in both our G&P and L&T segments. Turning to hedging. Based on a range of current estimates of producer customer activity levels, we remain substantially hedged for 2020. We have hedged approximately 85% to 95% of natural gas, approximately 80% to 90% of condensate and approximately 75% to 85% of NGLs. Supplemental hedge disclosures including 2021 hedge percentages by commodity can be found in our earnings and supplement presentation on our website. Related to counterparty risk, we have had no material credit losses and remain focused on monitoring and managing our credit exposure. We have a large diversified customer base across our operating businesses, which includes large integrated customers, other investment-grade counterparties and customers that are required to provide credit protection. Our 2020 net growth CapEx estimate range remains between $700 million to $800 million and our 2020 net maintenance CapEx estimate continues to be approximately $130 million. We have spent about $400 million of net growth CapEx through the first two quarters with growth CapEx spending expected to continue to trend lower as we move through the second half of the year with free cash flow increasing. We had over $2.1 billion of available liquidity as of June 30 and have no near-term maturities of senior notes or credit facilities with the earliest maturity occurring in May 2023. On a debt compliance basis TRC's leverage ratio at the end of the second quarter was approximately 4.1 times versus a compliance covenant of 5.5 times. Our consolidated reported debt-to-EBITDA ratio was approximately 4.9 times. With our premier integrated asset position and our talented employees Targa is well positioned for the longer term.

Our business is performing very well across a difficult year and we are so proud of the exceptional performance of our employees.

Lastly, before we turn the call over to Q&A, we wanted to provide an update that we are on track to publish our 2019 sustainability report during the third quarter and will include enhanced disclosures around our framework of policies, practices and systems in the areas of safety, environmental, social and governance.

            "name": "Matt Meloy",
            "content": "Thanks, Sanjay. During the second quarter, we navigated the challenges and impacts related to COVID-19 extremely well across our organization. We remain highly focused on employee safety, while efficiently operating our facilities. And have experienced no material impact to our operations. I would like to extend a thank you to all our employees for their continuous efforts to keep their colleagues and family safe. We appreciate all that you do on behalf of the Targa team, including delivering and maintaining first-class service to our customers. We had a strong second quarter, despite impacts from reduced demand and lower crude oil prices, which resulted in producers temporarily curtailing production and meaningfully reducing their activity levels. We have seen a quicker than anticipated rebound in prices and related producer activity, and forecasted activity for the remainder of 2020. Our overall Permian gathering and processing position performed well and our Midland system even showed sequential increase in the second quarter. This sets us up well for the second half of the year as we expect to benefit from stronger production across the Permian. We also benefited from our NGL storage position in the contango price structure, which existed for much of the second quarter. We expect to see those benefits show up in our margin throughout the remainder of the year. We made significant progress on reducing costs across Targa and expect to continue to benefit from these cost-reduction measures. And our free cash flow profile is improving and should continue to improve going forward, as our capital spending comes down and our cash flow remains strong. As we look forward, we are in a position where we expect to have the ability to capture growth volumes from the Permian without having to spend incremental CapEx on Grand Prix, fractionation or LPG export facilities, and we have excess processing capacity in the Delaware. This puts Targa in the position to delever and generate strong returns going forward. Now a bit more color on the shut-ins that occurred in the second quarter. On our previous earnings call, we estimated the potential impacts related to our producer customer shutting in production. We saw a trough in production across our G&P systems in May and these declines were consistent with our estimates of about a 10% reduction in the Permian due to shut-ins. In the Permian the impact was less pronounced across our Permian Midland system than our Permian Delaware system. We also experienced some declines in the Delaware, due to some third-party on-load gas coming off the system during the second quarter. Despite the temporary shut-in production and reduced activity levels quarterly inlet volumes across our aggregate Permian footprint declined only 1% sequentially. We have seen almost all volumes on our Midland and Delaware systems that were temporarily shut-in come back online. And we are continuing to see our volumes in Permian and Midland prove to be resilient. We are pleased to have our gateway plant online ahead of schedule, placing this asset in service early even through the challenges presented by COVID-19 is outstanding performance by our Targa team. With gateway online, we are currently processing volumes at higher levels than our March levels in the Permian Midland. The addition of gateway enhances our operational flexibility to move volumes across our system from other plants that we're running over nameplate. This allows us to enhance NGL recoveries and perform maintenance across our system footprint. Moving on to the Badlands. During May, we saw shut-in production impact our gas volumes by around 40%, which was at the high end of our previous estimate. Our gas volumes for July have since rebounded and are up significantly over the second quarter average. Across our Badlands crude system, we continue to have some production that remains shut in, but expect additional volumes to return as we continue to move through the third quarter. Turning to our Central region, which has already largely been decline, gas inlet volumes in the second quarter declined 15% sequentially, primarily driven by greater-than-expected shut-in production on our South Oak system and we also had some on-load gas expire. Despite the historically low commodity price environment, the durability of our G&P segment margin has strengthened as we have reduced our commodity exposure by adding fees and fee floors to our G&P contracts. The financial performance of our G&P segment is now more driven by volume throughput and fees as opposed to direct commodity prices, which is evidenced in our year-to-date results and will serve us well going forward. With fee floors, we also will benefit as prices begin to rise. Shifting to our logistics and transportation segment. Throughput volumes on our Grand Prix pipeline and at our fractionation complex in Mont Belvieu were slightly lower sequentially as a result of lower inlet volumes from production shut-ins and reduced activity across our G&P systems. But now with most of the shut-in production back online and the recent start-up of our gateway plant, we are currently seeing higher volumes through Grand Prix and our fractionation assets. We remain on track to bring Frac Train 8 online later in the third quarter as well as our Grand Prix extension in the Central Oklahoma in the first quarter of 2021, where it will connect with William's new Bluestem pipeline. Our LPG export services business at Galena Park continued to perform well during the second quarter. Sequentially volumes during the second quarter were slightly lower as a result of scheduled downtime to tie in the phase expansion at our LPG export facility. We recently completed our Galena Park expansion in early August and expect our LPG export volumes to be higher in the second half of this year as we are highly contracted for the balance of the year and beyond. While the majority of shut-in production has returned and activity levels begin to pick back up, there remains a level of uncertainty for the second half of 2020 around the pace of demand and commodity price recovery due to COVID-19. However, our assets are performing very well. And given we are more than six months through the year and have more visibility today than we had back in March, April or May, we are revising the bottom end of our estimated full year 2020 adjusted EBITDA range higher and the updated range is now $1.5 billion to $1.625 billion. Spending related to our announced major capital project is largely complete and Targa is well positioned to meaningfully benefit as business conditions strengthen. With our best-in-class Permian supply position, driving increasing volumes through our integrated midstream system. We remain focused on continued capital and operating cost discipline and combined with the strategic measures we executed earlier this year, we expect to generate positive free cash flow after dividends in the second half of 2020 based on our revised full year adjusted EBITDA estimate. While there may be some uncertainty in global commodity markets related to the coronavirus and other macro factors there is strength in what we can see for Targa's core business, positioning us exceptionally well for the longer term. With that I'll now turn the call over to Jen to discuss Targa's results for the second quarter and other finance-related matters. Good morning. Yes, I'll answer the first one just about Grand Prix and then go to the other one. Yes, the Grand Prix volumes we are seeing some strength. I'd say with gateway coming on and just the resilience that we're seeing in the Permian. With that plant coming on volumes are continuing to ramp. I'd say we've been pleasantly surprised with how that assets performed, the volumes going through it and our ability to enhance recoveries across that asset and the rest of our Permian footprint is going to continue to drive better recoveries going forward. So on a recovery basis, I think we feel good about the outlook for moving those volumes down Grand Prix and just from the overall volume uplift we're going to get from putting gateway on. Both of those things are going to drive more volumes on Grand Prix. So I think it's kind of happening real-time, as we're ramping up gateway. But I think we're pretty optimistic about the volume profile for gateway through the back half of the year and then into 2021. Now in terms of business mix and how that's shifting, yes, I'd say with Grand Prix going to continue to ramp volumes fractionation export and the investments we made on the downstream side. I would say that over time, partially dependent on commodity prices. But yes, we see more of the business mix shifting to downstream in terms of percentage operating margin than G&P. But we expect to have really growth in both areas over time. Sure. On the South Texas footprint really amongst the whole Eagle Ford, there's not a lot of activity out there. We actually didn't see a whole lot of volume shut in on that system but there's just really not a lot of activity. So you've seen volumes move down. We are getting some indications from producers that some activity could start picking up here. So there remains an opportunity for kind of stemming the decline and maybe going the other way here as we kind of get into the back half of the year. But we really haven't seen a lot of progress made in terms of volumes here recently. But there is some \u2013 there is some opportunity for those volumes to perform a little bit better as we go forward. Okay. Thank you. I'd say, for that we're -- we've had good discussions with our producers. And we're getting more visibility around their plans for 2020. So I'd say in the incremental data points, we're getting there continue to be more and more positive in more and more conversations we have. So it would be our expectation that, out in the Permian that from here would not surprise me if we had some growth, from where we are today, through the end of the year, in the Permian. We still have a range in our EBITDA guidance, because it's still -- there's still certainly some uncertainty there. But I'd say the most recent data points, we're getting are more supportive, of having really growth from this point going forward in the Permian. Hey thank you. I think, we continue to just see the resiliency of our Permian Midland system. When we add plants there are more volumes that usually come in to fill those up relatively quickly. If there's other wells that are being shut in maybe it lower some pressures and we see it come from other parts of the system. So I think we benefit from just having a really large footprint on the Permian Midland side, with really high-quality, well capitalized good producers as well. So I would say on average we would expect them to outperform the Basin. And we've seen that continue to prove out. So I think it's a combination of a number of factors. I think it's the footprint system we have, but it's also the really strong producers we have behind our systems. Yeah. So for CapEx as we look forward if you look through the remainder of this year really the most of the large capital projects are coming on and going to be completed this year, adding the fractionation trains, export facilities and processing plants. As you look out into 2021, we have the completion of our Grand Prix extension up into Oklahoma in the first quarter but we don't have any large-scale projects announced to come online in 2021. So we'd expect that CapEx, when you look to our recent history to be much lower than the amount we've spent over the previous several years. We have capacity on Grand Prix. So as volumes ramp we'll be able to just move those volumes down Grand Prix. We have capacity in our fractionation and export. So we're really set up pretty well to be able to capture some growth volumes. Whether it's in 2021 or 2022, going forward to capture those growth volumes, with really not much more incremental investment on the downstream side of the business. So then it's on the G&P side where we'll have a regular field and compression and other spending we'll need to have to gather those volumes to the plants. And as I noted in my comments is we have excess capacity in the Delaware side. So with Peregrine coming on, we do have processing out there. So it really comes to on the G&P side. I'd say the next processing plant we have visibility to if there is some growth is again in the Permian Midland where we've seen strength. So it would be a processing plant on the Permian Midland side, which depending on how volumes move as we go through the remainder of this year there could be a need for another plant out there. And we're already trying to be even more capital efficient with the way we do that. So we're looking internally is there a potential plant we could move from another area that's underutilized. Repurpose that and move it out into the Permian Midland when and if it's needed out there. And so we're already looking at that. And if we do that and be significantly less capital than a new build get-out capital that we've had for the recent $250 million day plants we put in. Okay. Thank you. I'd say as we look out over multi-years, what we see is the addition of processing plants likely just going to be in the Permian. On the Midland side likely there'll be more plants there than the Delaware just kind of given where current volumes are relative to capacity. So it's putting in a processing plant on the Permian side shouldn't need much more capital on Grand Prix as we have capacity on that pipe. It will be just adding some pumps, but those are relatively small amounts of capital. And then is when we're going to need another fractionator after Train 8. So part of it will be the timing of what that growth looks like in 2021 and when we'll need to green light Train 9 on the fractionation. And does that fall into 2022 -- does it fall into 2020? When do we need that? How much growth is there in 2021 and 2022? But it's going to average out, one year we might be putting one in and other year we may not right? So it's going to depend on when we put in those processing plants and fractionation facilities. Sure. So we had -- if you look sequentially our marketing margin was down in the second quarter versus the first. We pointed to our wholesale marketing, which is normal seasonality that we had every year in that business. But we also -- it was actually a relatively good quarter for us on the NGL marketing front. But the margin really won't be realized until later quarters as there was significant contango on some of the NGL products. We're able to purchase store put into storage and we'll realize those margins as we go forward. So we factor that into our updated guidance. And so we'll reap those benefits as we realize those contango trades. Sure. At this point in the year it really is less about I'd say commodity prices. We gave commodity prices with our updated guidance. But given our hedge position and our fee base positionm it is less about commodity prices and it really is more about volumes. So we've had positive signs from the producers in the Permian. Let's see how that plays out through the rest of the year. So I think there's still some potential variability in what the volumes look like for the Permian from now to the rest of the year. And then we also still have some shut-ins up in the Badlands and we have some shut-ins in the South Oak segment. And so there are some signs that those are going to be coming on. When those come on, do they fully come back on? That's another variable. So to be the return of shut-in production in our Central region combined with Permian volumes and what the growth profile looks like from now to the end of the year. Yeah. So our focus and we mentioned it in our script multiple times is really on free cash flow after dividends and wanting to delever. We have a lot of really good organic projects adding -- picking up volumes through our Midland system, our Delaware system picking up the transport frac and export as we move the molecule downstream those are going to be really good returns for us. So our focus really is on -- if there's spending to do it's on organic spending in and around our footprint for our existing customers and add-on customers in and around our footprint. That is going to be our focus right now because our leverage is headed in the right direction, but we still want our leverage to move even lower."

I would now like to hand the conference over to Sanjay Lad, Senior Director of Finance and Investor Relations. Thank you. Please go ahead.\nSanjay Lad: Thank you, Bridget. Good morning, and welcome to the First Quarter 2020 Earnings Call for Targa Resources Corp. The first quarter earnings release for Targa Resources, along with the first quarter earnings supplement presentation are available on the Investors section of our website at targaresources.com. In addition, an updated investor presentation has also been posted to our website. A reminder that statements made during this call that might include Targa Resources' expectations or predictions should be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in forward-looking statements. For a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ, please refer to our latest SEC filings.  Our speakers for the call today will be Matt Meloy, Chief Executive Officer; and Jen Kneale, Chief Financial Officer. We will also have the following senior management team members available for Q&A.: Pat McDonie, President, Gathering and Processing; Scott Pryor, President, Logistics and Transportation; and Bobby Muraro, Chief Commercial Officer.  And with that, I will now turn the call over to Matt.\nMatthew Meloy: Thanks, Sanjay. Good morning, and thank you to everyone for joining. On behalf of the Targa team, we hope that you and your families are doing well and staying safe.  The first quarter results show that our assets continue to perform well with solid operational and financial performance in the first quarter. We had $428 million of adjusted EBITDA, 32% growth in Permian volumes, 37% growth in fractionation volumes and 26% growth in export volumes versus last year despite significantly lower commodity prices. Our continued efforts to reduce commodity exposure across our G&P business by adding fees and fee floors allowed us to generate higher operating margin even as prices fell significantly. The financial performance of our G&P segment is now more driven by volume throughput and fees as opposed to direct commodity prices, which will serve us well going forward. With some of our fee-based contracts through our fee-floor structure, we will also benefit as prices begin to rise.  Now moving on to the impacts of COVID-19. When it became clear that the pandemic was a significant risk to our employees and their families, we moved quickly to make sure that we took care of our employees, our facilities and our customers. We swiftly implemented important safety measures, including providing our employees with protective equipment and we are currently pleased with the minimal direct impact that the virus has had on our employees. I'd now like to thank all of our employees. We are especially proud of our frontline employees in the field who continue to safely and effectively operate our facilities every day. And thanks to our other employees who are operating at a high level of effectiveness, working remotely to ensure continued first-class service to our customers.  Our industry continues to navigate through an unprecedented period as a result of COVID-19. The low demand and low crude oil price environments driving producers to meaningfully reduce their activity levels and even curtail current production. Given this lower volume outlook and increased uncertainty about business fundamentals, we moved quickly and decisively as an organization to take some key actions to protect our balance sheet and position Targa to be successful over the long term. On March 18, we announced the market a 90% reduction in Targa's common dividend payout. This reduction provides approximately $755 million of additional annual direct cash flow resulting in significant free cash flow available to reduce debt. Additionally, we also announced meaningful reductions to our 2020 and 2021 net growth capital spending estimates. Since then, we have further reduced our 2020 net growth CapEx estimate to a range that is now between $700 million and $800 million, which now represents a 40% reduction at the midpoint relative to our initial 2020 guidance. We continue to identify and execute other measures to best position Targa over the long term, given lower expected growth and related business activity. In aggregate, we now expect our estimated 2020 operating and general and administrative expenses to be lower by at least $100 million versus prior expectations. Some of the additional measures that we have taken include reductions in compensation, benefits and our workforce across the Targa organization, including Targa executive management reduced their 2020 salaries by 10% to 15%, resulting in a reduction to their expected total cash compensation of approximately 40% compared to last year and based on our current forecast.  Targa's Board of Directors reduced their 2020 cash compensation by 10%. We reduced our workforce by 8% in late April. And we further eliminated new positions -- new open positions expected in the growth environment of our initial 2020 budget. We are also highly focused on tightly managing every line item in our operating and G&A expense budgets and are currently estimating significantly lower utilities, chemicals, lube oils and ad valorem taxes, among others. We will continue to be focused on capital and operating cost discipline as we work through the current environment.  Turning to our business segments. Let's talk about the production that we're currently seeing across our gathering and processing systems. We continue to have a lot of discussions with our producers regarding their plans for near term production, and those discussions remain very fluid. We have seen shut-ins of older wells and shut-ins of newer wells. Each producer is driven by different factors unique to their economic interests and their outlook. We have experienced shut-ins across each of our gathering and processing regions for the month of April, but only to a small degree so far. For example, our volumes in the Permian in April were approximately flat to the first quarter, so we have not seen a material impact from shut-ins yet.  We do, however, expect more volumes to be shut in for May. And while there is still significant uncertainty given our latest producer discussions and given what we're seeing on our systems today, beginning in May, we are estimating shut-in volumes of approximately 10% across our aggregate Permian region. In our central region, we are also estimating shut-in volumes of approximately 10%. And in the Badlands, we estimate about 30% to 40% of gas and approximately 20% of crude oil to be shut in. These shut-ins will result in lower NGL supply through Grand Prix and through our fractionation trains in Mont Belvieu. However, as a potential economic mitigant, Targa has one of the leading NGL storage positions in Mont Belvieu. This storage position is highly valuable in this environment and allows us an opportunity to benefit from the dynamics in the NGL market.  And our LPG export business at Galena Park continues to perform well and we remain on track to complete the expansion of our export facility at Galena Park in the third quarter. We remain highly contracted for the rest of the year.  It was only a few months ago that we reported a record fourth quarter and full year 2019 earnings and discussed our strong business outlook. And as we've already discussed since then, business fundamentals have changed drastically. We believe that Targa is well positioned to navigate through this period of weak market fundamentals, even in an environment with protracted producer shut-ins. We have a strong liquidity position and have taken actions to protect our balance sheet and preserve our financial flexibility, generating free cash flow after dividends to reduce debt looking forward.  The world continues to work through the impacts of this COVID-19, creating significant variability around expectations for demand for commodities. As you may have read in our press release this morning, given the uncertainties in this environment, we are updating our full year 2020 adjusted EBITDA estimate to $1.40 billion to $1.625 billion and withdrawing our previously disclosed full year 2020 operational expectations.  We would like to share what we see as a reasonable range of expected outcomes and some color around detailed downside cases that we ran internally. For example, we ran a downside case, which assumes 30% production shut-ins for the remainder of the year in the Permian Basin, and in that scenario, we believe we would generate somewhere around $1.4 billion of full year 2020 adjusted EBITDA. Based on recent producer dialogue, we currently don't expect that negative production case to occur, but rather some lesser amount of volume shut-ins for a duration of a couple to several months. So we believe an expectation of full year 2020 adjusted EBITDA of around $1.40 billion to $1.625 billion, depending on production levels, covers a reasonable range of potential outcomes. But remember, our results are driven by our producer customers across our G&P operating regions, and there remains significant uncertainty around the potential extent and duration of estimated shut-ins.  Lastly, despite the uncertainty of the current environment, based on the strength of our premier integrated asset position and our employees, Targa is poised to benefit when business fundamentals improve, positioning us exceptionally well for the longer term.  With that, I will now turn the call over to Jen to discuss Targa's results for the first quarter and other finance-related matters.\nJennifer Kneale: Thanks, Matt. Targa's reported quarterly adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter was $428 million. Our performance during the first quarter was driven by strong volumes across our Permian and Badlands G&P systems combined with strong asset performance through our integrated downstream value chain of NGL transportation, fractionation and LPG export services. We recently commenced operations on our new Frac Train 7 in Mont Belvieu and completed our new Peregrine gas plant in Permian Delaware. We remain on track to complete our remaining major growth capital projects underway this year, which means we will be well positioned to benefit when activity levels increase. Considering current market conditions in the low commodity price environment, during the first quarter, we recognized an approximate $2.4 billion noncash impairment charge. The impairment is primarily associated with the partial impairment of gas processing facilities and gathering systems associated with our mid-continent G&P operations and full impairment of our coastal G&P operations.  Turning to hedging. Based on a range of current estimates of producer customer activity levels, we remain substantially hedged for 2020. We have hedged approximately 85% to 100% of natural gas, approximately 75% to 100% of condensate and approximately 65% to 80% of NGL. Supplemental hedge disclosures, including 2021 hedge percentages by commodity, can be found in our earnings supplement presentation on our website. We continue to closely monitor and manage our credit exposure. We have a large diversified customer base across our operating businesses, which includes large integrated customers and other investment-grade counterparties.  Approximately 75% of the revenue from our top 25 customers is from investment-grade counterparties or from customers which provide credit protections. We currently do not anticipate any material credit losses as we are largely in a net payable position in our G&P contracts. And in our downstream businesses, our counterparties are largely either investment-grade or otherwise are required to provide credit protections to secure their commercial arrangements. As Matt described, our 2020 net growth CapEx estimate has been further reduced to now be between $700 million to $800 million. Additionally, we have reduced our 2020 net maintenance CapEx estimate to approximately $130 million.  In April, we extended our accounts receivable facility to April 2021 and reduced our facility commitment size from $400 million to $250 million, to minimize commitment fees, given our expectations for lower activity levels and commodity prices. During the first quarter and through early April, we repurchased a portion of outstanding senior TRP notes on the open market paying approximately $240 million plus accrued interest to repurchase approximately $300 million of notes, which provides approximately $12 million in annual interest savings. We had approximately $2.4 billion of available liquidity as of March 31 and have no near-term maturities of senior notes or credit facilities, with the earliest maturity occurring in 2023.  On a debt compliance basis, TRP's leverage ratio at the end of the first quarter was approximately 4.1x versus a compliance covenant of 5.5x. Our consolidated reported debt-to-EBITDA ratio was approximately 5.1x.  To echo Matt's earlier statements, we believe that with the collective actions we have proactively taken to protect our balance sheet and strengthen our financial flexibility, Targa is well positioned for the long term.  And with that, operator, please open the lineup for questions.\nSanjay Lad: [Operator Instructions]. Bridget, can you please open the line to Q&A, please?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Christine Cho with Barclays.\nChristine Cho: Thank you for all the color. I just wanted to maybe touch upon the conversations that you're having with producers. Can you just give us some more color on what those conversations are like? And also recognizing that you have some large customers that are public, I would also be curious as to how the conversations with the smaller and private guys are going.\nMatthew Meloy: Sure. Yes, I'd characterize our producer conversation, as I kind of said in the script, very fluid. I'd say even just a few weeks or even a month ago, some producers were giving us estimates for what they believe they were going to shut-in. And this ranges across our systems, really large and small. And we've seen them shut some in only, maybe even a few days or weeks later to come back up and then shut-in a different amount. So we've seen variability even among some producers about what they're going to do and how they're going to execute their shut-in plan. And we've seen others say, we're getting ready to, here's what we're going to do, and we've even seen those plans change. So I'd say producers right now are trying to work through what best makes sense for them. And oil prices are moving around very quickly as well. So they're trying to best balance their downstream needs and obligations versus current prices, and where they're in kind of constant dialogue with them trying to figure out how best to make sure that we can handle the volume.\nChristine Cho: Would you say the conversations are different for the private guys because they're downstream constraints or downstream commitments might be different?\nMatthew Meloy: I'd say, really, and just when the management team here is talking to each one of our different leaders in the business segment, it really just more varies producer by producer. I don't know if I could aggregate that the publics are doing one thing versus the privates. I mean, there's significant variability across system, across region. Some producers have acreage positions in multiple basins and how they're acting in one basin versus another versus a producer who might be acting one way because their production is all in one basin, can be very different, even amongst the same basin. So I think it varies more unique to their acreage position and their economic situation as opposed to whether they're the publics or the privates or small or large.\nChristine Cho: Okay. Very helpful. And then you brought on a frac, and another one is set to come on later this year. Some of your peers have deferred the timing of their frac. So wondering if you're expecting more third parties to offload into your plans this year or next year? Or alternatively, were there volumes that you were expecting to move over to third-party plans that are maybe not happening under the scheduled time frame?\nMatthew Meloy: Yes. I'd say, when it comes to our fracs, we are planning on completing we're -- significant progress on Train 8. So we do plan to complete that. And I think you're right, there are some others who have either slowed down or canceled some of their fracs. So when volumes begin to grow, if they're in a position where they would need some frac capacity, there is that potential. We would welcome that opportunity. What we're looking at for 2020, I don't know that we would see a lot of that opportunity, but as we go out, certainly, that opportunity could present itself.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Shneur Gershuni with UBS.\nShneur Gershuni: I just wanted to start off by following up on the frac conversation. When I think about Frac 8 coming online, if it's the volumes that come into your system end up being below the capacity of your entire frac footprint, are there opportunities to optimize by shutting down an older inefficient frac temporarily and moving the volumes to the newer fracs? What if kind of the partial ownership sort of limit that opportunity from a margin perspective?\nScott Pryor: Shneur, this is Scott Pryor. We definitely look at our entire fractionation facility as a whole. But we will operate those based upon what is most efficient, what is based upon the economics of the inflow of volumes as well as the outflow of volumes needed to fulfill customer contracts. Again, both on the inbound side as well as the outbound side. As we supply customers downstream of that, as we supply export volumes from both propane and butane, we certainly look at it from an optimization perspective. And there's a variety of factors that flow through those analyses, but we are certainly looking at it to optimize what is most efficient and is -- what benefits us from an economic perspective.\nShneur Gershuni: Okay. That makes great sense. And maybe to follow-up on the G&P side. I definitely appreciated all the color that you gave about shut-ins and so forth. I was wondering if you can just give a little bit of color about what your underlying decline rate is for your Permian footprint. And how easy is it to bring shut-in wells back? Is it costly? Or is it something that's pretty straightforward across your footprint?\nMatthew Meloy: Yes. Good. Good question there on the shut-ins. We've had, I'd say, extensive conversations with our producers about that. So as we're trying to forecast when there's going to be shut-ins, what should we expect when it comes back. So again, we can be ready. I'd say for the most part, in those producer discussions, they feel like most of that production when they shut-in, we'll be able to bring it back without damaging the reservoir. Could there be some older, really low rate vertical wells and some things which they shut-in and just don't bring back? I think there could be some amount of those as well. But I think for the most part, we'd expect the shut-in volumes to come back and perform well when those volumes do come back. As far as the decline rates, that's tough. I don't have a crisp answer for you on that. I mean, it would be by system. Obviously, there's been a lot of growth in the Permian. So we have newer vintage on average production there where some of our older systems who haven't been growing as much. So it would be steeper there.\nShneur Gershuni: Okay. That makes sense. And just one final question. I was surprised to see how much you've been able to repurchase debt in the open market. Do you expect to continue to do so if the opportunities present itself, i.e. the debt trades below par? Or have we seen the sale end of that?\nJennifer Kneale: Shneur, this is Jen. I think, ultimately, it depends on opportunities that the market presents to us. And so we saw the opportunity when our debt started trading at a deep discount in early March to repurchase notes at a very attractive rate made all the sense in the world in terms of interest savings while also reducing our overall leverage. If we get that opportunity in the future, we'll certainly look to utilize some of our available liquidity to continue to execute on that, but ultimately, it just depends on the market opportunity.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Blum with Wells Fargo.\nMichael Blum: So I apologize for harping on the fracs and all that. But I guess, maybe the questions everyone is trying to get at, and I'll try to ask it may be a little differently is -- so as you stated, you're expecting to see NGL volumes come down, but you also said at the sort of tail end of that, that you're contracted on your pipeline and the LPG exports and your frac. So can you just address the contracted position? Because I think what everyone's trying to figure out is why are you adding frac capacity and LPG export capacity when it seems like production is going down so how protected are you with contracts?\nMatthew Meloy: Sure. Yes, thanks, Michael. Yes, I'll start on the fracs and then hit on the exports as well, and then Scott, you can fill in too. On the fractionation side, we have significant number of third-party customers, we have long-term fractionation contracts with. A lot of those are transportation in fractionation and a lot of our simple, just fractionation agreements. And then we have additional volumes moving through our system, through our gathering and processing business, which are underpinned by acreage dedications and volumes coming from our processing plants.  So when you look at our fractionation position, we're, obviously, anticipating there would be significant growth from our underlying acreage dedications, but we also have a ramp-up in our commitments in our MVCs. So whether they're T&F or fractionation, they're going to be ramping and these commitments ramp over time. And so that's what gave us the confidence to underwrite 2 trains, Train 7 and 8. So over time, we'll have our own volumes for ramping MVCs and commitments for highly -- a substantial majority, a very large portion of our fractionation position there.  But it's going to take a little bit longer. The ramp is going to take a little bit longer than we estimated when we underwrote those facilities. And we are so far along on Train 8 that there's not much cost savings to be had by delaying that. We can do better on optimizing, as Scott talked about earlier, optimizing our fracs, trying to lower cost by running things a little bit better. So we think it makes sense for us to go ahead and continue with Train 8. And then moving to the export side, we have -- we're significantly contracted. We're highly contracted last year. We're highly contracted right now. And we do have forward contracts that ramp up as we bring LEP3. So as we increase our capacity on the export side, we have more contracts that start as well. So we're highly contracted this year, even when taking into account the increased capacity.\nMichael Blum: Great. I'm sorry, go ahead.\nScott Pryor: Michael, I'm sorry, this is Scott. Just to add to that a little bit. When you look at the volumes that we did across the fractionator in the first quarter, obviously, they were very strong. We appreciated the added capacity that came online during March with Frac Train 7. But as Matt alluded to, is we may see the ramp a little bit longer as we fill into the rest of the fractionation capacity that we're adding later this year. With that said, it also allows us the opportunity to reduce our capital exposure for 2020 as well as 2021, which we alluded to clearly in our script, as we talked about our capital spend. So we are positioned well as volume growth starts coming back to the marketplace over time. From the export perspective, we had a nice strong quarter.  And you can see, if you look at the materials that we put out there on our pages, we've had strong quarters, really good dating back to early 2019, every quarter was stronger with the export volumes going across our dock. We continue to see good exports in the month of April, and things are shaping up well. There's still strong demand for exports across the world. And as markets recover in the East, that just actually provides more benefit to us over the long haul. And you've also seen, just from a market perspective, some of the pull-down in production with the OPEC+ nations that adds some benefit to U.S. Gulf Coast volumes going out. So we feel very fortunate to be in the position we are within a very diverse downstream market that supports our upstream production growth.\nMichael Blum: Great. I really appreciate it. One -- just 1 clarification question on something you said earlier. The shut-in numbers you put out there, the different percentages for the different patients, is that just for May? Or is that like what time period is that specifically?\nMatthew Meloy: Yes. The numbers I gave, the 10% for Permian and the like was our estimate for what's going to be shut-in in May, kind of relative to current. So if you take kind of April or just kind of where we are kind of entering May, we would estimate 10% of those volumes to be shut-in, in the Permian, 10% in central and then 30% to 40% of the Badlands.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Colton Bean with Tudor, Pickering and Holt.\nColton Bean: I appreciate the comments on the NGL storage. I think you guys have something around 100 million -- or 50 million, sorry, in Belvieu and another 20 million in Louisiana. Can you just frame for us to what degree that's available to you versus leased out to third parties?\nMatthew Meloy: Yes. I'd say we have with 50 million in barrels in Belvieu, we have a lot of flexibility and capabilities to optimize our storage position. And you're right, a good portion of that is leased to third parties. A lot of it is for our own managing the engine out, the Y-grade coming in, the purity products, but we have a significant amount to move wells in from one purity product into another and have some flexibility and fungibility there as well. So I'd say, with our position, it just provides us a lot of ability to optimize that position. And so we feel good about that in this contango market.\nColton Bean: Got it. And then I think even prior to the volume reduction, you were already hedged around 80% or so on natural gas, but still some spot and correct me here, but I believe Waha was assumed at $0.50 or so. So with the forward curve now looking like $2-plus for Waha, can you just update us on what's assumed in the new guidance range?\nJennifer Kneale: We don't have what I characterize as a single price assumption. We've got a wide guidance range, Colton, and that's reflective of the uncertainty in the current market. Prices are moving around on a daily basis as they do, but it's difficult to say that there's a certain commodity price that's running through our new updated guidance range. It's based on a range of estimates for prices, shut-ins, activity levels, et cetera.\nColton Bean: Got it. I guess, directionally, is it fair to say that the Waha assumption may have moved higher? Or is that also still, I guess, included in that range?\nMatthew Meloy: So I think given our hedged position for gas, the amount that it's moved around is not a large variable in the guidance range. We have significant amount hedged for 2020. So there's -- it's not a large driver for us in that guidance range. But Jen is right, we looked at this around. We looked at strip pricing as we were going through the volumes and updating it, but we looked at many different cases and many different pricing assumptions. But the gas price variability was not one of the larger drivers in that range.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan.\nCharles Barber: This is Charlie on for Jeremy. I just wanted to follow-up on the LPG export side. It sounded like volumes are still pretty strong through April and 2020 is pretty well contracted, but I was curious about how you think that trends kind of the balance of this year as we think about lower cost naphtha, just competing products? And then maybe how that leaks into 2021 and beyond. I don't know how low contracted you are there? How you feel about that? And if your strategy, how that's evolved?\nScott Pryor: Yes. Charlie, I would say -- this is Scott again. First off, when you look back at the fact that we're adding additional export expansion in the third quarter this year, we talked about that in our script as well. And that is supported by contracts that will be coming online that are tied to that expansion project. So that's the pieces that make us feel very good about the second half of 2020. Those contracts, obviously, flow into 2021, which are both supportive of propane exports as well as butane exports. And so from that perspective, we feel good about the growth. And again, like the fact that we're moving forward with that project coming online in the third quarter. As it relates to the naphtha-based products, there's been some refinery runs that have created some tightness in the marketplace. And some of the heavy-end derivatives that are impacted by that. So we continue to believe that we'll see strong exports for propane and butane, and there'll be limited, I guess, competition for that leading into '20 -- as the balance of '20 as well as 2021.\nCharles Barber: All right. That's helpful. And then just one other from me. The $100 million cost reductions, I know a lot of that was tied to compensation and headcount. Curious if there's anything operationally you're doing to kind of slim down costs or anything that you can do. I think you noted that -- is that this $100 million was at least so, I don't know if there's more to come there.\nJennifer Kneale: Yes. I'd say that a significant portion of the $100 million of expected savings is OpEx. And so that does include some reduction in headcount, both in existing positions and then also in a lower expectation for hiring throughout the year out in the field. But our supply chain group, our operations groups are incredibly focused and have been very successful in identifying opportunities to rationalize costs on basically every line item. So you heard Matt mentioned some of them, like chemicals and lubricants, but it's really every single item that we're purchasing, we are trying to purchase better at a lower cost to Targa. So that will continue to be a focus and has been a very big focus of our operations and supply chain group really over the last year, but certainly, that focus has heightened here recently.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Tristan Richardson with SunTrust.\nTristan Richardson: Really appreciate all the commentary around shut-ins and just what you're seeing on the supply side. Just, with respect to the supply side, as you went through that range of what potential outcomes, on the base case, where do you guys see a general resumption that shut-in production occurring, either a time frame or a price signal?\nMatthew Meloy: Yes. I'd say in that downside scenario, which kind of got us to that low end 1.4 number, taking, call it, 30% shut-ins in the Permian for the rest of the year, that's not our base case. I just don't think it's going to be that severe for that long. I said in the script, it's probably more likely going to be a couple to a few months would be if you had to say what's a reasonable guess, maybe a couple to a few months seems like a reasonable guess. But we also qualify, I want to qualify that with we really -- there's a lot of uncertainty. And could it carry on much longer than a couple to a few months? That's certainly a possibility. When does worldwide demand come back? When do people start driving again? It's really hard to say when that demand comes back. So that's why we did want to kind of present a wider range and have a downside scenario that if this lasts longer and the cuts are even deeper than what we're likely going to see in May, how does Targa look? And that's why we kind of went with that wider range and did that. But ours would be -- our best guess would be something less than that downside case in terms of shut-in percentage.\nTristan Richardson: I appreciate it. Very helpful. And then, Jen, you mentioned working with customers to reduce commodity exposure. I think we generally think of that as a long term initiative. But does the current market advance those discussions? I mean understanding it's difficult to open up an existing contract with a customer in this environment, but just any thoughts there.\nJennifer Kneale: We continue to be focused on trying to enter into, amend, have the best possible contracts. And so that's always a focus for our commercial teams and then for others across the organization that are entered -- involved in purchasing and other things like that. On the gathering and processing side, we've talked fairly consistently over the last several quarters about our efforts to enter into more fee-based arrangements, have more fee-based floors. I think the lower commodity price environment highlights why that's important to us, particularly if we are going to spend capital. Now clearly, we're rationalizing capital. So that's a little less applicable right now. But that continues to be a big focus of ours, really across the organization is trying to improve contracts when we are given the opportunity.\nOperator: And our last question comes from the line of Keith Stanley with Wolfe Research.\nKeith Stanley: Just a follow-up on the volume assumptions in the guidance. So the bottom end ties to 30% shut-ins through the rest of the year in the Permian, it sounds pretty conservative. What does it assume for other basins? And then what is the top end of the guidance range assumed for volumes, just at a high level?\nMatthew Meloy: Yes. In terms of the production, we wanted to give you some clarity around that downside scenario related to our most impactful basin, which to us is the Permian because then it moves through Grand Prix and fractionation and export. The other basins are, to some extent, tied in, but not as much. So we did pull the operational guidance for this year and don't want to get too specific on kind of each system, what we assumed for those. I'd say the most impactful one is Permian. And we wanted to give you a sense that it's a conservative range there. I'd just say directionally, it was a higher percentage in the Badlands, and it was a lower percentage in our other regions as the others are more gassy-weighted. So just kind of directionally for those other areas.\nKeith Stanley: Okay. And the top end, can you comment at all, just Permian what you guys were planning?\nMatthew Meloy: Yes. So I mean we looked at shut-in cases. We looked at others where there was less. I think on the top end, we said it at the low end of our previous guidance range and said, let's look at a number of different volume cases, price cases, when things come back. So it's not a one street case, which was the low side, the mid and the high. It was a range of cases and we feel like in a number of those scenarios, they're going to shake out in that $1.4 billion to $1.625 billion. So to get up to the mid or higher, it would be less shut-ins percentage for less duration and doing well on optimization and cost savings and other items. So -- but it's not a discrete case tied to the high end, yes.\nKeith Stanley: Okay. Follow-up question, just with any revised thoughts on what the company's leverage target would be? And how much of the priority it is to get there, I guess, quickly? I mean, it doesn't seem like the rating agencies are reacting very much to the sector as a whole with the downturn. So just how much of a priority is it if the rating agencies aren't really pressuring you? And just on capital allocation, would you expect looking forward beyond this year to be allocating most of the free cash flow to paying down debt on the balance sheet?\nJennifer Kneale: This is Jen. I think that for the last year-plus, we've talked very consistently about how reducing our overall leverage was the priority for us, the Paramount priority. And as we look forward and look at our profile of generating growing free cash flow as we move through time, it would be available for the repayment of debt just as a result of the dividend reduction plus lower capital spending. That means that we'll have a lot more flexibility than we would have previously prior to the dividend reduction to reduce our leverage more quickly.  So I think that we feel very well positioned from that perspective. I think for anybody that's lived through the last couple of months, having lower leverage clearly would feel better than being in position of higher leverage. And so we've talked about 4x on a consolidated debt-to-EBITDA basis, being sort of a target for ours, but that it was going to take us some time to get there and that we're willing to be patient to get there. I think we have that same patience to get there. But again, the dividend reduction potentially allows us to get there more quickly. Now does 4x consolidated end-up being the right leverage ratio to target or is it lower than that? I think that remains to be seen a little bit, but it potentially could be lower than 4x.  As you can imagine, after we reduced the dividend, we had calls with the rating agencies. And I think those were very constructive conversations, I think that they are appreciative of the steps that we have taken to shore up our balance sheet and to make sure that we have financial flexibility. So certainly, it doesn't feel like that's a catalyst that's pushing us to make different decisions than we otherwise might want to, but again, as we've consistently said for the last year, ideally, we would like for our business to grow into being an investment-grade business because that, again, enhances flexibility that we would have in difficult markets. And so that remains a priority, too.\nOperator: I'm not showing any further questions. So I'll now turn the call back over to Sanjay for closing remarks.\nSanjay Lad: Great. Thank you. We thank everyone for being on the call this morning and appreciate your interest in Targa Resources. We will be available for any follow-up questions over the course of the day. Thank you, and have a great day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the program. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Jennifer Kneale",
            "content": "Thanks, Matt. Targa's reported quarterly adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter was $428 million. Our performance during the first quarter was driven by strong volumes across our Permian and Badlands G&P systems combined with strong asset performance through our integrated downstream value chain of NGL transportation, fractionation and LPG export services. We recently commenced operations on our new Frac Train 7 in Mont Belvieu and completed our new Peregrine gas plant in Permian Delaware. We remain on track to complete our remaining major growth capital projects underway this year, which means we will be well positioned to benefit when activity levels increase. Considering current market conditions in the low commodity price environment, during the first quarter, we recognized an approximate $2.4 billion noncash impairment charge. The impairment is primarily associated with the partial impairment of gas processing facilities and gathering systems associated with our mid-continent G&P operations and full impairment of our coastal G&P operations.  Turning to hedging. Based on a range of current estimates of producer customer activity levels, we remain substantially hedged for 2020. We have hedged approximately 85% to 100% of natural gas, approximately 75% to 100% of condensate and approximately 65% to 80% of NGL. Supplemental hedge disclosures, including 2021 hedge percentages by commodity, can be found in our earnings supplement presentation on our website. We continue to closely monitor and manage our credit exposure. We have a large diversified customer base across our operating businesses, which includes large integrated customers and other investment-grade counterparties.  Approximately 75% of the revenue from our top 25 customers is from investment-grade counterparties or from customers which provide credit protections. We currently do not anticipate any material credit losses as we are largely in a net payable position in our G&P contracts. And in our downstream businesses, our counterparties are largely either investment-grade or otherwise are required to provide credit protections to secure their commercial arrangements. As Matt described, our 2020 net growth CapEx estimate has been further reduced to now be between $700 million to $800 million. Additionally, we have reduced our 2020 net maintenance CapEx estimate to approximately $130 million.  In April, we extended our accounts receivable facility to April 2021 and reduced our facility commitment size from $400 million to $250 million, to minimize commitment fees, given our expectations for lower activity levels and commodity prices. During the first quarter and through early April, we repurchased a portion of outstanding senior TRP notes on the open market paying approximately $240 million plus accrued interest to repurchase approximately $300 million of notes, which provides approximately $12 million in annual interest savings. We had approximately $2.4 billion of available liquidity as of March 31 and have no near-term maturities of senior notes or credit facilities, with the earliest maturity occurring in 2023.  On a debt compliance basis, TRP's leverage ratio at the end of the first quarter was approximately 4.1x versus a compliance covenant of 5.5x. Our consolidated reported debt-to-EBITDA ratio was approximately 5.1x.  To echo Matt's earlier statements, we believe that with the collective actions we have proactively taken to protect our balance sheet and strengthen our financial flexibility, Targa is well positioned for the long term.  And with that, operator, please open the lineup for questions. Shneur, this is Jen. I think, ultimately, it depends on opportunities that the market presents to us. And so we saw the opportunity when our debt started trading at a deep discount in early March to repurchase notes at a very attractive rate made all the sense in the world in terms of interest savings while also reducing our overall leverage. If we get that opportunity in the future, we'll certainly look to utilize some of our available liquidity to continue to execute on that, but ultimately, it just depends on the market opportunity. We don't have what I characterize as a single price assumption. We've got a wide guidance range, Colton, and that's reflective of the uncertainty in the current market. Prices are moving around on a daily basis as they do, but it's difficult to say that there's a certain commodity price that's running through our new updated guidance range. It's based on a range of estimates for prices, shut-ins, activity levels, et cetera. Yes. I'd say that a significant portion of the $100 million of expected savings is OpEx. And so that does include some reduction in headcount, both in existing positions and then also in a lower expectation for hiring throughout the year out in the field. But our supply chain group, our operations groups are incredibly focused and have been very successful in identifying opportunities to rationalize costs on basically every line item. So you heard Matt mentioned some of them, like chemicals and lubricants, but it's really every single item that we're purchasing, we are trying to purchase better at a lower cost to Targa.

            "name": "Scott Pryor",
            "content": "Shneur, this is Scott Pryor. We definitely look at our entire fractionation facility as a whole. But we will operate those based upon what is most efficient, what is based upon the economics of the inflow of volumes as well as the outflow of volumes needed to fulfill customer contracts. Again, both on the inbound side as well as the outbound side. As we supply customers downstream of that, as we supply export volumes from both propane and butane, we certainly look at it from an optimization perspective. And there's a variety of factors that flow through those analyses, but we are certainly looking at it to optimize what is most efficient and is -- what benefits us from an economic perspective. Michael, I'm sorry, this is Scott. Just to add to that a little bit. When you look at the volumes that we did across the fractionator in the first quarter, obviously, they were very strong. We appreciated the added capacity that came online during March with Frac Train 7. But as Matt alluded to, is we may see the ramp a little bit longer as we fill into the rest of the fractionation capacity that we're adding later this year. With that said, it also allows us the opportunity to reduce our capital exposure for 2020 as well as 2021, which we alluded to clearly in our script, as we talked about our capital spend. So we are positioned well as volume growth starts coming back to the marketplace over time. From the export perspective, we had a nice strong quarter.  And you can see, if you look at the materials that we put out there on our pages, we've had strong quarters, really good dating back to early 2019, every quarter was stronger with the export volumes going across our dock. We continue to see good exports in the month of April, and things are shaping up well. There's still strong demand for exports across the world. And as markets recover in the East, that just actually provides more benefit to us over the long haul. And you've also seen, just from a market perspective, some of the pull-down in production with the OPEC+ nations that adds some benefit to U.S. Gulf Coast volumes going out. So we feel very fortunate to be in the position we are within a very diverse downstream market that supports our upstream production growth. Yes. Charlie, I would say -- this is Scott again. First off, when you look back at the fact that we're adding additional export expansion in the third quarter this year, we talked about that in our script as well. And that is supported by contracts that will be coming online that are tied to that expansion project. So that's the pieces that make us feel very good about the second half of 2020. Those contracts, obviously, flow into 2021, which are both supportive of propane exports as well as butane exports. And so from that perspective, we feel good about the growth. And again, like the fact that we're moving forward with that project coming online in the third quarter. As it relates to the naphtha-based products, there's been some refinery runs that have created some tightness in the marketplace. And some of the heavy-end derivatives that are impacted by that. So we continue to believe that we'll see strong exports for propane and butane, and there'll be limited, I guess, competition for that leading into '20 -- as the balance of '20 as well as 2021."
        },
        "speaker3": {
            "name": "Matthew Meloy",
            "content": "Thanks, Sanjay. Good morning, and thank you to everyone for joining. On behalf of the Targa team, we hope that you and your families are doing well and staying safe.  The first quarter results show that our assets continue to perform well with solid operational and financial performance in the first quarter. We had $428 million of adjusted EBITDA, 32% growth in Permian volumes, 37% growth in fractionation volumes and 26% growth in export volumes versus last year despite significantly lower commodity prices. Our continued efforts to reduce commodity exposure across our G&P business by adding fees and fee floors allowed us to generate higher operating margin even as prices fell significantly. The financial performance of our G&P segment is now more driven by volume throughput and fees as opposed to direct commodity prices, which will serve us well going forward. With some of our fee-based contracts through our fee-floor structure, we will also benefit as prices begin to rise.  Now moving on to the impacts of COVID-19. When it became clear that the pandemic was a significant risk to our employees and their families, we moved quickly to make sure that we took care of our employees, our facilities and our customers. We swiftly implemented important safety measures, including providing our employees with protective equipment and we are currently pleased with the minimal direct impact that the virus has had on our employees. I'd now like to thank all of our employees. We are especially proud of our frontline employees in the field who continue to safely and effectively operate our facilities every day. And thanks to our other employees who are operating at a high level of effectiveness, working remotely to ensure continued first-class service to our customers.  Our industry continues to navigate through an unprecedented period as a result of COVID-19. The low demand and low crude oil price environments driving producers to meaningfully reduce their activity levels and even curtail current production. Given this lower volume outlook and increased uncertainty about business fundamentals, we moved quickly and decisively as an organization to take some key actions to protect our balance sheet and position Targa to be successful over the long term. On March 18, we announced the market a 90% reduction in Targa's common dividend payout. This reduction provides approximately $755 million of additional annual direct cash flow resulting in significant free cash flow available to reduce debt. Additionally, we also announced meaningful reductions to our 2020 and 2021 net growth capital spending estimates. Since then, we have further reduced our 2020 net growth CapEx estimate to a range that is now between $700 million and $800 million, which now represents a 40% reduction at the midpoint relative to our initial 2020 guidance. We continue to identify and execute other measures to best position Targa over the long term, given lower expected growth and related business activity. In aggregate, we now expect our estimated 2020 operating and general and administrative expenses to be lower by at least $100 million versus prior expectations. Some of the additional measures that we have taken include reductions in compensation, benefits and our workforce across the Targa organization, including Targa executive management reduced their 2020 salaries by 10% to 15%, resulting in a reduction to their expected total cash compensation of approximately 40% compared to last year and based on our current forecast.  Targa's Board of Directors reduced their 2020 cash compensation by 10%. We reduced our workforce by 8% in late April. And we further eliminated new positions -- new open positions expected in the growth environment of our initial 2020 budget. We are also highly focused on tightly managing every line item in our operating and G&A expense budgets and are currently estimating significantly lower utilities, chemicals, lube oils and ad valorem taxes, among others. We will continue to be focused on capital and operating cost discipline as we work through the current environment.  Turning to our business segments. Let's talk about the production that we're currently seeing across our gathering and processing systems. We continue to have a lot of discussions with our producers regarding their plans for near term production, and those discussions remain very fluid. We have seen shut-ins of older wells and shut-ins of newer wells. Each producer is driven by different factors unique to their economic interests and their outlook. We have experienced shut-ins across each of our gathering and processing regions for the month of April, but only to a small degree so far. For example, our volumes in the Permian in April were approximately flat to the first quarter, so we have not seen a material impact from shut-ins yet.  We do, however, expect more volumes to be shut in for May. And while there is still significant uncertainty given our latest producer discussions and given what we're seeing on our systems today, beginning in May, we are estimating shut-in volumes of approximately 10% across our aggregate Permian region. In our central region, we are also estimating shut-in volumes of approximately 10%. And in the Badlands, we estimate about 30% to 40% of gas and approximately 20% of crude oil to be shut in. These shut-ins will result in lower NGL supply through Grand Prix and through our fractionation trains in Mont Belvieu. However, as a potential economic mitigant, Targa has one of the leading NGL storage positions in Mont Belvieu. This storage position is highly valuable in this environment and allows us an opportunity to benefit from the dynamics in the NGL market.  And our LPG export business at Galena Park continues to perform well and we remain on track to complete the expansion of our export facility at Galena Park in the third quarter. We remain highly contracted for the rest of the year.  It was only a few months ago that we reported a record fourth quarter and full year 2019 earnings and discussed our strong business outlook. And as we've already discussed since then, business fundamentals have changed drastically. We believe that Targa is well positioned to navigate through this period of weak market fundamentals, even in an environment with protracted producer shut-ins. We have a strong liquidity position and have taken actions to protect our balance sheet and preserve our financial flexibility, generating free cash flow after dividends to reduce debt looking forward.  The world continues to work through the impacts of this COVID-19, creating significant variability around expectations for demand for commodities. As you may have read in our press release this morning, given the uncertainties in this environment, we are updating our full year 2020 adjusted EBITDA estimate to $1.40 billion to $1.625 billion and withdrawing our previously disclosed full year 2020 operational expectations.  We would like to share what we see as a reasonable range of expected outcomes and some color around detailed downside cases that we ran internally. For example, we ran a downside case, which assumes 30% production shut-ins for the remainder of the year in the Permian Basin, and in that scenario, we believe we would generate somewhere around $1.4 billion of full year 2020 adjusted EBITDA. Based on recent producer dialogue, we currently don't expect that negative production case to occur, but rather some lesser amount of volume shut-ins for a duration of a couple to several months. So we believe an expectation of full year 2020 adjusted EBITDA of around $1.40 billion to $1.625 billion, depending on production levels, covers a reasonable range of potential outcomes. But remember, our results are driven by our producer customers across our G&P operating regions, and there remains significant uncertainty around the potential extent and duration of estimated shut-ins.  Lastly, despite the uncertainty of the current environment, based on the strength of our premier integrated asset position and our employees, Targa is poised to benefit when business fundamentals improve, positioning us exceptionally well for the longer term.  With that, I will now turn the call over to Jen to discuss Targa's results for the first quarter and other finance-related matters. Sure. Yes, I'd characterize our producer conversation, as I kind of said in the script, very fluid. I'd say even just a few weeks or even a month ago, some producers were giving us estimates for what they believe they were going to shut-in. And this ranges across our systems, really large and small. And we've seen them shut some in only, maybe even a few days or weeks later to come back up and then shut-in a different amount. So we've seen variability even among some producers about what they're going to do and how they're going to execute their shut-in plan. And we've seen others say, we're getting ready to, here's what we're going to do, and we've even seen those plans change. So I'd say producers right now are trying to work through what best makes sense for them. And oil prices are moving around very quickly as well. So they're trying to best balance their downstream needs and obligations versus current prices, and where they're in kind of constant dialogue with them trying to figure out how best to make sure that we can handle the volume. I'd say, really, and just when the management team here is talking to each one of our different leaders in the business segment, it really just more varies producer by producer. I don't know if I could aggregate that the publics are doing one thing versus the privates. I mean, there's significant variability across system, across region. Some producers have acreage positions in multiple basins and how they're acting in one basin versus another versus a producer who might be acting one way because their production is all in one basin, can be very different, even amongst the same basin. So I think it varies more unique to their acreage position and their economic situation as opposed to whether they're the publics or the privates or small or large. Yes. I'd say, when it comes to our fracs, we are planning on completing we're -- significant progress on Train 8. So we do plan to complete that. And I think you're right, there are some others who have either slowed down or canceled some of their fracs. So when volumes begin to grow, if they're in a position where they would need some frac capacity, there is that potential. We would welcome that opportunity. What we're looking at for 2020, I don't know that we would see a lot of that opportunity, but as we go out, certainly, that opportunity could present itself. Yes. Good. Good question there on the shut-ins. We've had, I'd say, extensive conversations with our producers about that. So as we're trying to forecast when there's going to be shut-ins, what should we expect when it comes back. So again, we can be ready. I'd say for the most part, in those producer discussions, they feel like most of that production when they shut-in, we'll be able to bring it back without damaging the reservoir. Could there be some older, really low rate vertical wells and some things which they shut-in and just don't bring back? I think there could be some amount of those as well. But I think for the most part, we'd expect the shut-in volumes to come back and perform well when those volumes do come back. As far as the decline rates, that's tough. I don't have a crisp answer for you on that. I mean, it would be by system. Obviously, there's been a lot of growth in the Permian. So we have newer vintage on average production there where some of our older systems who haven't been growing as much. So it would be steeper there. Sure. Yes, thanks, Michael. Yes, I'll start on the fracs and then hit on the exports as well, and then Scott, you can fill in too. On the fractionation side, we have significant number of third-party customers, we have long-term fractionation contracts with. A lot of those are transportation in fractionation and a lot of our simple, just fractionation agreements. And then we have additional volumes moving through our system, through our gathering and processing business, which are underpinned by acreage dedications and volumes coming from our processing plants.  So when you look at our fractionation position, we're, obviously, anticipating there would be significant growth from our underlying acreage dedications, but we also have a ramp-up in our commitments in our MVCs. So whether they're T&F or fractionation, they're going to be ramping and these commitments ramp over time. And so that's what gave us the confidence to underwrite 2 trains, Train 7 and 8. So over time, we'll have our own volumes for ramping MVCs and commitments for highly -- a substantial majority, a very large portion of our fractionation position there.  But it's going to take a little bit longer. The ramp is going to take a little bit longer than we estimated when we underwrote those facilities. And we are so far along on Train 8 that there's not much cost savings to be had by delaying that. We can do better on optimizing, as Scott talked about earlier, optimizing our fracs, trying to lower cost by running things a little bit better. So we think it makes sense for us to go ahead and continue with Train 8. And then moving to the export side, we have -- we're significantly contracted. We're highly contracted last year. We're highly contracted right now. And we do have forward contracts that ramp up as we bring LEP3. So as we increase our capacity on the export side, we have more contracts that start as well. So we're highly contracted this year, even when taking into account the increased capacity. Yes. The numbers I gave, the 10% for Permian and the like was our estimate for what's going to be shut-in in May, kind of relative to current. So if you take kind of April or just kind of where we are kind of entering May, we would estimate 10% of those volumes to be shut-in, in the Permian, 10% in central and then 30% to 40% of the Badlands. Yes. I'd say we have with 50 million in barrels in Belvieu, we have a lot of flexibility and capabilities to optimize our storage position. And you're right, a good portion of that is leased to third parties. A lot of it is for our own managing the engine out, the Y-grade coming in, the purity products, but we have a significant amount to move wells in from one purity product into another and have some flexibility and fungibility there as well. So I'd say, with our position, it just provides us a lot of ability to optimize that position. And so we feel good about that in this contango market. So I think given our hedged position for gas, the amount that it's moved around is not a large variable in the guidance range. We have significant amount hedged for 2020. So there's -- it's not a large driver for us in that guidance range. But Jen is right, we looked at this around. We looked at strip pricing as we were going through the volumes and updating it, but we looked at many different cases and many different pricing assumptions. But the gas price variability was not one of the larger drivers in that range. Yes. I'd say in that downside scenario, which kind of got us to that low end 1.4 number, taking, call it, 30% shut-ins in the Permian for the rest of the year, that's not our base case. I just don't think it's going to be that severe for that long. I said in the script, it's probably more likely going to be a couple to a few months would be if you had to say what's a reasonable guess, maybe a couple to a few months seems like a reasonable guess. But we also qualify, I want to qualify that with we really -- there's a lot of uncertainty. And could it carry on much longer than a couple to a few months? That's certainly a possibility. When does worldwide demand come back? When do people start driving again? It's really hard to say when that demand comes back. So that's why we did want to kind of present a wider range and have a downside scenario that if this lasts longer and the cuts are even deeper than what we're likely going to see in May, how does Targa look? And that's why we kind of went with that wider range and did that. But ours would be -- our best guess would be something less than that downside case in terms of shut-in percentage. Yes. In terms of the production, we wanted to give you some clarity around that downside scenario related to our most impactful basin, which to us is the Permian because then it moves through Grand Prix and fractionation and export. The other basins are, to some extent, tied in, but not as much. So we did pull the operational guidance for this year and don't want to get too specific on kind of each system, what we assumed for those. I'd say the most impactful one is Permian. And we wanted to give you a sense that it's a conservative range there. I'd just say directionally, it was a higher percentage in the Badlands, and it was a lower percentage in our other regions as the others are more gassy-weighted. So just kind of directionally for those other areas. Yes. So I mean we looked at shut-in cases. We looked at others where there was less. I think on the top end, we said it at the low end of our previous guidance range and said, let's look at a number of different volume cases, price cases, when things come back. So it's not a one street case, which was the low side, the mid and the high. It was a range of cases and we feel like in a number of those scenarios, they're going to shake out in that $1.4 billion to $1.625 billion. So to get up to the mid or higher, it would be less shut-ins percentage for less duration and doing well on optimization and cost savings and other items. So -- but it's not a discrete case tied to the high end, yes."

Fourth Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today\u2019s conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] 00:33 I will now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Mr. Sanjay Lad, Vice President of Finance and Investor Relations. Mr. Lad, the floor is yours.\nSanjay Lad: 00:44 Thanks, Chris. Good morning, everyone and welcome to the fourth quarter 2021 earnings call for Targa Resources Corp. The fourth quarter earnings release, along with the fourth quarter earnings supplement presentation for Targa Resources that accompany our call are available on our website at targaresources.com in the Investors section. In addition, an updated investor presentation has also been posted to our website. 01:09 Statements made during this call that might include Targa Resources' expectations or predictions should be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in forward-looking statements. For a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ, please refer to our latest SEC filings. 01:34 Our speakers for the call today will be Matt Meloy, Chief Executive Officer; and Jen Kneale, Chief Financial Officer. Additionally, the following senior management team members will be available for Q&A: Pat McDonie, President, Gathering and Processing; Scott Pryor, President, Logistics and Transportation; and Bobby Muraro, Chief Commercial Officer. 01:57 And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Matt.\nMatt Meloy: 02:00 Thanks, Sanjay and good morning. This is an exciting time at Targa, where our operational and financial execution in 2021 provided a lot of momentum for 2022. I would first like to recognize and thank Targa's employees that worked tirelessly across another year of challenges in 2021 to help drive record financial and operational performance. 02:22 Let's quickly mention some of the highlights from 2021: record Gathering and Processing volumes in the Permian, safely bringing the Heim Plant online, on time and under budget, record volumes across our Logistics and Transportation assets, record adjusted EBITDA of $2.05 billion, a 25% increase over 2020, about $1.2 billion of year-over-year debt reduction and a year-end leverage ratio of 3.2 times, and increasing return of capital to our shareholders through a higher fourth quarter dividend and fourth quarter common share repurchases. 03:01 Turning to 2022, we already have a number of highlights to mention, repurchased our DevCo joint venture interest in January, executed agreements to sell our 25% equity interest in Gulf Coast Express Pipeline, or GCX, for approximately 11 times EBITDA, upgraded to investment grade by Fitch and moved to positive Watch by S&P and Moody's, and refinanced our revolving credit facility to a five-year $2.75 billion facility at TRC. We continue to execute on our strategic priorities and have visibility to volume growth across our assets, which is driving increasing EBITDA as we look forward. 03:42 For 2022, we estimate full year adjusted EBITDA to be between $2.3 billion and $2.5 billion, which is a significant increase over 2021. This guidance is based on forward prices where there continues to be backwardation. If prices averaged around today's levels for 2022, we would expect to exceed the top end of our full year financial guidance. With the repurchase of our DevCo interest and our flexibility to accelerate redemption of our preferred stock, given the sale of GCX, we have already simplified and will continue to simplify our capital structure. 04:19 We are also demonstrating our increasing ability to return capital to our shareholders with the execution of common share repurchases in the fourth quarter, in addition to the fourth quarter common share dividend increase. As previously discussed, we expect to pay a common dividend of $0.35 per quarter, $1.40 annualized to our shareholders for 2022. The strength of our balance sheet provides significant flexibility to redeem our preferred shares faster than we previously anticipated and to continue to assess opportunistic repurchases of common shares. 04:53 Let's now turn to our operations. Starting in the Permian, our systems across the Midland and Delaware Basins continue to perform well, averaging a record 3 billion cubic feet per day reported inlet during the fourth quarter. Our average 2021 Permian inlet volumes increased 12% over 2020, exceeding the top end of our 2021 growth range. We continue to see strong activity levels across both our Midland and Delaware footprints and expect to benefit from this positive momentum as we move through 2022. 05:27 For full year 2022, we expect our average Permian inlet to increase between 12% to 15% over average 2021. In Permian Midland, our system continues to run near full with our next 275 million cubic feet per day Legacy Plant on track to begin operations during the fourth quarter of this year. With robust activity levels expected to continue into next year and beyond, we are moving forward with the construction of our Legacy II plant, another new 275 million cubic feet per day plant in the Permian Midland. Legacy II is expected to begin operations during the second quarter of 2023. 06:07 In Permian Delaware, volumes across our system also continue to ramp. Today, we announced the construction of a new 275 million cubic feet per day plant -- the Midway plant. The new Midway plant is expected to begin operations during the third quarter of 2023. Midway will provide us with additional flexibility to flow volumes between our Midland and Delaware systems. We are idling an older plant, which is more prone to operational upsets, has higher operating costs, higher maintenance costs, lower recoveries and is limited in capacity. 06:40 The Midway plant improves performance on all of those items and will give us the ability to flow current volumes being processed at Sand Hills and an additional 110 million cubic feet per day of capacity that can be filled from the Delaware, Central or Midland Basins. This project is a good example of how to improve our overall environmental performance while also providing attractive returns. 07:07 The strong outlook across our Permian Basin footprint will continue to drive incremental volumes through our NGL downstream businesses and our recently announced expansions in both the Midland and Delaware, position Targa to realize very attractive integrated returns and continue to benefit from our embedded operating leverage with modest capital spending. 07:27 In our Central and Badlands regions, we are seeing stronger activity levels given the higher commodity price environment and expect 2022 average Central and Badlands volumes in aggregate to be flat relative to 2021 as higher production is expected to largely offset legacy decline in our systems. 07:46 Shifting to our Logistics and Transportation segment. NGL transportation volumes continue to increase and we transported a record 433,000 barrels per day to Mont Belvieu during the fourth quarter. Throughput volumes sequentially increased 4%, driven by increasing NGL production from Targa's Permian plants, including our new Heim Plant and third-parties. 08:10 Fourth quarter fractionation volumes at our Mont Belvieu complex averaged 612,000 barrels per day and were lower sequentially due to an unplanned outage in associated repairs and maintenance, which impacted volumes by about 50,000 barrels per day. The unplanned outage was associated with cooling water exchangers that support a portion of our CBF fracs, which resulted in reduced operating rates for the quarter. 08:35 We have excess fractionation capacity, so we are handling all incoming NGL volumes as well as some volumes that normally would have been fractionated in Q4, so our Q1 average volumes are expected to be higher. We expect to be operating back to normal by the end of the quarter. This outage resulted in higher CapEx -- sorry, in higher OpEx in Q4 and is also expected to impact OpEx in Q1 of this year. 09:01 Looking ahead to 2022, we expect higher year-over-year Grand Prix and fractionation volumes as our downstream systems continue to benefit from increasing supply from our growing Permian G&P position. In our LPG export services business at Galena Park, fourth quarter volumes rebounded following maintenance completed during the third quarter and increased 19% sequentially as we loaded an average 10.7 million barrels per month during the fourth quarter. 09:31 The outlook for our LPG export business in 2022 remains robust, complemented by our contracted portfolio and supply position in Mont Belvieu. In response to growing international demand for cleaner feedstocks and U.S. LPGs, we are undertaking an additional low cost expansion project to increase our loading rates at our Galena Park facilities. This refrigeration expansion will increase our propane loading capabilities more than an incremental 1 million barrels per month by mid-2023. 10:05 The longer-term outlook for Targa is strong. Our premier integrated Permian NGL business, our talented employees, complemented by our strong balance sheet and financial flexibility, we remain in position to grow our footprint and return increasing capital to our shareholders over time. 10:24 With that, I will now turn the call over to Jen.\nJen Kneale: 10:27 Thanks, Matt. Targa's reported quarterly adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $571 million, increasing 13% sequentially as we benefited from higher volumes across most of our assets and higher commodity prices. Our full year 2021 adjusted EBITDA was $2.05 billion and exceeded the high end of our full year financial guidance range. 10:51 Targa generated adjusted free cash flow of approximately $1.13 billion, which allowed us to reduce our leverage significantly across the year. At year end, our consolidated leverage ratio was 3.2 times. We spent $408 million in net growth capital during 2021 with spending largely focused on our Gathering and Processing business as we continue to benefit from operating leverage downstream. 11:17 We also had some spending shift from the fourth quarter to 2022, which is included in our 2022 growth capital estimate. Our net maintenance CapEx was about $130 million in 2021. During the fourth quarter, we recognized an approximate $452 million non-cash pretax impairment charge of our South Texas assets attributable to a lower outlook on future volumes. We are significantly hedged for 2022 and continue to add hedges for 2023 and beyond, while still benefiting from higher prices across our unhedged equity volume exposure and prices now well above fee floors. 11:53 We repurchased approximately $40 million of common shares in the fourth quarter and as of December 31, had approximately $369 million remaining under our $500 million share repurchase program. At year end, we had over $3.2 billion of available liquidity, which put us in excellent position to close on the repurchase of our DevCo joint venture interest for $925 million in January. 12:20 As Matt mentioned, we executed agreements to sell our 25% equity interest in GCX for $857 million. We expect to receive the full proceeds from the sale of GCX in the second quarter of 2022, and our current expectation is that we will utilize the GCX proceeds to redeem our outstanding TRC preferred shares. Last week, we closed on a $2.75 billion credit facility at Targa Resources Corp., eliminating the dual credit facilities at TRC and TRP as we continue to simplify our corporate structure. 12:54 Turning to our 2022 financial expectations. We estimate that pro forma for the sale of GCX full year 2022 adjusted EBITDA to be between $2.3 billion and $2.5 billion, a 17% increase over 2021 based on the midpoint of our range. Comparing 2022 versus 2021, key drivers for EBITDA growth year-over-year include: a full year benefit from the repurchase of our DevCo interest; higher commodity prices and continued volume growth across our operations led by higher G&P volumes, primarily from our Permian assets; driving higher volumes across our transport, frac and export assets; and also higher fees across our contracts from inflation. 13:43 Offsets include the sale of GCX and higher estimated operating and G&A expenses from inflation and increasing volumes. As Matt described earlier, we are continuing to invest in attractive organic growth opportunities, including spending related to additional Permian plants, well connect and compression capital on the G&P side, additional pump station capital for Grand Prix and the expansion of our propane loading capabilities at Galena Park. We estimate 2022 net growth CapEx to be between $700 million and $800 million and net maintenance CapEx for 2022 of approximately $150 million. We currently expect year end 2022 leverage to be well within the bottom half of our long-term target range of 3 times to 4 times, providing us with significant flexibility. 14:32 For additional details related to our estimated 2022 outlook, please review our earnings supplement slides accompanying our webcast this morning, which are also posted to the Investors page of our website. Supported by our excellent operational and commercial performance through some very difficult environments over the last couple of years, we have been able to execute on our key strategies. And as Matt described, that means we are in an excellent position going forward. 14:57 Lastly, I would like to echo Matt's thank you to our employees that have continued to perform exceptionally well for our customers and have done so with a continued focus on safety. 15:08 And with that, I will turn the call back over to Sanjay.\nSanjay Lad: 15:11 Thanks, Jen. For the Q&A session, we kindly ask that you limit to one question and one follow up and re-enter the Q&A line-up, if you have additional questions. Chris, would you please open the line for Q&A?\nOperator: 15:24 Yes, sir. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from John Mackay of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nJohn Mackay: 15:47 Hey, everyone. Thanks for the time. I wanted to start on capital allocation. I think you mentioned the GCX proceeds would kind of go first towards the prefs. You talked about kind of buying those back over kind of slightly longer period of time before. Should we think about that as you guys are trying to get them done kind of sooner now? And then maybe the second half of the year, the common buyback can pick up. Just how do you think about the balance of those two?\nJen Kneale: 16:16 I think our current assumption right now, John, is that with the proceeds received from GCX, we will be able to accelerate and potentially repurchase all of the preferred interest in the second quarter, that's the base case assumption that we're currently running. Of course, we'll maintain the flexibility to change course if we want, but that's the current assumption. And then related to common share repurchases, you saw us active in the fourth quarter based on our outperformance for 2021. And certainly, our expectation is that we'll be able to return an increasing amount of capital to our shareholders as we move through 2022 and beyond. We've got the common dividend set for this year. And so that means that our assumption is we'll continue to be opportunistic around common share repurchases. So it isn't necessarily that because we're accelerating the TRC prep takeout to the second quarter that changes our assumptions around common share repurchases, we think we've got a lot of flexibility to execute across all parameters.\nJohn Mackay: 17:14 All right. Thanks for that. My follow-up is kind of on the CapEx side that fits in there. Can you just kind of frame up how much of the growth CapEx guide is going to the two new processing plants and also to the new export expansion? Just trying to think of those contributions above maybe a run rate level.\nMatt Meloy: 17:33 Yeah. Sure. Yeah. We announced the Legacy II plant and the Midway plant this morning. We had highlight we were already ordering long lead time for Legacy II on our prior call. For this year, the Midway plant really was kind of an incremental from maybe what we had signaled previously. There was about $150 million of capital for that Midway plant almost all of that spending is in year, and then there's a little bit of capital, which would move into 2023. We'll still have significant spending on Legacy and Legacy II this year. And then we'll also have pump capital for Grand Prix, the export project. That export project is really more kind of a debottlenecking or a bolt-on. It's relatively small CapEx, which is why we really like that project. It gives us an incremental 1 million barrels a month of ability to load -- increase our capacity on the propane loading side for relatively modest capital. But the large movers are midway and then the spending on Legacy I and II.\nJohn Mackay: 18:37 That\u2019s great. Appreciate to them. Thank you.\nMatt Meloy: 18:39 Okay. Thanks.\nOperator: 18:41 Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Blum of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nMichael Blum: 18:49 Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Just wanted to stay on Grand Prix. Can you just give us a sense of where utilization sits on the kind of the Mid-Con and the Permian pieces of that type? And then how much are you planning to expand it and what's the timing?\nScott Pryor: 19:05 Hey, Mike. This is Scott Pryor. I'll first just state that we've got tremendous operating leverage when it comes to our downstream assets, and that's inclusive of our pipeline capacity relating to Grand Prix. When you look at the 433,000 barrels a day that we did in the fourth quarter, which was a record for us, we do have contributions that are coming from the North. We don't describe what those volumes are. But I would say that we still have a lot of leverage on our West leg and our South leg as well. We'll add pumps to West leg in the South leg dependent upon the production growth that we see in the Permian and from the North. We're going to stay well ahead of that to make sure that we can move all the volumes that are necessary. We can look at possibilities of loops in the future based upon the cadence as we hedge gas processing plants on our upstream side, again, with a lot of focus on the Permian Basin, but we'll also look for commercial opportunities that may present themselves with other existing pipes that might be in the Basin. So adding pumps, looking at opportunities, future puts us in a great position to leverage into what we have today and future growth.\nMichael Blum: 20:21 Okay. Great. I appreciate that. And then maybe a question on the LPG export expansion you're announcing. Can you just remind us roughly kind of where you are on a contracted basis? And kind of what's leading your decision to expand here? And do you have -- will you continue to add contracts? In other words, will the contracted level as a percentage kind of stay the same as you increase the total capacity?\nScott Pryor: 20:49 Again, Michael, this is Scott. I'll restate kind of what Matt said. When you look at this project, it is a low capital type project. I would describe it less than $50 million. Barrel-per-barrel basis, it's our cheapest expansion that we can put in our system to debottleneck around Galena Park. When we look at the facilities that we're adding, we've got a tremendous contract structure today. We continue to have success with renewing contracts and adding contracts where necessary. The market growth potential continues to be strong. When you look at domestic use of LPG products where people -- developing countries are looking for clean burning fuels, this certainly supports that opportunity. And then obviously, you're going to see continued growth on the PDH side in the East with more focus on China. When I -- when you think about that and the continued success that we've had, really, this is a complementary type addition for us. 21:50 It puts us in a position to be more flexible, more reliable for our customers and our lifters that we have out of our facility. It gives us the ability to rebound from times of weather delays or fog delays or shipping delays that may happen, but it also provides us early, prior to increased production that we would see coming from the Permian into our assets, it provides us the ability to participate more heavily in the spot market when the market dictates and presents itself. So again, a nice bolt-on project, barrel for barrel with the cheapest add that we can do at this time, and we like how it complements, provides reliability to us and our customers that lift from us.\nMichael Blum: 22:31 Thank you very much.\nMatt Meloy: 22:33 Okay. Thanks, Michael.\nOperator: 22:35 Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Spiro Dounis of Credit Suisse. Your line is open\nSpiro Dounis: 22:46 Thanks, operator. Good morning, guys. First question, maybe just sticking with downstream CapEx, focusing a little bit more on fractionation. I believe you all have Frac nine as permitted. And so I'm just curious, given the rate of growth we're seeing here, is that something that's become a little bit more front of mind right now? And maybe just general thoughts on how you're thinking about the lead times for when that could come online and when you need to start acting on it?\nScott Pryor: 23:12 Again, this is Scott. I'll just start with it, again, the fact that we've got leverage on the downstream side as it relates to fractionation as well. So we've got current capacity today. We do have a permit in hand for Frac Train nine. So we will pay particularly close attention to the cadence of the processing plants that we add in the Permian Basin as well as third-party production that will be steered toward our downstream assets. So with that permit in hand, we can trigger a start up on that frac when necessary. We also have the ability to look at the restart of our Gulf Coast -- or excuse me, our Gulf Coast fractionator as it relates to our needs or the demand that we have with our partners at that facility. So again, we'll stay well ahead of the need. Having a permanent hand for Train nine certainly helps us and the ability to restart the idle frac with our partners is also a possibility.\nMatt Meloy: 24:09 Yeah. And just to add to that too, Scott, I'd say we would also continue to look across Belvieu. So if there's some excess capacity from some of our competitors that could give us some more time to evaluate when we need to do Train nine, we can look at those solutions as well. So we're kind of looking at the volume growth and really have all options on the table for us.\nSpiro Dounis: 24:31 Great. That's helpful. Switching gears a bit. I can't let you all go without asking you about natural gas, egress out of the Permian going forward. I think there's obviously a lot of projects potentially contending to be the next natural gas pipeline, whether it be expansion, a greenfield. Just curious, is it a concern of yours that somehow some of that growth gets stunted in any way. Do you think the industry will resolve the issue and how? And then you've obviously participated in some of these projects in the past, recognizing you just sold GCX, but is Targa interested maybe in participating in the future as well?\nMatt Meloy: 25:05 Yeah. Sure. To start, I would say, yeah, we do see one certainly being needed, and it looks like it's coming sooner than maybe previous expectations. So we are looking to be part of the solution. We have a lot of gas. We want additional infrastructure to get built. So we're talking to a number of the pipes that are trying to basically get geared up to get to FID. We want to get something done. So we want to be supportive to be able to get something done. So I guess just stay tuned on that. We think the industry will solve it. It's added pipes before. And just stay tuned on how and when Targa is going to participate in that.\nSpiro Dounis: 25:47 Got it. Helpful as always. Thanks, guys.\nMatt Meloy: 25:49 Okay. Thanks.\nOperator: 25:51 Thank you. Next, we have the line of Jeremy Tonet of JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Participant: 26:08 Sorry, this is Steve (ph) jumping in for Jeremy. Sorry about that. Really just kind of one question for us. Most of them have kind of already been hit. So just looking at the 2022 EBITDA guide, commodity prices bring your guide to above the high end. And we just kind of want to know what other main moving pieces of the high end versus the low end of the guide are there?\nMatt Meloy: 26:32 Yeah. I'd say as we gave a range, commodity prices, as I'd say, the largest variable. And then we also had a range in our Permian volumes, 12% to 15%. So depending on where volumes from the Permian shake out. We are seeing some drilling across the Central and in Badlands. So if prices stay here, we could see some additional upside to our Central as well. I'd say those are the main drivers on the G&P side. I'd say on the downstream side, the export, we see a continued strong export market. But I think there's still some upside to our assumption in our guidance number to exports. And if there's a real weak market, there's some potential. It's not all contracted. So there's some variability in exports as well.\nJen Kneale: 27:19 And we're doing a really good job of managing costs. So hopefully, there's upside to some of the conservative assumptions that we've made around cost. We'll have to see how those play out through the year.\nUnidentified Participant: 27:31 All right, really appreciate you guys. Thank you.\nMatt Meloy: 27:33Okay. Thank you.\nJen Kneale: 27:35 Thank you.\nOperator: 27:36 Thank you. And next, we have a question from the line of Tristan Richardson of Truist Securities. Your line is open.\nTristan Richardson: 27:44 Hi. Good morning, guys. Just curious on the contracting environment, just in -- what we're seeing in the strong commodity today, and as you bring on additional plants. Are you seeing from producers a desire to retain more of the economics pushing more towards the -- obviously, you guys have done a lot over the past couple of years, incorporating some changes in the contracting styles? But maybe just the landscape today in this current environment, what types of structures are your customers looking for?\nMatt Meloy: 28:17 Yeah. I'd say we're -- most of our growth is happening out in the Permian. Yes, there are some differences between the Delaware and the Midland. On the Midland side, that has been traditionally more POP, although we've done a good job at putting more fee-based components and fee floors on those POP. We have a lot of acreage dedicated to us under long-term contracts. And so a lot of the growth that we're seeing is under already existing longer-term contracts in and around that area. On the Delaware side, we do have more fee-based components on the Delaware side, but I'd say a lot of the volumes there for the growth is under long-term contracts. So it's really keeping the mix kind of similar to what we've had there. Pat, I don't know if there's anything you'd want to add to that.\nPat McDonie: 29:05 I think the only thing I would add, Matt, is that there's so many variables that affect how you contract, right? Is it sour gases? Is it sweet gas? Is it high pressure? Is it low pressure? And certainly, the Midland and Delaware Basin have some nuances related to some of those variables. But generally, the contracting hasn't materially changed. And as Matt described it, it was kind of spot on relative to the basins and how they break down. And we haven't seen a material change in and the way we're contracting.\nMatt Meloy: 29:39 Yes. Thanks, Pat.\nTristan Richardson: 29:40 That's helpful. And then just a follow-up. Jen, I may have missed this, but -- and appreciating you guys offered the sensitivities for the '22 budget, but can you talk maybe about the hedge position where you sit today and for '22? And then maybe also just what 2023 looks like just from a -- where you stand today?\nJen Kneale: 29:58 Sure, Tristan. We changed our disclosures around hedging just because we found that we are creating potentially more confusion than we were helping folks work through our numbers. So really, from our perspective, the sensitivity is what's most meaningful to you. And that's our result. We do have our equity volumes from our percent of proceeds contracts, but then we also have our fee floor contracts, and fee floors are set at different levels. So there's just a lot that goes into now, I think, figuring out what our position is. But I think we have excellent cash flow stability because we are very well hedged. The last disclosures that we gave showed that we were north of 75% hedged across all commodities for 2022 and then had already put significant hedges on in 2023. So I think importantly, we aren't changing our hedge program at all. So the expectation is we will continue to look to hedge our equity volume exposure 75% next 12 months out, 50% 12 months out after that, and then 25% the 12 months out after that. So none of that has changed. But we really thought that just providing a simple sensitivity provided you with the most clarity relative to all the moving pieces around our Gathering and Processing contracts and positions.\nTristan Richardson: 31:18 Appreciate it. Thank you, guys, very much.\nMatt Meloy: 31:22 Okay. Thanks, Tristan.\nJen Kneale: 31:23 Thank you.\nOperator: 31:23 Thank you. Next, we have questions from the line of Colton Bean from Tudor Pickering. Your line is open.\nJen Kneale: 31:39 Hey, Colton. Good morning.\nColton Bean: 31:38 Sorry about that. Good morning. So just on the balance sheet, would love to understand any shift in how you're thinking about optimal leverage. I think you've said previously you wouldn't want to drop below 3 times debt to EBITDA, but it looks like you closed out 2021 at 3.2. And then just the year-on-year EBITDA increase alone, looks like it will drive leverage below that threshold before considering retained free cash flow. So are you thinking about a lower target at this point or considering an alternative cash outlay that might offset that?\nJen Kneale: 32:09 I think we're really comfortable within the target range of 3 times to 4 times. And I've said that our strong preference is to exist towards the bottom end of that range. That doesn't mean that we have to stop at an exact number, but our goal is to really operate within the lower end of that range. So are we comfortable going sub 3 times for a quarter or a couple of quarters potentially, but I think we'll also be able to identify some attractive uses of that leverage capacity to be able to return incremental capital to shareholders, to be able to continue to invest in the business? It's been a while since we looked at M&A opportunities. But certainly, I think with our balance sheet, where we are, are continuing to look at attractive bolt-on opportunities, too. So there isn't a change to how we're thinking about capital allocation. I think just the outperformance that we had in 2021 and now the expected performance in 2022 just provides us with even more flexibility than we thought we would have even a quarter or a couple of quarters ago. So the outperformance in 2021, that's part of what drove us repurchasing $40 million worth of shares in the fourth quarter, maybe a little bit earlier than estimates. But we felt like we had the capacity to do so and opportunistically executed on that. So I think, again, flexibility just means that we've got more places that we can identify the best use of that available cash flow or leverage capacity and then go execute on that strategy.\nColton Bean: 33:38 Got it. So looking out over the next couple of years, is it reasonable to assume that the incremental leverage capacity from that organic growth and then the amount of free cash that the business is throwing off, first call might be capital returns and the second, opportunistic M&A?\nJen Kneale: 33:53 I don't think that we exist with if you do A, then you can do B. If you do B, then you can go to C, right? I think you've seen us over the last couple of years really just execute across opportunities. And so that's going to be the strategy going forward, Colton. So to the extent that we've got more organic growth or M&A opportunities that are attractive, we're definitely planning on continuing to invest in this business. We think that's what sets Targa up best for the short, medium and long term for our investors. And then we also believe that we'll be able to return increasing capital to our shareholders. Year-over-year, 2022 common dividend versus '21 dividend, we're doing that. We've talked about the fact that we expect that we'll be able to increase the dividend going forward as well in 2023. So that's definitely part of how we'll return incremental capital to our investors. And then also we'll continue to be opportunistic around our common share repurchase program, but it's going to be a combination of everything that's available to us.\nColton Bean: 34:51 Got it. Appreciate the time.\nJen Kneale: 34:54 Thank you.\nMatt Meloy: 34:55 Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: 34:56 Thank you. Next, we have the line of Keith Stanley of Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nKeith Stanley: 35:06 Hi. Good morning. Two follow-up questions. The first one, just to clarify on hedging, and appreciate the policy as the same and the percentage targets for each year. Can you just remind us how you typically hedge gas basis? Is it at the same time, you're hedging your broader gas price exposure or are you more opened on gas basis?\nMatt Meloy: 35:30 Yeah. Sure. When we hedge our equity volumes, we hedge really as close to where we sell the physical as we can. So for example, we'll sell Waha and other indices out in the Permian, and we'll sell other Mid-Con indices where we have length on gas. So we cover off the basis as best we can for the volumes that we are trying to hedge.\nKeith Stanley: 35:55 Great. And second follow-up was on the commentary about not really being in the market for acquisitions as much in the past few years and maybe being more open to that. Can you give a little more color on things you would look at? I assume tuck-in type Permian G&P opportunities, would you look at anything outside the Permian? And I guess one thought I had too is, is there any potential with the DevCo now done to buy in the rest of the Grand Prix stake or is that unlikely?\nMatt Meloy: 36:25 Sure. I'll give you some color there. We've, I'd say, kind of been actively looking at bolt-on, tuck-in acquisitions across our footprint. I'd say we just continue to have a high hurdle. It's not that nothing can cross over that hurdle. But as we look at acquisitions, we want to make sure we're staying within our leverage range. We want to make sure that we have good synergies on the G&P side and on the NGL side. We're in a good position where we don't need to acquire anything. So it's really got to be additive. It's got to be at a good value for us with synergies that drive that value down even more. So I'd say there are opportunities and things we're looking at, but we've -- that really hasn't changed. We've been looking at things for the last several years. There's opportunities in the Permian. There's also opportunities in other basins as well. And if it checks all those boxes of keeping our leverage where we need to be, good upfront value with G&P synergies and downstream synergies, a lot of those bolt-on or tuck-ins could look a lot like organic growth projects by the time you're done with them. So those are -- that's kind of how we're thinking about it, how we're looking at it. So I think, stay tuned, we'll see if anything meets all those -- it's a pretty high bar. We'll see if anything meets that. But if it does, there could be something there.\nKeith Stanley: 37:52 Thank you.\nMatt Meloy: 37:53 Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: 37:56 Thank you. Next on the line, we have Theresa Chen of Barclays. Your line is open.\nTheresa Chen: 38:02 Hi. I just wanted to follow up on the M&A line of commentary, if you don't mind. In terms of valuation of the things that you have been looking at for years, Matt, how has that trended recently given the commodity price outlook? And just more specifically, are there areas of the value chain or region-specific aspects that you're considering that would be most complementary to your existing footprint?\nMatt Meloy: 38:30 Yeah. I'd say on the valuation trends, it really depends on what you're looking at. So I consider us to be opportunistic on the buy side, but we're also opportunistic on the sell side, right? So we sold GCX at 11 times multiple. We thought that was a strong market there for that. But I would say for other assets that don't have that cash flow, kind of take-or-pay cash flow feature, it's -- over time, I think those multiples have trended down, but we haven't transacted on anything. So I can't really say how they've moved over the years. But for non-highly contracted assets where it makes sense for a financial buyer, I would expect the multiple to be significantly less than where we transacted GCX.\nJen Kneale: 39:19 And just to repeat, there really isn't a difference in the strategy here, as Matt, I think importantly articulated, we've been looking at M&A opportunities all along, and the hurdle has continued to be very, very high, and that hasn't really changed. All that's changed is our balance sheet is a whole lot stronger now than it was a year ago or two years ago. And that just provides us with more flexibility as we consider opportunities. But the strategy really hasn't changed.\nTheresa Chen: 39:45 Thank you.\nMatt Meloy: 39:46 Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: 39:49 Thank you. Next, we have the line of Chase Mulvehill of Bank of America. Your line is open.\nChase Mulvehill: 39:58 Yeah. Hey. Thanks for squeezing me in here. A few questions. I guess the first one is really just a follow-up to Keith's questions about -- the question around Waha basis spread. How much do you actually have hedged in 2023 for basis risk?\nMatt Meloy: 40:21 So when we have our equity hedges, we're, call it, 75% and then 50% hedged for our position on our equity position. We have some transport that also provides us ability to move our gas out in various directions. We have a gas marketing team that manages that portfolio very actively to make sure we have contracted takeaway.\nChase Mulvehill: 40:46 Okay. All right. So it sounds like you got some FT (ph) on some pipes and maybe you could actually benefit from that. So would you say that there is -- the benefit is greater than the risk when you think about Waha basis for you?\nMatt Meloy: 41:02 Chase, our primary focus for our gas is to make sure volumes are moving out of the basin. For us and for our producers, that is our focus to make sure we have a market that we can get to, that is our focus, and that is kind of how we manage that overall gas position. We want gas to move and we try and do it as best we can for us and for our producers.\nChase Mulvehill: 41:25 Okay. All right. A follow-up question, and I apologize if this was asked, but I don't think it was. But 4Q Midland volumes were down a smidge in the fourth quarter, and Delaware volumes were actually up pretty strongly, up 12% quarter-over-quarter. I guess two questions. Number one, you dropped below nameplate capacity. So should we think about -- in the Midland. Should we think that kind of running above nameplate capacity is tough to do consecutive quarters? And then number two is, were you able to move some Midland volumes over to Delaware, and that's why Delaware really saw a nice uptick in the fourth quarter?\nMatt Meloy: 42:10 Yeah. Sure. So I'll start on that, and then -- for Q4, so if you're comparing to our reported in Q3, it would look like it's down. If you look at what we reported, it's in the supplement. It's actually we see an increase of about 2% on our Midland volumes. There was a kind of production month accounting change from some volumes that were in October into -- and from September into October, which changed it. So we actually saw when it was corrected volume growth in Q4 on the Midland side. As far as nameplate, we have the ability to run over nameplate. You've seen us do that. It can provide us good flexibility. We actually updated what we estimate our nameplate really to be for our plants. We used to call these 250s. We've been running them for over that and haven't seen a degradation in NGL recoveries or operational performance. So we're calling them 275s now. So we still have good flexibility across our system to continue to operate. So we -- so to be clear, we saw growth in the Midland in Q4, and we expect to see growth in Midland kind of throughout the balance of the year.\nChase Mulvehill: 43:19 Okay. Perfect. Thanks, Matt.\nMatt Meloy: 43:21 Okay. Thanks, Chase\nOperator: 43:24 Thank you. And next, we have the line of Sunil Sibal of Seaport Securities. Your line is open.\nSunil Sibal: 43:33 Yeah. Hi. Good morning. So my first question was a little bit of a follow-up on Permian. So when we think about the 12% to 15% volume growth in 2022, could you give us a sense where that is kind of skewed more towards Delaware versus Midland, especially in light of some of the commentary we are hearing from some of your producers in the Midland?\nMatt Meloy: 43:59 Sure. We did not provide a detailed breakout of that. I'd say we see growth on both Delaware and the Midland. So we see pretty strong activity across both areas of our system. And so yeah, we see growth in both areas.\nSunil Sibal: 44:20 So you wouldn't handicap that 12% to 15% to be weighted towards any specific part of Permian?\nMatt Meloy: 44:26 We haven't given that color. I think you'll see it as we report going forward. But no, we haven't provided a kind of basin level detailed breakout. But we do see meaningful growth in both, and we see strong growth continuing in the Midland, which is why we're adding those plants, but we also see growth in the Delaware.\nSunil Sibal: 44:44 Got it. And then one bit of a broader question. I think in the past, you have talked about some of energy transition investment opportunities. Obviously, I think the solar generation that you're looking at, you're doing at -- to provide a balance sheet. I was just curious, has that kind of opportunity set expanded for you guys or what is on radar screen currently?\nMatt Meloy: 45:12 Yeah. I'd say we are continuing to look at opportunities in and around energy transition. We're continuing to look at renewable deals, whether it's additional solar or additional wind deals. We're continuing to be active to see if we can be part of the solution that way. Like, I said before, I think for those projects, it's unlikely we put our capital on those projects, but we could provide some offtake to help get those underwritten. So we're currently evaluating additional renewable projects on that front. We're also continuing to develop our carbon capture out in and around our assets. So we're continuing to make progress on that. That is going to take a while. So we are making progress. There are some hurdles. There's some -- there's permitting, there's just things that need to get done, but we are working through those. And I think we still are optimistic that we can get something done there in carbon capture. Part of it does depend on where is the 45Q going to settle out, and there was talk for a while of it going up 80. So is it going to be 80 or is it going to be 50? Those kind of things matter as well. So we're going to continue to work to try and develop the operational hurdles and get through that, and then we'll have to make the call on whether it makes financial sense for us or we need to source third-party capital.\nSunil Sibal: 46:31 Got it. Thanks for that.\nMatt Meloy: 46:33 Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: 46:36 Thank you. And I see no further questions in the queue. I will turn it back over to Mr. Sanjay Lad for closing remarks.\nSanjay Lad: 46:45 Thanks to everyone that was on the call this morning, and we appreciate your interest in Targa Resources. The IR team will be available for any follow-up questions you may have. Thanks, and have a great day.\nOperator: 46:57 This concludes today's conference call. Thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect and have a pleasant day.",

            "name": "Scott Pryor",
            "content": "19:05 Hey, Mike. This is Scott Pryor. I'll first just state that we've got tremendous operating leverage when it comes to our downstream assets, and that's inclusive of our pipeline capacity relating to Grand Prix. When you look at the 433,000 barrels a day that we did in the fourth quarter, which was a record for us, we do have contributions that are coming from the North. We don't describe what those volumes are. But I would say that we still have a lot of leverage on our West leg and our South leg as well. We'll add pumps to West leg in the South leg dependent upon the production growth that we see in the Permian and from the North. We're going to stay well ahead of that to make sure that we can move all the volumes that are necessary. We can look at possibilities of loops in the future based upon the cadence as we hedge gas processing plants on our upstream side, again, with a lot of focus on the Permian Basin, but we'll also look for commercial opportunities that may present themselves with other existing pipes that might be in the Basin. So adding pumps, looking at opportunities, future puts us in a great position to leverage into what we have today and future growth. 20:49 Again, Michael, this is Scott. I'll restate kind of what Matt said. When you look at this project, it is a low capital type project. I would describe it less than $50 million. Barrel-per-barrel basis, it's our cheapest expansion that we can put in our system to debottleneck around Galena Park. When we look at the facilities that we're adding, we've got a tremendous contract structure today. We continue to have success with renewing contracts and adding contracts where necessary. The market growth potential continues to be strong. When you look at domestic use of LPG products where people -- developing countries are looking for clean burning fuels, this certainly supports that opportunity. And then obviously, you're going to see continued growth on the PDH side in the East with more focus on China. When I -- when you think about that and the continued success that we've had, really, this is a complementary type addition for us. 21:50 It puts us in a position to be more flexible, more reliable for our customers and our lifters that we have out of our facility. It gives us the ability to rebound from times of weather delays or fog delays or shipping delays that may happen, but it also provides us early, prior to increased production that we would see coming from the Permian into our assets, it provides us the ability to participate more heavily in the spot market when the market dictates and presents itself. So again, a nice bolt-on project, barrel for barrel with the cheapest add that we can do at this time, and we like how it complements, provides reliability to us and our customers that lift from us. 23:12 Again, this is Scott. I'll just start with it, again, the fact that we've got leverage on the downstream side as it relates to fractionation as well. So we've got current capacity today. We do have a permit in hand for Frac Train nine. So we will pay particularly close attention to the cadence of the processing plants that we add in the Permian Basin as well as third-party production that will be steered toward our downstream assets. So with that permit in hand, we can trigger a start up on that frac when necessary. We also have the ability to look at the restart of our Gulf Coast -- or excuse me, our Gulf Coast fractionator as it relates to our needs or the demand that we have with our partners at that facility. So again, we'll stay well ahead of the need. Having a permanent hand for Train nine certainly helps us and the ability to restart the idle frac with our partners is also a possibility."

        "speaker3": {
            "name": "Jen Kneale",
            "content": "10:27 Thanks, Matt. Targa's reported quarterly adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $571 million, increasing 13% sequentially as we benefited from higher volumes across most of our assets and higher commodity prices. Our full year 2021 adjusted EBITDA was $2.05 billion and exceeded the high end of our full year financial guidance range. 10:51 Targa generated adjusted free cash flow of approximately $1.13 billion, which allowed us to reduce our leverage significantly across the year. At year end, our consolidated leverage ratio was 3.2 times. We spent $408 million in net growth capital during 2021 with spending largely focused on our Gathering and Processing business as we continue to benefit from operating leverage downstream. 11:17 We also had some spending shift from the fourth quarter to 2022, which is included in our 2022 growth capital estimate. Our net maintenance CapEx was about $130 million in 2021. During the fourth quarter, we recognized an approximate $452 million non-cash pretax impairment charge of our South Texas assets attributable to a lower outlook on future volumes. We are significantly hedged for 2022 and continue to add hedges for 2023 and beyond, while still benefiting from higher prices across our unhedged equity volume exposure and prices now well above fee floors. 11:53 We repurchased approximately $40 million of common shares in the fourth quarter and as of December 31, had approximately $369 million remaining under our $500 million share repurchase program. At year end, we had over $3.2 billion of available liquidity, which put us in excellent position to close on the repurchase of our DevCo joint venture interest for $925 million in January. 12:20 As Matt mentioned, we executed agreements to sell our 25% equity interest in GCX for $857 million. We expect to receive the full proceeds from the sale of GCX in the second quarter of 2022, and our current expectation is that we will utilize the GCX proceeds to redeem our outstanding TRC preferred shares. Last week, we closed on a $2.75 billion credit facility at Targa Resources Corp., eliminating the dual credit facilities at TRC and TRP as we continue to simplify our corporate structure. 12:54 Turning to our 2022 financial expectations. We estimate that pro forma for the sale of GCX full year 2022 adjusted EBITDA to be between $2.3 billion and $2.5 billion, a 17% increase over 2021 based on the midpoint of our range. Comparing 2022 versus 2021, key drivers for EBITDA growth year-over-year include: a full year benefit from the repurchase of our DevCo interest; higher commodity prices and continued volume growth across our operations led by higher G&P volumes, primarily from our Permian assets; driving higher volumes across our transport, frac and export assets; and also higher fees across our contracts from inflation. 13:43 Offsets include the sale of GCX and higher estimated operating and G&A expenses from inflation and increasing volumes. As Matt described earlier, we are continuing to invest in attractive organic growth opportunities, including spending related to additional Permian plants, well connect and compression capital on the G&P side, additional pump station capital for Grand Prix and the expansion of our propane loading capabilities at Galena Park. We estimate 2022 net growth CapEx to be between $700 million and $800 million and net maintenance CapEx for 2022 of approximately $150 million. We currently expect year end 2022 leverage to be well within the bottom half of our long-term target range of 3 times to 4 times, providing us with significant flexibility. 14:32 For additional details related to our estimated 2022 outlook, please review our earnings supplement slides accompanying our webcast this morning, which are also posted to the Investors page of our website. Supported by our excellent operational and commercial performance through some very difficult environments over the last couple of years, we have been able to execute on our key strategies. And as Matt described, that means we are in an excellent position going forward. 14:57 Lastly, I would like to echo Matt's thank you to our employees that have continued to perform exceptionally well for our customers and have done so with a continued focus on safety. 15:08 And with that, I will turn the call back over to Sanjay. 16:16 I think our current assumption right now, John, is that with the proceeds received from GCX, we will be able to accelerate and potentially repurchase all of the preferred interest in the second quarter, that's the base case assumption that we're currently running. Of course, we'll maintain the flexibility to change course if we want, but that's the current assumption. And then related to common share repurchases, you saw us active in the fourth quarter based on our outperformance for 2021. And certainly, our expectation is that we'll be able to return an increasing amount of capital to our shareholders as we move through 2022 and beyond. We've got the common dividend set for this year. And so that means that our assumption is we'll continue to be opportunistic around common share repurchases. So it isn't necessarily that because we're accelerating the TRC prep takeout to the second quarter that changes our assumptions around common share repurchases, we think we've got a lot of flexibility to execute across all parameters. 27:19 And we're doing a really good job of managing costs. So hopefully, there's upside to some of the conservative assumptions that we've made around cost. We'll have to see how those play out through the year. 27:35 Thank you. 29:58 Sure, Tristan. We changed our disclosures around hedging just because we found that we are creating potentially more confusion than we were helping folks work through our numbers. So really, from our perspective, the sensitivity is what's most meaningful to you. And that's our result. We do have our equity volumes from our percent of proceeds contracts, but then we also have our fee floor contracts, and fee floors are set at different levels. So there's just a lot that goes into now, I think, figuring out what our position is. But I think we have excellent cash flow stability because we are very well hedged. The last disclosures that we gave showed that we were north of 75% hedged across all commodities for 2022 and then had already put significant hedges on in 2023. So I think importantly, we aren't changing our hedge program at all. So the expectation is we will continue to look to hedge our equity volume exposure 75% next 12 months out, 50% 12 months out after that, and then 25% the 12 months out after that. So none of that has changed. But we really thought that just providing a simple sensitivity provided you with the most clarity relative to all the moving pieces around our Gathering and Processing contracts and positions. 31:23 Thank you. 31:39 Hey, Colton. Good morning. 32:09 I think we're really comfortable within the target range of 3 times to 4 times. And I've said that our strong preference is to exist towards the bottom end of that range. That doesn't mean that we have to stop at an exact number, but our goal is to really operate within the lower end of that range. So are we comfortable going sub 3 times for a quarter or a couple of quarters potentially, but I think we'll also be able to identify some attractive uses of that leverage capacity to be able to return incremental capital to shareholders, to be able to continue to invest in the business? It's been a while since we looked at M&A opportunities. But certainly, I think with our balance sheet, where we are, are continuing to look at attractive bolt-on opportunities, too. So there isn't a change to how we're thinking about capital allocation. I think just the outperformance that we had in 2021 and now the expected performance in 2022 just provides us with even more flexibility than we thought we would have even a quarter or a couple of quarters ago. So the outperformance in 2021, that's part of what drove us repurchasing $40 million worth of shares in the fourth quarter, maybe a little bit earlier than estimates. But we felt like we had the capacity to do so and opportunistically executed on that. So I think, again, flexibility just means that we've got more places that we can identify the best use of that available cash flow or leverage capacity and then go execute on that strategy. 33:53 I don't think that we exist with if you do A, then you can do B. If you do B, then you can go to C, right? I think you've seen us over the last couple of years really just execute across opportunities. And so that's going to be the strategy going forward, Colton. So to the extent that we've got more organic growth or M&A opportunities that are attractive, we're definitely planning on continuing to invest in this business. We think that's what sets Targa up best for the short, medium and long term for our investors. And then we also believe that we'll be able to return increasing capital to our shareholders. Year-over-year, 2022 common dividend versus '21 dividend, we're doing that. We've talked about the fact that we expect that we'll be able to increase the dividend going forward as well in 2023. So that's definitely part of how we'll return incremental capital to our investors. And then also we'll continue to be opportunistic around our common share repurchase program, but it's going to be a combination of everything that's available to us. 34:54 Thank you. 39:19 And just to repeat, there really isn't a difference in the strategy here, as Matt, I think importantly articulated, we've been looking at M&A opportunities all along, and the hurdle has continued to be very, very high, and that hasn't really changed. All that's changed is our balance sheet is a whole lot stronger now than it was a year ago or two years ago. And that just provides us with more flexibility as we consider opportunities. But the strategy really hasn't changed."

            "name": "Matt Meloy",
            "content": "02:00 Thanks, Sanjay and good morning. This is an exciting time at Targa, where our operational and financial execution in 2021 provided a lot of momentum for 2022. I would first like to recognize and thank Targa's employees that worked tirelessly across another year of challenges in 2021 to help drive record financial and operational performance. 02:22 Let's quickly mention some of the highlights from 2021: record Gathering and Processing volumes in the Permian, safely bringing the Heim Plant online, on time and under budget, record volumes across our Logistics and Transportation assets, record adjusted EBITDA of $2.05 billion, a 25% increase over 2020, about $1.2 billion of year-over-year debt reduction and a year-end leverage ratio of 3.2 times, and increasing return of capital to our shareholders through a higher fourth quarter dividend and fourth quarter common share repurchases. 03:01 Turning to 2022, we already have a number of highlights to mention, repurchased our DevCo joint venture interest in January, executed agreements to sell our 25% equity interest in Gulf Coast Express Pipeline, or GCX, for approximately 11 times EBITDA, upgraded to investment grade by Fitch and moved to positive Watch by S&P and Moody's, and refinanced our revolving credit facility to a five-year $2.75 billion facility at TRC. We continue to execute on our strategic priorities and have visibility to volume growth across our assets, which is driving increasing EBITDA as we look forward. 03:42 For 2022, we estimate full year adjusted EBITDA to be between $2.3 billion and $2.5 billion, which is a significant increase over 2021. This guidance is based on forward prices where there continues to be backwardation. If prices averaged around today's levels for 2022, we would expect to exceed the top end of our full year financial guidance. With the repurchase of our DevCo interest and our flexibility to accelerate redemption of our preferred stock, given the sale of GCX, we have already simplified and will continue to simplify our capital structure. 04:19 We are also demonstrating our increasing ability to return capital to our shareholders with the execution of common share repurchases in the fourth quarter, in addition to the fourth quarter common share dividend increase. As previously discussed, we expect to pay a common dividend of $0.35 per quarter, $1.40 annualized to our shareholders for 2022. The strength of our balance sheet provides significant flexibility to redeem our preferred shares faster than we previously anticipated and to continue to assess opportunistic repurchases of common shares. 04:53 Let's now turn to our operations. Starting in the Permian, our systems across the Midland and Delaware Basins continue to perform well, averaging a record 3 billion cubic feet per day reported inlet during the fourth quarter. Our average 2021 Permian inlet volumes increased 12% over 2020, exceeding the top end of our 2021 growth range. We continue to see strong activity levels across both our Midland and Delaware footprints and expect to benefit from this positive momentum as we move through 2022. 05:27 For full year 2022, we expect our average Permian inlet to increase between 12% to 15% over average 2021. In Permian Midland, our system continues to run near full with our next 275 million cubic feet per day Legacy Plant on track to begin operations during the fourth quarter of this year. With robust activity levels expected to continue into next year and beyond, we are moving forward with the construction of our Legacy II plant, another new 275 million cubic feet per day plant in the Permian Midland. Legacy II is expected to begin operations during the second quarter of 2023. 06:07 In Permian Delaware, volumes across our system also continue to ramp. Today, we announced the construction of a new 275 million cubic feet per day plant -- the Midway plant. The new Midway plant is expected to begin operations during the third quarter of 2023. Midway will provide us with additional flexibility to flow volumes between our Midland and Delaware systems. We are idling an older plant, which is more prone to operational upsets, has higher operating costs, higher maintenance costs, lower recoveries and is limited in capacity. 06:40 The Midway plant improves performance on all of those items and will give us the ability to flow current volumes being processed at Sand Hills and an additional 110 million cubic feet per day of capacity that can be filled from the Delaware, Central or Midland Basins. This project is a good example of how to improve our overall environmental performance while also providing attractive returns. 07:07 The strong outlook across our Permian Basin footprint will continue to drive incremental volumes through our NGL downstream businesses and our recently announced expansions in both the Midland and Delaware, position Targa to realize very attractive integrated returns and continue to benefit from our embedded operating leverage with modest capital spending. 07:27 In our Central and Badlands regions, we are seeing stronger activity levels given the higher commodity price environment and expect 2022 average Central and Badlands volumes in aggregate to be flat relative to 2021 as higher production is expected to largely offset legacy decline in our systems. 07:46 Shifting to our Logistics and Transportation segment. NGL transportation volumes continue to increase and we transported a record 433,000 barrels per day to Mont Belvieu during the fourth quarter. Throughput volumes sequentially increased 4%, driven by increasing NGL production from Targa's Permian plants, including our new Heim Plant and third-parties. 08:10 Fourth quarter fractionation volumes at our Mont Belvieu complex averaged 612,000 barrels per day and were lower sequentially due to an unplanned outage in associated repairs and maintenance, which impacted volumes by about 50,000 barrels per day. The unplanned outage was associated with cooling water exchangers that support a portion of our CBF fracs, which resulted in reduced operating rates for the quarter. 08:35 We have excess fractionation capacity, so we are handling all incoming NGL volumes as well as some volumes that normally would have been fractionated in Q4, so our Q1 average volumes are expected to be higher. We expect to be operating back to normal by the end of the quarter. This outage resulted in higher CapEx -- sorry, in higher OpEx in Q4 and is also expected to impact OpEx in Q1 of this year. 09:01 Looking ahead to 2022, we expect higher year-over-year Grand Prix and fractionation volumes as our downstream systems continue to benefit from increasing supply from our growing Permian G&P position. In our LPG export services business at Galena Park, fourth quarter volumes rebounded following maintenance completed during the third quarter and increased 19% sequentially as we loaded an average 10.7 million barrels per month during the fourth quarter. 09:31 The outlook for our LPG export business in 2022 remains robust, complemented by our contracted portfolio and supply position in Mont Belvieu. In response to growing international demand for cleaner feedstocks and U.S. LPGs, we are undertaking an additional low cost expansion project to increase our loading rates at our Galena Park facilities. This refrigeration expansion will increase our propane loading capabilities more than an incremental 1 million barrels per month by mid-2023. 10:05 The longer-term outlook for Targa is strong. Our premier integrated Permian NGL business, our talented employees, complemented by our strong balance sheet and financial flexibility, we remain in position to grow our footprint and return increasing capital to our shareholders over time. 10:24 With that, I will now turn the call over to Jen. 17:33 Yeah. Sure. Yeah. We announced the Legacy II plant and the Midway plant this morning. We had highlight we were already ordering long lead time for Legacy II on our prior call. For this year, the Midway plant really was kind of an incremental from maybe what we had signaled previously. There was about $150 million of capital for that Midway plant almost all of that spending is in year, and then there's a little bit of capital, which would move into 2023. We'll still have significant spending on Legacy and Legacy II this year. And then we'll also have pump capital for Grand Prix, the export project. That export project is really more kind of a debottlenecking or a bolt-on. It's relatively small CapEx, which is why we really like that project. It gives us an incremental 1 million barrels a month of ability to load -- increase our capacity on the propane loading side for relatively modest capital. But the large movers are midway and then the spending on Legacy I and II. 18:39 Okay. Thanks. 22:33 Okay. Thanks, Michael. 24:09 Yeah. And just to add to that too, Scott, I'd say we would also continue to look across Belvieu. So if there's some excess capacity from some of our competitors that could give us some more time to evaluate when we need to do Train nine, we can look at those solutions as well. So we're kind of looking at the volume growth and really have all options on the table for us. 25:05 Yeah. Sure. To start, I would say, yeah, we do see one certainly being needed, and it looks like it's coming sooner than maybe previous expectations. So we are looking to be part of the solution. We have a lot of gas. We want additional infrastructure to get built. So we're talking to a number of the pipes that are trying to basically get geared up to get to FID. We want to get something done. So we want to be supportive to be able to get something done. So I guess just stay tuned on that. We think the industry will solve it. It's added pipes before. And just stay tuned on how and when Targa is going to participate in that. 25:49 Okay. Thanks. 26:32 Yeah. I'd say as we gave a range, commodity prices, as I'd say, the largest variable. And then we also had a range in our Permian volumes, 12% to 15%. So depending on where volumes from the Permian shake out. We are seeing some drilling across the Central and in Badlands. So if prices stay here, we could see some additional upside to our Central as well. I'd say those are the main drivers on the G&P side. I'd say on the downstream side, the export, we see a continued strong export market. But I think there's still some upside to our assumption in our guidance number to exports. And if there's a real weak market, there's some potential. It's not all contracted. So there's some variability in exports as well. 27:33Okay. Thank you. 28:17 Yeah. I'd say we're -- most of our growth is happening out in the Permian. Yes, there are some differences between the Delaware and the Midland. On the Midland side, that has been traditionally more POP, although we've done a good job at putting more fee-based components and fee floors on those POP. We have a lot of acreage dedicated to us under long-term contracts. And so a lot of the growth that we're seeing is under already existing longer-term contracts in and around that area. On the Delaware side, we do have more fee-based components on the Delaware side, but I'd say a lot of the volumes there for the growth is under long-term contracts. So it's really keeping the mix kind of similar to what we've had there. Pat, I don't know if there's anything you'd want to add to that. 29:39 Yes. Thanks, Pat. 31:22 Okay. Thanks, Tristan. 34:55 Okay. Thank you. 35:30 Yeah. Sure. When we hedge our equity volumes, we hedge really as close to where we sell the physical as we can. So for example, we'll sell Waha and other indices out in the Permian, and we'll sell other Mid-Con indices where we have length on gas. So we cover off the basis as best we can for the volumes that we are trying to hedge. 36:25 Sure. I'll give you some color there. We've, I'd say, kind of been actively looking at bolt-on, tuck-in acquisitions across our footprint. I'd say we just continue to have a high hurdle. It's not that nothing can cross over that hurdle. But as we look at acquisitions, we want to make sure we're staying within our leverage range. We want to make sure that we have good synergies on the G&P side and on the NGL side. We're in a good position where we don't need to acquire anything. So it's really got to be additive. It's got to be at a good value for us with synergies that drive that value down even more. So I'd say there are opportunities and things we're looking at, but we've -- that really hasn't changed. We've been looking at things for the last several years. There's opportunities in the Permian. There's also opportunities in other basins as well. And if it checks all those boxes of keeping our leverage where we need to be, good upfront value with G&P synergies and downstream synergies, a lot of those bolt-on or tuck-ins could look a lot like organic growth projects by the time you're done with them. So those are -- that's kind of how we're thinking about it, how we're looking at it. So I think, stay tuned, we'll see if anything meets all those -- it's a pretty high bar. We'll see if anything meets that. But if it does, there could be something there. 37:53 Okay. Thank you. 38:30 Yeah. I'd say on the valuation trends, it really depends on what you're looking at. So I consider us to be opportunistic on the buy side, but we're also opportunistic on the sell side, right? So we sold GCX at 11 times multiple. We thought that was a strong market there for that. But I would say for other assets that don't have that cash flow, kind of take-or-pay cash flow feature, it's -- over time, I think those multiples have trended down, but we haven't transacted on anything. So I can't really say how they've moved over the years. But for non-highly contracted assets where it makes sense for a financial buyer, I would expect the multiple to be significantly less than where we transacted GCX. 39:46 Okay. Thank you. 40:21 So when we have our equity hedges, we're, call it, 75% and then 50% hedged for our position on our equity position. We have some transport that also provides us ability to move our gas out in various directions. We have a gas marketing team that manages that portfolio very actively to make sure we have contracted takeaway. 41:02 Chase, our primary focus for our gas is to make sure volumes are moving out of the basin. For us and for our producers, that is our focus to make sure we have a market that we can get to, that is our focus, and that is kind of how we manage that overall gas position. We want gas to move and we try and do it as best we can for us and for our producers. 42:10 Yeah. Sure. So I'll start on that, and then -- for Q4, so if you're comparing to our reported in Q3, it would look like it's down. If you look at what we reported, it's in the supplement. It's actually we see an increase of about 2% on our Midland volumes. There was a kind of production month accounting change from some volumes that were in October into -- and from September into October, which changed it. So we actually saw when it was corrected volume growth in Q4 on the Midland side. As far as nameplate, we have the ability to run over nameplate. You've seen us do that. It can provide us good flexibility. We actually updated what we estimate our nameplate really to be for our plants. We used to call these 250s. We've been running them for over that and haven't seen a degradation in NGL recoveries or operational performance. So we're calling them 275s now. So we still have good flexibility across our system to continue to operate. So we -- so to be clear, we saw growth in the Midland in Q4, and we expect to see growth in Midland kind of throughout the balance of the year. 43:21 Okay. Thanks, Chase 43:59 Sure. We did not provide a detailed breakout of that. I'd say we see growth on both Delaware and the Midland. So we see pretty strong activity across both areas of our system. And so yeah, we see growth in both areas. 44:26 We haven't given that color. I think you'll see it as we report going forward. But no, we haven't provided a kind of basin level detailed breakout. But we do see meaningful growth in both, and we see strong growth continuing in the Midland, which is why we're adding those plants, but we also see growth in the Delaware. 45:12 Yeah. I'd say we are continuing to look at opportunities in and around energy transition. We're continuing to look at renewable deals, whether it's additional solar or additional wind deals. We're continuing to be active to see if we can be part of the solution that way. Like, I said before, I think for those projects, it's unlikely we put our capital on those projects, but we could provide some offtake to help get those underwritten. So we're currently evaluating additional renewable projects on that front. We're also continuing to develop our carbon capture out in and around our assets. So we're continuing to make progress on that. That is going to take a while. So we are making progress. There are some hurdles. There's some -- there's permitting, there's just things that need to get done, but we are working through those. And I think we still are optimistic that we can get something done there in carbon capture. Part of it does depend on where is the 45Q going to settle out, and there was talk for a while of it going up 80. So is it going to be 80 or is it going to be 50? Those kind of things matter as well. So we're going to continue to work to try and develop the operational hurdles and get through that, and then we'll have to make the call on whether it makes financial sense for us or we need to source third-party capital. 46:33 Okay. Thank you."

At this time, all attendees are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And please be advised that today\u2019s call is being recorded. Thank you. Now I would like to welcome Mr. Sanjay Lad, Vice President, Finance and Investor Relations. Sir, please go ahead.\nSanjay Lad: Thanks, Ruel. Good morning, and welcome to the third quarter 2021 earnings call for Targa Resources Corp. The third quarter earnings release, along with the third quarter earnings supplement presentation for Targa Resources that accompany our call are available on our website at targaresources.com in the Investors section. In addition, an updated investor presentation has also been posted to our website. Statements made during this call that might include Targa Resources' expectations or predictions should be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in forward-looking statements. For a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ, please refer to our latest SEC filings. Our speakers for the call today will be Matt Meloy, Chief Executive Officer; and Jen Kneale, Chief Financial Officer. Additionally, the following senior management team members will be available for Q&A. Pat McDonie, President, Gathering and Processing; Scott Pryor, President, Logistics and Transportation; and Bobby Muraro, Chief Commercial Officer. And with that, I will now turn the call over to Matt.\nMatt Meloy: Thanks, Sanjay, and good morning to everyone. This is a very exciting time at Targa, as highlighted by our earnings release this morning. Operationally, we continue to perform well and now expect to exceed all our volume guidance expectations for the year. Financially, our balance sheet is as strong as it's ever been, with our leverage in the midpoint of our target range and expectations for it to continue to trend lower. Strategically, several of our key areas of focus over the last several years are driving the strength of our results and are positioning looking forward; fully integrating our NGL business from wellhead to water, moving to a G&P contract structure that allows us to protect downside while continuing to participate from strong commodity prices and managing capital spending to focus on projects that leverage our integrated NGL platform and drive higher returns. The culmination of the successful execution of the Targa strategy gives me confidence to say that we are now where we want to be from a strategic and financial standpoint. Over the years, we invested outsized capital relative to the size of our company to fully integrate our business and create a best-in-class midstream footprint for our customers. These capital investments stretched our balance sheet more than we would have liked, but we believe those decisions would position us to generate significant long-term shareholder value, and we are now in a position where we are seeing the benefits of those previous strategic investments. We are also now in a position to unwind some of the structured financings that we utilized to finance our growth, and we will be able to do so while maintaining our leverage comfortably in our target range. Our EBITDA, free cash flow and balance sheet are as strong as they have ever been. And we now expect to exceed the top end of our adjusted EBITDA guidance for 2021 and see continued growth thereafter underpinned by attractive organic growth opportunities that are integrated high return projects. All of this puts us in position to return additional capital to our shareholders. We plan to recommend to our board $1.40 per common share annual dividend or $0.35 per quarter effective for the fourth quarter of this year and payable in February 2022. This equates to approximately 30% of our 2021 free cash flow and provides a yield competitive to members in the S&P 400 and S&P 500. We would expect to be able to increase the dividend, a modest amount, going forward on an annual basis. This level of common dividend returns additional capital to shareholders while providing us significant financial flexibility across cycles. For 2022, our current expectation is to direct free cash flow after dividends toward the repurchase of our DevCo joint venture interest. While continuing to closely manage our balance sheet, we believe we will have the flexibility to redeem preferred stock and opportunistically repurchase common shares under the $500 million share repurchase program. Before I move to discuss our operational performance, I want to acknowledge the continued outstanding efforts of our Targa employees. Throughout pandemic, hurricanes, storms and other issues, our employees have performed exceptionally well and we are so proud of their efforts. Let us now turn to our operational performance and business outlook. Starting in the Permian, third quarter system inlet volumes increased 7% sequentially, and we now expect our average 2021 Permian inlet to exceed the top end of our previously disclosed 5% to 10% growth range over 2020. In Permian Midland, our new 200 million cubic feet per day Heim Plant, which began full operations in early September, is currently running near full, and our next 250 million cubic feet per day Legacy Plant remains on track to begin operations during the fourth quarter of 2022. With robust activity levels expected to continue into next year and beyond, we are evaluating the timing of our next Midland Plant after Legacy and are now ordering long lead items. In Permian Delaware, completions and activity levels continue to ramp and we currently have adequate processing capacity to accommodate our anticipated near to medium term growth. The stronger outlook across our Permian Basin footprint will continue to drive incremental volumes through our NGL downstream business. And in our Central region, we are seeing an uptick in activity levels given the higher commodity price environment and remained optimistic around higher production, offsetting Legacy decline on many of our systems. Shifting to our Logistics and Transportation segment, Grand Prix volumes continue to increase and we transported a record 417,000 barrels per day to Mont Belvieu during the third quarter. Throughput volumes on Grand Prix sequentially increased 6% driven by increasing NGL production from Targa's Permian plant, including our new Heim Plant and third-parties. We also achieved record fractionation volumes at our Mont Belvieu complex averaging about 662,000 barrels per day during the third quarter, representing a 3% sequential increase. Our LPG Export Services business, third quarter volumes averaged 9 million barrels per month. Lower sequential volumes were attributable to general maintenance we chose to complete at our Galena Park export facility during the quarter, while it was an overall weaker global LPG market. The last couple of years have presented a number of challenges and we think that we have demonstrated the ability for Targa to perform exceptionally well across volatile markets with record 2020 adjusted EBITDA and expectation for a record 2021 adjusted EBITDA and current expectations for record 2022 adjusted EBITDA. So I will finish with another thank you to all of our employees. And with that, I will now turn the call over to Jen.\nJen Kneale: Thanks, Matt. I would also like to give a big thank you to all of our employees. Targa's reported quarterly adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter was $506 million, increasing 10% sequentially as we benefited from higher commodity prices including upside from fee floor volumes and higher volumes across our integrated Permian gathering, processing and logistics and transportation systems. Year-to-date 2021 Targa has generated adjusted free cash flow of $893 million, which has allowed us to reduce our leverage significantly across the year. We are highly hedged for 2021 and continue to add hedges for 2022 and beyond, while still benefiting from higher prices across our unhedged equity volume exposure and prices above fee floors. For 2022, we have now hedged about 85% of natural gas, 75% of NGLs and 75% of condensate. We are continuing to hedge into price strength and have added 2022 hedges at higher weighted average hedge prices. For 2023, we are around 50% hedged across all commodities. You can find our usual hedge disclosures in our quarterly earnings supplement presentation. As Matt mentioned, we now expect to be above the top end of our full year estimated 2021 adjusted EBITDA range of $1.9 billion to $2 billion. Increasing activity levels across our Permian systems and additional visibility to 2022, we now estimate our 2021 net growth CapEx to be toward the high end of our $350 million to $450 million range as we are ordering long lead items for our next Midland Basin plan. As we think about 2022 growth capital, our expectation is that it will be higher than 2021 with continued spending largely around additional plant, well connect and compression capital on the G&P side plus additional pump station capital for Grand Prix. Our full year net maintenance CapEx estimate remains unchanged at approximately $120 million. Our balance sheet is strong with a consolidated leverage ratio of about 3.5 times and we have significant liquidity with no near-term debt maturities. We now expect to end 2021 with consolidated leverage around 3.25 times and pro forma for our $925 million DevCo repurchase in January 2022, we expect to comfortably be within our target range of 2 to 4 times. Our outperformance year-to-date and balance sheet flexibility position us to begin returning incremental capital to our shareholders. In 2021, we focused on reducing leverage. In 2022, with the strength of our balance sheet, our focus shifts to simplifying our capital structure and returning more capital to shareholders. Complemented by our plans to recommend a meaningful increase to our common dividend in early 2022, we will continue to remain opportunistic around common and preferred share repurchases, and we'll continue to invest in attractive high returning growth opportunities that leverage our integrated system. Our recommendation to increase the common dividend to $1.40 per share annualized with the culmination of a lot of comparable company and industry analysis as well as scenario analysis. We believe that at $1.40, Targa offers an attractive common dividend per share that will provide for a stable return of cash flow to our shareholders across cycles. Our initial increase of the common dividend will be effective for the fourth quarter of 2021 and we expect to maintain that dividend level through the fourth quarter of 2022. Beyond 2022, we expect to provide modest increases to our annual common dividend per share and currently expect to articulate the next change to our dividend concurrent with providing our annual guidance in February 2023. We have worked very hard to improve our balance sheet and we remain focused on preserving our strong balance sheet and maintaining consolidated leverage of 3 to 4 times over the longer term. We are continuing our dialogue with the rating agencies with a focus toward achieving investment-grade rating, which is a priority for Targa. This week, Moody's upgraded us to Ba1. So we are now one notch from investment-grade at all three agencies. Shifting to sustainability and ESG. We recently published our third annual sustainability report. And we continue to advance Targa's sustainability disclosures with the report providing a review of our performance against various environmental, social and governance topics that are important to our industry. Also, as announced a couple of days ago, we entered into agreements to source renewable electricity from Concho Valley Solar to provide power to our G&P infrastructure in the Permian Basin. We continue to review and pursue other economic opportunities to advance our sustainability objectives that complement our core competencies and infrastructure footprint. In closing, we are so very proud of our Targa team. Our employees have continued to perform exceptionally well for our customers and have done so with a continued focus on safety, and we are very thankful for their efforts. And with that, I will turn the call back over to Sanjay.\nSanjay Lad: Thanks, Jen. For the Q&A session, we kindly ask that you limit to one question and one follow-up and reenter the line-up if you have additional questions. Ruel, would you please open the lines for Q&A. Ruel, would you please open the line.\nOperator: I'm sorry. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from the line of Jeremy Tonet from J.P. Morgan. Your line is now open.\nJeremy Tonet: Hi, good morning.\nMatt Meloy: Hey, good morning, Jeremy.\nJen Kneale: Good morning, Jeremy.\nJeremy Tonet: Great to see the rating agencies starting to pay attention to the improving metrics here. But I want to focus more on the 2022 outlook here, and just wondering if you could provide us more color on what you're seeing as far as producer activity in your footprint is concerned. This year we've seen kind of a bifurcation of private versus publics with the privates being more aggressive. Do you see similar trends like that continuing into 2022 or is there anything different there? And I think you've talked about processing plant every 18 months or so. Is that still kind of the current expectation?\nMatt Meloy: Yes. Hey, Jeremy. I'd say, it really is probably more of the same from us for our larger E&Ps and larger publics and integrated. They are really sticking more or less with what they have told us. They have some ranges in their forecast they give us, but more or less are kind of sticking to the plans that they have. And we are still seeing a lot of the uptick in activity from the smaller and private guys really across our systems. I don't see a big change happening there. And then in terms of adding processing plants, last call we talked about adding the Legacy Plant, we just had Heim Plant come online, and we're ordering long lead times now for the next plant in the Permian Midland. So as we're really working through our, I'd say, capital budgeting and planning for 2022, we're ordering long lead times so we can be ready. We're not sure exactly when we think we'll need the next plant after Legacy, so we're still kind of in that evaluation phase, but we want to be ready in there for customers when it comes in. So I guess, stay tuned. When we think that next plant will come in, we would likely announce more specifics around timing on the next earnings call.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. That's helpful. Thanks. And maybe just touching on capital allocation, great to see the dividend show up a little bit early and ahead of what we were looking for. But just wondering if you could just walk us through maybe the priorities of the waterfall here. It seems like you're able to do multiple things at once, but just kind of curious if that's how you think about it or how you prioritize? And just when it comes to buybacks, is it just going to be solely opportunistic or could there be some programmatic side to it?\nMatt Meloy: Sure. I'll start and then I'll hand it over to Jen to provide some more details there. As we look through the strength of this year, we saw our volumes and just overall business performance going very well with some commodity price tailwinds. As we kind of looked through \u2013 even our outlook continuing to be very strong. I think we found ourselves in a position in the midpoint of our leverage range where we said, we're here, we don't necessarily need to wait till next quarter to be more specific around returning capital to shareholders. And so that really is kind of signaling a bit of a shift from debt repayment, which is what we've been focused on. We're now in the middle of our leverage range and forecasting to get toward the lower end of it by year end to now wanting to return capital to shareholders. So the first step in that was moving the dividend to a more reasonable level. We looked at our S&P 400 and 500. We looked at our peers across the space and felt that that was an appropriate amount which allowed us to grow while providing financial flexibility. And that financial flexibility does give us the opportunity to continue to return capital to shareholders through simplifying repurchasing the preferred and opportunistic share repurchases. So we felt like that was kind of a good start along the way. Jen, any other color just how you think about opportunistic?\nJen Kneale: I'd say, Jeremy, clearly the near-term priority is now we're in excellent position to take out the DevCos in January and leverage will move a little bit higher when we do that, but then we expect to leverage to come down thereafter as we benefit from increasing EBITDA, not only in company's assets. but from the rest of the business. And that's what's really going to drive a lot of the flexibility that we see us having in 2022 that will allow us to return capital to our shareholders in a variety of ways. The simplification is still an important part of this for us though, and that starts with the DevCo and then also taking out the preferred. And that's what we'll largely be focused on in 2022. But again, I think we now have the flexibility to think about a go forward where we've got increasing EBITDA, which allows us to return more capital through both increasing dividends and potentially decreasing share count. And that's what we'll be focused on as we go forward through time, assuming a continued strong balance sheet.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. That's helpful. Thank you.\nJen Kneale: Thanks, Jeremy.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Shneur Gershuni from UBS. Your line is now open.\nShneur Gershuni: Good morning, everyone. From my perspective, not a lot of big picture questions. I think you guys have really answered the questions on return of capital, dividend increases today, timing of simplification. Congratulations on that, very much appreciated. Maybe just some smaller type questions. First of all, just with respect to the ramp in the Permian and so forth, appreciate the color that you gave, privates version publics. Wondering if you can talk about it more geographically. Any sense on how the ramp is going to work in the Delaware? Are you seeing any increased activity there or some shifts and so forth? Just kind of wondering if anything has kind of changed in terms of producer conversations or activity around that.\nMatt Meloy: Yeah, sure. So Pat McDonie, our President of G&P elaborate there.\nPat McDonie: I think it's pretty csonsistent across both the Midland side of the basin and the Delaware side of the basin. We're seeing the steady growth from the large publics, as Matt alluded to, and we're seeing more activity levels in both the Delaware and the Midland side of the basin from the smaller guys. And certainly, when you look at rig count adds, etc., it kind of indicates that there's probably a little more lag in the Delaware than there is in the Midland side of the basin. But certainly, in our conversations with those parties we contracted with, they're definitely ramping up in some form or fashion. Not crazy ramp up, but good, thoughtful investment of capital. So that's what we're seeing right now.\nShneur Gershuni: Great. Thank you for that. And then as a follow-up question, obviously, there's a lot going on from an inflation perspective right now. Many of your peers have talked about the fact that they have PPI or CPI style in players and the vast majority of their contracts, whether it's G&P, whether it's long haul pipes and so forth. Kind of curious if you can update us on where receipts in that respect. We have an inflator adjuster in there. Do your contracts in the Permian in general have those types inflators as well too?\nJen Kneale: Shneur, this is Jen. I think similar to a lot of our peers, we have escalators across our contracts both in G&P and also in Logistics and Transportation. So we would expect going forward that we're in that beneficiary of inflation. And so that's part of what would be a potential tailwind for us next year and then the go forward after that.\nShneur Gershuni: Taking the time today.\nJen Kneale: Thank you.\nMatt Meloy: Okay, thanks.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Christine Cho from Barclays. Your line is now open.\nMark Devries: This is Mark on for Christine. I was just wondering if you could give us an update on your discussions with the rating agencies. Obviously, with the continued strong results, it seems like you're well on your way to IG. But just curious how you're thinking about the path forward? And then as a second part to that, it would seem like you're trending below your long-term leverage target for next year. So could that open up capacity for share repurchases or how should we think about that?\nJen Kneale: Mark, this is Jen. I think that we are in an excellent dialogue with the rating agencies. I think from our perspective, we already have strong investment-grade metrics. And so have spent a lot of time with the agencies to make sure that they understand what our short, medium and long-term strategies are and really get comfortable with the direction that we're headed in. And I think with the recent upgrades from S&P and now Moody's, they're recognizing the progress that we've continued to make. And then Fitch with their initial rating, I think spent a lot of time with us to understand where we are and what the vision was going forward. So I think we're in a good position with all three. What has been articulated to us is that the DevCo repurchase in their minds is an important step for us in our simplification. So we'll do that in January of 2022. Leverage will move a little bit higher just as a result of where leverage is now and where we expect it to be at year end and then we'd expect it to come down thereafter. So I think we're really well positioned. And our hope is that it will be a 2022 event that we become investment-grade. And then obviously, we don't control the timing of that, but we\u2019ll continue to be in dialogue with the agencies to figure out what the appropriate timing is for us. And then related to the second part of your question, can you just remind me what that was?\nMark Devries: Just that you\u2019re trending below your long-term leverage target for next year. So does that open up any capacity for share repurchases or how should we just think about that?\nJen Kneale: I think, hopefully, what you\u2019ve heard from us this morning is that we\u2019re really excited about where we\u2019re positioned today and the flexibility that that affords us going forward. We focused on reducing leverage this year. And you\u2019ve heard already that in our minds there is a shift in 2022 where we\u2019re able to return more capital to our shareholders. And to the extent we are able to continue to manage leverage where it is and where we expect it to go, I think that increases our flexibility to do a lot of different things that will improve the return of capital to our shareholders and increase the value of Targa as we move through time.\nMark Devries: Great. Appreciate that. And then looks like your implied G&P fees came in pretty strong again this quarter. How should we think about that going forward into 2022? It looks like you are above the fee floor levels at this point. And should we think there is a cap to how much upside the volumes on these contracts can participate in?\nMatt Meloy: Yes. So you are correct in that our fee floors were put in place to protect the downside. And right now, our average NGL is around $1.06 and gas prices are much higher than they were last year. So we are above the fee floors on our POP contract. So the way those generally work is they\u2019re still POP contracts, percentage-of-proceeds, just has a fee floor in them. So as prices will continue to move up, it will look like a regular POP contract.\nMark Devries: Great. Thanks for the time.\nMatt Meloy: Okay. Thank you.\nJen Kneale: Thanks, Mark.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Colton Bean from Tudor Pickering. Your line is now open.\nColton Bean: Great. So I\u2019ll stick with the leverage theme there. So Jen, you mentioned exiting 2021 near the low end, it seems likely that you\u2019ll be able to fund the DevCo buying with free cash. So even if there is a little bit of a tick higher in early parts of the year as you move through the balance of 2022 and certainly to 2023, it seems likely that you\u2019ll be below that 3x to 4x range. So just conceptually, can you update us how you think about the appropriate level of debt on the business? Should we expect an updated leverage target over time? Really just interested in kind of broader thoughts there.\nJen Kneale: Our long-term target is 3x to 4x, Colton, and that\u2019s not something that I would expect that we\u2019ll be updating. We\u2019re very comfortable within the 3x to 4x range. That doesn\u2019t mean that we couldn\u2019t have quarters or quarters where we\u2019re lower or even higher than that. I think we\u2019re very comfortable existing anywhere around that zip code. To the extent we\u2019re in the lower end or even below, that gives us more flexibility. So we\u2019ll just be continuing to manage our balance sheet as we go through time. But again, very comfortable within the 3x to 4x range and that\u2019s really over the long-term where we expect to manage the business.\nColton Bean: Got it. And then just on the Series A, any thoughts as to the cadence we should expect over the course of 2022 there?\nJen Kneale: The base plan that we have right now is that we\u2019ll ratably take it out beginning really in the second quarter after it steps down to 105, and that will continue until, call it, the end of 2023 when it will be fully redeemed at that point in time. But to the extent that we want to take some out sooner, we obviously have that flexibility. So that\u2019s a lever that we\u2019ll be able to pull as we move through 2022 just depending on the performance of the business and the outlook for the business.\nColton Bean: Great. I appreciate the time.\nJen Kneale: Thank you.\nMatt Meloy: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of John Mackay from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nJohn Mackay: Hey, good morning. Congrats from me as well on the dividend and the capital allocation investment. Wanted to touch on the 2022 CapEx comment, signaled at little higher year-over-year. Just curious if you could kind of talk about how much of that is from increasing activity? You mentioned the Midland plants and Grand Prix pumps, but is there any of that also coming from any inflation on the sourcing side? Thanks.\nMatt Meloy: Yes. No, really I think as we look for 2022 CapEx, it\u2019s really more related to our \u2013 this increase in activity out in the Permian. We\u2019re looking to exceed our guidance on volumes for this year, ordering long lead times, it looks like we\u2019re going to have more plant capital as you get into 2022, and then also, it\u2019s just more volumes, more gathering compression pipelines and the like. So I\u2019d say it\u2019s more related to that. We are seeing some higher costs for steel and other things. The team has done a really good job for whether it\u2019s Legacy or even this next plant we\u2019re kind of getting in the Q4 are trying to manage that as best we can. There will be some pressures on that, but I\u2019d say it\u2019s primarily related to more activity than just inflation.\nJohn Mackay: All right. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. And then maybe just following-up on your comments around the export downtime this quarter. Just curious if, one, you could kind of frame-up how much of the lower margin, lower volumes quarter-over-quarter was the downtime versus shifts in kind of the overall macro? And then maybe you can kind of just give us a snapshot maybe on where exports sit right now? Thanks.\nMatt Meloy: Sure. Scott Pryor can handle that one.\nScott Pryor: Hey, John. Yes, as it relates to the third quarter, first of all, we performed on our term-related contracts as it relates to that working with all of our term customers. But we opted to do the maintenance at our facility during the quarter. And really doing that against the backdrop of the fact that there was a softer market globally and the result of really less arb opportunity. So we foregoed, if you will, the opportunity to sell some additional spot cargos across our dock. That teases up very well as we move into the fourth quarter domestically. Prices have kind of stabilized here. We\u2019ve seen increases in the arb and the opportunities across the market to the Far East and other areas. So I think it puts us in good position obviously to perform very well in the fourth quarter, not only for our term-related contracts, but taking advantage of the opportunity to move additional spots across the dock. So I think we\u2019re in good position there.\nJohn Mackay: I appreciate that. Thank you.\nMatt Meloy: Okay. Thanks, John.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Spiro Dounis from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hey, good morning, everyone. This is Doug on for Spiro. Maybe just to start on one on margins, a few peers have talks this quarter about frac T&F becoming more competitive in the Permian. Just wondering if you\u2019re seeing similar pressure on margins? And if so, kind of what it takes to scale back toward midstream?\nMatt Meloy: Yes, sure. Right now, I would agree with that assessment that the T&F market is very competitive. There is excess capacity. And so new deals that are coming, it\u2019s very competitive, and there\u2019s a lot of competition to get the marginal barrel there. I\u2019d say the good thing for Targa is we have, we are underpinned by either long-term contracts if it\u2019s a T&F agreement. We have long-terms, a lot of them are 10-plus years, our longer term T&F contracts. And then in our Gathering and Processing business, we have long-term contracts on the G&P side. So most of the volumes that are coming and most of the volumes that are underpinning our growth are already contracted for multiple years to come. So I\u2019d say, while we are in that same market, we\u2019re still very well positioned for the next several years because of our contract structure.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. Got it. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. And then maybe just to follow-up on the dividend, realized the next decision is a little ways away, but this quarter you kind of referenced that 30% of free cash flow around the dividend increase. As we look towards what the next increase could look like, is that a good reference point to think about? Are there other metrics you\u2019re looking at in terms of determining how big of an increase you could see next time?\nJen Kneale: Doug, this is Jen. When we think about 2022, there is still a little bit for us to continue to work through related to the corporate simplification, right? So primary use of free cash flow in 2022 will be the DevCo repurchase. As we think about beyond that, I think we\u2019ll wait to articulate more about our plans. We tried to give a reference point that said that setting the dividend at $1.40 for the fourth quarter we were looking at how much of 2021 free cash flow that represented and are very comfortable with the dividend that approximates to call it 30% of this year\u2019s free cash flow. But as we move through time, that could change. And so I\u2019d say that that\u2019s something that we will continue to evaluate. We have said that we think that we will be in position to return more capital to shareholders as we move through time. And so how much free cash flow that means we are comfortable paying out on any given year will be dependent on our performance for that year and then our expectations for the go forward as well.\nUnidentified Analyst: All right, great. That is all from me. Thank you.\nJen Kneale: Thank you.\nMatt Meloy: Okay, thanks.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Michael Blum from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.\nMichael Blum: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. I think I know the answer to this, but just wanted to confirm the transaction that was just announced for the Pioneer acreage. I assume that includes acreage tied to your assets and I assume the contracts will just move and there will be no really change from your perspective. Just wanted to confirm that.\nPat McDonie: Yeah, that is correct. The Continental acquisition of Pioneer acreage, a lot of it is dedicated to us and it will just move over with the existing dedication.\nMichael Blum: Great. Perfect, thanks. And then I know it\u2019s early, but I wanted to kind of get your read on the EPA\u2019s proposal to regulate methane emissions. Do you see this as a potential costs for your business or is it potentially a positive upside, for example, producers are no longer permitted to flare any natural gas? Just want to get your thoughts there. Thanks.\nMatt Meloy: Sure. Yes, with the proposed additional regulations from the EPA, I\u2019d say, as we look through those, we\u2019re in overall agreement with what they\u2019re trying to do, and that\u2019s trying to keep methane in the facilities, which makes sense. We\u2019re already operating with best practices in a lot of these areas. So the recommendations they are putting forth we\u2019re already doing in a lot of the areas, and we\u2019ve been retrofitting and making changes for years doing this. So this may perhaps speed that along some work that we\u2019re already doing. We\u2019re already looking and trying to find leaks along our pipelines and facilities. As outlined in our ESG report, we\u2019re hiring third-parties to fly, kind of going above and beyond and flying our facilities looking for leaks and fixing them. So overall, this is things we\u2019ve already done. It puts some more parameters in place, which we\u2019ll have to follow. But I don\u2019t see that as being an issue for us, it\u2019s things we were already doing. And then an opportunity, I\u2019d say, as we provide really good service to our customers and can have good metrics there, yes, I think there is some potential opportunity as we kind of become leading in this and continue to perform very well. That could be beneficial for some of the larger E&Ps who are focused on our overall performance there.\nMichael Blum: Thank you.\nMatt Meloy: Okay. Thanks, Mike.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Keith Stanley from Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.\nKeith Stanley: Thanks. Good morning. So appreciating there\u2019s rounding involved in your disclosures, but I was looking at the year-end leverage expectation of 3.25 versus 3.50 last time. If I kind of look at debt outstanding, that implies a pretty big increase in EBITDA for the year, it would be like $2.1 billion for 2021. Is that a possibility based on the math or am I over thinking that and it\u2019s just rounding involved?\nJen Kneale: I mean, clearly, we\u2019re not giving specific numbers on exactly what our expectation is right now for full year adjusted EBITDA. I think we do have a pretty good outlook for the fourth quarter. And now that we\u2019re a month into the fourth quarter, feel good about it. But ultimately, we\u2019ll have to see how the next couple of months shake out and how we finish up the year. But yes, I mean, prices are strong, fundamentals are strong. We do expect increasing volumes really across the business this quarter so to the extent that those materialize. I think it should end up being a pretty good quarter for Targa and that will drive a very nice 2021 overall adjusted EBITDA year for the company.\nKeith Stanley: Great, thanks. And second question. The Midland plants just in Q3, I mean, they look like they are already running above nameplate even with Heim. Should we assume you\u2019re somewhat limited on Midland growth until Legacy starts up or can you still kind of flex those facilities higher and meet, I guess, demand?\nPat McDonie: Yes. We have the ability to get some incremental capacity out of the plate above \u2013 out our plants above nameplate. When you think about the size of our Midland system and then number of plants that we have, and let\u2019s just say, we\u2019ve got 10% at least capability above nameplate, it\u2019s a pretty substantial amount of incremental capacity that allows us to go ahead and continue to handle all of our producers\u2019 volumes, while we\u2019re building that next plant and putting that incremental capacity in place. Does that answer your question?\nKeith Stanley: So 10% above nameplate you think you can get to if needed?\nPat McDonie: I think that\u2019s very comfortable, I\u2019ll put it that way, and some of our facilities have capabilities beyond that 10%.\nKeith Stanley: Okay, great. That does answer it. Thank you.\nMatt Meloy: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Chase Mulvehill from Bank of America. Your line is now open.\nChase Mulvehill: Hey, thanks, everyone. Thanks for squeezing me in here. I guess, one quick follow-up to Keith\u2019s question. If you were to run out of capacity in Midland before kind of Legacy comes on, and I know you said you could squeeze more out above nameplate, is it possible for you to move any kind of wet gas over to the Delaware and process the gas there?\nPat McDonie: Yes. We do have some capability of moving gas from the Midland site to the Delaware site. And frankly, looking at ways to improve our capability of doing so. So some looking to grow that. And certainly, we have the ability to offload to peers in the marketplace that having incremental available capacity. So we feel pretty good about our ability to handle the growth in volumes before our next plant comes up just based on the fleet of plants that we currently have. But we certainly have some other flexibility.\nChase Mulvehill: Okay, great. Unrelated follow-up. I know we\u2019ve kind of talked about this a lot on the call so far about capital allocation, but it sounds like excess free cash is going to go to the DevCo buy-in and retiring some of the preferreds, and at some point, you\u2019re going to look at buybacks. So can I ask a question on buybacks? Like, how are you approaching buybacks? Is it kind of more of a planned and measured program each quarter or will it be more opportunistic and price sensitive?\nJen Kneale: We\u2019ve characterized it as opportunistic, Chase. So it\u2019s really going to depend on what\u2019s happening in a given quarter and what\u2019s our outlook for the year, what\u2019s our outlook beyond that. And so we\u2019ll look under \u2013 we\u2019ll look at that decision under a number of different frameworks. But I think hopefully what you\u2019re hearing from us is that with the balance sheet flexibility we now feel that we have, it certainly can be part of how we\u2019re going to return capital to shareholders. But we\u2019re not going to provide clarity under the frameworks under which we will or will not participate in the market.\nChase Mulvehill: Okay. And noticeably absent was any mention of a special or potential special dividend. Is that off the table?\nJen Kneale: I think from our perspective, everything always has to be on the table. We\u2019ve clearly articulated that as we think about our priorities for 2021. It was managing our leverage lower. And then for 2022, it\u2019s really continuing corporate simplification with the DevCo and the preferred, while also being able to return more capital to shareholders, which I think initially we\u2019re talking about in terms of paying a higher base common dividend and then also potentially being able to engage in some opportunistic repurchases. But everything is always on the table, and that\u2019s what we work through with our Board each and every quarter to make decisions. From our perspective, that\u2019s not something that makes sense for us today, but that doesn\u2019t mean that that couldn\u2019t change in the future.\nChase Mulvehill: Okay, perfect. I\u2019ll turn it back over. Thanks, Jen.\nJen Kneale: Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question is from the line of Sunil Sibal from Seaport Global Securities. Your line is now open.\nSunil Sibal: Yes, hi. Good morning, everybody, and thanks for all the color. So my first question is related to the M&A. So obviously, we continue to see fair bit of M&A in the upstream space and some has also started in the midstream side also not too far away from your footprint. So my question was, now that you\u2019ve kind of got the company to where you want it to be over the longer term, how do you look at M&A in the midstream space going forward?\nMatt Meloy: Yeah, sure. Good morning. I think for us, it\u2019s really been \u2013 it\u2019s really going to be more of the same. I think we\u2019re going to continue to have a high hurdle for us. We have a really good organic growth projects outlook to continue to grow that. So we\u2019re not in a position of need where we feel like we have to go get something to complete our integrated story or that we are really falling short in any area. So we\u2019ll continue to look at assets. We have looked over the last several years. If there is something that\u2019s complementary to our existing assets and it fits well on the G&P side and it has liquid synergies, so it\u2019s a good G&P business with some liquids, we will look at that as we\u2019ve continued to look at it, but we also want to make sure if we do anything there, we\u2019re staying within our 3x to 4x target leverage. So it\u2019s kind of got to be just right for us. So we haven\u2019t really found anything that\u2019s fit that, but we\u2019ll continue to look. But it continues to be a high bar because we have \u2013 we think we\u2019re going to able to grow our EBITDA just through organic growth.\nSunil Sibal: Got it. Thanks for that. And my second question related to the ESG initiatives. So obviously, you\u2019ve signed up for solar power through PPAs. I was just curious, should we kind of think about that as the line you intend to take as you look at your ESG initiatives or there could be more kind of meaningful participation there?\nMatt Meloy: Yeah. So we have talked quite a bit about the opportunities in terms of investments and how we\u2019re thinking about purchasing power. So I\u2019m excited to be able to announce supporting that power project. Robert Muraro has been working with the team to try to evaluate other opportunities whether it would be additional renewables or carbon capture. Bobby, you just want to talk a little bit about some opportunities?\nBobby Muraro: Yes. I think the way we think about it, this is Bobby, as we look at all these projects that either fit our capital profile or third-party capital profile. So to the extent we can go to low carbon projects that supply power to our assets or carbon capture or something else that we\u2019re willing to fund on our balance sheet or someone else is willing to fund on their balance sheet, we will look to do those projects. I think this is the first example of one where there were someone that was willing to build a solar project that fit within the parameters we want to do from a low carbon standpoint and their return parameters. It probably didn\u2019t hit our return parameters, which is why you won\u2019t see us put money in the projects like that. But to the extent we start to fund ones that do, that will be part of the evaluation going forward. I wouldn\u2019t set a standard to what we would or wouldn\u2019t do, but that\u2019s kind of how the analysis goes internally.\nSunil Sibal: Got it. Thanks for all the color, and congratulations on the good update.\nJen Kneale: Thanks, Sunil.\nMatt Meloy: Okay. Thank you.\nBobby Muraro: Thanks, Sunil.\nOperator: There are no further questions. Presenters, please continue.\nSanjay Lad: Well, thanks everyone that was on the call this morning, and we appreciate your interest in Targa Resources. Thank you, and have a great day.\nOperator: And with that, this concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for attending. You may now disconnect.",

So that's what we're seeing right now. Yeah, that is correct. The Continental acquisition of Pioneer acreage, a lot of it is dedicated to us and it will just move over with the existing dedication. Yes. We have the ability to get some incremental capacity out of the plate above \u2013 out our plants above nameplate. When you think about the size of our Midland system and then number of plants that we have, and let's just say, we've got 10% at least capability above nameplate, it's a pretty substantial amount of incremental capacity that allows us to go ahead and continue to handle all of our producers' volumes, while we're building that next plant and putting that incremental capacity in place. Does that answer your question? I think that's very comfortable, I'll put it that way, and some of our facilities have capabilities beyond that 10%. Yes. We do have some capability of moving gas from the Midland site to the Delaware site. And frankly, looking at ways to improve our capability of doing so. So some looking to grow that. And certainly, we have the ability to offload to peers in the marketplace that having incremental available capacity. So we feel pretty good about our ability to handle the growth in volumes before our next plant comes up just based on the fleet of plants that we currently have. But we certainly have some other flexibility."

            "content": "Thanks, Matt. I would also like to give a big thank you to all of our employees. Targa's reported quarterly adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter was $506 million, increasing 10% sequentially as we benefited from higher commodity prices including upside from fee floor volumes and higher volumes across our integrated Permian gathering, processing and logistics and transportation systems. Year-to-date 2021 Targa has generated adjusted free cash flow of $893 million, which has allowed us to reduce our leverage significantly across the year. We are highly hedged for 2021 and continue to add hedges for 2022 and beyond, while still benefiting from higher prices across our unhedged equity volume exposure and prices above fee floors. For 2022, we have now hedged about 85% of natural gas, 75% of NGLs and 75% of condensate. We are continuing to hedge into price strength and have added 2022 hedges at higher weighted average hedge prices. For 2023, we are around 50% hedged across all commodities. You can find our usual hedge disclosures in our quarterly earnings supplement presentation. As Matt mentioned, we now expect to be above the top end of our full year estimated 2021 adjusted EBITDA range of $1.9 billion to $2 billion. Increasing activity levels across our Permian systems and additional visibility to 2022, we now estimate our 2021 net growth CapEx to be toward the high end of our $350 million to $450 million range as we are ordering long lead items for our next Midland Basin plan. As we think about 2022 growth capital, our expectation is that it will be higher than 2021 with continued spending largely around additional plant, well connect and compression capital on the G&P side plus additional pump station capital for Grand Prix. Our full year net maintenance CapEx estimate remains unchanged at approximately $120 million. Our balance sheet is strong with a consolidated leverage ratio of about 3.5 times and we have significant liquidity with no near-term debt maturities. We now expect to end 2021 with consolidated leverage around 3.25 times and pro forma for our $925 million DevCo repurchase in January 2022, we expect to comfortably be within our target range of 2 to 4 times. Our outperformance year-to-date and balance sheet flexibility position us to begin returning incremental capital to our shareholders. In 2021, we focused on reducing leverage. In 2022, with the strength of our balance sheet, our focus shifts to simplifying our capital structure and returning more capital to shareholders. Complemented by our plans to recommend a meaningful increase to our common dividend in early 2022, we will continue to remain opportunistic around common and preferred share repurchases, and we'll continue to invest in attractive high returning growth opportunities that leverage our integrated system. Our recommendation to increase the common dividend to $1.40 per share annualized with the culmination of a lot of comparable company and industry analysis as well as scenario analysis. We believe that at $1.40, Targa offers an attractive common dividend per share that will provide for a stable return of cash flow to our shareholders across cycles. Our initial increase of the common dividend will be effective for the fourth quarter of 2021 and we expect to maintain that dividend level through the fourth quarter of 2022. Beyond 2022, we expect to provide modest increases to our annual common dividend per share and currently expect to articulate the next change to our dividend concurrent with providing our annual guidance in February 2023. We have worked very hard to improve our balance sheet and we remain focused on preserving our strong balance sheet and maintaining consolidated leverage of 3 to 4 times over the longer term. We are continuing our dialogue with the rating agencies with a focus toward achieving investment-grade rating, which is a priority for Targa. This week, Moody's upgraded us to Ba1. So we are now one notch from investment-grade at all three agencies. Shifting to sustainability and ESG. We recently published our third annual sustainability report. And we continue to advance Targa's sustainability disclosures with the report providing a review of our performance against various environmental, social and governance topics that are important to our industry. Also, as announced a couple of days ago, we entered into agreements to source renewable electricity from Concho Valley Solar to provide power to our G&P infrastructure in the Permian Basin. We continue to review and pursue other economic opportunities to advance our sustainability objectives that complement our core competencies and infrastructure footprint. In closing, we are so very proud of our Targa team. Our employees have continued to perform exceptionally well for our customers and have done so with a continued focus on safety, and we are very thankful for their efforts. And with that, I will turn the call back over to Sanjay. Good morning, Jeremy. I'd say, Jeremy, clearly the near-term priority is now we're in excellent position to take out the DevCos in January and leverage will move a little bit higher when we do that, but then we expect to leverage to come down thereafter as we benefit from increasing EBITDA, not only in company's assets. but from the rest of the business. And that's what's really going to drive a lot of the flexibility that we see us having in 2022 that will allow us to return capital to our shareholders in a variety of ways. The simplification is still an important part of this for us though, and that starts with the DevCo and then also taking out the preferred. And that's what we'll largely be focused on in 2022. But again, I think we now have the flexibility to think about a go forward where we've got increasing EBITDA, which allows us to return more capital through both increasing dividends and potentially decreasing share count. And that's what we'll be focused on as we go forward through time, assuming a continued strong balance sheet. Thanks, Jeremy. Shneur, this is Jen. I think similar to a lot of our peers, we have escalators across our contracts both in G&P and also in Logistics and Transportation. So we would expect going forward that we're in that beneficiary of inflation. And so that's part of what would be a potential tailwind for us next year and then the go forward after that. Thank you. Mark, this is Jen. I think that we are in an excellent dialogue with the rating agencies. I think from our perspective, we already have strong investment-grade metrics. And so have spent a lot of time with the agencies to make sure that they understand what our short, medium and long-term strategies are and really get comfortable with the direction that we're headed in. And I think with the recent upgrades from S&P and now Moody's, they're recognizing the progress that we've continued to make. And then Fitch with their initial rating, I think spent a lot of time with us to understand where we are and what the vision was going forward. So I think we're in a good position with all three. What has been articulated to us is that the DevCo repurchase in their minds is an important step for us in our simplification. So we'll do that in January of 2022. Leverage will move a little bit higher just as a result of where leverage is now and where we expect it to be at year end and then we'd expect it to come down thereafter. So I think we're really well positioned. And our hope is that it will be a 2022 event that we become investment-grade. And then obviously, we don't control the timing of that, but we'll continue to be in dialogue with the agencies to figure out what the appropriate timing is for us. And then related to the second part of your question, can you just remind me what that was? I think, hopefully, what you've heard from us this morning is that we're really excited about where we're positioned today and the flexibility that that affords us going forward. We focused on reducing leverage this year. And you've heard already that in our minds there is a shift in 2022 where we're able to return more capital to our shareholders. And to the extent we are able to continue to manage leverage where it is and where we expect it to go, I think that increases our flexibility to do a lot of different things that will improve the return of capital to our shareholders and increase the value of Targa as we move through time. Thanks, Mark. Our long-term target is 3x to 4x, Colton, and that's not something that I would expect that we'll be updating. We're very comfortable within the 3x to 4x range. That doesn't mean that we couldn't have quarters or quarters where we're lower or even higher than that. I think we're very comfortable existing anywhere around that zip code. To the extent we're in the lower end or even below, that gives us more flexibility. So we'll just be continuing to manage our balance sheet as we go through time. But again, very comfortable within the 3x to 4x range and that's really over the long-term where we expect to manage the business. The base plan that we have right now is that we'll ratably take it out beginning really in the second quarter after it steps down to 105, and that will continue until, call it, the end of 2023 when it will be fully redeemed at that point in time. But to the extent that we want to take some out sooner, we obviously have that flexibility. So that's a lever that we'll be able to pull as we move through 2022 just depending on the performance of the business and the outlook for the business. Thank you. Doug, this is Jen. When we think about 2022, there is still a little bit for us to continue to work through related to the corporate simplification, right? So primary use of free cash flow in 2022 will be the DevCo repurchase. As we think about beyond that, I think we'll wait to articulate more about our plans. We tried to give a reference point that said that setting the dividend at $1.40 for the fourth quarter we were looking at how much of 2021 free cash flow that represented and are very comfortable with the dividend that approximates to call it 30% of this year's free cash flow. But as we move through time, that could change. And so I'd say that that's something that we will continue to evaluate. We have said that we think that we will be in position to return more capital to shareholders as we move through time. And so how much free cash flow that means we are comfortable paying out on any given year will be dependent on our performance for that year and then our expectations for the go forward as well. Thank you. I mean, clearly, we're not giving specific numbers on exactly what our expectation is right now for full year adjusted EBITDA. I think we do have a pretty good outlook for the fourth quarter. And now that we're a month into the fourth quarter, feel good about it. But ultimately, we'll have to see how the next couple of months shake out and how we finish up the year. But yes, I mean, prices are strong, fundamentals are strong. We do expect increasing volumes really across the business this quarter so to the extent that those materialize. I think it should end up being a pretty good quarter for Targa and that will drive a very nice 2021 overall adjusted EBITDA year for the company. We've characterized it as opportunistic, Chase. So it's really going to depend on what's happening in a given quarter and what's our outlook for the year, what's our outlook beyond that. And so we'll look under \u2013 we'll look at that decision under a number of different frameworks. But I think hopefully what you're hearing from us is that with the balance sheet flexibility we now feel that we have, it certainly can be part of how we're going to return capital to shareholders. But we're not going to provide clarity under the frameworks under which we will or will not participate in the market. I think from our perspective, everything always has to be on the table. We've clearly articulated that as we think about our priorities for 2021. It was managing our leverage lower. And then for 2022, it's really continuing corporate simplification with the DevCo and the preferred, while also being able to return more capital to shareholders, which I think initially we're talking about in terms of paying a higher base common dividend and then also potentially being able to engage in some opportunistic repurchases. But everything is always on the table, and that's what we work through with our Board each and every quarter to make decisions. From our perspective, that's not something that makes sense for us today, but that doesn't mean that that couldn't change in the future. Thank you. Thanks, Sunil."

            "name": "Bobby Muraro",
            "content": "Yes. I think the way we think about it, this is Bobby, as we look at all these projects that either fit our capital profile or third-party capital profile. So to the extent we can go to low carbon projects that supply power to our assets or carbon capture or something else that we're willing to fund on our balance sheet or someone else is willing to fund on their balance sheet, we will look to do those projects. I think this is the first example of one where there were someone that was willing to build a solar project that fit within the parameters we want to do from a low carbon standpoint and their return parameters. It probably didn't hit our return parameters, which is why you won't see us put money in the projects like that. But to the extent we start to fund ones that do, that will be part of the evaluation going forward. I wouldn't set a standard to what we would or wouldn't do, but that's kind of how the analysis goes internally. Thanks, Sunil."

            "content": "Hey, John. Yes, as it relates to the third quarter, first of all, we performed on our term-related contracts as it relates to that working with all of our term customers. But we opted to do the maintenance at our facility during the quarter. And really doing that against the backdrop of the fact that there was a softer market globally and the result of really less arb opportunity. So we foregoed, if you will, the opportunity to sell some additional spot cargos across our dock. That teases up very well as we move into the fourth quarter domestically. Prices have kind of stabilized here. We've seen increases in the arb and the opportunities across the market to the Far East and other areas. So I think it puts us in good position obviously to perform very well in the fourth quarter, not only for our term-related contracts, but taking advantage of the opportunity to move additional spots across the dock. So I think we're in good position there."

            "name": "Matt Meloy",
            "content": "Thanks, Sanjay, and good morning to everyone. This is a very exciting time at Targa, as highlighted by our earnings release this morning. Operationally, we continue to perform well and now expect to exceed all our volume guidance expectations for the year. Financially, our balance sheet is as strong as it's ever been, with our leverage in the midpoint of our target range and expectations for it to continue to trend lower. Strategically, several of our key areas of focus over the last several years are driving the strength of our results and are positioning looking forward; fully integrating our NGL business from wellhead to water, moving to a G&P contract structure that allows us to protect downside while continuing to participate from strong commodity prices and managing capital spending to focus on projects that leverage our integrated NGL platform and drive higher returns. The culmination of the successful execution of the Targa strategy gives me confidence to say that we are now where we want to be from a strategic and financial standpoint. Over the years, we invested outsized capital relative to the size of our company to fully integrate our business and create a best-in-class midstream footprint for our customers. These capital investments stretched our balance sheet more than we would have liked, but we believe those decisions would position us to generate significant long-term shareholder value, and we are now in a position where we are seeing the benefits of those previous strategic investments. We are also now in a position to unwind some of the structured financings that we utilized to finance our growth, and we will be able to do so while maintaining our leverage comfortably in our target range. Our EBITDA, free cash flow and balance sheet are as strong as they have ever been. And we now expect to exceed the top end of our adjusted EBITDA guidance for 2021 and see continued growth thereafter underpinned by attractive organic growth opportunities that are integrated high return projects. All of this puts us in position to return additional capital to our shareholders. We plan to recommend to our board $1.40 per common share annual dividend or $0.35 per quarter effective for the fourth quarter of this year and payable in February 2022. This equates to approximately 30% of our 2021 free cash flow and provides a yield competitive to members in the S&P 400 and S&P 500. We would expect to be able to increase the dividend, a modest amount, going forward on an annual basis. This level of common dividend returns additional capital to shareholders while providing us significant financial flexibility across cycles. For 2022, our current expectation is to direct free cash flow after dividends toward the repurchase of our DevCo joint venture interest. While continuing to closely manage our balance sheet, we believe we will have the flexibility to redeem preferred stock and opportunistically repurchase common shares under the $500 million share repurchase program. Before I move to discuss our operational performance, I want to acknowledge the continued outstanding efforts of our Targa employees. Throughout pandemic, hurricanes, storms and other issues, our employees have performed exceptionally well and we are so proud of their efforts. Let us now turn to our operational performance and business outlook. Starting in the Permian, third quarter system inlet volumes increased 7% sequentially, and we now expect our average 2021 Permian inlet to exceed the top end of our previously disclosed 5% to 10% growth range over 2020. In Permian Midland, our new 200 million cubic feet per day Heim Plant, which began full operations in early September, is currently running near full, and our next 250 million cubic feet per day Legacy Plant remains on track to begin operations during the fourth quarter of 2022. With robust activity levels expected to continue into next year and beyond, we are evaluating the timing of our next Midland Plant after Legacy and are now ordering long lead items. In Permian Delaware, completions and activity levels continue to ramp and we currently have adequate processing capacity to accommodate our anticipated near to medium term growth. The stronger outlook across our Permian Basin footprint will continue to drive incremental volumes through our NGL downstream business. And in our Central region, we are seeing an uptick in activity levels given the higher commodity price environment and remained optimistic around higher production, offsetting Legacy decline on many of our systems. Shifting to our Logistics and Transportation segment, Grand Prix volumes continue to increase and we transported a record 417,000 barrels per day to Mont Belvieu during the third quarter. Throughput volumes on Grand Prix sequentially increased 6% driven by increasing NGL production from Targa's Permian plant, including our new Heim Plant and third-parties. We also achieved record fractionation volumes at our Mont Belvieu complex averaging about 662,000 barrels per day during the third quarter, representing a 3% sequential increase. Our LPG Export Services business, third quarter volumes averaged 9 million barrels per month. Lower sequential volumes were attributable to general maintenance we chose to complete at our Galena Park export facility during the quarter, while it was an overall weaker global LPG market. The last couple of years have presented a number of challenges and we think that we have demonstrated the ability for Targa to perform exceptionally well across volatile markets with record 2020 adjusted EBITDA and expectation for a record 2021 adjusted EBITDA and current expectations for record 2022 adjusted EBITDA. So I will finish with another thank you to all of our employees. And with that, I will now turn the call over to Jen. Hey, good morning, Jeremy. Yes. Hey, Jeremy. I'd say, it really is probably more of the same from us for our larger E&Ps and larger publics and integrated. They are really sticking more or less with what they have told us. They have some ranges in their forecast they give us, but more or less are kind of sticking to the plans that they have. And we are still seeing a lot of the uptick in activity from the smaller and private guys really across our systems. I don't see a big change happening there. And then in terms of adding processing plants, last call we talked about adding the Legacy Plant, we just had Heim Plant come online, and we're ordering long lead times now for the next plant in the Permian Midland. So as we're really working through our, I'd say, capital budgeting and planning for 2022, we're ordering long lead times so we can be ready. We're not sure exactly when we think we'll need the next plant after Legacy, so we're still kind of in that evaluation phase, but we want to be ready in there for customers when it comes in. So I guess, stay tuned. When we think that next plant will come in, we would likely announce more specifics around timing on the next earnings call. Sure. I'll start and then I'll hand it over to Jen to provide some more details there. As we look through the strength of this year, we saw our volumes and just overall business performance going very well with some commodity price tailwinds. As we kind of looked through \u2013 even our outlook continuing to be very strong. I think we found ourselves in a position in the midpoint of our leverage range where we said, we're here, we don't necessarily need to wait till next quarter to be more specific around returning capital to shareholders. And so that really is kind of signaling a bit of a shift from debt repayment, which is what we've been focused on. We're now in the middle of our leverage range and forecasting to get toward the lower end of it by year end to now wanting to return capital to shareholders. So the first step in that was moving the dividend to a more reasonable level. We looked at our S&P 400 and 500. We looked at our peers across the space and felt that that was an appropriate amount which allowed us to grow while providing financial flexibility. And that financial flexibility does give us the opportunity to continue to return capital to shareholders through simplifying repurchasing the preferred and opportunistic share repurchases. So we felt like that was kind of a good start along the way. Jen, any other color just how you think about opportunistic? Yeah, sure. So Pat McDonie, our President of G&P elaborate there. Okay, thanks. Yes. So you are correct in that our fee floors were put in place to protect the downside. And right now, our average NGL is around $1.06 and gas prices are much higher than they were last year. So we are above the fee floors on our POP contract. So the way those generally work is they're still POP contracts, percentage-of-proceeds, just has a fee floor in them. So as prices will continue to move up, it will look like a regular POP contract. Okay. Thank you. Okay. Thank you. Yes. No, really I think as we look for 2022 CapEx, it's really more related to our \u2013 this increase in activity out in the Permian. We're looking to exceed our guidance on volumes for this year, ordering long lead times, it looks like we're going to have more plant capital as you get into 2022, and then also, it's just more volumes, more gathering compression pipelines and the like. So I'd say it's more related to that. We are seeing some higher costs for steel and other things. The team has done a really good job for whether it's Legacy or even this next plant we're kind of getting in the Q4 are trying to manage that as best we can. There will be some pressures on that, but I'd say it's primarily related to more activity than just inflation. Sure. Scott Pryor can handle that one. Okay. Thanks, John. Yes, sure. Right now, I would agree with that assessment that the T&F market is very competitive. There is excess capacity. And so new deals that are coming, it's very competitive, and there's a lot of competition to get the marginal barrel there. I'd say the good thing for Targa is we have, we are underpinned by either long-term contracts if it's a T&F agreement. We have long-terms, a lot of them are 10-plus years, our longer term T&F contracts. And then in our Gathering and Processing business, we have long-term contracts on the G&P side. So most of the volumes that are coming and most of the volumes that are underpinning our growth are already contracted for multiple years to come. So I'd say, while we are in that same market, we're still very well positioned for the next several years because of our contract structure. Okay, thanks. Sure. Yes, with the proposed additional regulations from the EPA, I'd say, as we look through those, we're in overall agreement with what they're trying to do, and that's trying to keep methane in the facilities, which makes sense. We're already operating with best practices in a lot of these areas. So the recommendations they are putting forth we're already doing in a lot of the areas, and we've been retrofitting and making changes for years doing this. So this may perhaps speed that along some work that we're already doing. We're already looking and trying to find leaks along our pipelines and facilities. As outlined in our ESG report, we're hiring third-parties to fly, kind of going above and beyond and flying our facilities looking for leaks and fixing them. So overall, this is things we've already done. It puts some more parameters in place, which we'll have to follow. But I don't see that as being an issue for us, it's things we were already doing. And then an opportunity, I'd say, as we provide really good service to our customers and can have good metrics there, yes, I think there is some potential opportunity as we kind of become leading in this and continue to perform very well. That could be beneficial for some of the larger E&Ps who are focused on our overall performance there. Okay. Thanks, Mike. Okay. Thank you. Yeah, sure. Good morning. I think for us, it's really been \u2013 it's really going to be more of the same. I think we're going to continue to have a high hurdle for us. We have a really good organic growth projects outlook to continue to grow that. So we're not in a position of need where we feel like we have to go get something to complete our integrated story or that we are really falling short in any area. So we'll continue to look at assets. We have looked over the last several years. If there is something that's complementary to our existing assets and it fits well on the G&P side and it has liquid synergies, so it's a good G&P business with some liquids, we will look at that as we've continued to look at it, but we also want to make sure if we do anything there, we're staying within our 3x to 4x target leverage. So it's kind of got to be just right for us. So we haven't really found anything that's fit that, but we'll continue to look. But it continues to be a high bar because we have \u2013 we think we're going to able to grow our EBITDA just through organic growth. Yeah. So we have talked quite a bit about the opportunities in terms of investments and how we're thinking about purchasing power. So I'm excited to be able to announce supporting that power project. Robert Muraro has been working with the team to try to evaluate other opportunities whether it would be additional renewables or carbon capture. Bobby, you just want to talk a little bit about some opportunities? Okay. Thank you."

And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Matt. \nMatt Meloy: Thanks, Sanjay, and good morning everyone. We're excited to announce another great quarter at Targa, as our overall business continued to perform well, led by our position in the Permian Basin and our integrated NGL business. As we continue to execute on our key strategic priorities, we are very pleased with our positioning. Taking into consideration, our first half performance and the strength in our business outlook for the second half of this year coupled with stronger commodity price fundamentals, we are increasing our estimated 2021 EBITDA to be between $1.9 billion and $2 billion. 2021 EBITDA is now estimated to be 19% higher than last year based on the midpoint of our new guidance range. Our prioritization of free cash flow for debt reductions mean we reduced our debt balance by $780 million in the first half of the year and our consolidated leverage was 3.8 times at the end of the second quarter, within our target range of three to four times, and well ahead of schedule due to our strong performance. This provides us greater flexibility and bolsters Targa's financial position. We now expect to end the year at about 3.5 times leverage with a strong balance sheet and well positioned to repurchase the DevCo interest in the first quarter of next year. We're also very proud of the efforts of our Targa employees over a difficult last year and a half. Our employees have continued to perform exceptionally well for our customers, and have done so with a continued focus on safety, and we are very thankful for their efforts. Let's now turn to our operational performance and business outlook. Starting in the Permian, second quarter system volumes rebounded quickly following the major winter storm, during the first quarter, as system inlet volumes increased 15% sequentially. We now expect our 2021 Permian inlet volumes to increase to the high end of the previously disclosed 5% to 10% growth over 2020. Our Permian Midland system ran above nameplate capacity for much of the second quarter, and we're pleased to announce our new 200 million cubic feet per day Heim Plant is mechanically complete and expected to begin full operations in early September. A special thanks to our operations and engineering teams for safely bringing online Heim, well over a month ahead of schedule and under -. We expect Heim to commence operations highly utilized. And given our outlook for continued production growth we announced this morning our plans to move forward with the construction of our new 250 million cubic feet per day Legacy Plant, which is expected to begin operations during the fourth quarter of 2022. Even with the addition of Legacy there is no change to our 2021 net growth capital spending estimate of between $350 million to $450 million. Our current year spend on Legacy is estimated to be about $70 million. In Permian Delaware, completions and activity levels have continued to ramp and we currently have adequate processing capacity to accommodate our anticipated near to medium-term growth. The stronger outlook across our Permian Basin footprint coupled with our new plant announcement will continue to drive incremental volumes through our downstream businesses. Moving on to the Badlands, we saw sequential increases to our gas and crude volumes during the second quarter. Producers are completing wells and we continue to have positive producer dialogue. Turning to our Central region, gas inlet volumes during the second quarter also rebounded from the winter storm and increased 8% sequentially. While the system continues to largely be in decline we are currently seeing a modest uptick in completions and activity, which could mitigate some of the decline. Shifting to our Logistics and Transportation segment, overall system volumes during the second quarter meaningfully rebounded from the effects of prior quarter's major winter storms. Our Grand Prix pipeline continues to perform very well with total deliveries in the Mont Belvieu increasing 14% sequentially. During the second quarter, we transported a record 392,000 barrels per day and we expect volumes to ramp through the balance of the year. We also achieved record fractionation volumes at our Mont Belvieu complex, averaging about 644,000 barrels per day during the second quarter, representing an 18% sequential increase. In our LPG export services business at Galena Park, second quarter volumes sequentially increased 20%, averaging 10.3 million barrels per month. While we remain highly contracted, the current higher NGL prices are causing reduced short-term demand for spot opportunities. However, overall the long-term fundamentals remain strong for LPG exports and the current strength in propane prices is still a net positive for Targa. Looking ahead, with our leverage already in the target range and on track to be even lower by year-end, we expect to be in a position to return incremental capital to our shareholders in 2022 after repurchasing the DevCo joint venture interest. We have the ability to return capital to shareholders in a number of different ways, through additional dividend, share repurchases, repayment of preferred equity, and/or continuing to reduce debt. We are currently evaluating along with our Board the best way to deliver value to shareholders while maintaining our long-term financial flexibility. We will prioritize a strong balance sheet that keeps Targa and strong financial position across downside scenarios. We expect to articulate more details in February with our 2022 outlook and capital plan for the year. Targa continues to benefit from the strength of our business and our talented employees and we remain very well positioned for the long-term. With that, I will now turn the call over to Jen.\nJen Kneale: Thanks, Matt. Targa's adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter was $460 million as second quarter volumes across our integrated Permian Gathering and Processing and Logistics and Transportation systems, meaningfully rebounded from the effects of the winter storm experienced during the first quarter. Second quarter EBITDA was sequentially lower predominantly due to the storm-related benefits and seasonal opportunities in our marketing businesses realized during the first quarter and from higher OpEx from additional volumes moving through our systems and higher G&A. Through the first half of 2020 -- sorry, through the first half of 2021, Targa has generated free cash flow of $593 million versus $171 million over the same time period in 2020, and significantly hedged for 2021 and continue to add hedges for this year and beyond while still benefiting from higher prices across our unhedged equity volume exposure and prices above fee floors. You can find our usual hedge disclosures in our quarterly earnings supplement presentation. As Matt mentioned, we are increasing our full year estimated 2021 adjusted EBITDA to be between $1.9 billion to $2 billion. Our updated financial estimates assume full year 2021 WTI crude oil, prices average $65 per barrel, NGL prices average $0.70 per gallon and Henry Hub and Waha natural gas prices average $3.20 and $3.10 per MMBtu. The biggest drivers of our continued performance relative to previous expectations for 2021 are commodity prices, particularly as we benefit from prices above these floors, also higher volumes and continued cost management relative to expectations. Inclusive of expected spending this year for the newly announced Legacy Plant our 2021 net growth CapEx estimate remains unchanged at between $350 million and $450 million and we now estimate net maintenance CapEx to be lower at approximately $120 million. Our continued strong performance means we expect to end 2021 with consolidated leverage around 3.5x. This puts us in excellent position to repurchase our DevCo interest in the first quarter of 2022 while still maintaining consolidated leverage within our target of three to 4x. Looking forward we believe that existing in the lower half of our target consolidated leverage ratio range provides for more flexibility which is why we are continuing to prioritize free cash flow for debt reduction particularly in advance of our DevCo repurchase. As we look forward our balance sheet is well positioned. We have an excellent liquidity position with no near-term debt maturities. Also in early June Fitch issued their inaugural ratings for Targa and assigned us with a BB+ rating. We really appreciate the amount of work that the Fitch team invested to provide that initial rating. We are now rated by the three leading agencies and are continuing our dialogue with each related to our trajectory towards investment grade which remains a priority for Targa. Shifting to our focus around sustainability and ESG we continue to advance our efforts and internal initiatives in this area and we plan to publish our next sustainability report in the fall. In closing on behalf of all management we say thank you to our talented Targa team for all that they do. And with that I will turn the call back over to Sanjay. \nSanjay Lad: Thanks Jen. [Operator Instructions] Victor will you please open the lines for Q&A? \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Shneur Gershuni from UBS. You may begin.\nShneur Gershuni: Hi good morning everyone. Maybe to start off a little bit just wanted to chat about your guidance. Obviously it was taken up today and you sort of cited the fact that you expect to be at the higher end of the volume -- or volume growth range. Just kind of curious there's been a lot of discussion around increased activity specifically in the Delaware. Curious if that's around your assets and that's what's driving the guidance increase? Or is there a potential that if this activity in the Delaware continues to increase that we could actually see an even higher exit rate for Targa, when you close out the year? Just kind of curious what was baked in. \nMatt Meloy: Sure. Good morning Shneur. Yes. We are seeing stronger volumes. We pointed at the high end of our range. I'd say it's -- in both the Midland and the Delaware we are seeing I'd say higher activity. But it's really the dynamic we talked about last call, I'd say is still for the most part there which is the larger producers are really staying within what they told us. But the smaller and some of the private guys we are seeing ramp up more. We've seen a steady increase in the rig count but not a huge spike up. So I think we're just seeing just continued strong activity across the board for our producers. Pat is there anything else you'd want to add to that or? \nPat McDonie: I'd just say that we're seeing activity in both basins. Obviously the Legacy Plant announcement. We're seeing continued strong growth on the Midland side of the basin. We have seen more activity in the Delaware Basin but delineated just as Matt described. The big guys staying kind of on the programs and more little guy activity. So both sides are growing. \nShneur Gershuni: Cool. Definitely appreciate the color there. And then maybe to follow up in terms of the whole simplification approach. Meaning you've been pretty consistent in saying that this is really a '22 event. I think in your prepared remarks today you talked about DevCo probably happening in 1Q. I imagine you have to give notice and you'll let us know that ahead of time. And if I remember correctly your pref steps down in March as well too which is another component to that. But at the same time, you're kind of in this interesting position today where you can actually write that you're going to be 3.5x leverage by the end of this year. Does that increase your flexibility to be a little bit more opportunistic around buybacks? Or right now everything is parked to take out the DevCo and maybe work on the pref later in next year? \nMatt Meloy: Yes. I'll start, Jen and then if you want to add in. We did say we are targeting 3.5 through year end. And that does assume that we're prioritizing our free cash flow to go towards debt reduction. That is our base case plan is to get there and that just puts us in a good position to be able to take out the DevCo in the first part of next year. We do have a share buyback authorized. But what you've seen us do this year for the first part is prioritize that free cash flow towards debt reduction. That's my expectation that we'll continue to do that. We're still having the ability to do share repurchases. And then we're taking a hard look at that with our Board and we'll kind of lay out what the 2022 capital plan is in February for our free cash flow. \nJen Kneale: All, I'll add Shneur is that I think the flexibility of our outperformance -- the flexibility as a result of our outperformance this year positions us really nicely to be able to take out to DevCos in the first quarter and still have our leverage within that long-term target range which is great. And then as we think about the pref we've got a lot of optionality there. It steps down to 105% in mid-March, but that's something that we also could look at taking out ratably over a number of quarters in order to maintain that balance sheet flexibility that we've worked so hard to get. \nShneur Gershuni: Great. So it sounds like a lot of flexibility here and the outperformance in guidance increase -- sort of positions you to have a lot of options. Is that kind of the takeaway guide? \nJen Kneale: That's right. \nMat Meloy: Yes, that's right. \nShneur Gershuni: Perfect. Thank you very much. Really appreciate the color, today.\nMat Meloy: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of John Mackay from Goldman Sachs. You may begin.\nJohn Mackay: Hi everyone. Good morning. Thanks for the time. Maybe for a first one I'll just circle back on Shneur's first question on Permian volumes. So I'm thinking if we look at where you guys sit right now you're kind of at the top end of the range or close for the growth guidance even if you're kind of flat for the next couple of quarters. Just curious to balance that against your comments of activity overall picking up. And whether or not that's just some conservatism or you see anything else going on? \nMatt Meloy: Yes, sure. We typically see especially on the Midland side a lot of growth as we get into second quarter and into the third quarter. So some of it is seasonal. We see a lot of activity. We see that continuing. And sometimes it feels like the activity is more ratable, but the volumes tend to grow more in the second and third quarter. And we are seeing that this year I think which is part of that. So while we do expect some growth as we kind of continue through the back half of the year and into 2022 it may not be at the same rate that we kind of experienced in the last few months. Pat anything? \nPat McDonie: No, I agree. We're lumpy in that second third quarter but we do expect growth through the end of the year probably not as lumpy as what we've seen over the last six months. \nJohn Mackay: Okay. That's fair. Thank you. And then just on CapEx. The first half was lower than we expected. Looks like the Heim Plant is coming in sooner than expected. You guys reduced the maintenance guidance, but not the growth guidance. I'm just curious on kind of what else is kind of filling out that second half of the year spending. And is that because of more activity we're seeing more well connects and that can kind of give us a read on 2022? Or anything else going on in there? \nJen Kneale: I think the biggest piece John is the announcement of the Legacy Plant. So as Matt mentioned in his scripted remarks that moves essentially $70 million of spending into this year that we otherwise -- we're probably likely going to spend this year. And so when you think about where we are year-to-date we've spent call it around $150 million and then we now have that additional $70 million. So the remainder of our expected spending is for additional gathering and lines and compression to support the continued growth of our gathering and processing footprint and then some small downstream projects that are consistent with what we've been forecasting previously. \nJohn Mackay: Okay. Thanks. I guess just to clarify that. So the Legacy Plant -- that is still the same one you guys were, I guess, evaluating last quarter and now it's just kind of formally in the  budget. Is that the right way to think about it? \nMatt Meloy: Sure.\nJen Kneale: That's right. It's formally Board-approved now and the spending has begun on it.\nJohn Mackay: Okay. All right. Thanks for the time. Appreciate it.\nMatt Meloy: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Michael Blum from Wells Fargo. You may begin.\nMichael Blum: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. I wanted to just clarify just looking at sequentially that the marketing margins were down. Is that just due to the absence of every [ph] opportunities, or is there something else going on with NGL marketing that -- I just want to make sure I understood that.\nJen Kneale: It's really two pieces Michael. And we talked a little bit about this on our first quarter earnings call that was in the first quarter. On the marketing side, we benefited from both the winter storm and then there were also some benefits from contango opportunities that we entered into in the sort of early in the second quarter and late in the first quarter of 2020.\nMichael Blum: Got it. And then I wanted to ask about LPG exports. You mentioned perhaps some fewer spot opportunities. But in light of just how high propane prices are, do you think in the second half of the year, you're going to see actual cargo cancellations? It just seems like something's got to give. \nScott Pryor: Yeah, Michael, this is Scott. I would first point to the fact that our export performance was strong in the second quarter, a nice recovery from what we saw in the first quarter, which was impacted by the February winter storm. Certainly as you pointed to of late and really throughout this year the increased price on both propane and butane here in the US versus global pricing has impacted some opportunities for spot. So I think when you look at it the international market is choosing at times to look at other places as opposed to US Gulf Coast for exports. And at times quite frankly, Targa may choose to not participate at certain pricing levels. So as a result of that, I think spot opportunities may be impacted. As Matt pointed out though higher prices here on propane in the US help us in other areas of our integrated platform, so we benefit from that. We have not experienced any cancellations to this point. But again the fundamentals with inventories here in the US about 20 million barrels behind this time last year that supports propane prices, which could have an impact on spot opportunities. We're well contracted. And should we see cancellations, obviously, we collect the cancellation fee as a result of that.\nMichael Blum: Understood. Thank you.\nScott Pryor: Okay. Thanks Michael.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Jeremy Tonet from JPMorgan. You may begin.\nJeremy Tonet: Hi, good morning.\nMatt Meloy: Jeremy, good morning.\nJeremy Tonet: Just wanted to start off on the credit side here and we get to similar numbers. You guys being around 3.5 times levered at the end of the year, delevering rapidly into next year, two billion being a quite notable size and scale. I'm just curious why the agencies I guess haven't been moving a bit quicker towards IAG here. I mean, it seems like you check all the boxes those metrics that leverage is actually better than all the other C-corp peers. So am I missing something here, or is there something else for the agencies? \nJen Kneale: I think with respect to -- we're in a consistent dialogue with the agencies and we certainly I think share your view Jeremy. I think part of what they're looking for is just continued sustainable performance and delivering on what we said we were going to do related to our deleveraging, related to our continued discipline around CapEx spending and the like. So I believe that we already have incredibly strong metrics. And I'm really proud of the organization for getting us in the position that we're in where we could end this year with leverage around 3.5 times. Certainly agree with you and I hope that the rating agencies similarly will continue to assess our strong performance thus far this year and really over the last 18 months and will start to take positive credit actions. All we can do is continue to stay in front of them. And I think that we have an excellent dialogue with all three agencies and appreciate the amount of time that they've been willing to spend with us over the last 18 months too. So I do feel like it's just a matter of time.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. Yeah. I just wanted to make sure they knew you had the lowest leverage of all C-corp peers because that kind of stood out to us. But maybe moving on here to carbon capture. It seems from the maps that we can tell. Some of your processing plants in the Permian are, kind of, a stones throw away from some CO2 plants. So I'm just, kind of, wondering is that something you see in the near future? If there's all this, kind of, ESG green PE money out there. Is there any reason not to invite them into a JV where they put up the capital, you guys put in the assets and get something going together there that's positive ESG doesn't cost a lot for Targa?\nMatt Meloy: Yeah Jeremy, we are [Technical Difficulty]. So we're looking at carbon capture up our processing plants and evaluating what that project could look like. We are -- as we go through it, I agree with you. I don't know that there's going to be a shortage of capital is going to be the issue, just kind of getting through some of the operational where we're going to sequester it, and permitting and some other things that we're working hard on. So -- and you also said in the near-term, I think this is also -- it is going to take a while right, for us to figure if we have a viable project here or not? I'd say we're making good progress. As we kind of learn more, I'm becoming increasingly optimistic that there's a potential to do something here but it's still going to take -- it's going to take sometime.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. So hopefully if the Railroad Commission gets primacy there that things can kind of move a bit quicker but great to hear things are going in that direction. So I'll leave it there. Thank you.\nMatt Meloy: Okay. Thanks Jeremy.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Tristan Richardson from Truist Securities. You may begin.\nTristan Richardson: Hey good morning guys. I appreciate all the comments. Just a follow-up to an earlier question on capital in 2022, obviously you guys make very clear priorities in 2022 around leverage and DevCo consolidation and cost of capital management. But just thinking, if we've got a very short list of identified projects and really only half of the Legacy Plant spend in 2022, even on the back of increased completion activity should we think capital could come in further next year than even kind of where you've talked about where the guidance is today for 2021?\nJen Kneale: Tristan, this is Jen. I think ultimately it will depend on activity levels. We're certainly continuing to see good growth around our systems particularly on both, the Midland side and also the Delaware side in the Permian. So we certainly expect continued spending on gathering lines compression et cetera. Plus we'll have the remaining spending of the Legacy Plant and then we'll be, having to likely think about the right timing for the next plant in the Midland Basin just depending on how forecast flows. So I think right now we're not in a position to give 2022 CapEx, but I think that my expectation was the -- would be that it would be more similar to this year versus we'd see a material drop-off year-over-year.\nTristan Richardson: That's helpful. And then, just secondly, just curious thoughts on sort of hedging philosophy in 2022, I mean I think this time a year ago the world was very different and you guys were very intentional on taking out equity links just taking it out of the question for 2021. But just thinking in somewhat more normal world thoughts on equity links particularly against the past several years of VL's big shift to a much more fee-based model?\nMatt Meloy: Yeah. As far as our hedging goes I mean, we are going to want to stay -- we call it programmatic hedging, our target is 75% year one, 50% year two and then 25% year three. I see us continuing to execute kind of along that programmatic amount and be somewhere around those ranges. But you're right with our leverage lower and with more fee-based we would have some opportunity to even go inside of that. But I think right now, where we are is kind of sticking with that 75% 50% 25% is approach that's worked for us and something we're likely to kind of hover around for a while.\nTristan Richardson: Great. Matt, thank you.\nMatt Meloy: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Spiro Dounis from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. You may begin.\nSpiro Dounis: Hi good morning team. Two quick follow-ups from me first one on capital return and kind of tying it back to Jeremy's question around investment grade. It sounds like you guys are on a path there. It's all about execution. Just curious in your discussions with the agencies have they provided any sort of guardrails for you as you sort of formulate that plan to return capital? And then, also kind of imagine you've been getting feedback from investors as you go through this process. So curious what so far has kind of resonated with you as you formulate that plan?\nJen Kneale: I think clearly our existing investors potential investors and then the rating agencies are some of the important constituents where we have to take their points of view into consideration as we work with the Board through this fall really to then be in a position to articulate what our go-forward strategy on capital allocation will be. That again as Matt said, we expect to articulate in February Spiro. So I'd say that, it's an evolving dialogue. I'd say that, we're getting a lot of advice. And I'd say that that advice is varied as one would expect just depending on what type of investor we're talking to or certainly the rating agencies want to see more credit positive decision-making versus the alternative. So those are all very important voices and we are certainly listening to them and then providing our Board with that feedback. And that's an important part of the evolving conversation at Targa.\nSpiro Dounis: Great. Thanks a lot, Jen. Second question just on asset sales. Obviously, not in a position where you need to do anything but I know at one point you had contemplated selling some non-core assets last year. It seems like the M&A market has dramatically improved, valuations seem to be coming back assets are changing hands. Just curious where that stands and if there's any interest there?\nJen Kneale: I think you'll continue to see us be opportunistic Spiro. So to the extent that we think there's an asset or assets that make sense for somebody else to own, if they have a lower cost of capital for other reasons and that's something that we'll consider. But as you said in your opening part of the question, the great part of this is we've got a lot of flexibility and we don't need to do anything. So that means that the bar and the threshold for us willing to sell assets is higher than it certainly was before when we needed to sell assets in order to be able to finance our growth capital.\nSpiro Dounis: Got it. That\u2019s all I had. Thanks for the time, Jen.\nMatt Meloy: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Keith Stanley from Wolfe Research. \nKeith Stanley: Hi, good morning. I wanted to clarify one thing on return of capital for next year. You listed options of buybacks, dividends and buying in the preferred equity. So I guess how do you compare buying in the prefs versus the other alternatives? And you talked a little bit about maybe buying it in gradually. Is it fair to say you have a more patient tone on the pace of taking out the prefs than perhaps in past quarters? \nJen Kneale: I think from our perspective the TRC pref is a material amount of capital that we need to deploy in order to be able to redeem that. So as we look at it, it is higher cost to us at 9.5%, but we also have a lot of flexibility in terms the amount of time that we have that we want to redeem it. So I think you are hearing from us that our base case assumption right now is that there really isn't a driving reason to have to take it out in the first quarter in mid-March, when it steps down to 105%. We can maintain and even enhance our balance sheet flexibility by being a little bit more deliberate with the TRC prefs and taking it out more slowly over time. And so that's the base case assumption that we're running Keith. Of course that can evolve as we move through this year and into next year as we have more flexibility with the increasing free cash flow but that's the current assumption that we're running.\nKeith Stanley: Got it. Thanks. And second question you've talked about increased activity in the Permian. And I feel like we've heard some mixed things this earnings season on that. And the one thing I'm wondering just last year you had associated gas production meaningfully outpace oil. Are you seeing any changes in that dynamic? Or do you think gas NGL production growth from here continues to outpace the oil production growth in the Permian? \nPat McDonie: No. We see it continuing. As you described it's exactly right. And obviously, the Delaware is a little more oily than the Midland side of the basin, dependent upon where our overall volume growth could affect it a little bit but absolutely more gassy.\nKeith Stanley: Thank you.\nMatt Meloy: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Robert Mosca from Mizuho. You may begin.\nRobert Mosca: Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. One whom was already asked. But just curious one of your G&P peers in the Bakken seems to be benefiting from rising gas oil ratios and -- assets there and in the Permian. We're just curious to hear whether longer term you expect to see a similar sort of GOR trajectory in the Permian as that base matures? Or whether Permian is a bit of a different animal in terms of underlying geology? Just curious to hear your thoughts. \nMatt Meloy: Yes. I mean I think we are benefiting similarly to others as you see higher GOR go up. You have seen that help us out in the Permian and you've seen our gas performance be even a little bit better than our crude here, when you look at this quarter. So I think the higher GOR is a tailwind for us across multiple systems. \nRobert Mosca: Okay. thanks. That\u2019s all from me.\nMatt Meloy: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question will come from the line of Sunil Sibal from Seaport Global. You may begin.\nSunil Sibal: Yes. Hi. Good morning everybody. Couple of questions from me. There has been a fair bit of industry discussion on ethane recovery. I was just curious, if you could talk about some trends that you're seeing on your systems. And also kind of remind us with regard to your commercial contract with the customers, is those decisions on ethane recovery made at the Targa level or is it primarily at the customers? Especially, considering that it seems like you do have some frac capacity and also ability to expand Grand Prix. \nMatt Meloy: Sure. Yes. On ethane recovery I'd say it varies across our systems for whether producers have elections or we make the election. So it varies by contract by system. But for the most part our assets are in recovery and kind of have been in recovery. So that's how most of our assets are operating. You did see if you look -- you saw an uptick in South Texas where it was in rejection. Now it's in recovery. So you saw an NGL uplift there. But for the most part the other systems were really already in recovery. \nSunil Sibal: Okay. Then second question, was related to the margins in the logistics segment. So clearly there was a rapid downtick there. I was just curious, on the transportation and services side are you seeing any kind of movements in the rates? Or those -- that part of the business is fairly steady and most of the dynamics or the changes are on the marketing side of things? \nMatt Meloy: Yes. So most of our volumes that are going downstream business whether it's transportation or fractionation are under long-term contract. So there's not a whole lot of movement in terms of rates there for, where the volumes that are going through our assets. I think when you look at the unit margin you just look at the reported numbers what Jen talked about was we had some marketing gains in the first quarter. So we had some outperformance due to the winter storm and some marketing gains, which kind of skewed the unit margins higher. But overall just run rate business is performing well and are generally under long-term contract. \nSunil Sibal: Okay. Got it. Thank you \nMatt Meloy: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And I'm not showing any further questions in the queue at this moment. \nSanjay Lad: Well, thanks to everyone for being on the call this morning and we appreciate your interest in Targa Resources. The IR team will be available for any follow-up questions you may have. Thank you and have a great day. \nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating.

            "content": "Thanks, Matt. Targa's adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter was $460 million as second quarter volumes across our integrated Permian Gathering and Processing and Logistics and Transportation systems, meaningfully rebounded from the effects of the winter storm experienced during the first quarter. Second quarter EBITDA was sequentially lower predominantly due to the storm-related benefits and seasonal opportunities in our marketing businesses realized during the first quarter and from higher OpEx from additional volumes moving through our systems and higher G&A. Through the first half of 2020 -- sorry, through the first half of 2021, Targa has generated free cash flow of $593 million versus $171 million over the same time period in 2020, and significantly hedged for 2021 and continue to add hedges for this year and beyond while still benefiting from higher prices across our unhedged equity volume exposure and prices above fee floors. You can find our usual hedge disclosures in our quarterly earnings supplement presentation. As Matt mentioned, we are increasing our full year estimated 2021 adjusted EBITDA to be between $1.9 billion to $2 billion. Our updated financial estimates assume full year 2021 WTI crude oil, prices average $65 per barrel, NGL prices average $0.70 per gallon and Henry Hub and Waha natural gas prices average $3.20 and $3.10 per MMBtu. The biggest drivers of our continued performance relative to previous expectations for 2021 are commodity prices, particularly as we benefit from prices above these floors, also higher volumes and continued cost management relative to expectations. Inclusive of expected spending this year for the newly announced Legacy Plant our 2021 net growth CapEx estimate remains unchanged at between $350 million and $450 million and we now estimate net maintenance CapEx to be lower at approximately $120 million. Our continued strong performance means we expect to end 2021 with consolidated leverage around 3.5x. This puts us in excellent position to repurchase our DevCo interest in the first quarter of 2022 while still maintaining consolidated leverage within our target of three to 4x. Looking forward we believe that existing in the lower half of our target consolidated leverage ratio range provides for more flexibility which is why we are continuing to prioritize free cash flow for debt reduction particularly in advance of our DevCo repurchase. As we look forward our balance sheet is well positioned. We have an excellent liquidity position with no near-term debt maturities. Also in early June Fitch issued their inaugural ratings for Targa and assigned us with a BB+ rating. We really appreciate the amount of work that the Fitch team invested to provide that initial rating. We are now rated by the three leading agencies and are continuing our dialogue with each related to our trajectory towards investment grade which remains a priority for Targa. Shifting to our focus around sustainability and ESG we continue to advance our efforts and internal initiatives in this area and we plan to publish our next sustainability report in the fall. In closing on behalf of all management we say thank you to our talented Targa team for all that they do. And with that I will turn the call back over to Sanjay. All, I'll add Shneur is that I think the flexibility of our outperformance -- the flexibility as a result of our outperformance this year positions us really nicely to be able to take out to DevCos in the first quarter and still have our leverage within that long-term target range which is great. And then as we think about the pref we've got a lot of optionality there. It steps down to 105% in mid-March, but that's something that we also could look at taking out ratably over a number of quarters in order to maintain that balance sheet flexibility that we've worked so hard to get. That's right. I think the biggest piece John is the announcement of the Legacy Plant. So as Matt mentioned in his scripted remarks that moves essentially $70 million of spending into this year that we otherwise -- we're probably likely going to spend this year. And so when you think about where we are year-to-date we've spent call it around $150 million and then we now have that additional $70 million. So the remainder of our expected spending is for additional gathering and lines and compression to support the continued growth of our gathering and processing footprint and then some small downstream projects that are consistent with what we've been forecasting previously. That's right. It's formally Board-approved now and the spending has begun on it. It's really two pieces Michael. And we talked a little bit about this on our first quarter earnings call that was in the first quarter. On the marketing side, we benefited from both the winter storm and then there were also some benefits from contango opportunities that we entered into in the sort of early in the second quarter and late in the first quarter of 2020. I think with respect to -- we're in a consistent dialogue with the agencies and we certainly I think share your view Jeremy. I think part of what they're looking for is just continued sustainable performance and delivering on what we said we were going to do related to our deleveraging, related to our continued discipline around CapEx spending and the like. So I believe that we already have incredibly strong metrics. And I'm really proud of the organization for getting us in the position that we're in where we could end this year with leverage around 3.5 times. Certainly agree with you and I hope that the rating agencies similarly will continue to assess our strong performance thus far this year and really over the last 18 months and will start to take positive credit actions. All we can do is continue to stay in front of them. And I think that we have an excellent dialogue with all three agencies and appreciate the amount of time that they've been willing to spend with us over the last 18 months too. So I do feel like it's just a matter of time. Tristan, this is Jen. I think ultimately it will depend on activity levels. We're certainly continuing to see good growth around our systems particularly on both, the Midland side and also the Delaware side in the Permian. So we certainly expect continued spending on gathering lines compression et cetera. Plus we'll have the remaining spending of the Legacy Plant and then we'll be, having to likely think about the right timing for the next plant in the Midland Basin just depending on how forecast flows. So I think right now we're not in a position to give 2022 CapEx, but I think that my expectation was the -- would be that it would be more similar to this year versus we'd see a material drop-off year-over-year. I think clearly our existing investors potential investors and then the rating agencies are some of the important constituents where we have to take their points of view into consideration as we work with the Board through this fall really to then be in a position to articulate what our go-forward strategy on capital allocation will be. That again as Matt said, we expect to articulate in February Spiro. So I'd say that, it's an evolving dialogue. I'd say that, we're getting a lot of advice. And I'd say that that advice is varied as one would expect just depending on what type of investor we're talking to or certainly the rating agencies want to see more credit positive decision-making versus the alternative. So those are all very important voices and we are certainly listening to them and then providing our Board with that feedback. And that's an important part of the evolving conversation at Targa. I think you'll continue to see us be opportunistic Spiro. So to the extent that we think there's an asset or assets that make sense for somebody else to own, if they have a lower cost of capital for other reasons and that's something that we'll consider. But as you said in your opening part of the question, the great part of this is we've got a lot of flexibility and we don't need to do anything. So that means that the bar and the threshold for us willing to sell assets is higher than it certainly was before when we needed to sell assets in order to be able to finance our growth capital. I think from our perspective the TRC pref is a material amount of capital that we need to deploy in order to be able to redeem that. So as we look at it, it is higher cost to us at 9.5%, but we also have a lot of flexibility in terms the amount of time that we have that we want to redeem it. So I think you are hearing from us that our base case assumption right now is that there really isn't a driving reason to have to take it out in the first quarter in mid-March, when it steps down to 105%. We can maintain and even enhance our balance sheet flexibility by being a little bit more deliberate with the TRC prefs and taking it out more slowly over time. And so that's the base case assumption that we're running Keith. Of course that can evolve as we move through this year and into next year as we have more flexibility with the increasing free cash flow but that's the current assumption that we're running."

            "content": "Yeah, Michael, this is Scott. I would first point to the fact that our export performance was strong in the second quarter, a nice recovery from what we saw in the first quarter, which was impacted by the February winter storm. Certainly as you pointed to of late and really throughout this year the increased price on both propane and butane here in the US versus global pricing has impacted some opportunities for spot. So I think when you look at it the international market is choosing at times to look at other places as opposed to US Gulf Coast for exports. And at times quite frankly, Targa may choose to not participate at certain pricing levels. So as a result of that, I think spot opportunities may be impacted. As Matt pointed out though higher prices here on propane in the US help us in other areas of our integrated platform, so we benefit from that. We have not experienced any cancellations to this point. But again the fundamentals with inventories here in the US about 20 million barrels behind this time last year that supports propane prices, which could have an impact on spot opportunities. We're well contracted. And should we see cancellations, obviously, we collect the cancellation fee as a result of that. Okay. Thanks Michael."

            "name": "Matt Meloy",
            "content": "Thanks, Sanjay, and good morning everyone. We're excited to announce another great quarter at Targa, as our overall business continued to perform well, led by our position in the Permian Basin and our integrated NGL business. As we continue to execute on our key strategic priorities, we are very pleased with our positioning. Taking into consideration, our first half performance and the strength in our business outlook for the second half of this year coupled with stronger commodity price fundamentals, we are increasing our estimated 2021 EBITDA to be between $1.9 billion and $2 billion. 2021 EBITDA is now estimated to be 19% higher than last year based on the midpoint of our new guidance range. Our prioritization of free cash flow for debt reductions mean we reduced our debt balance by $780 million in the first half of the year and our consolidated leverage was 3.8 times at the end of the second quarter, within our target range of three to four times, and well ahead of schedule due to our strong performance. This provides us greater flexibility and bolsters Targa's financial position. We now expect to end the year at about 3.5 times leverage with a strong balance sheet and well positioned to repurchase the DevCo interest in the first quarter of next year. We're also very proud of the efforts of our Targa employees over a difficult last year and a half. Our employees have continued to perform exceptionally well for our customers, and have done so with a continued focus on safety, and we are very thankful for their efforts. Let's now turn to our operational performance and business outlook. Starting in the Permian, second quarter system volumes rebounded quickly following the major winter storm, during the first quarter, as system inlet volumes increased 15% sequentially. We now expect our 2021 Permian inlet volumes to increase to the high end of the previously disclosed 5% to 10% growth over 2020. Our Permian Midland system ran above nameplate capacity for much of the second quarter, and we're pleased to announce our new 200 million cubic feet per day Heim Plant is mechanically complete and expected to begin full operations in early September. A special thanks to our operations and engineering teams for safely bringing online Heim, well over a month ahead of schedule and under -. We expect Heim to commence operations highly utilized. And given our outlook for continued production growth we announced this morning our plans to move forward with the construction of our new 250 million cubic feet per day Legacy Plant, which is expected to begin operations during the fourth quarter of 2022. Even with the addition of Legacy there is no change to our 2021 net growth capital spending estimate of between $350 million to $450 million. Our current year spend on Legacy is estimated to be about $70 million. In Permian Delaware, completions and activity levels have continued to ramp and we currently have adequate processing capacity to accommodate our anticipated near to medium-term growth. The stronger outlook across our Permian Basin footprint coupled with our new plant announcement will continue to drive incremental volumes through our downstream businesses. Moving on to the Badlands, we saw sequential increases to our gas and crude volumes during the second quarter. Producers are completing wells and we continue to have positive producer dialogue. Turning to our Central region, gas inlet volumes during the second quarter also rebounded from the winter storm and increased 8% sequentially. While the system continues to largely be in decline we are currently seeing a modest uptick in completions and activity, which could mitigate some of the decline. Shifting to our Logistics and Transportation segment, overall system volumes during the second quarter meaningfully rebounded from the effects of prior quarter's major winter storms. Our Grand Prix pipeline continues to perform very well with total deliveries in the Mont Belvieu increasing 14% sequentially. During the second quarter, we transported a record 392,000 barrels per day and we expect volumes to ramp through the balance of the year. We also achieved record fractionation volumes at our Mont Belvieu complex, averaging about 644,000 barrels per day during the second quarter, representing an 18% sequential increase. In our LPG export services business at Galena Park, second quarter volumes sequentially increased 20%, averaging 10.3 million barrels per month. While we remain highly contracted, the current higher NGL prices are causing reduced short-term demand for spot opportunities. However, overall the long-term fundamentals remain strong for LPG exports and the current strength in propane prices is still a net positive for Targa. Looking ahead, with our leverage already in the target range and on track to be even lower by year-end, we expect to be in a position to return incremental capital to our shareholders in 2022 after repurchasing the DevCo joint venture interest. We have the ability to return capital to shareholders in a number of different ways, through additional dividend, share repurchases, repayment of preferred equity, and/or continuing to reduce debt. We are currently evaluating along with our Board the best way to deliver value to shareholders while maintaining our long-term financial flexibility. We will prioritize a strong balance sheet that keeps Targa and strong financial position across downside scenarios. We expect to articulate more details in February with our 2022 outlook and capital plan for the year. Targa continues to benefit from the strength of our business and our talented employees and we remain very well positioned for the long-term. With that, I will now turn the call over to Jen. Sure. Good morning Shneur. Yes. We are seeing stronger volumes. We pointed at the high end of our range. I'd say it's -- in both the Midland and the Delaware we are seeing I'd say higher activity. But it's really the dynamic we talked about last call, I'd say is still for the most part there which is the larger producers are really staying within what they told us. But the smaller and some of the private guys we are seeing ramp up more. We've seen a steady increase in the rig count but not a huge spike up. So I think we're just seeing just continued strong activity across the board for our producers. Pat is there anything else you'd want to add to that or? Yes. I'll start, Jen and then if you want to add in. We did say we are targeting 3.5 through year end. And that does assume that we're prioritizing our free cash flow to go towards debt reduction. That is our base case plan is to get there and that just puts us in a good position to be able to take out the DevCo in the first part of next year. We do have a share buyback authorized. But what you've seen us do this year for the first part is prioritize that free cash flow towards debt reduction. That's my expectation that we'll continue to do that. We're still having the ability to do share repurchases. And then we're taking a hard look at that with our Board and we'll kind of lay out what the 2022 capital plan is in February for our free cash flow. Yes, sure. We typically see especially on the Midland side a lot of growth as we get into second quarter and into the third quarter. So some of it is seasonal. We see a lot of activity. We see that continuing. And sometimes it feels like the activity is more ratable, but the volumes tend to grow more in the second and third quarter. And we are seeing that this year I think which is part of that. So while we do expect some growth as we kind of continue through the back half of the year and into 2022 it may not be at the same rate that we kind of experienced in the last few months. Pat anything? Sure. Thank you. Jeremy, good morning. Yeah Jeremy, we are [Technical Difficulty]. So we're looking at carbon capture up our processing plants and evaluating what that project could look like. We are -- as we go through it, I agree with you. I don't know that there's going to be a shortage of capital is going to be the issue, just kind of getting through some of the operational where we're going to sequester it, and permitting and some other things that we're working hard on. So -- and you also said in the near-term, I think this is also -- it is going to take a while right, for us to figure if we have a viable project here or not? I'd say we're making good progress. As we kind of learn more, I'm becoming increasingly optimistic that there's a potential to do something here but it's still going to take -- it's going to take sometime. Okay. Thanks Jeremy. Yeah. As far as our hedging goes I mean, we are going to want to stay -- we call it programmatic hedging, our target is 75% year one, 50% year two and then 25% year three. I see us continuing to execute kind of along that programmatic amount and be somewhere around those ranges. But you're right with our leverage lower and with more fee-based we would have some opportunity to even go inside of that. But I think right now, where we are is kind of sticking with that 75% 50% 25% is approach that's worked for us and something we're likely to kind of hover around for a while. Okay. Thank you. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Yes. I mean I think we are benefiting similarly to others as you see higher GOR go up. You have seen that help us out in the Permian and you've seen our gas performance be even a little bit better than our crude here, when you look at this quarter. So I think the higher GOR is a tailwind for us across multiple systems. Okay. Thank you. Sure. Yes. On ethane recovery I'd say it varies across our systems for whether producers have elections or we make the election. So it varies by contract by system. But for the most part our assets are in recovery and kind of have been in recovery. So that's how most of our assets are operating. You did see if you look -- you saw an uptick in South Texas where it was in rejection. Now it's in recovery. So you saw an NGL uplift there. But for the most part the other systems were really already in recovery. Yes. So most of our volumes that are going downstream business whether it's transportation or fractionation are under long-term contract. So there's not a whole lot of movement in terms of rates there for, where the volumes that are going through our assets. I think when you look at the unit margin you just look at the reported numbers what Jen talked about was we had some marketing gains in the first quarter. So we had some outperformance due to the winter storm and some marketing gains, which kind of skewed the unit margins higher. But overall just run rate business is performing well and are generally under long-term contract. Okay. Thank you."

Additionally, the following senior management team members will be available for Q&A, Pat McDonie, President, Gathering and Processing; Scott Pryor, President, Logistics and Transportation; and Bobby Muraro, Chief Commercial Officer. And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Matt.\nMatthew Meloy: Thanks, Sanjay, and good morning. During the quarter, our overall business continued to perform very well, led by our position in the Permian Basin and our integrated NGL business and positive aggregate benefits from the winter storm. We continued to execute on our key strategic priorities, including prioritizing free cash flow towards debt reduction as we reduced our debt balance by $383 million quarter-over-quarter. The severe weather from the February winter storm impacted us across our operations during the first quarter. Over a 10-day period around the storm, we experienced, on average, a 50% reduction across our gathering and processing and downstream system volumes. Our overall system volumes quickly rebounded and returned to around pre-storm levels later in the first quarter. Those operational impacts were offset by storm-related benefits elsewhere in our business, which resulted in an aggregate margin benefit of about $30 million for the quarter. Let's now turn to our operational performance and business outlook. Starting in the Permian, we remain on track and expect our average total 2021 Permian inlet volumes to increase between 5% and 10% over last year. We are seeing increasing activity levels across both our Midland and Delaware footprints with our current Permian inlet gas volumes ahead of pre-storm levels averaging about 2.7 billion cubic feet per day. With our Permian Midland system running close to capacity, our new 200 million cubic feet per day Heim Plant will be much needed and remains on track to begin operations early in the fourth quarter. We continue to evaluate the timing of our next Midland plant, which we estimate would cost about $150 million and could be needed as early as the second half of 2022. We currently have adequate processing capacity in Permian Delaware to accommodate our anticipated near- to medium-term growth. Moving on to the Badlands. Our gas and crude volumes during the first quarter each sequentially decreased 6% largely due to the winter conditions in North Dakota. We are seeing completions increase across our system and are having increasing producer dialogue around a ramp in activity levels. Turning to our Central Region, which continues to largely be in decline, gas inlet volumes in the first quarter were further impacted by the effects of the winter storm. We are currently seeing a modest uptick in completions and activity levels, which could mitigate some of the decline. Across our Gathering and Processing business, our margins are also benefiting from the inherent tailwinds associated with higher commodity prices and the upside participation embedded in our fee floor arrangements as a result of our recontracting efforts. Shifting to our Logistics and Transportation segment, our Grand Prix pipeline continues to perform very well. Current Grand Prix deliveries into Mont Belvieu are approximately 380,000 barrels per day, and we expect volumes to continue to ramp from here. We continue to estimate full year 2021 average deliveries into Mont Belvieu to increase over 25% from 2020 average throughput. Our fractionation volumes in Mont Belvieu rebounded from the winter storm, and we are once again seeing higher volumes of around 630,000 barrels per day. In addition to the winter storm impact, lower sequential frac volumes were also attributable to some minor repairs. And recall that fourth quarter 2020 frac volumes benefited from working down inventory as a result of scheduled maintenance performed in the second half of 2020. In our LPG export services business at Galena Park, first quarter volumes averaged 8.5 million barrels per month and were down 23% sequentially. Fourth quarter 2020 volumes benefited from the very strong export fundamentals, which enabled us to capture some shorter term volumes during the prior quarter. The impact from the winter storm, combined with periods of fog along the Houston ship channel during the first quarter, also contributed to the sequential volume decline. The outlook for full year 2021 and beyond remains strong, and we expect our LPG export volumes to be higher during the second quarter over first quarter levels. Taking into consideration our first quarter results, strong business performance and continued focus around cost management, coupled with a stronger estimated commodity price outlook for the balance of 2021, we are increasing our full year estimated 2021 adjusted EBITDA to be between $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion. 2021 adjusted EBITDA is now estimated to be 13% higher than 2020 based on the midpoint of our new guidance range. With our higher full year adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow estimate, we expect to end 2021 with reported leverage around 4 times. As we look forward, our integrated NGL business is poised to continue to benefit from an overall recovery, and we have the ability to capture growth volumes from the Permian without having to spend much incremental CapEx on Grand Prix, fractionation or LPG export facilities. This puts Targa in a position to generate strong returns going forward and increasing free cash flow after dividends available to reduce debt and further strengthen our financial position. With that, I will now turn the call over to Jen.\nJennifer Kneale: Thanks, Matt. Good morning, everyone. Targa's reported quarterly adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter was $516 million, increasing 18% over the fourth quarter. The aggregate net benefit from the winter storm, lower operating in G&A expenses and higher commodity prices drove the sequential increase in adjusted EBITDA. Commodity prices meaningfully increased quarter-over-quarter. And while we are significantly hedged, our Gathering and Processing segment gross margin directly benefits from higher prices across our unhedged equity exposure and to the extent prices are above our fee floors. During the first quarter, Targa generated free cash flow of $336 million, which, as Matt mentioned, was utilized to reduce our aggregate debt balance significantly. And our consolidated reported debt-to-EBITDA ratio was approximately 4.3 times at the end of the first quarter, which was a reduction from 4.7 times at year-end 2020. We did make a reporting change that you may have noticed, beginning in the first quarter of 2021, we now include certain fuel and power costs, previously included in operating expenses, in product purchases and fuel to better reflect the direct relationship of these costs to our revenue-generating activities and align with our evaluation of the performance of the business. Prior periods have been updated to reflect this change. We remain significantly hedged for 2021 and continue to add hedges for this year and beyond. Relative to when we last reported in February, we added incremental hedges across most commodities as we benefited from higher prices, particularly in the prompt year. You can find our usual hedge disclosures in our quarterly earnings supplement presentation. As Matt mentioned, we are increasing our full year 2021 adjusted EBITDA estimate to be between $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion. Our updated financial estimates assume full year 2021 WTI crude oil prices to average $60 per barrel, NGL prices to average $0.60 per gallon and Henry Hub and Waha natural gas prices to average $2.75 and $2.65 per MMbtu. Given the strength of first quarter adjusted EBITDA and the seasonality of some of our businesses, we expect second quarter adjusted EBITDA to be lower than ramping through the back half of the year, providing significant momentum heading into 2022 as we expect to end 2021 with reported leverage of around four times. Also, we would expect aggregate OpEx and G&A to be higher in the second quarter as some costs shifted from the first quarter related to the winter storm. In Q2, aggregate OpEx G&A is estimated to more closely approximate the fourth quarter. We continue to be very proud of the organization's efforts on reducing costs, and this will continue to be an area of focus across the company. Our 2021 CapEx estimates remain unchanged with net growth CapEx to be between $350 million and $450 million and net maintenance CapEx of approximately $130 million. There is no change to our near-term capital allocation strategy. To continue to improve our leverage ratios and simplify our corporate structure, we are making significant progress on advancing towards our long-term consolidated leverage ratio target of three to four times as we continue to focus on improving our corporate ratings and becoming investment grade. There is no change to our assumption that we will repurchase the DevCo interest in the first quarter of 2022, which would generate additional EBITDA in 2022 and beyond and be about leverage neutral. Shifting to Targa's focus around sustainability and ESG, we continue to advance our efforts and internal initiatives in this area. We recently announced the formation of a Sustainability committee at the Board level, which will report to the Board on a quarterly basis. Targa has also joined the ONE Future Coalition, and we plan to publish our next sustainability report in the fall. Finally, I would like to echo Matt's comments. Targa continues to benefit from the strength of our integrated business, and we remain exceptionally well positioned for the long term. On behalf of management, we would all like to say thank you to all of our Targa team for continuing to prioritize safety and providing best-in-class service to our customers. And with that, I will turn the call back over to Sanjay.\nSanjay Lad: Thanks, Jen. We kindly ask that you limit to one question and one follow-up and please re-enter the Q&A line up, if you have additional questions. Carmen, would you please open the lines for Q&A?\nOperator: Thank you. And our first question will be Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nJeremy Tonet: Hi, good morning.\nMatthew Meloy: Hey, good morning, Jeremy.\nJeremy Tonet: I think you touched on this a bit during the prepared remarks, but just wanted to kind of dive in a bit more when it comes to capital allocation philosophy, a few different things that can happen here, be it lowering leverage outright, the press that can be kind of brought in simplifying to bring in the opco, I just wanted to see kind of how you think about these different priorities at this point. And also, I guess if activity levels are starting to tick up, I mean do you see pressure on CapEx moving up to kind of facilitate that? Or do you think it's really these other measures I mentioned first are top priority?\nMatthew Meloy: Sure. Yes. Thanks, Jeremy. I'll touch on capital allocation and let Jen kind of fill in some additional comments there. Our overall capital allocation priority is on leverage reduction. You saw us do that in the first quarter. That's going to be our priority to try and make progress towards getting ratings increases, towards investment-grade and getting into our target, three to 4 times. So that is going to be our overriding priority there. And then on your second point in terms of CapEx pressure, with increasing volumes, we are optimistic that Permian volumes are going to continue to grow year-over-year. We do have capacity out in the Permian Delaware. So we really think in terms of CapEx pressure where you're going to see it is on that Permian Midland side. And I mentioned in my remarks, we're evaluating right now the timing of when we may need to add another plant out there. With volume currently running around 2.7 Bcf a day, we're kind of hitting our capacity. So we're going to need the Heim Plant to come on. We do have some ability to stretch beyond nameplate and provide us some cushion for that next plant. But we're evaluating right now that next plant. And that's for the tune of about $150 million, which would be spread out over the bill cycle. So it's manageable. We can still continue to generate free cash flow, deleverage and make progress with all of our goals even in an environment if we see some more strength on volumes. And then, Jen, you want to add anything more on the capital allocation...\nJennifer Kneale: I'd just say, Jeremy, that being ahead of schedule essentially gives us more flexibility. And so from our perspective, that flexibility doesn't change the base plan that we articulated in our scripted remarks and that Matt just reiterated, which is really reducing leverage, improving our ratios and then simplifying both taking out the DevCo and redeeming the TRC preferred. So those will continue to be our areas of focus, which is very consistent with how we've been talking about our capital allocation strategy over the last many quarters.\nJeremy Tonet: That's helpful. Thank you for that. And then maybe kind of shifting gears, you've seen changes recently out of D.C. with the 45Qs kind of more credit happening there, supporting initiatives such as carbon capture. And it seems like where processing plants stand on the cost curve for carbon capture, the 45Qs could possibly make that economic given the purity of the CO2 stream there. Just wondering if you had any thoughts on that side, if that's something you could see Targa doing at some point in the future. Or any other thoughts on energy transition efforts like that you might want to share?\nMatthew Meloy: Yes. Sure. Yes. In terms of broader energy transition, we think NGLs, crude gas are going to be here for decades to come, and we're really well positioned within that environment. That said, we will continue to look at other opportunities. We mentioned on our previous calls, we'll evaluate are there some renewable projects that we could either support or help underwrite with commitments to off take some electricity, whether it be solar or wind. We're continuing to evaluate those projects. And then on the carbon capture front, we are taking a look at that. So we have folks internally that are looking at can we aggregate CO2 and either sell the CO2 or sequester it and just put it down hole. So we are evaluating that. I would say that does fit what seems like more of our core competency, gathering CO2, putting it in a pipe and then moving it. So we are looking at that. I'd say we're in the early stages of that. And whether the 45Q credits are enough or not, I'd say right now, it's still too early. We're in the scoping and seeing if something could work out there. But we are evaluating that as that one seems that may have more potential. But for any additional capital that we would spend, whether it's carbon capture or anything else, it would have to generate strong returns relative to our other organic growth opportunities and if -- so there may be some projects that we help support, and we can find other sources of capital if it's not meeting our threshold.\nJeremy Tonet: That\u2019s quite encouraging to hear. Thank you.\nMatthew Meloy: Okay. Thank you, Jeremy.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Shneur Gershuni with UBS. Your question please?\nShneur Gershuni: Hi. Good morning, everyone. Maybe start off, just kind of wanted to talk about your guidance a little bit here. Jen, definitely appreciate the color around timing for 2Q as to why your guidance is not even higher, and don't take this as I'm complaining, guidance increase is good. Last quarter, you had mentioned that the high end of the range was achievable without any changes in volume expectations. Is that still the case? And within the context of the guidance question, we're just wondering if you can talk about the performance of the fee floors as well, too. And are there any elements of conservatism within your guide?\nJennifer Kneale: Shneur, this is Jen. I don't recall saying that we could meet the high end of our guidance range without changing any of our volume expectations. But I think that the guidance range that we put out today is one that is higher for a variety of factors. We've actualized the first quarter. We did benefit from the storm to the tune of $30 million, which is certainly additive. And then as we look forward over the rest of the year, I think just a continued expectation of strong operating performance. Matt gave some color on where our volumes sort of sit today. And again, I think we just feel better about the base performance of our business as a result of where volumes are and really, the fact that it feels like maybe there's light at the end of the tunnel around COVID. So that's providing I think a little bit of a tailwind as well just in terms of more macro stability and how that relates to Targa. Clearly, to the extent that we continue to benefit from higher commodity prices that will be additive to what we published today. To the extent that we have higher commodity prices that result in more activity levels, then that could obviously increase our expectations for volumes for this year. So there are a lot of factors at play. But I think that it feels like we've got a lot of momentum right now, and that momentum is creating a lot of flexibility, and that's what we're really excited about. And importantly, it's really the base business that's creating a lot of that momentum along with discontinued management of costs related to our base business activities, which, again, the organization has done a really good job of doing. We haven't provided a lot of color around exactly where sort of the fee floors are set and what the upside at different commodity prices means related to our fee floors. But what we have done is consistent with what we published in February, the commodity price sensitivity that we have for our business that we published also in our earnings supplement and broader presentation today, that encompasses our expectations for additional margin from not only just direct commodity price appreciation on unhedged volumes, but also if prices move higher, what that would mean for our fee floors. And then there are a variety of other factors that are also included in there. So I do think that that's a pretty good sensitivity related to performance of aggregate Targa business in higher commodity price environments.\nShneur Gershuni: Perfect. Really appreciate all the color there. Maybe following up on the momentum seen here just sort of thinking about the simplification process as it unfolds, you talked about in your prepared remarks that you have not changed the expectation around the DevCo. Does that mean the - despite the momentum, the [indiscernible] hasn't changed? Or you're just not updating the time line? And maybe as we think about the whole simplification process, your leverage and liquidity are certainly there for the DevCo at this stage right now. Should we be thinking about perhaps as the next simplification step? Or is rightsizing the dividend something on the radar screen? Just any color with respect to your thoughts there would be great.\nJennifer Kneale: We've talked a little bit about the EBITDA expectations from the DevCo buy-in. And so there, you've got Train six and GCX, which are relatively stable cash flows. Those essentially have been full since they came online. So really, the upside asset that's within the DevCos is Grand Prix. And so from our perspective, certainly, Grand Prix is continuing to perform phenomenally well, but it's not changing that base case assumption that we'll take out the DevCos in a single tranche in Q1 of '22, which is an assumption that I think has been well received. It's easy I think for investors and potential investors to understand, and it is consistent with what our base plan is, and that plan hasn't changed. Clearly, the second part of what we characterize as our corporate simplification prioritization is redeeming the TRC preferred, and that steps down to 105% at the end of the first quarter of 2022. And I think if you look at where our balance sheet is expected to be at that point in time, we have a lot of flexibility. And our continued outperformance would just enhance that flexibility. And so I think you're absolutely right that, that is definitely a priority. And that is, again, very consistent with what we've laid out over the last many quarters, which is our simplification isn't really complete until the TRC pref is also redeemed.\nShneur Gershuni: All right. Perfect. And then I guess the upside to the dividend would be further down the road.\nMatthew Meloy: Yes. I think once we kind of achieve our target leverage ratio, hit the simplification that Jen talked about, then the best way to return capital, look at our free cash flow and whether it's more organic growth or dividend or share repurchase, that will be evaluated with the Board and then decided about what the right - appropriate way to distribute that is.\nShneur Gershuni: Perfect. Thank you very much, everyone. Really appreciate the color. And have a safe day.\nMatthew Meloy: Okay. Thank you\nJennifer Kneale: Thanks, Shneur.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Blum with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nMichael Blum: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. I had a question on the guidance. As you know, I'm sure propane inventories are somewhat depleted. And do you think we could see domestic demand drive prices higher in the back half of the year as you head towards winter potentially narrow the ARB, which could impact exports. Just curious how you're thinking about that scenario as the year plays out and what exactly is factored into guidance.\nMatthew Meloy: Yes. Sure, Michael. Yes. We have seen really strong NGL prices across the board. And you're right. On propane, inventories are low, and we've seen strong pricing there. That could have some impacts for the shorter-term kind of uncontracted volumes as we go through the remainder of the year. We have significant contracts in place. We feel good about our base business. For the remainder of the year on the export side. But if there is some strength in pricing there, we do have upside exposure through our G&P business. So we have some offsets there. So overall, higher NGL prices, generally speaking, are going to benefit Targa. There may be some offset to some shorter-term opportunities in export. But I think, overall, higher propane prices, other NGL prices, is likely going to be a positive for us.\nMichael Blum: Great. And then I wonder if you can just talk a little bit about Pioneer's sort of tuck-in acquisition of DoublePoint. At least my understanding is that acreage is already dedicated to you, but just curious if there's any ancillary benefits or incremental upside there from that transaction as it relates to your volumes.\nMatthew Meloy: Yes. Sure. I'm going to - we don't like to talk about specific customers and contracts that we have in play. So I'm going to answer that more generally, Michael. I think as some of our larger customers in general are growing, whether it's in the Delaware or Permian Midland side, as they grow, we have good relationships with those larger customers. I think in the short term, it's not going to be -- have any material impact, really positive or negative for us. But over the longer term as the larger guys, the relationships we have with our customers continue to increase, over the longer term, it is a good thing for us. So the consolidation on the upstream side longer-term is a -- we view it as a net positive for us.\nMichael Blum: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Colton Bean with Tudor, Pickering, Holt Company. Please go ahead.\nColton Bean: Morning. So just looking at the business mix there on Page nine of the presentation, looks like marketing may have been north of $100 million for Q1. So can you just walk us through the marketing results last quarter and then how that reconciles to $30 million of net benefit from weather?\nJennifer Kneale: Colton, this is Jen. We generally are a little bit opaque about the benefits that we get within the marketing business just because there tends to be a lot of moving pieces each quarter and we tend to have marketing benefits each quarter. So I'm not going to really get into the specifics here. But you'll recall in 2020 that we benefited from being able to enter into trades when there was a lot of contango in various commodity markets. And so you're seeing some of that be realized as we really moved through time, going back to earlier in 2020. And in particular, we did benefit in the first quarter from that. And then there were also some storm-related benefits, which, again, we're not going to get into the specifics of, but those were also factored into the outperformance for the marketing business.\nColton Bean: Got it. So some of that - it sounds like a decent portion was already in the works in 2020, it wasn't necessarily related to February?\nJennifer Kneale: Correct.\nColton Bean: Okay. And then maybe just to ask Shneur's question a little bit more pointed. I think on the updated EBITDA guide at the midpoint, it looks like it implies just under $450 million for the remaining three quarters. So if we back out that $30 million from Q1, it's still a little bit lower. So just - is that primarily the OpEx impact that you referenced, Jen, or anything else to point to?\nJennifer Kneale: That's primarily the delta that I think you're looking for, is we do expect that we'll see higher aggregate OpEx and G&A in the second quarter. And then we'll be continuing to try to manage those costs as we move forward through the year, but a little bit dependent on volumes and also just dependent on higher costs. And there are some elements that we need to purchase for our operations where we are seeing some increases in costs. But our guys are doing a really, really good job of managing costs lower everywhere across our businesses. So we'll continue to look for outperformance in that realm as we move through the rest of the year.\nMatthew Meloy: And there is some seasonality in our NGL business on the wholesale refinery services side, which generally has a better Q4 and Q1 as there's more sales in the winter. So there is some, all things equal, softness in the second quarter relative to the first quarter because of that. But Jen's right, I'd say it's largely probably more on the OpEx side, but then partially due to some seasonality as well.\nColton Bean: Understood. Appreciate the detail.\nMatthew Meloy: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Christine Cho with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nChristine Cho: Thank you. I actually have a follow-up to the propane question. Given that inventories are depleted and earlier in the quarter, we saw propane prices at Conway trading at a nice premium, and I suspect that we can see that later again this year, can you remind us if you're able to benefit from higher Conway prices? Would that just be from any supply that you physically have hitting that hub from your Mid-Con operations? Or is there any other way to, I don't know, physically bring up volumes from Mont Belvieu benefit from your pipeline that you now have?\nScott Pryor: Christine, this is Scott. First off, just to reiterate some of the things that Matt was saying, certainly from an inventory perspective, which is leading to what Michael's question was, inventories across the industry stand at about 41 million barrels with the most recent inventory stats. We didn't have much of a build from the last stats, again, just a week on week. That puts us below where we were this time last year. But certainly, that has helped increase the prices, which is -- I think it will take some time before we see some of the pricing across the world -- globe to reflect some of that activity. But increased prices, obviously, is going to help sustain some increased growth on the production side of things. As it relates to Conway, on the margin, we have opportunities to bring products down from Conway, recognizing that we've got the pipe in place, but it is predominantly a Y-grade pipeline, but there are some opportunities on the margin to bring it down. So I think relatively speaking, though, we're going to continue to see increased production from the Permian, and that's going to help us translate into larger volumes of Y-grade coming into our systems. And I think it will help shore up inventories over time. But again, depending upon what we see from an export perspective and just touching base on that for just a little bit, certainly, our volumes were down from the first quarter relative to the fourth quarter. But as Matt alluded to in our comments, we certainly see that our second quarter export volumes will be up over our first quarter volumes.\nChristine Cho: Okay. And then just going on to CapEx for the new Midland plant, is that going to be new build? Or are you moving around one of your other plants? And can you remind us the lead time on that? So if you want it potentially in second half of next year, when would you have to start spending money?\nMatthew Meloy: Sure. Yes. We're evaluating and kind of have evaluated and are continuing to evaluate the best plan to put in for the next plant. Right now, the reason I said the $150 million that I think we're leaning towards putting in a new build there, just for timing and just other factors that makes the most sense. So we think it's likely going to be a new build. That $150 million reflects new build. And then depending on infrastructure, one of the lead time -- long lead time items is getting electricity out of these plants. These are typically electric plants. But I'd say, think of it as kind of '18 months or so, 12 to 18 months, depending on how much -- how far you have to go and the like. So that gives us confidence that we'd be able to do something in the back half of '22.\nChristine Cho: And when would you - so like how much could that impact CapEx this year?\nMatthew Meloy: Yes. Really depending on when we greenlight and, say, we're seeing enough strength in volumes, it could have some impact to CapEx this year. We didn't change our CapEx guidance. We had really strong performance on our growth CapEx in Q1. So I think it remains to be seen whether we need to update our CapEx or not depending on the timing of that plant because we do have a range in there.\nChristine Cho: Got it. Thank you\nMatthew Meloy: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from John Mackay with Goldman Sachs. Your question please?\nJohn Mackay: Thanks for the time. I wanted to circle back on CapEx. We've seen a pretty big increase in steel prices over the last couple of months. I imagine you're largely covered for 2021. But just curious if you could talk about maybe the impact on 2022 CapEx. And just more generally, how we should think about input costs potentially going up.\nMatthew Meloy: Yes. And we have seen some input costs increase. So you're right, steel and just a number of other commodities have increased significantly. That will have some upward pressure on costs. But I'd say what we're seeing now is more than an offset on the labor side with - it's not in the heated environment we were in 24 months ago. So being able to negotiate rates on the labor and contracting side is offsetting that. So that's why the $150 million we said for the plant -- I think for our last plant new build, we indicated it was around $165 million. So all in, it is a net benefit with this lower level of activity.\nJohn Mackay: That's helpful. Thanks. Maybe just a follow-up, M&A across the market is picking up again slightly, at least on the asset side. Can you just kind of talk a little bit about what you're seeing, how you're thinking about maybe corporate M&A more generally? And then also, if there's any updates on the non-core sales side? Thanks.\nMatthew Meloy: Sure. For us, as we look out, there are a number of smaller acquisitions that are out there and, I guess, available. We still look at it here. It's a really high hurdle for us to go and acquire something. We have good opportunities on the organic side. And our focus, as we talked about earlier, is on reducing our leverage and simplifying. So that's really going to be our focus now. We have a really good footprint on the G&P side that's feeding our downstream business. So we're not in a position where we have a need to go and do something to utilize our downstream assets. We have a really good footprint. So I think we're going to be patient there and continue to evaluate those opportunities and look at them relative to our organic growth opportunities and our leverage targets and goals. That said - I mean we always look at things. So there may be something that's bolt-on relatively small that could work for us. I'd just say it's still -- it's a relatively high hurdle for us as we are focused on reducing our leverage.\nJennifer Kneale: Related to non-core asset sales, there's no update. We don't have any processes underway right now. But as always, we're looking across the portfolio to see if there's anything that makes sense for us to divest.\nJohn Mackay: All right. That\u2019s great. Thank you very much.\nMatthew Meloy: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Tristan Richardson with Truist Securities. Please go ahead.\nTristan Richardson: Hey. Good morning, guys. Appreciate all the comments, covered a lot of ground this morning. I just wanted to follow up on one earlier question on the updated financial guidance. I mean, Jen, you talked about it extensively. It seems to capture your new commodity assumptions as well as impacts from the storm and OpEx adjustments. But thinking about the volume side, as we continue to see price response on the part of producers, does that offer incremental opportunity this year versus your volume guide that we should think of as pretty consistent with where it was even at the beginning of this year?\nMatthew Meloy: Yes. I would say we are seeing some increase in activity from some of the smaller producers we have on our system. So if we are here in the 60s, I think the longer that we're here, the more kind of response you're going to see from those folks. Yes. I still think from our larger customers on the supply side don't see a lot of change in what they're telling us in terms of their volume expectations for this year. If we hang around here for the duration of this year, I could see potentially in late 2021, but probably really into 2022, maybe there's additional ramp in activity from some of our larger customers. But in the aggregate, I'd say that there is some potential upside to this year. But to really get the larger guys moving, it's more about what's their free cash flow targets, their debt reduction plans and the like. So - and I'd also point out, we are holding to our volume guidance. We saw a significant -- I mean we significantly underperformed in the first quarter because of the winter storm. So there's some kind of implied strength in the remaining part of this year because the first quarter was way under our expectations, but we still feel good about our overall volume range.\nTristan Richardson: That's helpful. Thanks, Matt. And then I guess just thinking, Jen, you noted no update on the non-core side, obviously, containing one of the portfolio. I guess we've seen some healthy markers on gas assets in the market. So I guess to the extent you have the capacity you need locked up for the foreseeable time frame, just curious on how strategic or how core you view your equity stake on the long-haul gas side.\nJennifer Kneale: Tristan, we've been fairly open that our minority stake in Gulf Coast Express is certainly something that we could consider selling if it made sense to the right counterparty at the right value. That is one of the assets that is in the DevCo. So that clearly complicates any process that we might want to undertake in the relative short term. But that's definitely something that we will continue to evaluate, particularly as we think about taking out the DevCos and then owning that full interest again in Gulf Coast Express. That's certainly one of the assets that we've previously identified as an asset that we could potentially divest.\nTristan Richardson: Helpful. Thank you guys, very much.\nMatthew Meloy: Okay. Thank you.\nJennifer Kneale: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Keith Stanley with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nKeith Stanley: Hi, thanks. Most of my questions have been answered. I just wanted to clarify on the preferred stock when the takeout steps down to 105%, was it Q1 2022 or '23?\nJennifer Kneale: No. It steps down from 110% to 105% in - really the end of Q1 of 2022.\nKeith Stanley: Okay. So when you think about timing, do you think you'd have financial capacity however you're going to take that out with, I assume, debt and cash to do that pretty early in 2022? Or would you need to wait a little since you're kind of absorbing the DevCo at the same time? I'm just trying to get a sense of when the big simplification items could be complete.\nJennifer Kneale: Frankly, it's something that we are continuing to assess, Keith. So continued outperformance this year will give us more flexibility, more capacity to potentially redeem parts or more of the TRC preferred earlier. I think our ability to effectively take out the DevCo and the TRC pref is largely dependent on where our leverage is and what our pathing looks like with the rating agencies. I think that's a big component that we'll be continuing to assess really as we move through the rest of this year and into next year. So would we have the liquidity to do it and the ability to do it concurrent or around the same time in 2022? I think yes. But what are the implications of that with the rating agencies related to our leverage ratios, et cetera, is something that we'll be continuing to assess again as we move through the rest of this year and into next year.\nKeith Stanley: Got it. Thank you.\nJennifer Kneale: Okay. Thank you.\nMatthew Meloy: Yes, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from James Carreker with U.S. Capital Advisors. Please go ahead.\nJames Carreker: Thanks for the question. Just wanted to circle back and try to maybe unpack Q1 results a little bit more. If I look sequentially, EBITDA was up $80 million versus Q4. You talked about the $30 million storm impact, but G&P volumes were down, frac volumes down, export volumes down. So are there some other buckets that could help explain exactly where the remainder of that delta is coming from?\nJennifer Kneale: James, this is Jen. I think if you look sequentially, we certainly benefited from lower costs, and we've talked about that a lot this morning. We also benefited from the $30 million of what we characterize as an aggregate net benefit. So that takes into account all of the negatives associated with lower volumes, and we were still able to generate an additional $30 million of margin beyond all of the negatives associated with volumes. I talked a little bit earlier in one of the questions about additional marketing opportunities and essentially additional realized margin from marketing. So that's a small part of the sequential benefit quarter-over-quarter as well. And so I think those are really the large component pieces. Sanjay, am I missing anything?\nSanjay Lad: Just the non-controlling interest production being lower quarter-over-quarter as a result of some of the joint venture assets.\nJennifer Kneale: That's right. To Sanjay's point, the non-controlling interest cutback was lower in the first quarter than it was in the fourth quarter. And that's because our joint ventures were largely impacted on the negative side from some of the volume variances quarter-over-quarter as a result of the winter storm. And a lot of the aggregate net benefits that we've talked about was really more at sort of the corporate level.\nJames Carreker: And so I guess some of these, I guess, non-storm-related marketing margins, I guess, was there something that led to those opportunities being available that's not related to the weather?\nJennifer Kneale: We generally have marketing benefits that we're able to realize each quarter. And it's really dependent on market dynamics, et cetera, for what we benefit and where we benefit across our businesses when you look at a quarter-by-quarter basis. So as I mentioned, in the first quarter, we did benefit from some realized gains associated with contango trades that we entered into when there was steep contango in various commodity markets back in 2020, and some of that was realized in the first quarter. Some of that was also realized in the fourth quarter, but there was more sequential benefit in the first quarter than the fourth quarter.\nJames Carreker: Yes. I guess I'm just struggling because, I guess, wouldn't you have known about those commodity trades when putting out your prior guidance? So I'm just - I'm trying to, I guess, also bridge the gap between old guidance, new guidance, volume's flat, commodity prices up a little bit, $30 million storm impact. So I guess what else was kind of new information in this revised guidance?\nJennifer Kneale: I think that new information in the revised guidance was a lot of different elements, some of which we've talked about on the call. But I think there's also, frankly, just less conservatism in our guidance because we're now one quarter through the year. So we've got one quarter that's actualized where we actually had additional benefits from the winter storm that we previously had not expected. I think we also, again, feel like there's good stability related to where we are in terms of COVID and the potential future impacts on our business as a result of COVID and then there is continued commodity price tailwinds, and we were seeing I think pretty steep backwardation in commodity price markets when we came out with our guidance. So to the extent that we're able to continue to realize the benefits of those as we move through the rest of the year, that's certainly a benefit. And we're also seeing some of the benefits from higher prices on volumes, which, to Matt's point, is why we haven't changed any of our volume guidance despite volumes being lower in the first quarter than we certainly would have expected when we first came out with guidance.\nJames Carreker: Okay. Thank you for the comment.\nJennifer Kneale: Thanks, James.\nMatthew Meloy: Yes, thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Sunil Sibal with Seaport Global. Please go ahead.\nSunil Sibal: Yes, hi. Good morning. And thanks for all the color on the call. I just wanted to explore the capital allocation part a little bit. So it seems like getting back - getting to IG is a higher priority. I was curious the way credit markets price your debt seems like already give you a fair bit of credit of the asset diversity and the quality of the asset. So are there any significant benefits beyond the financial benefits of transitioning to IG in terms of strategic benefits or any operational or contractual benefits that you expect to realize?\nJennifer Kneale: We have been a very strong, high-yield credit, Sunil, and I think have definitely benefited from that. But as we look forward, the benefits to becoming investment-grade and being a strong investment-grade credit are more than just financial. Our ability to issue longer-term debt, for instance, is a positive. The fact that generally, the market for investment-grade debt stays open versus we have had to successfully sort of reopen the high-yield market more than once through Targa's history. So those are also financial benefits. But I think just in terms of working with counterparties, being investment-grade is a benefit as well. It changes that dialogue a little bit, makes it a little bit easier. And so I think that we see a lot of both intangible and tangible benefits. And that's why this has always been a priority of ours. We've always just articulated that we expected the business to sort of get to investment-grade naturally over time as our growth capital spending came down, as our leverage ratios improved, as we benefited from increasing EBITDA, higher fee-based margins, more fee floors. So a lot of our efforts over the last couple of years have really been to set up this path to investment grade, and we certainly think it's one that we're on today and one that we think is important to us over the long term. We've all lived through a difficult last many years. And I think being investment-grade has shown its benefits to those credits that have been strong investment grades through a lot of volatility.\nSunil Sibal: Okay. Got it. Thanks for that. And then on your Permian contracts, I think a couple of quarters back, you had indicated that about 60% of the contracts are now fee-based floors and the remaining are POP. Is that still kind of the right way to think about it? Or has there been more changes in that mix? Thanks.\nMatthew Meloy: I'd say we continue to make progress on adding fee floors and fee-based components to our Permian contract. I think last time we gave the update, it was about 55%. I think we're continuing to make progress and move that higher. So a lot of those arrangements are fee floor. So they are still percentage of proceeds. They just have a minimum. And so earlier - last year, we were kind of underneath that fee floor now for a lot of those contracts we are moving above. So they're still POP, but they just have a minimum associated with them. And so I'd say we're at kind of 65% plus now, and we'll continue to make progress as we move forward.\nSunil Sibal: Got it. Thanks for the color.\nMatthew Meloy: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And I will pass the call back to Sanjay Lad for any final remarks.\nSanjay Lad: Great. Well, we thank everyone for participating in this morning's call and appreciate your interest in Targa Resources. The IR team will be available for any follow-up questions you may have. Thank you and have a great day.\nOperator: And this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation and you may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Jennifer Kneale",
            "content": "Thanks, Matt. Good morning, everyone. Targa's reported quarterly adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter was $516 million, increasing 18% over the fourth quarter. The aggregate net benefit from the winter storm, lower operating in G&A expenses and higher commodity prices drove the sequential increase in adjusted EBITDA. Commodity prices meaningfully increased quarter-over-quarter. And while we are significantly hedged, our Gathering and Processing segment gross margin directly benefits from higher prices across our unhedged equity exposure and to the extent prices are above our fee floors. During the first quarter, Targa generated free cash flow of $336 million, which, as Matt mentioned, was utilized to reduce our aggregate debt balance significantly. And our consolidated reported debt-to-EBITDA ratio was approximately 4.3 times at the end of the first quarter, which was a reduction from 4.7 times at year-end 2020. We did make a reporting change that you may have noticed, beginning in the first quarter of 2021, we now include certain fuel and power costs, previously included in operating expenses, in product purchases and fuel to better reflect the direct relationship of these costs to our revenue-generating activities and align with our evaluation of the performance of the business. Prior periods have been updated to reflect this change. We remain significantly hedged for 2021 and continue to add hedges for this year and beyond. Relative to when we last reported in February, we added incremental hedges across most commodities as we benefited from higher prices, particularly in the prompt year. You can find our usual hedge disclosures in our quarterly earnings supplement presentation. As Matt mentioned, we are increasing our full year 2021 adjusted EBITDA estimate to be between $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion. Our updated financial estimates assume full year 2021 WTI crude oil prices to average $60 per barrel, NGL prices to average $0.60 per gallon and Henry Hub and Waha natural gas prices to average $2.75 and $2.65 per MMbtu. Given the strength of first quarter adjusted EBITDA and the seasonality of some of our businesses, we expect second quarter adjusted EBITDA to be lower than ramping through the back half of the year, providing significant momentum heading into 2022 as we expect to end 2021 with reported leverage of around four times. Also, we would expect aggregate OpEx and G&A to be higher in the second quarter as some costs shifted from the first quarter related to the winter storm. In Q2, aggregate OpEx G&A is estimated to more closely approximate the fourth quarter. We continue to be very proud of the organization's efforts on reducing costs, and this will continue to be an area of focus across the company. Our 2021 CapEx estimates remain unchanged with net growth CapEx to be between $350 million and $450 million and net maintenance CapEx of approximately $130 million. There is no change to our near-term capital allocation strategy. To continue to improve our leverage ratios and simplify our corporate structure, we are making significant progress on advancing towards our long-term consolidated leverage ratio target of three to four times as we continue to focus on improving our corporate ratings and becoming investment grade. There is no change to our assumption that we will repurchase the DevCo interest in the first quarter of 2022, which would generate additional EBITDA in 2022 and beyond and be about leverage neutral. Shifting to Targa's focus around sustainability and ESG, we continue to advance our efforts and internal initiatives in this area. We recently announced the formation of a Sustainability committee at the Board level, which will report to the Board on a quarterly basis. Targa has also joined the ONE Future Coalition, and we plan to publish our next sustainability report in the fall. Finally, I would like to echo Matt's comments. Targa continues to benefit from the strength of our integrated business, and we remain exceptionally well positioned for the long term. On behalf of management, we would all like to say thank you to all of our Targa team for continuing to prioritize safety and providing best-in-class service to our customers. And with that, I will turn the call back over to Sanjay. I'd just say, Jeremy, that being ahead of schedule essentially gives us more flexibility. And so from our perspective, that flexibility doesn't change the base plan that we articulated in our scripted remarks and that Matt just reiterated, which is really reducing leverage, improving our ratios and then simplifying both taking out the DevCo and redeeming the TRC preferred. So those will continue to be our areas of focus, which is very consistent with how we've been talking about our capital allocation strategy over the last many quarters. Shneur, this is Jen. I don't recall saying that we could meet the high end of our guidance range without changing any of our volume expectations. But I think that the guidance range that we put out today is one that is higher for a variety of factors. We've actualized the first quarter. We did benefit from the storm to the tune of $30 million, which is certainly additive. And then as we look forward over the rest of the year, I think just a continued expectation of strong operating performance. Matt gave some color on where our volumes sort of sit today. And again, I think we just feel better about the base performance of our business as a result of where volumes are and really, the fact that it feels like maybe there's light at the end of the tunnel around COVID. So that's providing I think a little bit of a tailwind as well just in terms of more macro stability and how that relates to Targa. Clearly, to the extent that we continue to benefit from higher commodity prices that will be additive to what we published today. To the extent that we have higher commodity prices that result in more activity levels, then that could obviously increase our expectations for volumes for this year. So there are a lot of factors at play. But I think that it feels like we've got a lot of momentum right now, and that momentum is creating a lot of flexibility, and that's what we're really excited about. And importantly, it's really the base business that's creating a lot of that momentum along with discontinued management of costs related to our base business activities, which, again, the organization has done a really good job of doing. We haven't provided a lot of color around exactly where sort of the fee floors are set and what the upside at different commodity prices means related to our fee floors. But what we have done is consistent with what we published in February, the commodity price sensitivity that we have for our business that we published also in our earnings supplement and broader presentation today, that encompasses our expectations for additional margin from not only just direct commodity price appreciation on unhedged volumes, but also if prices move higher, what that would mean for our fee floors. And then there are a variety of other factors that are also included in there. So I do think that that's a pretty good sensitivity related to performance of aggregate Targa business in higher commodity price environments. We've talked a little bit about the EBITDA expectations from the DevCo buy-in. And so there, you've got Train six and GCX, which are relatively stable cash flows. Those essentially have been full since they came online. So really, the upside asset that's within the DevCos is Grand Prix. And so from our perspective, certainly, Grand Prix is continuing to perform phenomenally well, but it's not changing that base case assumption that we'll take out the DevCos in a single tranche in Q1 of '22, which is an assumption that I think has been well received. It's easy I think for investors and potential investors to understand, and it is consistent with what our base plan is, and that plan hasn't changed. Clearly, the second part of what we characterize as our corporate simplification prioritization is redeeming the TRC preferred, and that steps down to 105% at the end of the first quarter of 2022. And I think if you look at where our balance sheet is expected to be at that point in time, we have a lot of flexibility. And our continued outperformance would just enhance that flexibility. And so I think you're absolutely right that, that is definitely a priority. And that is, again, very consistent with what we've laid out over the last many quarters, which is our simplification isn't really complete until the TRC pref is also redeemed. Thanks, Shneur. Colton, this is Jen. We generally are a little bit opaque about the benefits that we get within the marketing business just because there tends to be a lot of moving pieces each quarter and we tend to have marketing benefits each quarter. So I'm not going to really get into the specifics here. But you'll recall in 2020 that we benefited from being able to enter into trades when there was a lot of contango in various commodity markets. And so you're seeing some of that be realized as we really moved through time, going back to earlier in 2020. And in particular, we did benefit in the first quarter from that. And then there were also some storm-related benefits, which, again, we're not going to get into the specifics of, but those were also factored into the outperformance for the marketing business. Correct. That's primarily the delta that I think you're looking for, is we do expect that we'll see higher aggregate OpEx and G&A in the second quarter. And then we'll be continuing to try to manage those costs as we move forward through the year, but a little bit dependent on volumes and also just dependent on higher costs. And there are some elements that we need to purchase for our operations where we are seeing some increases in costs. But our guys are doing a really, really good job of managing costs lower everywhere across our businesses. So we'll continue to look for outperformance in that realm as we move through the rest of the year. Related to non-core asset sales, there's no update. We don't have any processes underway right now. But as always, we're looking across the portfolio to see if there's anything that makes sense for us to divest. Tristan, we've been fairly open that our minority stake in Gulf Coast Express is certainly something that we could consider selling if it made sense to the right counterparty at the right value. That is one of the assets that is in the DevCo. So that clearly complicates any process that we might want to undertake in the relative short term. But that's definitely something that we will continue to evaluate, particularly as we think about taking out the DevCos and then owning that full interest again in Gulf Coast Express. That's certainly one of the assets that we've previously identified as an asset that we could potentially divest. Thank you. No. It steps down from 110% to 105% in - really the end of Q1 of 2022. Frankly, it's something that we are continuing to assess, Keith. So continued outperformance this year will give us more flexibility, more capacity to potentially redeem parts or more of the TRC preferred earlier. I think our ability to effectively take out the DevCo and the TRC pref is largely dependent on where our leverage is and what our pathing looks like with the rating agencies. I think that's a big component that we'll be continuing to assess really as we move through the rest of this year and into next year. So would we have the liquidity to do it and the ability to do it concurrent or around the same time in 2022? I think yes. But what are the implications of that with the rating agencies related to our leverage ratios, et cetera, is something that we'll be continuing to assess again as we move through the rest of this year and into next year. Okay. Thank you. James, this is Jen. I think if you look sequentially, we certainly benefited from lower costs, and we've talked about that a lot this morning. We also benefited from the $30 million of what we characterize as an aggregate net benefit. So that takes into account all of the negatives associated with lower volumes, and we were still able to generate an additional $30 million of margin beyond all of the negatives associated with volumes. I talked a little bit earlier in one of the questions about additional marketing opportunities and essentially additional realized margin from marketing. So that's a small part of the sequential benefit quarter-over-quarter as well. And so I think those are really the large component pieces. Sanjay, am I missing anything? That's right. To Sanjay's point, the non-controlling interest cutback was lower in the first quarter than it was in the fourth quarter. And that's because our joint ventures were largely impacted on the negative side from some of the volume variances quarter-over-quarter as a result of the winter storm. And a lot of the aggregate net benefits that we've talked about was really more at sort of the corporate level. We generally have marketing benefits that we're able to realize each quarter. And it's really dependent on market dynamics, et cetera, for what we benefit and where we benefit across our businesses when you look at a quarter-by-quarter basis. So as I mentioned, in the first quarter, we did benefit from some realized gains associated with contango trades that we entered into when there was steep contango in various commodity markets back in 2020, and some of that was realized in the first quarter. Some of that was also realized in the fourth quarter, but there was more sequential benefit in the first quarter than the fourth quarter. I think that new information in the revised guidance was a lot of different elements, some of which we've talked about on the call. But I think there's also, frankly, just less conservatism in our guidance because we're now one quarter through the year. So we've got one quarter that's actualized where we actually had additional benefits from the winter storm that we previously had not expected. I think we also, again, feel like there's good stability related to where we are in terms of COVID and the potential future impacts on our business as a result of COVID and then there is continued commodity price tailwinds, and we were seeing I think pretty steep backwardation in commodity price markets when we came out with our guidance. So to the extent that we're able to continue to realize the benefits of those as we move through the rest of the year, that's certainly a benefit. And we're also seeing some of the benefits from higher prices on volumes, which, to Matt's point, is why we haven't changed any of our volume guidance despite volumes being lower in the first quarter than we certainly would have expected when we first came out with guidance. Thanks, James. We have been a very strong, high-yield credit, Sunil, and I think have definitely benefited from that. But as we look forward, the benefits to becoming investment-grade and being a strong investment-grade credit are more than just financial. Our ability to issue longer-term debt, for instance, is a positive. The fact that generally, the market for investment-grade debt stays open versus we have had to successfully sort of reopen the high-yield market more than once through Targa's history. So those are also financial benefits. But I think just in terms of working with counterparties, being investment-grade is a benefit as well. It changes that dialogue a little bit, makes it a little bit easier. And so I think that we see a lot of both intangible and tangible benefits. And that's why this has always been a priority of ours. We've always just articulated that we expected the business to sort of get to investment-grade naturally over time as our growth capital spending came down, as our leverage ratios improved, as we benefited from increasing EBITDA, higher fee-based margins, more fee floors. So a lot of our efforts over the last couple of years have really been to set up this path to investment grade, and we certainly think it's one that we're on today and one that we think is important to us over the long term. We've all lived through a difficult last many years. And I think being investment-grade has shown its benefits to those credits that have been strong investment grades through a lot of volatility."

            "name": "Scott Pryor",
            "content": "Christine, this is Scott. First off, just to reiterate some of the things that Matt was saying, certainly from an inventory perspective, which is leading to what Michael's question was, inventories across the industry stand at about 41 million barrels with the most recent inventory stats. We didn't have much of a build from the last stats, again, just a week on week. That puts us below where we were this time last year. But certainly, that has helped increase the prices, which is -- I think it will take some time before we see some of the pricing across the world -- globe to reflect some of that activity. But increased prices, obviously, is going to help sustain some increased growth on the production side of things. As it relates to Conway, on the margin, we have opportunities to bring products down from Conway, recognizing that we've got the pipe in place, but it is predominantly a Y-grade pipeline, but there are some opportunities on the margin to bring it down. So I think relatively speaking, though, we're going to continue to see increased production from the Permian, and that's going to help us translate into larger volumes of Y-grade coming into our systems. And I think it will help shore up inventories over time. But again, depending upon what we see from an export perspective and just touching base on that for just a little bit, certainly, our volumes were down from the first quarter relative to the fourth quarter. But as Matt alluded to in our comments, we certainly see that our second quarter export volumes will be up over our first quarter volumes."

            "name": "Matthew Meloy",
            "content": "Thanks, Sanjay, and good morning. During the quarter, our overall business continued to perform very well, led by our position in the Permian Basin and our integrated NGL business and positive aggregate benefits from the winter storm. We continued to execute on our key strategic priorities, including prioritizing free cash flow towards debt reduction as we reduced our debt balance by $383 million quarter-over-quarter. The severe weather from the February winter storm impacted us across our operations during the first quarter. Over a 10-day period around the storm, we experienced, on average, a 50% reduction across our gathering and processing and downstream system volumes. Our overall system volumes quickly rebounded and returned to around pre-storm levels later in the first quarter. Those operational impacts were offset by storm-related benefits elsewhere in our business, which resulted in an aggregate margin benefit of about $30 million for the quarter. Let's now turn to our operational performance and business outlook. Starting in the Permian, we remain on track and expect our average total 2021 Permian inlet volumes to increase between 5% and 10% over last year. We are seeing increasing activity levels across both our Midland and Delaware footprints with our current Permian inlet gas volumes ahead of pre-storm levels averaging about 2.7 billion cubic feet per day. With our Permian Midland system running close to capacity, our new 200 million cubic feet per day Heim Plant will be much needed and remains on track to begin operations early in the fourth quarter. We continue to evaluate the timing of our next Midland plant, which we estimate would cost about $150 million and could be needed as early as the second half of 2022. We currently have adequate processing capacity in Permian Delaware to accommodate our anticipated near- to medium-term growth. Moving on to the Badlands. Our gas and crude volumes during the first quarter each sequentially decreased 6% largely due to the winter conditions in North Dakota. We are seeing completions increase across our system and are having increasing producer dialogue around a ramp in activity levels. Turning to our Central Region, which continues to largely be in decline, gas inlet volumes in the first quarter were further impacted by the effects of the winter storm. We are currently seeing a modest uptick in completions and activity levels, which could mitigate some of the decline. Across our Gathering and Processing business, our margins are also benefiting from the inherent tailwinds associated with higher commodity prices and the upside participation embedded in our fee floor arrangements as a result of our recontracting efforts. Shifting to our Logistics and Transportation segment, our Grand Prix pipeline continues to perform very well. Current Grand Prix deliveries into Mont Belvieu are approximately 380,000 barrels per day, and we expect volumes to continue to ramp from here. We continue to estimate full year 2021 average deliveries into Mont Belvieu to increase over 25% from 2020 average throughput. Our fractionation volumes in Mont Belvieu rebounded from the winter storm, and we are once again seeing higher volumes of around 630,000 barrels per day. In addition to the winter storm impact, lower sequential frac volumes were also attributable to some minor repairs. And recall that fourth quarter 2020 frac volumes benefited from working down inventory as a result of scheduled maintenance performed in the second half of 2020. In our LPG export services business at Galena Park, first quarter volumes averaged 8.5 million barrels per month and were down 23% sequentially. Fourth quarter 2020 volumes benefited from the very strong export fundamentals, which enabled us to capture some shorter term volumes during the prior quarter. The impact from the winter storm, combined with periods of fog along the Houston ship channel during the first quarter, also contributed to the sequential volume decline. The outlook for full year 2021 and beyond remains strong, and we expect our LPG export volumes to be higher during the second quarter over first quarter levels. Taking into consideration our first quarter results, strong business performance and continued focus around cost management, coupled with a stronger estimated commodity price outlook for the balance of 2021, we are increasing our full year estimated 2021 adjusted EBITDA to be between $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion. 2021 adjusted EBITDA is now estimated to be 13% higher than 2020 based on the midpoint of our new guidance range. With our higher full year adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow estimate, we expect to end 2021 with reported leverage around 4 times. As we look forward, our integrated NGL business is poised to continue to benefit from an overall recovery, and we have the ability to capture growth volumes from the Permian without having to spend much incremental CapEx on Grand Prix, fractionation or LPG export facilities. This puts Targa in a position to generate strong returns going forward and increasing free cash flow after dividends available to reduce debt and further strengthen our financial position. With that, I will now turn the call over to Jen. Hey, good morning, Jeremy. Sure. Yes. Thanks, Jeremy. I'll touch on capital allocation and let Jen kind of fill in some additional comments there. Our overall capital allocation priority is on leverage reduction. You saw us do that in the first quarter. That's going to be our priority to try and make progress towards getting ratings increases, towards investment-grade and getting into our target, three to 4 times. So that is going to be our overriding priority there. And then on your second point in terms of CapEx pressure, with increasing volumes, we are optimistic that Permian volumes are going to continue to grow year-over-year. We do have capacity out in the Permian Delaware. So we really think in terms of CapEx pressure where you're going to see it is on that Permian Midland side. And I mentioned in my remarks, we're evaluating right now the timing of when we may need to add another plant out there. With volume currently running around 2.7 Bcf a day, we're kind of hitting our capacity. So we're going to need the Heim Plant to come on. We do have some ability to stretch beyond nameplate and provide us some cushion for that next plant. But we're evaluating right now that next plant. And that's for the tune of about $150 million, which would be spread out over the bill cycle. So it's manageable. We can still continue to generate free cash flow, deleverage and make progress with all of our goals even in an environment if we see some more strength on volumes. And then, Jen, you want to add anything more on the capital allocation... Yes. Sure. Yes. In terms of broader energy transition, we think NGLs, crude gas are going to be here for decades to come, and we're really well positioned within that environment. That said, we will continue to look at other opportunities. We mentioned on our previous calls, we'll evaluate are there some renewable projects that we could either support or help underwrite with commitments to off take some electricity, whether it be solar or wind. We're continuing to evaluate those projects. And then on the carbon capture front, we are taking a look at that. So we have folks internally that are looking at can we aggregate CO2 and either sell the CO2 or sequester it and just put it down hole. So we are evaluating that. I would say that does fit what seems like more of our core competency, gathering CO2, putting it in a pipe and then moving it. So we are looking at that. I'd say we're in the early stages of that. And whether the 45Q credits are enough or not, I'd say right now, it's still too early. We're in the scoping and seeing if something could work out there. But we are evaluating that as that one seems that may have more potential. But for any additional capital that we would spend, whether it's carbon capture or anything else, it would have to generate strong returns relative to our other organic growth opportunities and if -- so there may be some projects that we help support, and we can find other sources of capital if it's not meeting our threshold. Okay. Thank you, Jeremy. Yes. I think once we kind of achieve our target leverage ratio, hit the simplification that Jen talked about, then the best way to return capital, look at our free cash flow and whether it's more organic growth or dividend or share repurchase, that will be evaluated with the Board and then decided about what the right - appropriate way to distribute that is. Okay. Thank you Yes. Sure, Michael. Yes. We have seen really strong NGL prices across the board. And you're right. On propane, inventories are low, and we've seen strong pricing there. That could have some impacts for the shorter-term kind of uncontracted volumes as we go through the remainder of the year. We have significant contracts in place. We feel good about our base business. For the remainder of the year on the export side. But if there is some strength in pricing there, we do have upside exposure through our G&P business. So we have some offsets there. So overall, higher NGL prices, generally speaking, are going to benefit Targa. There may be some offset to some shorter-term opportunities in export. But I think, overall, higher propane prices, other NGL prices, is likely going to be a positive for us. Yes. Sure. I'm going to - we don't like to talk about specific customers and contracts that we have in play. So I'm going to answer that more generally, Michael. I think as some of our larger customers in general are growing, whether it's in the Delaware or Permian Midland side, as they grow, we have good relationships with those larger customers. I think in the short term, it's not going to be -- have any material impact, really positive or negative for us. But over the longer term as the larger guys, the relationships we have with our customers continue to increase, over the longer term, it is a good thing for us. So the consolidation on the upstream side longer-term is a -- we view it as a net positive for us. And there is some seasonality in our NGL business on the wholesale refinery services side, which generally has a better Q4 and Q1 as there's more sales in the winter. So there is some, all things equal, softness in the second quarter relative to the first quarter because of that. But Jen's right, I'd say it's largely probably more on the OpEx side, but then partially due to some seasonality as well. Okay. Thank you. Sure. Yes. We're evaluating and kind of have evaluated and are continuing to evaluate the best plan to put in for the next plant. Right now, the reason I said the $150 million that I think we're leaning towards putting in a new build there, just for timing and just other factors that makes the most sense. So we think it's likely going to be a new build. That $150 million reflects new build. And then depending on infrastructure, one of the lead time -- long lead time items is getting electricity out of these plants. These are typically electric plants. But I'd say, think of it as kind of '18 months or so, 12 to 18 months, depending on how much -- how far you have to go and the like. So that gives us confidence that we'd be able to do something in the back half of '22. Yes. Really depending on when we greenlight and, say, we're seeing enough strength in volumes, it could have some impact to CapEx this year. We didn't change our CapEx guidance. We had really strong performance on our growth CapEx in Q1. So I think it remains to be seen whether we need to update our CapEx or not depending on the timing of that plant because we do have a range in there. Thank you. Yes. And we have seen some input costs increase. So you're right, steel and just a number of other commodities have increased significantly. That will have some upward pressure on costs. But I'd say what we're seeing now is more than an offset on the labor side with - it's not in the heated environment we were in 24 months ago. So being able to negotiate rates on the labor and contracting side is offsetting that. So that's why the $150 million we said for the plant -- I think for our last plant new build, we indicated it was around $165 million. So all in, it is a net benefit with this lower level of activity. Sure. For us, as we look out, there are a number of smaller acquisitions that are out there and, I guess, available. We still look at it here. It's a really high hurdle for us to go and acquire something. We have good opportunities on the organic side. And our focus, as we talked about earlier, is on reducing our leverage and simplifying. So that's really going to be our focus now. We have a really good footprint on the G&P side that's feeding our downstream business. So we're not in a position where we have a need to go and do something to utilize our downstream assets. We have a really good footprint. So I think we're going to be patient there and continue to evaluate those opportunities and look at them relative to our organic growth opportunities and our leverage targets and goals. That said - I mean we always look at things. So there may be something that's bolt-on relatively small that could work for us. I'd just say it's still -- it's a relatively high hurdle for us as we are focused on reducing our leverage. Okay. Thank you. Yes. I would say we are seeing some increase in activity from some of the smaller producers we have on our system. So if we are here in the 60s, I think the longer that we're here, the more kind of response you're going to see from those folks. Yes. I still think from our larger customers on the supply side don't see a lot of change in what they're telling us in terms of their volume expectations for this year. If we hang around here for the duration of this year, I could see potentially in late 2021, but probably really into 2022, maybe there's additional ramp in activity from some of our larger customers. But in the aggregate, I'd say that there is some potential upside to this year. But to really get the larger guys moving, it's more about what's their free cash flow targets, their debt reduction plans and the like. So - and I'd also point out, we are holding to our volume guidance. We saw a significant -- I mean we significantly underperformed in the first quarter because of the winter storm. So there's some kind of implied strength in the remaining part of this year because the first quarter was way under our expectations, but we still feel good about our overall volume range. Okay. Thank you. Yes, thank you. Yes, thanks. I'd say we continue to make progress on adding fee floors and fee-based components to our Permian contract. I think last time we gave the update, it was about 55%. I think we're continuing to make progress and move that higher. So a lot of those arrangements are fee floor. So they are still percentage of proceeds. They just have a minimum. And so earlier - last year, we were kind of underneath that fee floor now for a lot of those contracts we are moving above. So they're still POP, but they just have a minimum associated with them. And so I'd say we're at kind of 65% plus now, and we'll continue to make progress as we move forward. Okay. Thank you."

[Operator Instructions] Also be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to the Vice President of Finance and Investor Relations, Sanjay Lad. Please go ahead.\nSanjay Lad: Thanks, Carmen. Good morning, and welcome to the fourth quarter 2022 earnings call for Targa Resources Corp. The fourth quarter earnings release, along with the fourth quarter earnings supplement presentation for Targa that accompany our call are available on our website at targaresources.com in the Investors section. In addition, an updated investor presentation has also been posted to our website. Statements made during this call that might include Targa Resources' expectations or predictions should be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in forward-looking statements. For a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ, please refer to our latest SEC filings. Our speakers for the call today will be Matt Meloy, Chief Executive Officer; and Jen Kneale, Chief Financial Officer. Additionally, the following senior management members will be available for Q&A. Pat McDonie, President, Gathering and Processing; Scott Pryor, President, Logistics and Transportation; and Bobby Muraro, Chief Commercial Officer. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Matt.\nMatt Meloy: Thanks, Sanjay. And good morning to everyone. 2022 was an excellent year for Targa, and I would like to recognize and thank our employees for their focus, dedication and execution. Some of our highlights from 2022 include record safety performance based on multiyear low total reportable incident rate, record gathering and processing volumes in the Permian, record volumes across our logistics and transportation assets, record adjusted EBITDA of $2.9 billion, a 41% increase over 2021 while also reducing our share count. Major projects came online on time, on budget and have been highly utilized since start-up. Execution and successful integration of our Delaware Basin acquisition and our South Texas acquisition, execution of our corporate simplification with our DevCo repurchase and preferred share redemption, successful sale of our 25% equity interest in Gulf Coast Express Pipeline for approximately 11 times EBITDA, upgrades to investment grade by all of the rating agencies and completion of two successful investment-grade offerings and higher year-over-year return of capital to our shareholders through both an increased common dividend and continued common share repurchases. We expect our momentum to continue through 2023 and beyond, given the strength of the business fundamentals underpinning our assets. There is a continued need for critical midstream infrastructure like Targa's to balance and link cost advantaged U.S. production to domestic and global markets. Global events have underscored the critical nature of safe, reliable and affordable fossil fuels to support everyday life domestically and around the world. Cost advantage basins like the Permian, where we are the largest gatherer and processor of natural gas, will continue to be a key supplier of hydrocarbons for decades to come. We are less than two months into the year and already had some notable announcements, including the successful negotiation and closing of our acquisition of the remaining 25% interest in our Grand Prix NGL pipeline, our early January offering of 10- and 30-year senior notes that funded the Grand Prix acquisition and reduced floating rate borrowings on our revolver. And within this morning's release, our operational and financial estimates for 2023, which are expected to be records across many fronts, including an estimated 24% increase in year-over-year adjusted EBITDA. Our transfer and construction of a plant from our South Texas acquisition to the Delaware Basin, which we are calling the Roadrunner II plant, where activity around Southern New Mexico is currently exceeding our expectations. And an expected 43% year-over-year increase to our 2023 annualized common dividend per share versus last year. For 2023, we estimate that our adjusted EBITDA will be between $3.5 billion and $3.7 billion. The significant year-over-year increase in adjusted EBITDA is driven by higher expected gathering and processing volumes, higher expected NGL transportation, fractionation and export volumes, higher expected marketing optimization and LPG export opportunities, higher fees from contract escalators, a full year contribution from our Delaware Basin and South Texas acquisitions, contribution from our acquisition of the remaining 25% interest in Grand Prix and higher hedge prices. Related to capital allocation, maintaining a strong investment-grade balance sheet across cycles continues to be a priority at Targa. We also have attractive opportunities to continue to invest organically, which we believe will support the continued creation of significant shareholder value over time. We currently estimate between $1.8 billion and $1.9 billion of growth capital in 2023 as we build infrastructure that we expect to be highly utilized across our footprint. Our major projects in progress are core to our business, five new Permian gas processing plants, Train 9 fractionator and our Daytona NGL pipeline. Along with our partners, we are also in the process of restarting the 135,000 barrel per day Gulf Coast fractionator in Mont Belvieu, which we expect to be operational in the first quarter of 2024. Beyond those projects already announced, and in progress, we are evaluating when we will need additional gas processing capacity in the Permian, and we are ordering long lead time items for our next Midland plant. We believe our organic growth opportunities create value for Targa and our investors over time as we have demonstrated strong returns over the last five years. As you can see from Slide 4 in our earnings supplement presentation, we generated an attractive 26% return on invested capital since 2017, despite a volatile commodity price backdrop over the last several years. For our recent major capital projects, we have invested at a low single-digit multiple of EBITDA as the immediate high utilization of assets like new gas processing plants have resulted in very attractive returns despite higher build costs from inflation. A strong balance sheet and continued investment in high-return projects positions us to continue to prudently return an increasing amount of capital to our shareholders across cycles. We announced an expectation of a 43% year-over-year increase to our annualized 2023 common dividend per share this morning. The increased dividend will be recommended to our Board in April for the first quarter of 2023 with payment to shareholders in May. Our expected 2023 dividend increase reflects a lot of different factors, including our near- and long-term business fundamentals and balance sheet strength across scenarios, flexibility associated with our increasing size, scale and fee-based margin and Targa's positioning relative to our midstream C-Corp peers [ph], the S&P 500 and cyclical industries within the S&P 500. We also expect to be in a position to continue to execute opportunistically under our common share repurchase program, which will allow us to further increase our return of capital to shareholders and reduce our share count over time. We bought back $225 million worth of common shares in 2022 and had about $144 million remaining under the $500 million share repurchase program we put in place in October 2020. Our current expectation is we will request Board approval to authorize a new $1 billion share repurchase program once we exhaust our existing program. We believe that we will offer a unique value proposition for our shareholders and potential shareholders, growing EBITDA, growing dividend and reducing share count. We expect to continue to set expectations for our annual common dividend each February when we announce our financial and operational guidance and expect to continue to increase our return of capital to shareholders over time. In addition, to our standard annual disclosures around our financial expectations, we also included in our investor presentation this morning, describing Targa across upside and downside commodity price scenarios. We have spent the last many years focused on increasing our cash flow stability and reducing our volatility to downward moving commodity prices. As you can see from Slide 12 in our earnings presentation relative to our full year 2023 financial guidance, a 30% move higher in commodity prices from our guidance levels would increase adjusted EBITDA by around $100 million, while a 30% decrease would reduce adjusted EBITDA by around $60 million. This asymmetric risk, where we have significantly more upside than downside across commodity prices continues to be an area of focus at Targa where our commercial teams are working really well with our producers and other customers to maintain alignment to be in a position to continue to invest across cycles. As we look forward, we believe that Targa is in excellent position to continue to provide best-in-class service to our customers and create additional value for our shareholders. I will now turn the call over to Jen to discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2022 results in more detail as well as our expectations for 2023.\nJen Kneale: Thanks, Matt. Good morning, everyone. Targa's reported quarterly adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $840 million, increasing 9% sequentially as we benefited from the first full quarter of our Delaware Basin acquisition, optimization opportunities and recent processing additions across our Permian systems despite lower commodity prices and operational impacts from Winter Storm Elliott. Full year 2022 adjusted EBITDA was $2.9 billion, 41% increase over 2021, driven by record volumes in gathering and processing, NGL transportation and fractionation. Our consolidated leverage ratio at the end of the year was 3.7x well within our long-term leverage ratio target range. We spent approximately $552 million on growth capital projects in the fourth quarter and our full year 2022 growth capital spend was $1.177 billion, about $30 million of growth capital shifted from 2022 into 2023. Maintenance capital spend for 2022 was about $168 million. We repurchased approximately $28 million of common shares in the fourth quarter. And as Matt mentioned, had approximately $144 million remaining under our $500 million share repurchase program at year-end. In early January, we announced and shortly thereafter closed our acquisition of the remaining 25% interest in our Grand Prix NGL pipeline for approximately $1.05 billion. The acquisition price represented an 8.75x multiple of Grand Prix's estimated 2023 adjusted EBITDA, which we believe was an attractive purchase price. With 100% ownership of Grand Prix, including our Daytona pipeline expansion, we benefit from having significantly more operational flexibility and also near and longer term capital synergies. We funded the Grand Prix acquisition through a successful $1.75 billion offering of 10 and 30 year senior notes and used the incremental proceeds to reduce borrowings on our revolver. We currently have about $2.5 billion of available liquidity, which provides us with a lot of flexibility looking forward. Turning to our expectations for 2023, as Matt described in his remarks, we really are very excited about the continued momentum at Targa. We estimate full year 2023 adjusted EBITDA to be between $3.5 billion and $3.7 billion, a 24% increase over 2022 based on the midpoint of our range, assuming commodity prices of $2.25 per MMBtu for Waha natural gas, $0.70 per gallon for our weighted average NGL barrel and $75 per WTI crude oil barrel. We are well hedged across 2023 and beyond and are benefiting from significant additional fee-based margin year-over-year. We expect significant margin benefit in the first quarter from increased LPG exports, natural gas and natural gas and NGL marketing optimization opportunities. Please see the additional disclosures that we added to our investor presentation this morning on sensitivities to commodity price changes and our hedges. We currently estimate between $1.8 billion and $1.9 billion of growth capital spending based on announced projects and other identified spending and $175 million of net maintenance capital spending. Operationally, high activity levels continue across our dedicated acreage in the Permian. Our reported full year 2023 average Permian Basin natural gas inlet volumes are projected to increase about 10% over average fourth quarter 2022 Permian inlet volumes. There is no change to the estimated in-service dates of our plants under construction with the Legacy II and Midway plants expected in service in the second quarter of 2023. Greenwood in service late in the fourth quarter of 2023 and Wildcat II in service in the first quarter of 2024. As Matt mentioned, we are also moving a plant acquired in our South Texas transaction to the Permian Delaware which we are calling Roadrunner II and expect in service in the second quarter of 2024. The significant increase in Permian Basin volumes is expected to result in record NGL transportation and fractionation volumes in 2023. There is no change to the expected in-service dates of our major downstream projects with Train 9 expected to be complete in the second quarter of 2024 and the Daytona NGL pipeline complete by the end of 2024. GCF will provide some much needed help on the fractionation side, and we expect it fully restarted in the first quarter of 2024. We will also benefit from the mid-2023 completion of our project at our Galena Park LPG export facility, which will increase our propane loading capabilities by about 1 million barrels per month. We are well contracted across our export facility and are estimating that 2023 will be a record year for LPG export volumes for Targa as well. We expect to pay an annualized common dividend in 2023 of $2 per share and have the flexibility to continue to use our common share repurchase program opportunistically to return incremental capital to shareholders through the year. Our balance sheet is strong with leverage near the midpoint of our long-term leverage ratio target range of 3x to 4x, and we expect to end 2023 around the midpoint of our range, providing continued flexibility for Targa going forward. Lastly, I would like to echo Matt and extend a thank you to our employees, their continued focus on safety while executing on our strategic priorities and continuing to provide best-in-class services to our customers. And with that, I will turn the call back over to Sanjay.\nSanjay Lad: Thanks, Jen. For the Q&A session, we kindly ask that you limit to one question and one follow-up and reenter the lineup if you have additional questions. Carmen, would you please open the lines for Q&A?\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we have our first question from the line of Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nJeremy Tonet: Hi, good morning.\nMatt Meloy: Hey, Good morning, Jeremy.\nJen Kneale: Good morning.\nJeremy Tonet: I wanted to touch on the 2023 guide, and I want to touch on three components to it, if I could. Just wondering as far as Permian volume growth, I'm just wondering, the growth seems very strong here. Do you see yourselves growing faster than the base on your acreage? Or do you see yourself taking market share just curious on the drivers of the strong Permian growth there. And then also, I guess, the drivers \u2013 what are the drivers behind marketing optimization stepping up in LPG exports stepping up? Just color on those points would be super helpful.\nMatt Meloy: Yes, sure, Jeremy. On the Permian growth, yes, we are seeing significant activity across our acreage, both in the Delaware and the Midland, so part of that relates to the recent acquisition that we made. There is a lot of activity. And frankly, it's exceeding our expectations for the opportunities there. I don't know, Pat, do you want to give some additional color on what we're seeing in Permian?\nPat McDonie: Sure. And if you think about this year versus last year, you start January and February with basically 50 more rigs than what you had last year. They levelize for the remainder of the year, but obviously, off to a better start than what we saw last year. Then when you look historically of how Targa performed in the Midland Basin, we always have outperformed the average growth across the Midland Basin. We performed well in the Delaware Basin, but Lucid on the other hand, significantly outperformed the average growth in the Delaware Basin. So with that asset in our Delaware side of our overall Permian portfolio, we have the best-performing assets on the Midland side, the best-performing assets on the Delaware side. That coupled with the rigs currently running on that acreage. Our line of sight with a great producer group and what they're doing, and we're very in tune with them. We feel very, very good about our volume forecast.\nScott Pryor: And then Jeremy, as it relates \u2013 this is Scott, as it relates to the LPG export business and the growth that we're seeing for 2023. Just recognize third quarter versus fourth quarter. Our fourth quarter volumes were up. We expect that our first quarter volumes here in 2023 will be up there. And then obviously, with the increase in production that we're seeing, on our integrated platform, speaking to what Pat was talking about feeding through our downstream assets, we see opportunities there for continued growth. And that is certainly complemented by the growth that we're seeing across the global marketplaces. Benefiting on that side is things like the reopening of the Chinese marketplace. Increased demand for PDH demand in Asia as a result of that. We\u2019ve also seen improvements on the shipping side because we\u2019re seeing new deliveries of VLGCs which is providing more liquidity on the water and certainly some improvements in efficiencies out of the Panama Canal. So I think the combination of all those, which will certainly also benefit with the small expansion that Jen spoke to in her opening comments, that will be online mid-year. That 1 million barrels per month of additional capacity will just complement what we\u2019re doing. And as Jen also mentioned, we continue to be highly contracted while also feeling comfortable about the available space that we would have to participate in a spot market when the market presents itself. So that lends flexibility to our customers, reliability to our customers while also providing economic benefit to Targa when the pricing firms up at times.\nMatt Meloy: Yes. And just to add to that, Scott, and Jeremy, I know you asked about our optimization on our marketing, I\u2019d say we had really good opportunities in the fourth quarter in both NGL markets and natural gas markets as we move a lot of volumes of both products. And when there\u2019s increased volatility, which we saw in the fourth quarter, we were able to optimize and make some additional margin there. And we\u2019re off to a strong start in the first quarter as well, which is why we kind of pointed to that in our 2023 guide. So we\u2019re already kind of factoring in some of that that has already occurred this year. So we do expect a strong first quarter because of some of that optimization as well.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. Great to hear, strong data points across all three components there. And just one last question, if I could. I want to touch on capital allocation a little bit more, and you gave some thoughts in the prepared remarks and in the PR, but I just wanted to touch on, I guess, how you think about that in the future? I mean, we had a very nice 43% step-up in the dividend here. It\u2019s going to be an annual determination going forward. But \u2013 how do you see \u2013 can you give any more color on what future years could look like to bookend us to make sure we don\u2019t get off the rails. And as far as capital spend is concerned, is this kind of how \u2013 kind of closer to the peak? Or do you expect this level to persist?\nMatt Meloy: Sure. Yes, Jeremy, on capital allocation, our priority within how we want to spend both organically and return capital to shareholders. We want to start with a strong balance sheet and make sure we have flexibility to continue to invest and to continue to return capital to shareholders over time. The good thing about our forecast and what we\u2019re showing this year is we think we can do all of that. We think we can grow our EBITDA, invest in our business while significantly increasing the dividend, which we did \u2013 or which we anticipate to do for 2023. I think we have the ability for future significant dividend increases as we go forward. Just as you look at our EBITDA growth, strong balance sheet, I think we\u2019ll have some ability to continue to grow the dividend while continuing to buy back shares. We were pretty active in 2022, buying back shares. I see us being opportunistic in how we buy back those shares, but we have the significant ability to continue to repurchase shares. So that is where we see us position, growing our EBITDA, growing our dividend and reducing our share count over time.\nJeremy Tonet: Wonderful. Thank you so much.\nMatt Meloy: Okay. Thanks, Jeremy.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And it comes from the line of Brian Reynolds with UBS. Please proceed.\nBrian Reynolds: Hi, good morning, everyone. Maybe just to follow-up on some of the guidance assumptions. You talked about the 10% Permian exit-to-exit growth, which implies just really strong Permian growth once again. You recently had some plants come online full during 4Q, and it seems like plants can\u2019t come online fast enough with over half of capacity coming online next year. So curious of how much of those offloaded volumes coming back on the Targa system post the Lucid acquisition is baked into that volume forecast? Or should we effectively assume those volumes coming back onto the system as upside to your Permian growth forecast? Thanks.\nPat McDonie: I would say that we do have some offloads in the Delaware Basin and minimal on the Midland side because we just brought a plan up, right? And we\u2019ve got another plant coming up fairly quickly in the next, call it, six to eight weeks on the Midland side. So we feel like we\u2019re in pretty good shape in Midland. And there isn\u2019t anything currently being offloaded that will come back on to the system. On the Delaware side, because Lucid was behind in processing capacity, we had some things to do there. We brought up the Red Hills VI plant in September. Frankly, it was immediately full. We had existing connections between the Targa Delaware system and the Lucid system, which we were immediately able to offload 150 million a day into our Far West plant complex is the Peregrine and Falcon plants and we had available capacity. We also had contracted some third-party offload capacity, which we have retained because, frankly, the performance of those assets is better than what we had in our acquisition case. And I think you can see by what we\u2019ve announced, we\u2019ve got the Wildcat II plant coming on. Midway will be that \u2013 Midway that will be that midway point, basically adding capacity in May. Wildcat II at the end of the year, the very beginning of next year because of the anticipated growth and the Roadrunner announcement right behind that coming on because, frankly, we\u2019re going to need it. But we\u2019ve done some things in the meantime. We\u2019ve increased our ability to move the old Lucid system, what we call Targa North Delaware gas into our Far West plants, which, again, we have available capacity. So over the next, let\u2019s call it, 9 months to 12 months, one will fill up the Midway capacity. We had a little bit of remaining capacity at Wildcat. We have a sweet plant at Loving that\u2019s kind of our swing plant that will fill up. And then we utilize the offload in the Peregrine and Falcon capacity to get us to the Wildcat II plant. And don\u2019t forget, we have the ability to run our plants over nameplate, which can give us another 100 million to 150 million a day of incremental capacity.\nBrian Reynolds: Great. Thanks. Sounds like there\u2019s a significant amount of roadway of growth in the Delaware over the year. As my follow-up, the last 24 months, we\u2019ve just seen Targa integrate and simplify itself in a series of transactions to become the S&P 500 company it is today. Moving forward, as you talked about, there seems to be a healthy amount of organic growth opportunities within Targa. And thus, given the amount of organic growth backlog, should we view the recent Grand Prix M&A as kind of the last piece of simplification of Targa at this time? Or are there other missing pieces to the portfolio that could use some of that excess free cash? Thanks.\nJen Kneale: This is Jen. I don\u2019t think that there are any missing pieces to the portfolio. I think we are very pleased with the asset footprint that we have and see significant opportunities for continued organic investment going forward that will help underpin that increasing year-over-year EBITDA growth that we expect. The Blackstone acquisition, you\u2019re exactly right. That, in our view, was an acquisition, but a simplification as well. And I think operationally and in terms of how we invest capital around our NGL transportation assets going forward, it just gives us enhanced flexibility. So we do see that as sort of the final piece of our simplification story. Going back to beginning with the DevCo and then the TRC preferred repurchase.\nBrian Reynolds: Great. I\u2019ll leave it there. Thanks for the color and enjoy the rest of your day. Thanks.\nJen Kneale: Thank you.\nMatt Meloy: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And it comes from the line of Spiro Dounis with Citi. Please proceed.\nSpiro Dounis: Thanks, operator. Good morning, team. I wanted to go back to the commodity sensitivity that and that asymmetry that Matt referenced earlier. I guess it\u2019s a bit different than how you guys were traded in the past. And I guess I\u2019m just curious, is that an indication that that fee floors could trigger before a 30% down move in commodity prices. I know the calculation is probably a bit complex, but just curious how you\u2019re thinking about the fee floors and maybe what\u2019s embedded in that low end of the guidance beyond the commodity move down?\nJen Kneale: Spiro, this is Jen. We\u2019re really proud of the efforts of our commercial teams over the last many years to put in fee floors really across our gathering and processing businesses. And part of what we wanted to provide today was additional information that indicates that the Targa of today looks very different than the Targa of several years ago. And a big reason for that is the fee floors that we have in place. So we tried to publish was that if you had a significant move downward in commodity prices, it would be, call it a 30% down move would be about a $60 million impact to our 2023 adjusted EBITDA. And I think that is again reflective of not only the fee floors, but we also just have a lot more fee-based margin now both on the logistics and transportation side, which is essentially all fee-based margin and then also on the gathering and processing side, where the Lucid acquisition was the latest element of fee-based margin that we brought into the portfolio. So I really think it\u2019s a combination of a number of factors that we think demonstrates that Targa\u2019s downside exposure is significantly reduced today than what it was previously. And that\u2019s all enhanced by our hedging program that really hasn\u2019t changed over the last several years. But I do think that it\u2019s realistic to assume that in a 30% leg down in commodity prices across the Board versus what we had in our guidance, the fee floors would all be in play at that point.\nSpiro Dounis: Okay. Got it. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks for that, Jen. And then maybe just to go back to the volume growth. It sounds like it is exceeding expectations and a lot of discussions so far has been around the processing plants. And Jen, I know you mentioned that all the in-service dates for expansions, including Daytona, are all still in place. But I guess on my math and just based on some of this discussion, it would seem like Grand Prix is going to get pretty tight potentially before Daytona could come online. So I\u2019m just curious, is there an ability to bring that on sooner or in phases? Or do you have any sort of bridging solutions if that gets tighter than expected?\nScott Pryor: Spiro, this is Scott. First off, I would say that when we look at Grand Prix, we\u2019ve been \u2013 obviously, the success of that is evident. And the continued growth that we\u2019ll see in the Permian will feed into that. Just recognize that as we enter into 2023, we\u2019ve got some additional pump stations that will commission throughout 2023, probably more heavily in the first half of this year versus the back half of the year. And during that time frame, we would push our overall capacity up to what we call our nameplate of roughly 550,000 barrels a day just on the West leg alone. We feel comfortable that we can likely operate above that, call it, in the 600,000 barrel a day range. And then we will certainly be expediting as quickly as we can the installation of the Daytona pipeline. Fourth quarter of 2024 is kind of where we\u2019re at with that. We\u2019re calling at the end of 2024, but we\u2019ll be working hard to make sure we get that online as quickly as possible. In the interim, if we do have some situations where we need to offload capacity, we\u2019ve got a number of plants that are connected to multiple pipelines, and they\u2019re not solely dependent upon just the Grand Prix pipeline. So we feel that we\u2019ve got a lot of flexibility to manage through it. We certainly want to make sure that it\u2019s preferred that the volumes are moving on our pipelines. But we\u2019ve got some opportunities to manage through that, if necessary, if the volume growth exceeds our expectations.\nSpiro Dounis: Great. Appreciate all the color today, guys. Thank you.\nScott Pryor: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And it comes from the line of Theresa Chen with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nTheresa Chen: Good morning. I\u2019d love to get your take on the frac outlook, given the tightness that we\u2019re seeing evidence in anecdotes of tightness in the Gulf Coast, maybe most recently from the restart announcement at GCF, would you mind giving us an update on your outlook on utilization for the part of the value chain and general demand outlook for the purity product maybe touching on some that LPG export commentary? What are you hearing from your petchem customers? What are your general expectations for demand for ethane and LPGs?\nScott Pryor: Again, this is Scott. So when we look at the fractionation complex that we have, certainly bringing on GCF that the partnership has agreed to restart. That will start. We expect to commission that in the first quarter of 2024, and that will be needing capacity. I will say that when you look at our volumes that we had from third quarter to fourth quarter of 2022, those probably don\u2019t illustrate exactly the volume growth that we\u2019re seeing over time across our various assets and alluding to the comments that Pat made as it relates to our growth on the G&P side of our business. We did have some planned and unplanned outage at our facility during the fourth quarter, which really basically is behind us now. So we feel as though that we should be at our \u2013 basically at our full complement of fractionation capacity going forward. And some of that, when you look at the impacts of that, we\u2019re also impacted by Winter Storm Elliott. We obviously have substantial amount of storage that allows us to manage the influx of products on the inbound side, whether it\u2019s Y-grade, spec products as well as on the outbound side. So we feel very comfortable with that. But certainly, the additive of Train 9 coming on in the second quarter of next year will be an important piece of the pie for us from a fractionation perspective. As it relates to the distribution of products on the spec side, certainly, products of inflow of product coming into us. The LPG export facility that we have at Galena Park is a very important integral piece of our platform that we have today for propane as well as butanes. And again, what we mentioned earlier with the small expansion we have that provides us additional capacity there. And so we feel very comfortable with our expectations on that side. As it relates to ethane, certainly, the market continues to pull on the ethane molecule. We\u2019ve had a number of petchem expansions that have been announced recently. New expansions have come online over the course of the last two years. And our team has done an excellent job as we\u2019ve added fractionation capacity as we have future expansions that are coming online, the team has done an excellent job of increasing our connectivity to the downstream petrochemical market to make sure that we can clear that ethane molecule. So we view that that is a continuation of that. And I think the petchem industry is starting to really get more on solid footing as it relates to improvements in the global economy that going forward look good for us.\nTheresa Chen: Thank you. And Jen, I wanted to go back to your comments about the breakdown between fee-based versus commodity-based margin. Now that you are 85% fee-based, as you bring online incremental processing capacity embedded with contract escalators over time fee floors, et cetera, how do you think this breakdown evolves? And with the asymmetric risk that you currently see within that 60% band, do you see that becoming more favorably skewed going forward as you layer in more for fee floors and general fee-based margin?\nJen Kneale: I think that we have demonstrated a commitment to our producers to continue to invest capital and infrastructure to support their drilling activities. But in order to do that, we need to have protections in place that we\u2019ll get at least a minimum rate of return on that invested capital. And so I think that we have seen good support in our areas where we are spending capital to put in fee floors and we are trying to bring that to other basins as well as contracts come up for expiration or there\u2019s a catalyst for a renegotiation. And I do think it creates excellent alignment for us to continue to invest and benefit from higher commodity prices, but have a little bit of production in a lower commodity price environment. I think it\u2019s difficult to see us going from 85% fee-based margin to 100% fee-based margin just by the nature of our assets. I think we\u2019re also very comfortable with the commodity price exposure that we have, particularly if it can be with a fee floor structure in place. So I think that\u2019s the trend that will continue for us. And our commercial teams have really done a great job of putting those fee floors in place when they\u2019ve had the opportunity to do so. And so I believe that, that will continue to be a big point of focus for us, but it\u2019s difficult to predict what that means in terms of where fee-based margin goes in the future. But I would expect that we will continue to have more margin protected with the fee floor structure.\nTheresa Chen: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And it comes from the line of Colton Bean with Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Please proceed.\nColton Bean: Good morning. So the transport and frac unit margins were up materially relative to Q3. Any drivers on that apart from lower OpEx? And was there a mix shift in basin origin or any contracts that moved around and then between the two transport and frac any weighting in terms of the margin uplift?\nMatt Meloy: Yes, sure. Hey, Colton. We really benefited from a couple of things there. We had, as I mentioned before, some optimization just related to our marketing activities in both NGL marketing and gas marketing. What Scott also mentioned is our fracs that we had some planned and unplanned maintenance, we were bringing in more fractionation volumes, and we were able to fractionate. So here in the first quarter, those are behind us, and we\u2019ll be operating closer to nameplate, so we have the opportunity to either build inventory or to do some offload. So we were able to execute some offload at cheaper rates than our overall T&F. So it kind of creates the margin spread for us even though our volumes did move up as much. So I\u2019d say we have more volumes coming in than kind of what was reported because that\u2019s what we actually fracked, but we were able to do some third-party offloads that work is really behind us. So we have more capacity now in Q1. So that is, for us, creating a little bit more flexibility in terms of the overall frac market. And with other fracs coming on in 2023, we see some looseness in 2023 in the frac market. So we\u2019ll be able to, I think, be in good position ahead of GCS start-up and Train 9 coming on. But it was really a combination of all those things.\nColton Bean: Okay. And so it sounds like it was more concentrated on the frac side and relatively stable for transport?\nMatt Meloy: Yes. I think that\u2019s about right.\nColton Bean: Great. And then on OpEx. So Q4 was relatively flat for G&P and actually down in logistics. I think previously, you were expecting continued increases as you had a full quarter of Lucid and then higher overall activity. So just \u2013 was Q4 more of a structural shift in your outlook? Or should we still expect that step-up in expense levels heading into 2023?\nJen Kneale: Colton, this is Jen. What tends to happen is through the year, we overestimate what our ad val costs may end up being just because we generally tend to forecast conservatively. And so as those costs come in throughout the year, it means that often fourth quarter OpEx for us steps down a little bit versus prior quarters on that front. So that was a benefit for us in the fourth quarter. And then our teams have also done just an excellent job of managing our operating expenses as well. Within the fourth quarter, we did have OpEx associated with Winter Storm Elliott, which our team did a great job of managing through. We\u2019ll actually have a little bit of OpEx that comes into the first quarter related to Winter Storm Elliott, but it\u2019s also just a really well management, particularly on the G&P side, where we did have the step up or expected step-up from the Lucid acquisition and then managed it very, very well. On the downstream side, we had the benefit also of lower ad valorem costs in the fourth quarter. And we also had repairs and maintenance in the third quarter that Scott mentioned. And so there was a step down there just because we did not have those repairs and maintenance in the fourth quarter. Those were one-time.\nColton Bean: Great. Appreciate the time.\nJen Kneale: Thank you.\nMatt Meloy: Okay. Thanks, Colton.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question, please. And it comes from the line of Keith Stanley with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nKeith Stanley: Hi. Good morning. Thank you. Just wanted to start on commodities and hedges. So if I compare the hedge prices for 2023 to the forward curve where it sits, are your hedges now in the money, would you say, for this year? And so additive to EBITDA or are they below market still? Asking across commodities, just to try to give a better picture of where an unhedged outlook might be for 2023 versus the $3.5 billion to $3.7 billion guidance?\nJen Kneale: On the hedge disclosures that we gave this morning on the natural gas side, that\u2019s aggregated swaps across everywhere that we hedge. So I\u2019d say that the majority of those hedges are Waha swaps where actually would say that Waha prices for balanced 2023 are now lower than where we have hedged. So it\u2019s a little bit of a mixed bag depending on each basis point that we hedge to and the swaps that we have in place there. On the NGL side, I think where prices are right now is really since the beginning of the year, we\u2019ve seen NGL prices that are a little bit higher than where we have hedges in place. We\u2019ll just have to see how that plays out for calendar 2023, and we\u2019ll be continuing to layer in hedges as we move through time and then our exposure to WTI crude prices just isn\u2019t that significant, but prices are a little bit lower, I think, today than where we\u2019ve got our hedge prices sitting.\nKeith Stanley: Okay. So overall, big picture, you\u2019re a little above market on gas, a little below on NGLs and crude, but net-net, it doesn\u2019t sound like the hedges materially change what the EBITDA outlook is for the year?\nJen Kneale: No, I think that\u2019s fair. We had, call it, north of $400 million of hedged losses in 2022, and we\u2019ve said that we\u2019re hedged at higher prices this year. So articulated that that was a tailwind for 2023 relative to 2022. And then when we think about where hedges are relative to where prices sit today, maybe a little bit of a tailwind, but we\u2019ll have to see how it plays out through the year.\nKeith Stanley: Got it. Okay. Thank you. Second question was just on the CapEx guidance, are you baking in any spend for unannounced plants or other likely future spending? And related to that, just how are you thinking about the potential need to start work on a frac 10 before the end of this year? Or is that now pushed out into 2024 with the GCS?\nMatt Meloy: Yes, sure. So for \u2013 we have the five plants that we have announced. And also said in the script, we are ordering long lead time items for another plant in the Permian Midland. So we factored in some of that CapEx into this overall guidance. So it really depends on when we greenlight that and say, okay, we are going forward with it. So there could be some additional shift of capital if we greenlight that plant sooner rather than later. And I\u2019d say right now, we are evaluating even though we\u2019re adding Wildcat II and Roadrunner II, we are evaluating potentially another plant out in the Delaware. So we\u2019re going to see kind of how the first part of this year plays out and if we need to go forward with another plant sooner rather than later. Right now, that\u2019s not factored in. We\u2019re evaluating. We have a lot of plants coming on between the Midway Wildcat II, Roadrunner, and we have some offload capability. So we\u2019re trying to be capital efficient there, but we kind of have our eye on when we\u2019re going to need another plant in the Delaware. As far as frac Train 10, again, I think let\u2019s see how volumes kind of play out this year and what producers are saying for next year. We have Train 9 coming on. We have GCF coming on. But we are talking about when we\u2019re going to need Train 10 when you have kind of 10-ish percent growth on the footprint that we have, that significant amount of NGLs moving through Grand Prix moving into our frac. So I\u2019d say we\u2019re having discussions on when we\u2019re going to need to add Train 10, and we\u2019re trying to kind of evaluate that as the year plays out.\nKeith Stanley: Thank you.\nMatt Meloy: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question, please. And it comes from the line of Neel Mitra with Bank of America. Please proceed.\nNeel Mitra: Hi. Good morning. I was wondering if you could speak to the capital associated with moving Roadrunner to the Delaware. How that would compare to a new build? And then where would you be moving that plant into the Delaware? And where are you seeing that pocket of growth that would require that plant to be moved there?\nMatt Meloy: Yes, sure. What\u2019s great about where we\u2019re moving that is it\u2019s connected to our existing footprint, so the Roadrunner II will be right next to the Roadrunner I plant, which was part of the Lucid acquisition. There\u2019s the Red Hills complex and the Roadrunner, which will now be a complex when we add that there. The overall capital fed is about $120-or-so million for that move. So it is capital efficient relative to just doing a new build. The new builds are, say, closer to $175 million, give or take. Those are \u2013 the new builds are about $275 million. The Roadrunner move is about, call it, $230-or-so million. So you get a little more capacity on the new build, but still on a per unit basis, a little bit better for the move and timing, being able to move it does help our timing. As Pat mentioned, we\u2019re getting tighter on capacity out there. So moving it is quicker than just putting a new build out there.\nNeel Mitra: Okay. So just to clarify, this would be for the Lucid acreage and wouldn\u2019t necessarily connect to Grand Prix. Is that fair?\nMatt Meloy: What\u2019s interesting is what\u2019s the Lucid acreage were started now it\u2019s all Targa and it\u2019s really getting mixed. When you talk to producers, is it \u2013 a Targa system, it\u2019s all becoming really quickly all one system out there. And Sorry, Bobby, do you want to add some color on that?\nBobby Muraro: Yes, this is Bobby. I was just going to say also when you think about the scale of the system in the Midland Basin and the fungibility across areal extent of it. You don\u2019t exactly drop a plant right on top of acreage that you see coming because we can move volumes across the entire system. So as we start to build out the Delaware in the same manner, such that we\u2019re putting plants, generally speaking, where we see growth. All the growth doesn\u2019t have to happen right at the top of the year because of the fungibility of that system. And the integration of the loose assets that we bought into our existing asset footprint with the big AMI we did with Chevron several years ago, it creates fungibility such that, that\u2019s a convenient place and a fast place to put Roadrunner, but it also is gas can flow from lots of different spots to that plant.\nMatt Meloy: We\u2019re also working to connect Roadrunner and integrate that system into Grand Prix, so we\u2019re building that line now.\nNeel Mitra: Got it. And then if I could just follow up on Grand Prix. It seems like for the second half of 2022 volumes were relatively flattish. And I know early 3Q, you had some ethane rejection and that\u2019s set to recovery, maintenance and weather, should we see a step-up back in kind of 1Q? Or are there any other kind of lingering issues on Grand Prix in the volumes for you, you start stepping back up to kind of be consistent with the processing growth?\nMatt Meloy: Yes. We expect volumes to start moving higher here as we get into the year. What you see there is Grand Prix is mix between Permian and our North leg, which goes up into Oklahoma. We\u2019ve seen continued growth on our West leg. We have seen volumes move South a little bit kind of as we\u2019ve not as much strength there as you\u2019ve seen in the Permian. So it\u2019s looked relatively flat. But we are already seeing it. Frankly, the start of this year we\u2019re seeing volumes move higher, and that\u2019s what we would expect in Grand Prix as we move through the year, pretty strong growth there.\nBobby Muraro: And I would also just add, Matt, that we've got \u2013 the second half of this year, we've got some third-party contract contribution that will be coming in from the North leg more the back half of the year. So you'll see those volumes starting to ramp up for deliveries into Belvieu as well.\nJen Kneale: And just so we touch on every quarter of growth for Grand Prix. In the second quarter, we'll have Legacy II coming online and then the additional capacity available at Midway. So those will be nice catalysts in the second quarter.\nMatt Meloy: Yes.\nNeel Mitra: Got it. Thank you for all the color.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And comes from the line of John Mackay with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nJohn Mackay: Hey. Thanks for the time. Wanted to just sit on Permian growth for another half second and clarify one comment from before. Were you saying that \u2013 the growth outlook right now is 10% off of fourth quarter 2022 assumes no incremental rate adds off of what we've seen so far through February? That's the first part. And then second, I'd love to just hear how you're thinking about the other basins, relatively less gas-driven exposure, of course, but we're seeing slowdowns elsewhere. So curious what your view on maybe the Barnett and others look like? Thanks.\nMatt Meloy: Yes. I'll hit the first one, and then Pat can comment on the second. Yes, we were not specific on the rig adds I'd say we do a bottoms-up build with our producers in both Midland and Delaware, and there's a combination of some folks adding and doing more and some doing less or shifting, so it's an aggregate of all of those. We don't \u2013 we haven't given one number instead it assumes rig adds or takeaways. It's a bottoms-up build, but we also kind of do a top down and say how they performed relative to history. And then what do we really expect to do. So it's kind of the usual way we do a forecast on that. And then, Pat, do you want to hit on other basis?\nPat McDonie: Sure. We'll start in Oklahoma. We've seen, frankly good activity in both our South Oklahoma and our Western Oklahoma areas. Good activities relative to, let's call it the last three, four years prior to that, obviously, there was a lot of activity. But enough so that we're able to offset decline. Frankly, in Southern Oklahoma, we show where we were basically flat and frankly that includes a pretty significant chunk of volume rolled off under a contract, and we were able to fill that back in behind. So we are seeing some activity there. North Texas, we have \u2013 we've seen volume growth on our system, and we continue to see drilling activity. Certainly, it and frankly Southern Oklahoma are more sensitive to gas prices. So we have expectations at the beginning of the year here that we'll get to incremental volumes. There are planned drilling on our system throughout the year. We'll ultimately see how those pan out dependent upon commodity prices and the decisions of those producers. Our South Texas activity has been very good. The addition of the Southcross assets and the sour gas capabilities there have added a level of drilling activity and some of our contracts that originally underpinned the assets, those producers are active. So we've seen benefits in volumes from both of those kind of types of producers. So we feel good about volume growth there, but it's not significant in the overall scheme of things. [Indiscernible] same thing, a good steady pace of drilling. So good replacement of crude oil and natural gas, are we going to say how we're going to significantly grow in that basin. Now are we going to hold our own and see some slight growth probably?\nJohn Mackay: All right. That's great. Thank you for all that. Maybe just one last one for me on CapEx. Just curious if you could talk a little bit about any inflation pressure you're still seeing flowing through, whether that's on the plants or on kind of just gathering compression side, just anything kind of directionally there? And how we can kind of think about that going forward? Thanks.\nMatt Meloy: Yes. We are seeing some higher costs, whether it's compression pipelines or just the larger facilities we're putting in place. And I'd say part of the CapEx, too, that included in the 1.8, 1.9 this year is us with longer lead times on some of the assets, we are buying some compression right now, which is longer lead time, which is actually for 2024. So part of it is us getting ready because I know there's going to be future growth next year because lead times have been extended is pushing some more CapEx into this year as well. So part of it has been inflation, part of it is us trying to get ahead of kind of some of the supply chain disruptions and lead time growth.\nJohn Mackay: All right. Thanks for the comment. Appreciate it.\nMatt Meloy: Okay. Thanks John.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Okay. One moment please. We have a technical difficulties on this side. All right. And our last question for today will be from Sunil Sibal with Seaport Global. Please proceed.\nSunil Sibal: Yes. Hi. Good morning, everybody.\nMatt Meloy: Good morning.\nSunil Sibal: I just wanted to get a little bit of clarity on the returns on investments. I think a few years back, you had talked about a 5 to 7x kind of EBITDA multiple for gathering and processing capital spend. I was curious how that has changed in the current environment?\nJen Kneale: I think that we've actually seen an improvement in those returns, partially because as a result of, I think, being very capital efficient when we bring new projects online, they tend to be very well utilized, particularly on the gathering and processing side. So we've actually seen the returns improve just as a result of utilization as we try to get plants constructed as quickly as possible, but as Pat mentioned, sometimes have to operate the system overcapacity prior to a new plant coming online and/or utilized third-party offloads, that means that once the new plant is online, it tends to be very highly utilized or at least that has been our very recent history. And so I think that's driving returns lower on that side of the business \u2013 returns higher on that side of the business, so multiples lower, sorry.\nMatt Meloy: Yes. I'd say \u2013 just to add to that, I think as we think about going forward, 5% to 7% is still kind of what we think about and how we would articulate returns. We were able to execute better than that. If you look back over the last five years, closer to 4 times. And also part of that is we were successful in investments like, for example, GCX. We invested and we sold that at a significant multiple of capital, a really good return for us, and that kind of nets into the CapEx number. So we had some onetime items like that, which also helped drive that higher. But I think 5% to 7% is a good kind of planning case and we'll of course try to beat that through optimizing, but 5% to 7% is a good point in case.\nSunil Sibal: Okay. Thanks for that. And then one clarification. I think in the past, you've talked about the spend on the compression and pipeline being 1:1 with a new builder processing plant cost. So I think on the previously in the call, you said $175 million is what a new typical processing plant is costing. So is that 1:1 thumbnail [ph] still good for the other capital to fill up the plant?\nMatt Meloy: Yes. I think over time, that's a reasonable assumption. I'd say now what we have been seeing recently is potentially even a little bit more capital efficient than that. So maybe a little bit less as some of our producers are being more efficient with where they're drilling; so\u2013 but it can vary from year-to-year. So I'd say that's not an unreasonable assumption. Maybe I'll take the under on that. Maybe it's a little bit less gathering and compression versus the $175 million to fill up a plant but it can vary from year-to-year as well.\nSunil Sibal: Got it. Thanks for that and congratulations on a good print.\nJen Kneale: Thanks Sunil.\nMatt Meloy: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our Q&A Session. I will turn the call back to Sanjay Lad for final remarks.\nSanjay Lad: Thank you, everyone, that was on the call this morning, and we appreciate your interest in Targa Resources. The IR Team will be available for any follow-up questions you may have. Have a great day.\nOperator: Thank you, and everybody, this concludes today's conference call.

            "name": "Pat McDonie",
            "content": "Sure. And if you think about this year versus last year, you start January and February with basically 50 more rigs than what you had last year. They levelize for the remainder of the year, but obviously, off to a better start than what we saw last year. Then when you look historically of how Targa performed in the Midland Basin, we always have outperformed the average growth across the Midland Basin. We performed well in the Delaware Basin, but Lucid on the other hand, significantly outperformed the average growth in the Delaware Basin. So with that asset in our Delaware side of our overall Permian portfolio, we have the best-performing assets on the Midland side, the best-performing assets on the Delaware side. That coupled with the rigs currently running on that acreage. Our line of sight with a great producer group and what they're doing, and we're very in tune with them. We feel very, very good about our volume forecast. I would say that we do have some offloads in the Delaware Basin and minimal on the Midland side because we just brought a plan up, right? And we've got another plant coming up fairly quickly in the next, call it, six to eight weeks on the Midland side. So we feel like we're in pretty good shape in Midland. And there isn't anything currently being offloaded that will come back on to the system. On the Delaware side, because Lucid was behind in processing capacity, we had some things to do there. We brought up the Red Hills VI plant in September. Frankly, it was immediately full. We had existing connections between the Targa Delaware system and the Lucid system, which we were immediately able to offload 150 million a day into our Far West plant complex is the Peregrine and Falcon plants and we had available capacity. We also had contracted some third-party offload capacity, which we have retained because, frankly, the performance of those assets is better than what we had in our acquisition case. And I think you can see by what we've announced, we've got the Wildcat II plant coming on. Midway will be that \u2013 Midway that will be that midway point, basically adding capacity in May. Wildcat II at the end of the year, the very beginning of next year because of the anticipated growth and the Roadrunner announcement right behind that coming on because, frankly, we're going to need it. But we've done some things in the meantime. We've increased our ability to move the old Lucid system, what we call Targa North Delaware gas into our Far West plants, which, again, we have available capacity. So over the next, let's call it, 9 months to 12 months, one will fill up the Midway capacity. We had a little bit of remaining capacity at Wildcat. We have a sweet plant at Loving that's kind of our swing plant that will fill up. And then we utilize the offload in the Peregrine and Falcon capacity to get us to the Wildcat II plant. And don't forget, we have the ability to run our plants over nameplate, which can give us another 100 million to 150 million a day of incremental capacity. Sure. We'll start in Oklahoma. We've seen, frankly good activity in both our South Oklahoma and our Western Oklahoma areas. Good activities relative to, let's call it the last three, four years prior to that, obviously, there was a lot of activity. But enough so that we're able to offset decline. Frankly, in Southern Oklahoma, we show where we were basically flat and frankly that includes a pretty significant chunk of volume rolled off under a contract, and we were able to fill that back in behind. So we are seeing some activity there. North Texas, we have \u2013 we've seen volume growth on our system, and we continue to see drilling activity. Certainly, it and frankly Southern Oklahoma are more sensitive to gas prices. So we have expectations at the beginning of the year here that we'll get to incremental volumes. There are planned drilling on our system throughout the year. We'll ultimately see how those pan out dependent upon commodity prices and the decisions of those producers. Our South Texas activity has been very good. The addition of the Southcross assets and the sour gas capabilities there have added a level of drilling activity and some of our contracts that originally underpinned the assets, those producers are active. So we've seen benefits in volumes from both of those kind of types of producers. So we feel good about volume growth there, but it's not significant in the overall scheme of things. [Indiscernible] same thing, a good steady pace of drilling. So good replacement of crude oil and natural gas, are we going to say how we're going to significantly grow in that basin. Now are we going to hold our own and see some slight growth probably?"

            "name": "Jen Kneale",
            "content": "Thanks, Matt. Good morning, everyone. Targa's reported quarterly adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $840 million, increasing 9% sequentially as we benefited from the first full quarter of our Delaware Basin acquisition, optimization opportunities and recent processing additions across our Permian systems despite lower commodity prices and operational impacts from Winter Storm Elliott. Full year 2022 adjusted EBITDA was $2.9 billion, 41% increase over 2021, driven by record volumes in gathering and processing, NGL transportation and fractionation. Our consolidated leverage ratio at the end of the year was 3.7x well within our long-term leverage ratio target range. We spent approximately $552 million on growth capital projects in the fourth quarter and our full year 2022 growth capital spend was $1.177 billion, about $30 million of growth capital shifted from 2022 into 2023. Maintenance capital spend for 2022 was about $168 million. We repurchased approximately $28 million of common shares in the fourth quarter. And as Matt mentioned, had approximately $144 million remaining under our $500 million share repurchase program at year-end. In early January, we announced and shortly thereafter closed our acquisition of the remaining 25% interest in our Grand Prix NGL pipeline for approximately $1.05 billion. The acquisition price represented an 8.75x multiple of Grand Prix's estimated 2023 adjusted EBITDA, which we believe was an attractive purchase price. With 100% ownership of Grand Prix, including our Daytona pipeline expansion, we benefit from having significantly more operational flexibility and also near and longer term capital synergies. We funded the Grand Prix acquisition through a successful $1.75 billion offering of 10 and 30 year senior notes and used the incremental proceeds to reduce borrowings on our revolver. We currently have about $2.5 billion of available liquidity, which provides us with a lot of flexibility looking forward. Turning to our expectations for 2023, as Matt described in his remarks, we really are very excited about the continued momentum at Targa. We estimate full year 2023 adjusted EBITDA to be between $3.5 billion and $3.7 billion, a 24% increase over 2022 based on the midpoint of our range, assuming commodity prices of $2.25 per MMBtu for Waha natural gas, $0.70 per gallon for our weighted average NGL barrel and $75 per WTI crude oil barrel. We are well hedged across 2023 and beyond and are benefiting from significant additional fee-based margin year-over-year. We expect significant margin benefit in the first quarter from increased LPG exports, natural gas and natural gas and NGL marketing optimization opportunities. Please see the additional disclosures that we added to our investor presentation this morning on sensitivities to commodity price changes and our hedges. We currently estimate between $1.8 billion and $1.9 billion of growth capital spending based on announced projects and other identified spending and $175 million of net maintenance capital spending. Operationally, high activity levels continue across our dedicated acreage in the Permian. Our reported full year 2023 average Permian Basin natural gas inlet volumes are projected to increase about 10% over average fourth quarter 2022 Permian inlet volumes. There is no change to the estimated in-service dates of our plants under construction with the Legacy II and Midway plants expected in service in the second quarter of 2023. Greenwood in service late in the fourth quarter of 2023 and Wildcat II in service in the first quarter of 2024. As Matt mentioned, we are also moving a plant acquired in our South Texas transaction to the Permian Delaware which we are calling Roadrunner II and expect in service in the second quarter of 2024. The significant increase in Permian Basin volumes is expected to result in record NGL transportation and fractionation volumes in 2023. There is no change to the expected in-service dates of our major downstream projects with Train 9 expected to be complete in the second quarter of 2024 and the Daytona NGL pipeline complete by the end of 2024. GCF will provide some much needed help on the fractionation side, and we expect it fully restarted in the first quarter of 2024. We will also benefit from the mid-2023 completion of our project at our Galena Park LPG export facility, which will increase our propane loading capabilities by about 1 million barrels per month. We are well contracted across our export facility and are estimating that 2023 will be a record year for LPG export volumes for Targa as well. We expect to pay an annualized common dividend in 2023 of $2 per share and have the flexibility to continue to use our common share repurchase program opportunistically to return incremental capital to shareholders through the year. Our balance sheet is strong with leverage near the midpoint of our long-term leverage ratio target range of 3x to 4x, and we expect to end 2023 around the midpoint of our range, providing continued flexibility for Targa going forward. Lastly, I would like to echo Matt and extend a thank you to our employees, their continued focus on safety while executing on our strategic priorities and continuing to provide best-in-class services to our customers. And with that, I will turn the call back over to Sanjay. Good morning. This is Jen. I don't think that there are any missing pieces to the portfolio. I think we are very pleased with the asset footprint that we have and see significant opportunities for continued organic investment going forward that will help underpin that increasing year-over-year EBITDA growth that we expect. The Blackstone acquisition, you're exactly right. That, in our view, was an acquisition, but a simplification as well. And I think operationally and in terms of how we invest capital around our NGL transportation assets going forward, it just gives us enhanced flexibility. So we do see that as sort of the final piece of our simplification story. Going back to beginning with the DevCo and then the TRC preferred repurchase. Thank you. Spiro, this is Jen. We're really proud of the efforts of our commercial teams over the last many years to put in fee floors really across our gathering and processing businesses. And part of what we wanted to provide today was additional information that indicates that the Targa of today looks very different than the Targa of several years ago. And a big reason for that is the fee floors that we have in place. So we tried to publish was that if you had a significant move downward in commodity prices, it would be, call it a 30% down move would be about a $60 million impact to our 2023 adjusted EBITDA. And I think that is again reflective of not only the fee floors, but we also just have a lot more fee-based margin now both on the logistics and transportation side, which is essentially all fee-based margin and then also on the gathering and processing side, where the Lucid acquisition was the latest element of fee-based margin that we brought into the portfolio. So I really think it's a combination of a number of factors that we think demonstrates that Targa's downside exposure is significantly reduced today than what it was previously. And that's all enhanced by our hedging program that really hasn't changed over the last several years. But I do think that it's realistic to assume that in a 30% leg down in commodity prices across the Board versus what we had in our guidance, the fee floors would all be in play at that point. I think that we have demonstrated a commitment to our producers to continue to invest capital and infrastructure to support their drilling activities. But in order to do that, we need to have protections in place that we'll get at least a minimum rate of return on that invested capital. And so I think that we have seen good support in our areas where we are spending capital to put in fee floors and we are trying to bring that to other basins as well as contracts come up for expiration or there's a catalyst for a renegotiation. And I do think it creates excellent alignment for us to continue to invest and benefit from higher commodity prices, but have a little bit of production in a lower commodity price environment. I think it's difficult to see us going from 85% fee-based margin to 100% fee-based margin just by the nature of our assets. I think we're also very comfortable with the commodity price exposure that we have, particularly if it can be with a fee floor structure in place. So I think that's the trend that will continue for us. And our commercial teams have really done a great job of putting those fee floors in place when they've had the opportunity to do so. And so I believe that, that will continue to be a big point of focus for us, but it's difficult to predict what that means in terms of where fee-based margin goes in the future. But I would expect that we will continue to have more margin protected with the fee floor structure. Colton, this is Jen. What tends to happen is through the year, we overestimate what our ad val costs may end up being just because we generally tend to forecast conservatively. And so as those costs come in throughout the year, it means that often fourth quarter OpEx for us steps down a little bit versus prior quarters on that front. So that was a benefit for us in the fourth quarter. And then our teams have also done just an excellent job of managing our operating expenses as well. Within the fourth quarter, we did have OpEx associated with Winter Storm Elliott, which our team did a great job of managing through. We'll actually have a little bit of OpEx that comes into the first quarter related to Winter Storm Elliott, but it's also just a really well management, particularly on the G&P side, where we did have the step up or expected step-up from the Lucid acquisition and then managed it very, very well. On the downstream side, we had the benefit also of lower ad valorem costs in the fourth quarter. And we also had repairs and maintenance in the third quarter that Scott mentioned. And so there was a step down there just because we did not have those repairs and maintenance in the fourth quarter. Those were one-time. Thank you. On the hedge disclosures that we gave this morning on the natural gas side, that's aggregated swaps across everywhere that we hedge. So I'd say that the majority of those hedges are Waha swaps where actually would say that Waha prices for balanced 2023 are now lower than where we have hedged. So it's a little bit of a mixed bag depending on each basis point that we hedge to and the swaps that we have in place there. On the NGL side, I think where prices are right now is really since the beginning of the year, we've seen NGL prices that are a little bit higher than where we have hedges in place. We'll just have to see how that plays out for calendar 2023, and we'll be continuing to layer in hedges as we move through time and then our exposure to WTI crude prices just isn't that significant, but prices are a little bit lower, I think, today than where we've got our hedge prices sitting. No, I think that's fair. We had, call it, north of $400 million of hedged losses in 2022, and we've said that we're hedged at higher prices this year. So articulated that that was a tailwind for 2023 relative to 2022. And then when we think about where hedges are relative to where prices sit today, maybe a little bit of a tailwind, but we'll have to see how it plays out through the year. And just so we touch on every quarter of growth for Grand Prix. In the second quarter, we'll have Legacy II coming online and then the additional capacity available at Midway. So those will be nice catalysts in the second quarter. I think that we've actually seen an improvement in those returns, partially because as a result of, I think, being very capital efficient when we bring new projects online, they tend to be very well utilized, particularly on the gathering and processing side. So we've actually seen the returns improve just as a result of utilization as we try to get plants constructed as quickly as possible, but as Pat mentioned, sometimes have to operate the system overcapacity prior to a new plant coming online and/or utilized third-party offloads, that means that once the new plant is online, it tends to be very highly utilized or at least that has been our very recent history. And so I think that's driving returns lower on that side of the business \u2013 returns higher on that side of the business, so multiples lower, sorry. Thanks Sunil."

            "name": "Bobby Muraro",
            "content": "Yes, this is Bobby. I was just going to say also when you think about the scale of the system in the Midland Basin and the fungibility across areal extent of it. You don't exactly drop a plant right on top of acreage that you see coming because we can move volumes across the entire system. So as we start to build out the Delaware in the same manner, such that we're putting plants, generally speaking, where we see growth. All the growth doesn't have to happen right at the top of the year because of the fungibility of that system. And the integration of the loose assets that we bought into our existing asset footprint with the big AMI we did with Chevron several years ago, it creates fungibility such that, that's a convenient place and a fast place to put Roadrunner, but it also is gas can flow from lots of different spots to that plant. And I would also just add, Matt, that we've got \u2013 the second half of this year, we've got some third-party contract contribution that will be coming in from the North leg more the back half of the year. So you'll see those volumes starting to ramp up for deliveries into Belvieu as well."
        },
        "speaker4": {
            "name": "Scott Pryor",
            "content": "And then Jeremy, as it relates \u2013 this is Scott, as it relates to the LPG export business and the growth that we're seeing for 2023. Just recognize third quarter versus fourth quarter. Our fourth quarter volumes were up. We expect that our first quarter volumes here in 2023 will be up there. And then obviously, with the increase in production that we're seeing, on our integrated platform, speaking to what Pat was talking about feeding through our downstream assets, we see opportunities there for continued growth. And that is certainly complemented by the growth that we're seeing across the global marketplaces. Benefiting on that side is things like the reopening of the Chinese marketplace. Increased demand for PDH demand in Asia as a result of that. We've also seen improvements on the shipping side because we're seeing new deliveries of VLGCs which is providing more liquidity on the water and certainly some improvements in efficiencies out of the Panama Canal. So I think the combination of all those, which will certainly also benefit with the small expansion that Jen spoke to in her opening comments, that will be online mid-year. That 1 million barrels per month of additional capacity will just complement what we're doing. And as Jen also mentioned, we continue to be highly contracted while also feeling comfortable about the available space that we would have to participate in a spot market when the market presents itself. So that lends flexibility to our customers, reliability to our customers while also providing economic benefit to Targa when the pricing firms up at times. Spiro, this is Scott. First off, I would say that when we look at Grand Prix, we've been \u2013 obviously, the success of that is evident. And the continued growth that we'll see in the Permian will feed into that. Just recognize that as we enter into 2023, we've got some additional pump stations that will commission throughout 2023, probably more heavily in the first half of this year versus the back half of the year. And during that time frame, we would push our overall capacity up to what we call our nameplate of roughly 550,000 barrels a day just on the West leg alone. We feel comfortable that we can likely operate above that, call it, in the 600,000 barrel a day range. And then we will certainly be expediting as quickly as we can the installation of the Daytona pipeline. Fourth quarter of 2024 is kind of where we're at with that. We're calling at the end of 2024, but we'll be working hard to make sure we get that online as quickly as possible. In the interim, if we do have some situations where we need to offload capacity, we've got a number of plants that are connected to multiple pipelines, and they're not solely dependent upon just the Grand Prix pipeline. So we feel that we've got a lot of flexibility to manage through it. We certainly want to make sure that it's preferred that the volumes are moving on our pipelines. But we've got some opportunities to manage through that, if necessary, if the volume growth exceeds our expectations. Okay, thank you. Again, this is Scott. So when we look at the fractionation complex that we have, certainly bringing on GCF that the partnership has agreed to restart. That will start. We expect to commission that in the first quarter of 2024, and that will be needing capacity. I will say that when you look at our volumes that we had from third quarter to fourth quarter of 2022, those probably don't illustrate exactly the volume growth that we're seeing over time across our various assets and alluding to the comments that Pat made as it relates to our growth on the G&P side of our business. We did have some planned and unplanned outage at our facility during the fourth quarter, which really basically is behind us now. So we feel as though that we should be at our \u2013 basically at our full complement of fractionation capacity going forward. And some of that, when you look at the impacts of that, we're also impacted by Winter Storm Elliott. We obviously have substantial amount of storage that allows us to manage the influx of products on the inbound side, whether it's Y-grade, spec products as well as on the outbound side. So we feel very comfortable with that. But certainly, the additive of Train 9 coming on in the second quarter of next year will be an important piece of the pie for us from a fractionation perspective. As it relates to the distribution of products on the spec side, certainly, products of inflow of product coming into us. The LPG export facility that we have at Galena Park is a very important integral piece of our platform that we have today for propane as well as butanes. And again, what we mentioned earlier with the small expansion we have that provides us additional capacity there. And so we feel very comfortable with our expectations on that side. As it relates to ethane, certainly, the market continues to pull on the ethane molecule. We've had a number of petchem expansions that have been announced recently. New expansions have come online over the course of the last two years. And our team has done an excellent job as we've added fractionation capacity as we have future expansions that are coming online, the team has done an excellent job of increasing our connectivity to the downstream petrochemical market to make sure that we can clear that ethane molecule. So we view that that is a continuation of that. And I think the petchem industry is starting to really get more on solid footing as it relates to improvements in the global economy that going forward look good for us."

            "name": "Matt Meloy",
            "content": "Thanks, Sanjay. And good morning to everyone. 2022 was an excellent year for Targa, and I would like to recognize and thank our employees for their focus, dedication and execution. Some of our highlights from 2022 include record safety performance based on multiyear low total reportable incident rate, record gathering and processing volumes in the Permian, record volumes across our logistics and transportation assets, record adjusted EBITDA of $2.9 billion, a 41% increase over 2021 while also reducing our share count. Major projects came online on time, on budget and have been highly utilized since start-up. Execution and successful integration of our Delaware Basin acquisition and our South Texas acquisition, execution of our corporate simplification with our DevCo repurchase and preferred share redemption, successful sale of our 25% equity interest in Gulf Coast Express Pipeline for approximately 11 times EBITDA, upgrades to investment grade by all of the rating agencies and completion of two successful investment-grade offerings and higher year-over-year return of capital to our shareholders through both an increased common dividend and continued common share repurchases. We expect our momentum to continue through 2023 and beyond, given the strength of the business fundamentals underpinning our assets. There is a continued need for critical midstream infrastructure like Targa's to balance and link cost advantaged U.S. production to domestic and global markets. Global events have underscored the critical nature of safe, reliable and affordable fossil fuels to support everyday life domestically and around the world. Cost advantage basins like the Permian, where we are the largest gatherer and processor of natural gas, will continue to be a key supplier of hydrocarbons for decades to come. We are less than two months into the year and already had some notable announcements, including the successful negotiation and closing of our acquisition of the remaining 25% interest in our Grand Prix NGL pipeline, our early January offering of 10- and 30-year senior notes that funded the Grand Prix acquisition and reduced floating rate borrowings on our revolver. And within this morning's release, our operational and financial estimates for 2023, which are expected to be records across many fronts, including an estimated 24% increase in year-over-year adjusted EBITDA. Our transfer and construction of a plant from our South Texas acquisition to the Delaware Basin, which we are calling the Roadrunner II plant, where activity around Southern New Mexico is currently exceeding our expectations. And an expected 43% year-over-year increase to our 2023 annualized common dividend per share versus last year. For 2023, we estimate that our adjusted EBITDA will be between $3.5 billion and $3.7 billion. The significant year-over-year increase in adjusted EBITDA is driven by higher expected gathering and processing volumes, higher expected NGL transportation, fractionation and export volumes, higher expected marketing optimization and LPG export opportunities, higher fees from contract escalators, a full year contribution from our Delaware Basin and South Texas acquisitions, contribution from our acquisition of the remaining 25% interest in Grand Prix and higher hedge prices. Related to capital allocation, maintaining a strong investment-grade balance sheet across cycles continues to be a priority at Targa. We also have attractive opportunities to continue to invest organically, which we believe will support the continued creation of significant shareholder value over time. We currently estimate between $1.8 billion and $1.9 billion of growth capital in 2023 as we build infrastructure that we expect to be highly utilized across our footprint. Our major projects in progress are core to our business, five new Permian gas processing plants, Train 9 fractionator and our Daytona NGL pipeline. Along with our partners, we are also in the process of restarting the 135,000 barrel per day Gulf Coast fractionator in Mont Belvieu, which we expect to be operational in the first quarter of 2024. Beyond those projects already announced, and in progress, we are evaluating when we will need additional gas processing capacity in the Permian, and we are ordering long lead time items for our next Midland plant. We believe our organic growth opportunities create value for Targa and our investors over time as we have demonstrated strong returns over the last five years. As you can see from Slide 4 in our earnings supplement presentation, we generated an attractive 26% return on invested capital since 2017, despite a volatile commodity price backdrop over the last several years. For our recent major capital projects, we have invested at a low single-digit multiple of EBITDA as the immediate high utilization of assets like new gas processing plants have resulted in very attractive returns despite higher build costs from inflation. A strong balance sheet and continued investment in high-return projects positions us to continue to prudently return an increasing amount of capital to our shareholders across cycles. We announced an expectation of a 43% year-over-year increase to our annualized 2023 common dividend per share this morning. The increased dividend will be recommended to our Board in April for the first quarter of 2023 with payment to shareholders in May. Our expected 2023 dividend increase reflects a lot of different factors, including our near- and long-term business fundamentals and balance sheet strength across scenarios, flexibility associated with our increasing size, scale and fee-based margin and Targa's positioning relative to our midstream C-Corp peers [ph], the S&P 500 and cyclical industries within the S&P 500. We also expect to be in a position to continue to execute opportunistically under our common share repurchase program, which will allow us to further increase our return of capital to shareholders and reduce our share count over time. We bought back $225 million worth of common shares in 2022 and had about $144 million remaining under the $500 million share repurchase program we put in place in October 2020. Our current expectation is we will request Board approval to authorize a new $1 billion share repurchase program once we exhaust our existing program. We believe that we will offer a unique value proposition for our shareholders and potential shareholders, growing EBITDA, growing dividend and reducing share count. We expect to continue to set expectations for our annual common dividend each February when we announce our financial and operational guidance and expect to continue to increase our return of capital to shareholders over time. In addition, to our standard annual disclosures around our financial expectations, we also included in our investor presentation this morning, describing Targa across upside and downside commodity price scenarios. We have spent the last many years focused on increasing our cash flow stability and reducing our volatility to downward moving commodity prices. As you can see from Slide 12 in our earnings presentation relative to our full year 2023 financial guidance, a 30% move higher in commodity prices from our guidance levels would increase adjusted EBITDA by around $100 million, while a 30% decrease would reduce adjusted EBITDA by around $60 million. This asymmetric risk, where we have significantly more upside than downside across commodity prices continues to be an area of focus at Targa where our commercial teams are working really well with our producers and other customers to maintain alignment to be in a position to continue to invest across cycles. As we look forward, we believe that Targa is in excellent position to continue to provide best-in-class service to our customers and create additional value for our shareholders. I will now turn the call over to Jen to discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2022 results in more detail as well as our expectations for 2023. Hey, Good morning, Jeremy. Yes, sure, Jeremy. On the Permian growth, yes, we are seeing significant activity across our acreage, both in the Delaware and the Midland, so part of that relates to the recent acquisition that we made. There is a lot of activity. And frankly, it's exceeding our expectations for the opportunities there. I don't know, Pat, do you want to give some additional color on what we're seeing in Permian? Yes. And just to add to that, Scott, and Jeremy, I know you asked about our optimization on our marketing, I'd say we had really good opportunities in the fourth quarter in both NGL markets and natural gas markets as we move a lot of volumes of both products. And when there's increased volatility, which we saw in the fourth quarter, we were able to optimize and make some additional margin there. And we're off to a strong start in the first quarter as well, which is why we kind of pointed to that in our 2023 guide. So we're already kind of factoring in some of that that has already occurred this year. So we do expect a strong first quarter because of some of that optimization as well. Sure. Yes, Jeremy, on capital allocation, our priority within how we want to spend both organically and return capital to shareholders. We want to start with a strong balance sheet and make sure we have flexibility to continue to invest and to continue to return capital to shareholders over time. The good thing about our forecast and what we're showing this year is we think we can do all of that. We think we can grow our EBITDA, invest in our business while significantly increasing the dividend, which we did \u2013 or which we anticipate to do for 2023. I think we have the ability for future significant dividend increases as we go forward. Just as you look at our EBITDA growth, strong balance sheet, I think we'll have some ability to continue to grow the dividend while continuing to buy back shares. We were pretty active in 2022, buying back shares. I see us being opportunistic in how we buy back those shares, but we have the significant ability to continue to repurchase shares. So that is where we see us position, growing our EBITDA, growing our dividend and reducing our share count over time. Okay. Thanks, Jeremy. Okay. Thank you. Yes, sure. Hey, Colton. We really benefited from a couple of things there. We had, as I mentioned before, some optimization just related to our marketing activities in both NGL marketing and gas marketing. What Scott also mentioned is our fracs that we had some planned and unplanned maintenance, we were bringing in more fractionation volumes, and we were able to fractionate. So here in the first quarter, those are behind us, and we'll be operating closer to nameplate, so we have the opportunity to either build inventory or to do some offload. So we were able to execute some offload at cheaper rates than our overall T&F. So it kind of creates the margin spread for us even though our volumes did move up as much. So I'd say we have more volumes coming in than kind of what was reported because that's what we actually fracked, but we were able to do some third-party offloads that work is really behind us. So we have more capacity now in Q1. So that is, for us, creating a little bit more flexibility in terms of the overall frac market. And with other fracs coming on in 2023, we see some looseness in 2023 in the frac market. So we'll be able to, I think, be in good position ahead of GCS start-up and Train 9 coming on. But it was really a combination of all those things. Yes. I think that's about right. Okay. Thanks, Colton. Yes, sure. So for \u2013 we have the five plants that we have announced. And also said in the script, we are ordering long lead time items for another plant in the Permian Midland. So we factored in some of that CapEx into this overall guidance. So it really depends on when we greenlight that and say, okay, we are going forward with it. So there could be some additional shift of capital if we greenlight that plant sooner rather than later. And I'd say right now, we are evaluating even though we're adding Wildcat II and Roadrunner II, we are evaluating potentially another plant out in the Delaware. So we're going to see kind of how the first part of this year plays out and if we need to go forward with another plant sooner rather than later. Right now, that's not factored in. We're evaluating. We have a lot of plants coming on between the Midway Wildcat II, Roadrunner, and we have some offload capability. So we're trying to be capital efficient there, but we kind of have our eye on when we're going to need another plant in the Delaware. As far as frac Train 10, again, I think let's see how volumes kind of play out this year and what producers are saying for next year. We have Train 9 coming on. We have GCF coming on. But we are talking about when we're going to need Train 10 when you have kind of 10-ish percent growth on the footprint that we have, that significant amount of NGLs moving through Grand Prix moving into our frac. So I'd say we're having discussions on when we're going to need to add Train 10, and we're trying to kind of evaluate that as the year plays out. Okay. Thank you. Yes, sure. What's great about where we're moving that is it's connected to our existing footprint, so the Roadrunner II will be right next to the Roadrunner I plant, which was part of the Lucid acquisition. There's the Red Hills complex and the Roadrunner, which will now be a complex when we add that there. The overall capital fed is about $120-or-so million for that move. So it is capital efficient relative to just doing a new build. The new builds are, say, closer to $175 million, give or take. Those are \u2013 the new builds are about $275 million. The Roadrunner move is about, call it, $230-or-so million. So you get a little more capacity on the new build, but still on a per unit basis, a little bit better for the move and timing, being able to move it does help our timing. As Pat mentioned, we're getting tighter on capacity out there. So moving it is quicker than just putting a new build out there. What's interesting is what's the Lucid acreage were started now it's all Targa and it's really getting mixed. When you talk to producers, is it \u2013 a Targa system, it's all becoming really quickly all one system out there. And Sorry, Bobby, do you want to add some color on that? We're also working to connect Roadrunner and integrate that system into Grand Prix, so we're building that line now. Yes. We expect volumes to start moving higher here as we get into the year. What you see there is Grand Prix is mix between Permian and our North leg, which goes up into Oklahoma. We've seen continued growth on our West leg. We have seen volumes move South a little bit kind of as we've not as much strength there as you've seen in the Permian. So it's looked relatively flat. But we are already seeing it. Frankly, the start of this year we're seeing volumes move higher, and that's what we would expect in Grand Prix as we move through the year, pretty strong growth there. Yes. Yes. I'll hit the first one, and then Pat can comment on the second. Yes, we were not specific on the rig adds I'd say we do a bottoms-up build with our producers in both Midland and Delaware, and there's a combination of some folks adding and doing more and some doing less or shifting, so it's an aggregate of all of those. We don't \u2013 we haven't given one number instead it assumes rig adds or takeaways. It's a bottoms-up build, but we also kind of do a top down and say how they performed relative to history. And then what do we really expect to do. So it's kind of the usual way we do a forecast on that. And then, Pat, do you want to hit on other basis? Yes. We are seeing some higher costs, whether it's compression pipelines or just the larger facilities we're putting in place. And I'd say part of the CapEx, too, that included in the 1.8, 1.9 this year is us with longer lead times on some of the assets, we are buying some compression right now, which is longer lead time, which is actually for 2024. So part of it is us getting ready because I know there's going to be future growth next year because lead times have been extended is pushing some more CapEx into this year as well. So part of it has been inflation, part of it is us trying to get ahead of kind of some of the supply chain disruptions and lead time growth. Okay. Thanks John. Good morning. Yes. I'd say \u2013 just to add to that, I think as we think about going forward, 5% to 7% is still kind of what we think about and how we would articulate returns. We were able to execute better than that. If you look back over the last five years, closer to 4 times. And also part of that is we were successful in investments like, for example, GCX. We invested and we sold that at a significant multiple of capital, a really good return for us, and that kind of nets into the CapEx number. So we had some onetime items like that, which also helped drive that higher. But I think 5% to 7% is a good kind of planning case and we'll of course try to beat that through optimizing, but 5% to 7% is a good point in case. Yes. I think over time, that's a reasonable assumption. I'd say now what we have been seeing recently is potentially even a little bit more capital efficient than that. So maybe a little bit less as some of our producers are being more efficient with where they're drilling; so\u2013 but it can vary from year-to-year. So I'd say that's not an unreasonable assumption. Maybe I'll take the under on that. Maybe it's a little bit less gathering and compression versus the $175 million to fill up a plant but it can vary from year-to-year as well. Okay. Thank you."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that, today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Sanjay Lad, VP of Finance and Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nSanjay Lad: Thanks, Gigi. Good morning, and welcome to the Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Call for Targa Resources Corp. The third quarter earnings release, along with the third quarter earnings supplement presentation for Targa Resources that accompany our call are available on our website at targaresources.com in the Investors section. In addition, an updated investor presentation has also been posted to our website. Statements made during this call that might include Targa Resources' expectations or predictions should be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in forward-looking statements. For a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ, please refer to our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and latest SEC filings. Our speakers for the call today will be Matt Meloy, Chief Executive Officer; Pat McDonie, President, Gathering and Processing; Scott Pryor, President, Logistics and Transportation; Robert Muraro, Chief Commercial Officer; and Jen Kneale, Chief Financial Officer. I will now turn the call over to Matt, who is recovering from laryngitis for his comments and Q&A participation today will be limited.\nMatt Meloy: Thanks, Sanjay, and good morning, and apologies for my hoarse voice. Our overall business is continuing to perform well and our strong execution continued across the third quarter, including record high quarterly EBITDA, record volumes in the Permian, record NGL transportation and fractionation volumes, integration of our Delaware Basin acquisition, successfully bringing on two plants in the Permian Basin safely, ahead of schedule and on budget, $73 million of opportunistic common share repurchases, and were also recently added to the S&P 500. Our record third quarter EBITDA was attributable to higher base business volumes, particularly in the Permian, plus a partial quarter contribution from our Delaware Basin acquisition. While commodity prices are significantly lower than the assumptions underlying the updated full year 2022 financial expectations that we provided in early August. There is no change to our expectation to generate full year adjusted EBITDA between $2.85 billion and $2.95 billion. Given the significant growth in volumes that we expect looking forward and to catch up on some of our Delaware Basin infrastructure, we announced this morning that we are moving forward with a new 275 million cubic feet per day gas processing plant in the Permian Delaware, which we are calling the Wildcat II plant. The growth in volumes across our G&P business also necessitated the announcement this morning that we are kicking off construction of the Daytona NGL pipeline, which will transport volumes from the Permian Basin and connect to our existing segment of Grand Prix and North Texas, to move volumes down to Mont Belvieu. The acceleration of these additional projects shift some spending into 2022, but there is no change to our year-end 2022 leverage ratio expectation of about 3.5 times, meaning we continue to have significant financial flexibility looking forward. Before I turn the call over to Pat, I would like to extend a thank you to our employees for their continued focus on safety while executing on our strategic priorities and continuing to provide best-in-class services to our customers. I will now turn it over to Pat, to discuss our G&P operations in more detail. Pat?\nPat McDonie: Thanks Matt and good morning everyone. Starting in the Permian our systems across the Midland and Delaware Basins averaged a record 4.1 billion cubic feet per day of volumes during the third quarter, including two months of contribution from our recently completed Delaware Basin acquisition. Given our performance year-to-date we expect our full year average 2022 Permian volume not including our Delaware Basin acquisition to increase at the high end of our initial 12% to 15% year-over-year volume guidance. In Permian Midland, our inlet volumes increased 8%, sequentially as our system essentially ran at capacity until our new legacy plant came online late in the third quarter. We have an incremental 550 million cubic feet per day of processing expansions underway in Permian Midland. Our Legacy two plant remains on track to begin operations during the second quarter of 2023. And our Greenwood plant remains on track to begin operations late in the fourth quarter of 2023. Similarly, we expect both plants to be highly utilized when they come online next year. In Permian Delaware, inlet volumes across our system not including contribution from our Delaware Basin acquisition increased 7% sequentially. We have successfully integrated our Delaware Basin assets and employees and appreciate the efforts of the collective Targa team that supported the integration. We commenced operations on our new 230 million cubic feet per day Red Hills VI plant in late September which was full at start-up. Our overall Delaware system is also running highly -- very highly utilized and volumes continue to ramp. And we remain on track to bring our new 275 million cubic per day Midway plant online during the second quarter of 2023. In response to strong producer activity levels and to meet the infrastructure needs of our customers across the Delaware and as Matt previously mentioned, we are moving forward with the construction of a new $275 million per day plant in Permian Delaware which we are calling the Wildcat II plant. Wildcat II is expected to begin operations in the first quarter of 2024. We are playing some catch-up on our newly acquired Delaware Basin assets as evidenced by Red Hills VI being full at startup, the expectation that Midway will be highly utilized on start-up and now moving forward with construction of the Wildcat II facility. All a positive reflection of how quickly current volumes are increasing and future volumes are expected to increase. We are also adding incremental treating infrastructure in the Delaware to increase our gas handling capabilities which enhances our ability to capture and handle increasing gas production and drive attractive returns from treating fees. This will also give us the ability to capture CO2 from the treating process and sequester the emissions in our acid gas injection storage wells. We have already obtained Class II permits and are working on MRV plans and additional Class II and Class VI permits to further enhance our carbon capture abilities. We expect to begin receiving 45Q tax credits as early as the fourth quarter of 2023. Shifting to the backgrounds our natural gas and crude gathered volumes rebounded in the third quarter following the reduced reported volumes impacted by late weather storms in the prior quarter. In our Central region a full quarter contribution from the acquired assets in South Texas and solid activity levels in Oklahoma and North Texas drove a sequential increase in aggregate volumes during the third quarter partially offset via contract expiration in South Texas. Scott will now discuss our logistics and transportation business in more detail. Scott?\nScott Pryor: Thanks Pat. Targa's NGL transportation volumes were a record 500,000 barrels per day. Fractionation volumes were a record 742,000 barrels per day during the third quarter. Our volumes would have been higher had it not been for some ethane rejection across our system and third-party systems during the third quarter plus some maintenance at our Mont Belvieu facility. Given the anticipated growth from our volume growth from our Permian G&P expansions growth of third-party volumes and volumes we can transport after the expirations of obligations on third-party pipelines our outlook for continued NGL transportation volume growth is strong. Today we announced plans to construct the Daytona NGL pipeline to transport NGLs from the Permian Basin and connect to the 30-inch diameter segment of the Grand Prix NGL pipeline in North Texas. Daytona is expected to be in service by the end of 2024. Targa will own 75% of Daytona and Blackstone Energy Partners will own 25% and with each member funding the respective share of the pipeline's cost based on their ownership percentage. With an estimated project cost of about $650 million Targa's net growth CapEx share is estimated to be approximately $488 million. In Mont Belvieu construction continues on our Train nine fractionator which is expected to begin operations during the second quarter of 2024 with an estimated cost of around $450 million. Turning to our LPG exports. We loaded an average of 8.5 million barrels per month during the third quarter as we were impacted by reduced spot cargo opportunities and some cancellations due to weaker global market conditions. We currently expect fourth core volumes to improve but will be impacted by similar global dynamics and some required maintenance at the terminal. Our low-cost LPG export expansion project to increase our propane loading capabilities with an incremental one million barrels per month of capacity remains on track for mid-2023. I'll now turn the call over to Jen.\nJen Kneale: Thanks Scott. Good morning everyone. Our record quarterly adjusted EBITDA and operational stats reflect that our business is performing really well. Our balance sheet is strong. We are continuing to invest in our business. We are returning an increasing amount of capital to our shareholders and we are very excited about Targa's outlook. Let's now go over some additional financial information. Targa's reported quarterly adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter was $769 million increasing 15% sequentially as we benefited from a partial quarter contribution from our Delaware Basin acquisition, higher volumes across our gathering and processing and logistics and transportation systems and higher fees partially offset by lower NGL prices and higher operating expenses. Higher operating expenses were primarily attributable to our recent Delaware Basin acquisition, increasing activity levels across our G&P systems, including two plants placed in service in the quarter and inflation. While costs were higher, just a reminder that for Targa, inflation is a net tailwind across our businesses, as we benefit from inflation-linked fee escalators across our commercial contracts. Targa generated adjusted free cash flow of $291 million in the third quarter. We repurchased about $73 million of common shares in the quarter and year-to-date through September 30 have repurchased about $197 million of common shares at a weighted average price of $65.23. Since program inception, we have repurchased about $328 million of shares at a weighted average price of $35.45. As of quarter end, we had approximately $172 million remaining under our $500 million equity repurchase program. For the third quarter, we declared a cash dividend of $0.35 per common share or $1.40 per share on an annualized basis and consistent with previous messaging expect to maintain the same dividend for the fourth quarter. Looking ahead, we currently plan to provide our full year 2023 operational and financial outlook in February, in conjunction with our fourth quarter earnings call and will also then provide color on our expected annualized dividend and share repurchase strategy for 2023. We are well hedged for the fourth quarter. Looking forward, we are currently about 80% hedged in 2023 across all commodities related to our exposure from our percent of proceeds contracts and are hedged at higher prices in 2023 than 2022 hedge prices. As Matt mentioned, our performance this year has been strong and we continue to estimate our leverage ratio will be around 3.5 times at year-end. During the third quarter, we upsized our accounts receivable securitization facility to $800 million and extended the facility to September 1, 2023. We spent about $625 million of net growth capital through the first three quarters of 2022. With some additional spending accelerating into 2022 for the Wildcat II plant and the Daytona NGL pipeline announced today, we now estimate 2022 net growth CapEx to be between $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion. Our estimate for 2022, net maintenance CapEx remains unchanged at approximately $150 million. We have strong momentum heading into 2023, backed by continued volume growth across our integrated businesses and we expect to benefit from full year contributions from our Delaware Basin and South Texas acquisitions, higher fees and higher hedge prices. We are focused on continuing to manage our leverage ratio within our three to four times long-term target range, with a preference to be in the lower half of the range and believe that the strength of our underlying business puts us in excellent position over the long term to continue to invest in attractive organic growth opportunities and return an increasing amount of capital to our shareholders. We published our 2021 sustainability report in early October and kicked off an initiative that is very important to us, where we engage with our largest shareholders each fall specifically around ESG to get feedback on our latest report and ESG-related efforts. We take our responsibility seriously and are committed to practices that create value for our shareholders and benefit the communities we serve and our latest report is hopefully reflective of that commitment. Lastly, I'd like to echo Matt and thank our employees for their dedication and for continuing to prioritize safety. With that, I will turn the call back over to Sanjay.\nSanjay Lad: Thanks, Jen. For the Q&A session, we kindly ask that you limit to one question and one follow-up and reenter the line up if you have additional questions. Gigi, would you please open the line for Q&A?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Colton Bean from Tudor Pickering Holt & Co.\nMatt Meloy : Good morning.\nColton Bean: So just starting off on Grand Prix, is there a general capacity buffer that you all were targeting when deciding when to bring Daytona into service? I guess asked differently, is there any risk of constraint on target NGL egress of Daytona timing were to slip a quarter or two?\nScott Pryor: Hi, Colton this is Scott. We've, obviously, been watching our volumes as it relates to Grand Prix both on the West leg and the North leg that feeds into Mont Belvieu for some time now and clearly watching the cadence of the plants that we've been adding on the G&P side of our business and along with the Delaware acquisition that we made. So we are keenly aware of the volumes that are moving and the timing of announcing Daytona fits with our expectations. We feel very comfortable with the fourth quarter operating that start in fourth quarter of 2024. And again with Daytona when you look at the volume growth that we've got from our G&P business, third-party volumes, expirations the third-party pipe volumes over time. It's a very good project for us. And especially it leverages the capacity that we've got available on our 30-inch pipeline that feeds into Mont Belvieu. So that gives us plenty of room over a period of time. I'd also like to state that when we start up Daytona and how it complements our Grand Prix West leg we'll also get some efficiency on the fuel side of things as we operate. It allows us to better operate pumps that are along the existing West leg in addition to how we would operate the pumps on the Daytona side.\nColton Bean: Great. And Jen maybe commenting over to hedges. I think you mentioned being above the normal course 75% for 2023. Can you expand on where you sit for next year and just the broader thought process on doing above your programmatic level?\nJen Kneale: I think based on the view that we had that there was likely to be Waha tightness and potential impacts on prices on the Waha side. We've added additional hedges particularly around natural gas, Colton. So are hedged above the 75% level on natural gas, actually significantly higher hedged than that right now for 2023. Then on the NGL side, we're a little bit higher hedged than the 75% level. Just continuing to watch backwardation of NGL price markets, and to the extent that we get strength we have tried to hedge into some of that strength. And then we've got a little bit of condensate exposure in our well hedged they're well north of that 75% level to. And those hedges are all related to our percent of proceeds contracts. So we do have commodity exposure elsewhere in our business, but have tried to do a very good job of hedging in advance of 2023 to help underpin continued cash flow stability across our businesses.\nColton Bean: Great. And it sounds like a natural gas the hedges also include an attempt to reduce basis risk.\nJen Kneale: Yes. We hedge directly to our basis points and certainly have tried to be far in advance of any price risk around Waha in 2023. Our gas marketing team has done a really good job of trying to manage not only takeaway transport but also our hedge exposure there.\nColton Bean: Great. I appreciate the time.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Jeremy Tonet from JPMorgan.\nJeremy Tonet: Hi, good morning.\nJen Kneale: Good morning, Jeremy.\nJeremy Tonet: I just want to kind of walk through, I guess, the results quarter because if you look at the last guide and we overlay kind of the commodities how they changed and what your sensitivities were it seemed to put some pressure on EBITDA expectations for the year possibly below the bottom end, yet you were able to reaffirm the guidance range. So it seems like some positives materialize versus I guess prior expectations there. Just wondering if you could provide a bit more detail on what those were and if you see them continuing into 2023. \nJen Kneale: I think that we have a pretty good track record of forecasting guidance conservatively, Jeremy, which is part of it. But also the underlying business is just performing really, really well. So when we think about the volume increases that we're seeing across our systems it feels like every quarter we're reporting record Permian volumes even ignoring the acquisition of the Delaware Basin assets, which will bring significantly more volumes to our system and then on the transportation and fractionation side as well. So while prices were weaker in the quarter, we're comfortable with where our guidance is set right now for the rest of the year. We've got only two months to go. And again, I think, that the business is performing so well that we're really setting up nicely heading into 2023 as well. \nJeremy Tonet: Got it. That's helpful there. And then looking at 2023 and recognizing the guide is not coming until February, but just wondering if you could provide any high-level thoughts as far as capital allocation where CapEx could shake out and how you think about the best way to return capital. \nJen Kneale: I think 2022 provides a little bit of a road map for how we're thinking about returning capital to shareholders. We entered 2022 focused on managing our leverage to levels that we are comfortable with and then also simplifying and also continuing to invest in the business and returning capital to shareholders. And I think that we've been able to execute across all dimensions in 2022. So for 2023 thankfully, we've got the simplifications behind us. No more DevCo. No more pros more And so it really allows us to focus on maintaining that balance sheet strength that we've spent so much time over the last several years talking about and then continuing to invest in our business additional organic growth capital opportunities that are very attractive for us like Wildcat II and like Daytona and like all the other projects that we have in progress, and then continuing to return an increasing amount of capital to our shareholders through higher dividend and additional share repurchases. So I think it will be a similar road map in 2023 and we look forward to describing that in February. On the growth capital side there's some lumpiness just related to the types of projects that we spend capital on. So when you think about Daytona and Wildcat II, a little bit of capital accelerating into this year, but a lot of capital on both of those projects will be spent in 2023. And then there's still lumpiness around Train 9 spending. So there's significant Train 9 spending in 2023 as well along with just the natural cadence of plant ads compression ads and gathering line ads. So 2023 capital will be higher and we'll give more visibility to that in February as well. But certainly, we're very comfortable and believe that similar to our spending this year underpinning EBITDA growth 2023 over 2022, the spending that we'll be doing next year is what will set us up for continued EBITDA growth going forward as well. \nJeremy Tonet: That\u2019s very helpful. I will leave it there. Thanks.\nJen Kneale: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Reynolds from UBS. \nBrian Reynolds: Hi. Good morning, everyone. Maybe just to circle back on [indiscernible]. Could you just talk a little bit about the synergies seen so far to capture some of those offloaded volumes. Curious, if you can just talk about how the transaction multiple is being worked out perhaps before all of those volumes fully work its way through the target integrated system in a few years? Thanks.\nPat McDonie: Yes. Red Hills VI came on in September. It's full. Frankly, volumes were greater than the capacity of the system including Red Hills VI. So immediately what we were able to do is offload some of the gas on the Lucid system into our Western Delaware plants, which had spare capacity. Pretty significant volumes frankly. Lucid was in the process prior to acquiring them seeking out offloads. We had some in place with them already and certainly, upon completion of the acquisition we stepped that up considerably and are building additional infrastructure that allows better communication between the \u2013 what we call Target North Delaware system, the old Lucid assets in our existing Delaware footprint. So the integration has gone pretty seamlessly. The volume growth is substantial. So we can get it done the better. But we're definitely seeing benefits of the integration and we'll see additional benefits via some of the projects that we've announced this morning. \nBrian Reynolds: Great. I appreciate that. My one follow-up entering 2023 just given some operational issues from some peers. There's various projects that are coming online in 2023 but curious, if you could talk about the GCF frac on iLink [ph] or if there's any desire to simplify that JV over the next year or two? Thanks.\nScott Pryor: Hey, Brian, this is Scott again. We are evaluating with our partners at GCF recognizing that is in a partnership as to what the timing would be of moving that from an idled asset to an operating asset. So we don't have a definitive date at this point but the discussions are happening and just trying to understand what the volumes look like for not only Targa but respectively also for our partners in that. With that said obviously, we are moving forward with our Train 9. That would be operational in second quarter of 2024. And in addition to that we also have a permit in hand for our Train 10. So as we continue to evaluate the build-out of our GMP footprint, how that feeds into our Grand Prix system, the expansion with Daytona, those deliveries into Mont Belvieu, the termination of when we would start a Train 10 or restart a GCF asset, we will be certainly taking all those volumes into consideration.\nBrian Reynolds: Great. Super helpful. [indiscernible] and everyone.\nJen Kneale: Thanks, Brian.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Keith Stanley from Wolfe Research.\nKeith Stanley: Hi, good morning. I wanted to start a couple of quick follow-ups on Daytona. Should we assume a pretty even split on the CapEx between 2023 and 2024? And did you say the capacity of the expansion I think previously you talked to maybe 550,000 a day. \nJen Kneale: Keith, this is Jen. In terms of spending we've got a little bit that's coming into 2022. And then we'll have spending of course in 2023 and actually more in 2024 than in 2023 is what we currently have forecasted but we're trying to get Daytona online as quickly as possible. So that may shift between 2023 and 2024, but that's what the spending currently looks like right now. \nScott Pryor: And then as it relates Keith to the volume expectations, when we start up Daytona, it will have an initial capacity of about 400,000 barrels a day. And just as a reminder, our current West Grand Prix leg has a capacity of roughly 550,000 barrels a day. So they will complement each other very well. And again, as I stated earlier in our comments, we would operate those two lines together in order to get fuel efficiencies across both lines.\nKeith Stanley : Thanks for that. My second question is on Permian gas. I guess, first, I'm just curious how -- if you have a view on how much of the weakness we've seen this fall has been due to maintenance versus a tighter-than-expected market. And any updated thoughts on the potential to support a new takeaway project either through contracting or ownership and we might hear more on that.\nRobert Muraro : Hi. This is Bobby. I'll tell you I think it's a combination of a lot of things at the end of the day. You have I think better production than some people have forecasted and then more maintenance than everyone had planned for along with some pipelines still being out relative to El Paso going west out of the basin. So I think from that perspective, it's all kind of intersected at a point where you saw some extreme weakness when multiple pipes went down. At the end of the day, I think, a big up would be El Paso coming back online. And then as the PHP and Marathon expansions come online -- the PHP and Whistler come online, sorry, and then Marathon comes online in 2024. I think we'll see the basin get a lot better. I think we have spent a lot of time preparing for that. Our group has been through this before. And I think we see a line of sight to target being able to operate all our assets at the capacity we will need through that period of time. As for Targa and long-haul gas pipelines, we want to say no, we'll keep saying that. We'll always say that. If it takes us participating, we're always wanting to participate. If other people get them done and gas gets out of the basin, and bottoms out basis we're excited to see that too. So I think we always stand by and stand ready for what's needed, because what we want to be is the gas costs that our plans keep operating our NGLs go through our system. \nKeith Stanley : Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Theresa Chen from Barclays. \nTheresa Chen : Hi, there. I wanted to ask on the comments related to the carbon capture opportunities and your anticipation of receiving 45Q credit. Can you provide some more detail on the nature of the economics with these projects in general and your outlook from here?\nRobert Muraro : So I think -- this is Bobby, sorry. We look at them like we do our kind of traditional economics around the rest of our system. So it's not that we have specific hurdles, but we have thresholds of which the team here wants to invest capital in projects. And what I'd tell you is in looking at our carbon capture projects prior to the updated 45Q, they were economic. And as we get to the new and better 45Q credit that we will get and make them that much better. So we don't comment on specific projects and specific returns, but these projects went from economic in our view under traditional ways we run economics to just that much better when the new 45Q came out. So it's got to -- I won't say it's accelerated our thinking, but it makes us more intention about making sure we get all these done. \nJen Kneale : And then related to timing, Theresa, we said in our script accounts that we thought that we could start getting credits as early as Q4 of 2023.\nTheresa Chen : Got it. And in relation to your LPG exports just curious as to why you have confidence that it will rebound and get better in the fourth quarter. Just given the pervasive downstream headwinds at your customers both Asia and Europe, I imagine. And then also, can you remind us around what percentage of volumes you have currently contracted at this point?\nScott Pryor: Hey, Theresa, this is Scott. First off, just to reiterate our volumes were 8.5 million barrels per month during the quarter. That was down obviously from what we saw in the second quarter. But it was comparative to what really the industry saw as a whole roughly down about 15% quarter-over-quarter when you look at the exports out of the US to various markets across the globe. A lot of that was driven by just as you stated weaker global markets. Some of that related to Asian ethylene producers where they were faced with really some unattractive economics relative to the co-products and products they produce on that side of the business. And thus they cut some of their LPG usage as a result of that. We also saw some slowdowns in China due to some areas that may have been impacted by COVID shutdowns and things of that nature which slowed up some of the PDH plant activity. But in general, I would say the reason why we feel as though the volumes would look better in the fourth quarter is because where we sit today, what has been lifted thus far, what is on our schedule for the balance of the fourth quarter. That's why we feel comfortable stating that our volumes will be up in the fourth quarter. With that said, we're still going to be facing some global market issues that are weaker at this point, shipping issues and things of that nature as well as conducting some scheduled maintenance that we have -- that we need to do in the fourth quarter. But again, overall we would believe at this point that our volumes will be up in the fourth quarter.\nTheresa Chen: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sunil Sibal from Seaport Global.\nSunil Sibal: Yes. Hi. Good morning, everybody, and thanks for all the clarity. So when I look at the base G&P business obviously, it seems like you have some impact of the inflation on your fees as well as on your OpEx. So I was just curious from here on should we consider that most of those inflation adjust has kicked in and that are incorporated in the 3Q results, or should we expect any significant movements in that?\nJen Kneale: Sunil, this is Jen. I'd say that across our entire portfolio of contracts, most of the escalators have kicked in for this year. We've talked previously about the fact that we have a number of contracts that essentially kick in January 1, then a number of contracts that kick in midyear and then there are some others that I'd say is more the minority that kick in on the annual renewal date of the contract or based on some other date during the calendar year. So yes, I think it's fair to say that we have benefited from the escalators that we would expect this year. And then heading into 2023 of course will be a net beneficiary of escalators as we move forward through into next year.\nSunil Sibal: Got it. And then could you give us a sense of ethane rejection across your Permian footprint? And what trends do you expect to play out in the near term on that?\nPat McDonie: I'm not sure I fully heard the question.\nJen Kneale: Ethane rejection in the Permian and trends. \nPat McDonie: The natural gas takeaway situation is going to play into that pretty heavily right. If you can't move residue gas, then probably more barrels are going to be pulled -- more is going to be recovered than rejected adding incremental MMBTUs into a tight gas market is going to be problematic. So, I think one first it's always an economic decision and it will continue to be an economic decision. And then some of those other dynamics relative to the ability to move residue gas. And obviously, if that price gets really low, which we've seen recently relative to ethane price, I think you'll see recoveries and ethane being transported to Belvieu. \nSunil Sibal: Okay, got it. Thanks.\nJen Kneale: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Neel Mitra from Bank of America.\nNeel Mitra: Hi, good morning. I just had a few follow-ups on Daytona. First is it going to twin Grand Prix or are you going to maybe have it go a different direction in some places so it can access new processing facilities. And then the second part of that is it limited to 400,000 cubic feet a day because of the limitation on the 30-inch pipe from North Texas to Mont Belvieu? \nScott Pryor: Hey Neel, this is Scott Pryor. First off the way you need to view Daytona is basically a loop of the existing Grand Prix West leg, albeit we will be taking advantage of the lines that move further west both in Texas as well as into New Mexico that Grand Prix system today will help feed both the Grand Prix West as well as the Daytona system. So, it will run virtually parallel of the Grand Prix West system tying into our 30-inch leg in North Texas what we refer to as our junction point which is just south of Dallas Texas. It allows us to leverage capacity that we have on the 30-inch pipeline. And when we say that it has an initial capacity of 400,000 barrels a day it's similar to how we said Grand Prix West had initial capacity of roughly 400,000 barrels a day when it first started up but we have put pumps on to amp that up to call it 550,000 barrels a day. We would have the same ability to do that with Daytona. So, we're taking advantage of where all of our plant activity is in the permit. So it will have the ability to again feed both Grand Prix West as well as Daytona and again take advantage of that line out of North Texas feeding into Mont Belvieu. So, it lines up very well with where our concentration of plant activity is.\nNeel Mitra: And if I could just follow-up on that. It seemed like $9.50 is that the limitation from North Texas to Mont Belvieu, or could you get more capacity with pumps? \nScott Pryor: Yes. I would -- we have had a cadence of where we've been putting on pumps both on the West leg as well as the South Lake to complement the volumes that are coming from West as well as in North Texas and up into Oklahoma. I would call it nominally one million barrels per day of capacity on the 30-inch leg going into Mont Belvieu.\nNeel Mitra: Okay. Great. And then just the second question, it seems like you've had some commercial success Wildcat II and Winkler to second. Wildcat plant you brought on in the last four years in the legacy Delaware. Could you just comment on the customer mix, or private public and activity you're seeing in that area to cause you to go forward with that project? \nPat McDonie: Sure. It is a mix as you described. We have a big chunk of the majors, dedication on both of those systems. And certainly -- if you think about the Delaware Basin, there's been acquisitions recently by majors that have gobbled up some of the smaller guys. So that has added to their portfolio, which is dedicated up under us. And then we have a ton of mid- to smaller guys that are extremely active, that some of which we've done business with a long time, and some of which as you described we've had commercial success with and added to our portfolio.\nNeel Mitra: Okay. Got it. Thank you very much\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of John McKay from Goldman Sachs. \nJohn McKay: Hi. Thanks for the time. I wanted to pick up on that last piece. You guys are showing really a much better volume outlook than a lot of your peers in the midstream side are talking about. And we've seen a couple of the producers starting to slow down. I was just wondering, if you could spend another minute maybe just talking about kind of, what's differentiating your footprint what kind of giving you guys a confidence on the growth outlook and whether or not you have seen a little bit of slowdown from your producer customers?\nPat McDonie: I'll address the last part, first. This is Pat McDonie. We really haven't seen an appreciable slowdown. The people have employed rigs continue to employ them and just move them across their acreage and continue to drill. Certainly, we've been fortunate that a lot of those rigs are running on our acreage. But I would tell you that, our infrastructure underpins a lot of the best acreage in the Delaware Basin and also obviously in the Midland Basin, as seen by many years of history. You've seen the \u2013Acorns [ph] the Chevrons the big guys come out and announce what their plans are for next year. And there's no appreciable slowdown from them, just their public information is available and Chevron is actually adding rigs. Our smaller guys the economics are very good, and they continue to stay active. So we have not seen a slowdown. There certainly has been some logistical constraints, that have a time made debt ponds a little bit lumpy. In other words, waiting on completion crews et cetera, but the wells are still getting drilled, eventually getting completed. So I can't speak to our competitors or our peers. But certainly, we're seeing a continued level of high activity. \nJohn McKay: I appreciate that. Maybe picking up on that one comment from earlier too, I think Theresa's question. Just back to the exports, have you guys commented on what your contracted levels are? \nJen Kneale: John, I'm sorry we could not hear a word of that. \nJohn McKay: I'll try again. Just circling back to Theresa's question on the exports. Have you guys commented, where your current contracted level set? \nJen Kneale: I'm sorry John. We couldn't hear a word of that. Either jump back in and you try from a different line.\nJohn Mackay: I\u2019ll follow-up offline.\nJen Kneale: Okay. We\u2019ll follow-up offline. Perfect. Thank you. Sorry about that.\nJohn Mackay: Thank you. Sorry about that.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Cusimano from Pickering Energy Partners.\nMichael Cusimano: Hi. Good morning. I just have a few follow-ups from some of the questions that have been asked. First, Jen, I appreciate the help on the hedge exposure. Specifically, in regards to Waha, though, should we think about any weighting throughout the year for how those hedges are on? I guess, I'm thinking are the first three quarters more heavily weighted for that basis than the back fourth quarter. And is that 80% an annual average?\nJen Kneale: The percent that I gave would be annual averages for next year, Michael. And then the way that we generally hedge is, there can be some shaping where there's more hedged earlier in the year than later in the year. But, I'd say, that for next year, it's actually all pretty ratable at this point in time on the gas side.\nMichael Cusimano: Okay. That's helpful. And then on the ethane rejection that you experienced, is it fair to assume that that was in the Mid-Con with the volumes a little bit lower quarter-to-quarter? And then, a follow-on for that. Can we assume that the West leg of the Grand Prix line grew similar to what volumes did? Just how do we think about that? \nJen Kneale: This is Jen. Related to the Mid-Con we actually had a contract expiration that we called out in South Oak and so that's part of what resulted in the volumes there being lower quarter-over-quarter. It was really in the Permian and a little bit elsewhere that we are making decisions around rejection recovery based on what we were seeing related to some of the maintenance issues on certain pipes and pricing around natural gas and ethane.\nMichael Cusimano: Okay. Got it. And then, lastly, can you remind us the typical cadence spend for just your standard processing plant, if it's a fourth quarter lead time, how that typically looks and if there's any nuance to the ongoing processing plants that you're working on?\nJen Kneale: It depends. Each plant is a little bit different based on whether there's additional treating infrastructure or what else is required, if it's plumbed close to the structure or not. So, again, each plant is a little bit different. I'd say that generally the spend is across the life of the project prior to it coming online. So there isn't significant lumpiness for Wildcat II, for example, that would be hitting this quarter. But then as we move into 2023, you wouldn't see continued spending. So I'd say that, for modeling purposes, it's easiest and probably most accurate just to assume ratable spending from now until a project comes online.\nMichael Cusimano: Okay.

            "content": "Thanks Matt and good morning everyone. Starting in the Permian our systems across the Midland and Delaware Basins averaged a record 4.1 billion cubic feet per day of volumes during the third quarter, including two months of contribution from our recently completed Delaware Basin acquisition. Given our performance year-to-date we expect our full year average 2022 Permian volume not including our Delaware Basin acquisition to increase at the high end of our initial 12% to 15% year-over-year volume guidance. In Permian Midland, our inlet volumes increased 8%, sequentially as our system essentially ran at capacity until our new legacy plant came online late in the third quarter. We have an incremental 550 million cubic feet per day of processing expansions underway in Permian Midland. Our Legacy two plant remains on track to begin operations during the second quarter of 2023. And our Greenwood plant remains on track to begin operations late in the fourth quarter of 2023. Similarly, we expect both plants to be highly utilized when they come online next year. In Permian Delaware, inlet volumes across our system not including contribution from our Delaware Basin acquisition increased 7% sequentially. We have successfully integrated our Delaware Basin assets and employees and appreciate the efforts of the collective Targa team that supported the integration. We commenced operations on our new 230 million cubic feet per day Red Hills VI plant in late September which was full at start-up. Our overall Delaware system is also running highly -- very highly utilized and volumes continue to ramp. And we remain on track to bring our new 275 million cubic per day Midway plant online during the second quarter of 2023. In response to strong producer activity levels and to meet the infrastructure needs of our customers across the Delaware and as Matt previously mentioned, we are moving forward with the construction of a new $275 million per day plant in Permian Delaware which we are calling the Wildcat II plant. Wildcat II is expected to begin operations in the first quarter of 2024. We are playing some catch-up on our newly acquired Delaware Basin assets as evidenced by Red Hills VI being full at startup, the expectation that Midway will be highly utilized on start-up and now moving forward with construction of the Wildcat II facility. All a positive reflection of how quickly current volumes are increasing and future volumes are expected to increase. We are also adding incremental treating infrastructure in the Delaware to increase our gas handling capabilities which enhances our ability to capture and handle increasing gas production and drive attractive returns from treating fees. This will also give us the ability to capture CO2 from the treating process and sequester the emissions in our acid gas injection storage wells. We have already obtained Class II permits and are working on MRV plans and additional Class II and Class VI permits to further enhance our carbon capture abilities. We expect to begin receiving 45Q tax credits as early as the fourth quarter of 2023. Shifting to the backgrounds our natural gas and crude gathered volumes rebounded in the third quarter following the reduced reported volumes impacted by late weather storms in the prior quarter. In our Central region a full quarter contribution from the acquired assets in South Texas and solid activity levels in Oklahoma and North Texas drove a sequential increase in aggregate volumes during the third quarter partially offset via contract expiration in South Texas. Scott will now discuss our logistics and transportation business in more detail. Scott? Yes. Red Hills VI came on in September. It's full. Frankly, volumes were greater than the capacity of the system including Red Hills VI. So immediately what we were able to do is offload some of the gas on the Lucid system into our Western Delaware plants, which had spare capacity. Pretty significant volumes frankly. Lucid was in the process prior to acquiring them seeking out offloads. We had some in place with them already and certainly, upon completion of the acquisition we stepped that up considerably and are building additional infrastructure that allows better communication between the \u2013 what we call Target North Delaware system, the old Lucid assets in our existing Delaware footprint. So the integration has gone pretty seamlessly. The volume growth is substantial. So we can get it done the better. But we're definitely seeing benefits of the integration and we'll see additional benefits via some of the projects that we've announced this morning. I'm not sure I fully heard the question. The natural gas takeaway situation is going to play into that pretty heavily right. If you can't move residue gas, then probably more barrels are going to be pulled -- more is going to be recovered than rejected adding incremental MMBTUs into a tight gas market is going to be problematic. So, I think one first it's always an economic decision and it will continue to be an economic decision. And then some of those other dynamics relative to the ability to move residue gas. And obviously, if that price gets really low, which we've seen recently relative to ethane price, I think you'll see recoveries and ethane being transported to Belvieu. Sure. It is a mix as you described. We have a big chunk of the majors, dedication on both of those systems. And certainly -- if you think about the Delaware Basin, there's been acquisitions recently by majors that have gobbled up some of the smaller guys. So that has added to their portfolio, which is dedicated up under us. And then we have a ton of mid- to smaller guys that are extremely active, that some of which we've done business with a long time, and some of which as you described we've had commercial success with and added to our portfolio. I'll address the last part, first. This is Pat McDonie. We really haven't seen an appreciable slowdown. The people have employed rigs continue to employ them and just move them across their acreage and continue to drill. Certainly, we've been fortunate that a lot of those rigs are running on our acreage. But I would tell you that, our infrastructure underpins a lot of the best acreage in the Delaware Basin and also obviously in the Midland Basin, as seen by many years of history. You've seen the \u2013Acorns [ph] the Chevrons the big guys come out and announce what their plans are for next year. And there's no appreciable slowdown from them, just their public information is available and Chevron is actually adding rigs. Our smaller guys the economics are very good, and they continue to stay active. So we have not seen a slowdown. There certainly has been some logistical constraints, that have a time made debt ponds a little bit lumpy. In other words, waiting on completion crews et cetera, but the wells are still getting drilled, eventually getting completed. So I can't speak to our competitors or our peers. But certainly, we're seeing a continued level of high activity."

            "content": "Thanks Pat. Targa's NGL transportation volumes were a record 500,000 barrels per day. Fractionation volumes were a record 742,000 barrels per day during the third quarter. Our volumes would have been higher had it not been for some ethane rejection across our system and third-party systems during the third quarter plus some maintenance at our Mont Belvieu facility. Given the anticipated growth from our volume growth from our Permian G&P expansions growth of third-party volumes and volumes we can transport after the expirations of obligations on third-party pipelines our outlook for continued NGL transportation volume growth is strong. Today we announced plans to construct the Daytona NGL pipeline to transport NGLs from the Permian Basin and connect to the 30-inch diameter segment of the Grand Prix NGL pipeline in North Texas. Daytona is expected to be in service by the end of 2024. Targa will own 75% of Daytona and Blackstone Energy Partners will own 25% and with each member funding the respective share of the pipeline's cost based on their ownership percentage. With an estimated project cost of about $650 million Targa's net growth CapEx share is estimated to be approximately $488 million. In Mont Belvieu construction continues on our Train nine fractionator which is expected to begin operations during the second quarter of 2024 with an estimated cost of around $450 million. Turning to our LPG exports. We loaded an average of 8.5 million barrels per month during the third quarter as we were impacted by reduced spot cargo opportunities and some cancellations due to weaker global market conditions. We currently expect fourth core volumes to improve but will be impacted by similar global dynamics and some required maintenance at the terminal. Our low-cost LPG export expansion project to increase our propane loading capabilities with an incremental one million barrels per month of capacity remains on track for mid-2023. I'll now turn the call over to Jen. Hi, Colton this is Scott. We've, obviously, been watching our volumes as it relates to Grand Prix both on the West leg and the North leg that feeds into Mont Belvieu for some time now and clearly watching the cadence of the plants that we've been adding on the G&P side of our business and along with the Delaware acquisition that we made. So we are keenly aware of the volumes that are moving and the timing of announcing Daytona fits with our expectations. We feel very comfortable with the fourth quarter operating that start in fourth quarter of 2024. And again with Daytona when you look at the volume growth that we've got from our G&P business, third-party volumes, expirations the third-party pipe volumes over time. It's a very good project for us. And especially it leverages the capacity that we've got available on our 30-inch pipeline that feeds into Mont Belvieu. So that gives us plenty of room over a period of time. I'd also like to state that when we start up Daytona and how it complements our Grand Prix West leg we'll also get some efficiency on the fuel side of things as we operate. It allows us to better operate pumps that are along the existing West leg in addition to how we would operate the pumps on the Daytona side. Hey, Brian, this is Scott again. We are evaluating with our partners at GCF recognizing that is in a partnership as to what the timing would be of moving that from an idled asset to an operating asset. So we don't have a definitive date at this point but the discussions are happening and just trying to understand what the volumes look like for not only Targa but respectively also for our partners in that. With that said obviously, we are moving forward with our Train 9. That would be operational in second quarter of 2024. And in addition to that we also have a permit in hand for our Train 10. So as we continue to evaluate the build-out of our GMP footprint, how that feeds into our Grand Prix system, the expansion with Daytona, those deliveries into Mont Belvieu, the termination of when we would start a Train 10 or restart a GCF asset, we will be certainly taking all those volumes into consideration. And then as it relates Keith to the volume expectations, when we start up Daytona, it will have an initial capacity of about 400,000 barrels a day. And just as a reminder, our current West Grand Prix leg has a capacity of roughly 550,000 barrels a day. So they will complement each other very well. And again, as I stated earlier in our comments, we would operate those two lines together in order to get fuel efficiencies across both lines. Hey, Theresa, this is Scott. First off, just to reiterate our volumes were 8.5 million barrels per month during the quarter. That was down obviously from what we saw in the second quarter. But it was comparative to what really the industry saw as a whole roughly down about 15% quarter-over-quarter when you look at the exports out of the US to various markets across the globe. A lot of that was driven by just as you stated weaker global markets. Some of that related to Asian ethylene producers where they were faced with really some unattractive economics relative to the co-products and products they produce on that side of the business. And thus they cut some of their LPG usage as a result of that. We also saw some slowdowns in China due to some areas that may have been impacted by COVID shutdowns and things of that nature which slowed up some of the PDH plant activity. But in general, I would say the reason why we feel as though the volumes would look better in the fourth quarter is because where we sit today, what has been lifted thus far, what is on our schedule for the balance of the fourth quarter. That's why we feel comfortable stating that our volumes will be up in the fourth quarter. With that said, we're still going to be facing some global market issues that are weaker at this point, shipping issues and things of that nature as well as conducting some scheduled maintenance that we have -- that we need to do in the fourth quarter. But again, overall we would believe at this point that our volumes will be up in the fourth quarter. Hey Neel, this is Scott Pryor. First off the way you need to view Daytona is basically a loop of the existing Grand Prix West leg, albeit we will be taking advantage of the lines that move further west both in Texas as well as into New Mexico that Grand Prix system today will help feed both the Grand Prix West as well as the Daytona system. So, it will run virtually parallel of the Grand Prix West system tying into our 30-inch leg in North Texas what we refer to as our junction point which is just south of Dallas Texas. It allows us to leverage capacity that we have on the 30-inch pipeline. And when we say that it has an initial capacity of 400,000 barrels a day it's similar to how we said Grand Prix West had initial capacity of roughly 400,000 barrels a day when it first started up but we have put pumps on to amp that up to call it 550,000 barrels a day. We would have the same ability to do that with Daytona. So, we're taking advantage of where all of our plant activity is in the permit. So it will have the ability to again feed both Grand Prix West as well as Daytona and again take advantage of that line out of North Texas feeding into Mont Belvieu. So, it lines up very well with where our concentration of plant activity is. Yes. I would -- we have had a cadence of where we've been putting on pumps both on the West leg as well as the South Lake to complement the volumes that are coming from West as well as in North Texas and up into Oklahoma. I would call it nominally one million barrels per day of capacity on the 30-inch leg going into Mont Belvieu."

            "content": "Hi. This is Bobby. I'll tell you I think it's a combination of a lot of things at the end of the day. You have I think better production than some people have forecasted and then more maintenance than everyone had planned for along with some pipelines still being out relative to El Paso going west out of the basin. So I think from that perspective, it's all kind of intersected at a point where you saw some extreme weakness when multiple pipes went down. At the end of the day, I think, a big up would be El Paso coming back online. And then as the PHP and Marathon expansions come online -- the PHP and Whistler come online, sorry, and then Marathon comes online in 2024. I think we'll see the basin get a lot better. I think we have spent a lot of time preparing for that. Our group has been through this before. And I think we see a line of sight to target being able to operate all our assets at the capacity we will need through that period of time. As for Targa and long-haul gas pipelines, we want to say no, we'll keep saying that. We'll always say that. If it takes us participating, we're always wanting to participate. If other people get them done and gas gets out of the basin, and bottoms out basis we're excited to see that too. So I think we always stand by and stand ready for what's needed, because what we want to be is the gas costs that our plans keep operating our NGLs go through our system. So I think -- this is Bobby, sorry. We look at them like we do our kind of traditional economics around the rest of our system. So it's not that we have specific hurdles, but we have thresholds of which the team here wants to invest capital in projects. And what I'd tell you is in looking at our carbon capture projects prior to the updated 45Q, they were economic. And as we get to the new and better 45Q credit that we will get and make them that much better. So we don't comment on specific projects and specific returns, but these projects went from economic in our view under traditional ways we run economics to just that much better when the new 45Q came out. So it's got to -- I won't say it's accelerated our thinking, but it makes us more intention about making sure we get all these done."

            "name": "Jen Kneale",
            "content": "Thanks Scott. Good morning everyone. Our record quarterly adjusted EBITDA and operational stats reflect that our business is performing really well. Our balance sheet is strong. We are continuing to invest in our business. We are returning an increasing amount of capital to our shareholders and we are very excited about Targa's outlook. Let's now go over some additional financial information. Targa's reported quarterly adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter was $769 million increasing 15% sequentially as we benefited from a partial quarter contribution from our Delaware Basin acquisition, higher volumes across our gathering and processing and logistics and transportation systems and higher fees partially offset by lower NGL prices and higher operating expenses. Higher operating expenses were primarily attributable to our recent Delaware Basin acquisition, increasing activity levels across our G&P systems, including two plants placed in service in the quarter and inflation. While costs were higher, just a reminder that for Targa, inflation is a net tailwind across our businesses, as we benefit from inflation-linked fee escalators across our commercial contracts. Targa generated adjusted free cash flow of $291 million in the third quarter. We repurchased about $73 million of common shares in the quarter and year-to-date through September 30 have repurchased about $197 million of common shares at a weighted average price of $65.23. Since program inception, we have repurchased about $328 million of shares at a weighted average price of $35.45. As of quarter end, we had approximately $172 million remaining under our $500 million equity repurchase program. For the third quarter, we declared a cash dividend of $0.35 per common share or $1.40 per share on an annualized basis and consistent with previous messaging expect to maintain the same dividend for the fourth quarter. Looking ahead, we currently plan to provide our full year 2023 operational and financial outlook in February, in conjunction with our fourth quarter earnings call and will also then provide color on our expected annualized dividend and share repurchase strategy for 2023. We are well hedged for the fourth quarter. Looking forward, we are currently about 80% hedged in 2023 across all commodities related to our exposure from our percent of proceeds contracts and are hedged at higher prices in 2023 than 2022 hedge prices. As Matt mentioned, our performance this year has been strong and we continue to estimate our leverage ratio will be around 3.5 times at year-end. During the third quarter, we upsized our accounts receivable securitization facility to $800 million and extended the facility to September 1, 2023. We spent about $625 million of net growth capital through the first three quarters of 2022. With some additional spending accelerating into 2022 for the Wildcat II plant and the Daytona NGL pipeline announced today, we now estimate 2022 net growth CapEx to be between $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion. Our estimate for 2022, net maintenance CapEx remains unchanged at approximately $150 million. We have strong momentum heading into 2023, backed by continued volume growth across our integrated businesses and we expect to benefit from full year contributions from our Delaware Basin and South Texas acquisitions, higher fees and higher hedge prices. We are focused on continuing to manage our leverage ratio within our three to four times long-term target range, with a preference to be in the lower half of the range and believe that the strength of our underlying business puts us in excellent position over the long term to continue to invest in attractive organic growth opportunities and return an increasing amount of capital to our shareholders. We published our 2021 sustainability report in early October and kicked off an initiative that is very important to us, where we engage with our largest shareholders each fall specifically around ESG to get feedback on our latest report and ESG-related efforts. We take our responsibility seriously and are committed to practices that create value for our shareholders and benefit the communities we serve and our latest report is hopefully reflective of that commitment. Lastly, I'd like to echo Matt and thank our employees for their dedication and for continuing to prioritize safety. With that, I will turn the call back over to Sanjay. I think based on the view that we had that there was likely to be Waha tightness and potential impacts on prices on the Waha side. We've added additional hedges particularly around natural gas, Colton. So are hedged above the 75% level on natural gas, actually significantly higher hedged than that right now for 2023. Then on the NGL side, we're a little bit higher hedged than the 75% level. Just continuing to watch backwardation of NGL price markets, and to the extent that we get strength we have tried to hedge into some of that strength. And then we've got a little bit of condensate exposure in our well hedged they're well north of that 75% level to. And those hedges are all related to our percent of proceeds contracts. So we do have commodity exposure elsewhere in our business, but have tried to do a very good job of hedging in advance of 2023 to help underpin continued cash flow stability across our businesses. Yes. We hedge directly to our basis points and certainly have tried to be far in advance of any price risk around Waha in 2023. Our gas marketing team has done a really good job of trying to manage not only takeaway transport but also our hedge exposure there. Good morning, Jeremy. I think that we have a pretty good track record of forecasting guidance conservatively, Jeremy, which is part of it. But also the underlying business is just performing really, really well. So when we think about the volume increases that we're seeing across our systems it feels like every quarter we're reporting record Permian volumes even ignoring the acquisition of the Delaware Basin assets, which will bring significantly more volumes to our system and then on the transportation and fractionation side as well. So while prices were weaker in the quarter, we're comfortable with where our guidance is set right now for the rest of the year. We've got only two months to go. And again, I think, that the business is performing so well that we're really setting up nicely heading into 2023 as well. I think 2022 provides a little bit of a road map for how we're thinking about returning capital to shareholders. We entered 2022 focused on managing our leverage to levels that we are comfortable with and then also simplifying and also continuing to invest in the business and returning capital to shareholders. And I think that we've been able to execute across all dimensions in 2022. So for 2023 thankfully, we've got the simplifications behind us. No more DevCo. No more pros more And so it really allows us to focus on maintaining that balance sheet strength that we've spent so much time over the last several years talking about and then continuing to invest in our business additional organic growth capital opportunities that are very attractive for us like Wildcat II and like Daytona and like all the other projects that we have in progress, and then continuing to return an increasing amount of capital to our shareholders through higher dividend and additional share repurchases. So I think it will be a similar road map in 2023 and we look forward to describing that in February. On the growth capital side there's some lumpiness just related to the types of projects that we spend capital on. So when you think about Daytona and Wildcat II, a little bit of capital accelerating into this year, but a lot of capital on both of those projects will be spent in 2023. And then there's still lumpiness around Train 9 spending. So there's significant Train 9 spending in 2023 as well along with just the natural cadence of plant ads compression ads and gathering line ads. So 2023 capital will be higher and we'll give more visibility to that in February as well. But certainly, we're very comfortable and believe that similar to our spending this year underpinning EBITDA growth 2023 over 2022, the spending that we'll be doing next year is what will set us up for continued EBITDA growth going forward as well. Thank you. Thanks, Brian. Keith, this is Jen. In terms of spending we've got a little bit that's coming into 2022. And then we'll have spending of course in 2023 and actually more in 2024 than in 2023 is what we currently have forecasted but we're trying to get Daytona online as quickly as possible. So that may shift between 2023 and 2024, but that's what the spending currently looks like right now. And then related to timing, Theresa, we said in our script accounts that we thought that we could start getting credits as early as Q4 of 2023. Sunil, this is Jen. I'd say that across our entire portfolio of contracts, most of the escalators have kicked in for this year. We've talked previously about the fact that we have a number of contracts that essentially kick in January 1, then a number of contracts that kick in midyear and then there are some others that I'd say is more the minority that kick in on the annual renewal date of the contract or based on some other date during the calendar year. So yes, I think it's fair to say that we have benefited from the escalators that we would expect this year. And then heading into 2023 of course will be a net beneficiary of escalators as we move forward through into next year. Ethane rejection in the Permian and trends. Thank you. John, I'm sorry we could not hear a word of that. I'm sorry John. We couldn't hear a word of that. Either jump back in and you try from a different line. Okay. We'll follow-up offline. Perfect. Thank you. Sorry about that. The percent that I gave would be annual averages for next year, Michael. And then the way that we generally hedge is, there can be some shaping where there's more hedged earlier in the year than later in the year. But, I'd say, that for next year, it's actually all pretty ratable at this point in time on the gas side. This is Jen. Related to the Mid-Con we actually had a contract expiration that we called out in South Oak and so that's part of what resulted in the volumes there being lower quarter-over-quarter. It was really in the Permian and a little bit elsewhere that we are making decisions around rejection recovery based on what we were seeing related to some of the maintenance issues on certain pipes and pricing around natural gas and ethane. It depends. Each plant is a little bit different based on whether there's additional treating infrastructure or what else is required, if it's plumbed close to the structure or not. So, again, each plant is a little bit different. I'd say that generally the spend is across the life of the project prior to it coming online. So there isn't significant lumpiness for Wildcat II, for example, that would be hitting this quarter. But then as we move into 2023, you wouldn't see continued spending. So I'd say that, for modeling purposes, it's easiest and probably most accurate just to assume ratable spending from now until a project comes online. Thanks, Michael."

Our overall business is continuing to perform well and our strong execution continued across the third quarter, including record high quarterly EBITDA, record volumes in the Permian, record NGL transportation and fractionation volumes, integration of our Delaware Basin acquisition, successfully bringing on two plants in the Permian Basin safely, ahead of schedule and on budget, $73 million of opportunistic common share repurchases, and were also recently added to the S&P 500. Our record third quarter EBITDA was attributable to higher base business volumes, particularly in the Permian, plus a partial quarter contribution from our Delaware Basin acquisition. While commodity prices are significantly lower than the assumptions underlying the updated full year 2022 financial expectations that we provided in early August. There is no change to our expectation to generate full year adjusted EBITDA between $2.85 billion and $2.95 billion. Given the significant growth in volumes that we expect looking forward and to catch up on some of our Delaware Basin infrastructure, we announced this morning that we are moving forward with a new 275 million cubic feet per day gas processing plant in the Permian Delaware, which we are calling the Wildcat II plant. The growth in volumes across our G&P business also necessitated the announcement this morning that we are kicking off construction of the Daytona NGL pipeline, which will transport volumes from the Permian Basin and connect to our existing segment of Grand Prix and North Texas, to move volumes down to Mont Belvieu. The acceleration of these additional projects shift some spending into 2022, but there is no change to our year-end 2022 leverage ratio expectation of about 3.5 times, meaning we continue to have significant financial flexibility looking forward. Before I turn the call over to Pat, I would like to extend a thank you to our employees for their continued focus on safety while executing on our strategic priorities and continuing to provide best-in-class services to our customers.

I would also like to thank all of our employees for their collective efforts as it has been a very busy first seven months of 2022, and the team has already accomplished a lot. And our strong execution continued across the second quarter, including record-high quarterly EBITDA, record volumes in the Permian, record NGL transportation and fractionation volumes, redemption of Series A preferred stock, completing the successful sale of our interest in Gulf Coast Express Pipeline, integration of our acquired South Texas assets, successful negotiation of our Delaware Basin acquisition and subsequent financing and $74 million of common share repurchases. Looking ahead, continuing to execute on our strategic priorities will drive increasing EBITDA, reduced common share count, a higher common dividend while maintaining leverage within our target range. Our performance this year has been strong, and we expect that to continue. We are updating our financial guidance for the year to account for the completion of the Delaware Basin acquisition effective August 1. We now estimate full year 2022 adjusted EBITDA to be between $2.85 billion and $2.95 billion. We continue to expect volumes to grow across both our Permian Midland and Delaware positions for the remainder of the year and well beyond. We have several gas plants under construction, Legacy I and Legacy II in the Permian Midland and Midway and Red Hill IV in the Permian Delaware. And given our line of sight to increasing G&P volume growth, we are continuing to invest across our NGL business. We are announcing two new projects, a new 275 million cubic feet per day processing plant in the Permian Midland, which we are calling the Greenwood plant; and a new 120,000 barrel per day Train 9 fractionator in Mont Belvieu. Investing in organic growth projects across our integrated footprint provides Targa with attractive returns and puts us in a strong position to continue to return capital to our shareholders. Turning to our Delaware Basin acquisition and our combined Permian Basin footprint. On a combined basis, we now have about 2.8 billion cubic feet per day of processing capacity in the Permian Delaware, complementing our 3.6 Bcf per day processing position in the Permian Midland for a combined total of 6.4 Bcf per day of processing capacity. Our assets in the Delaware Basin overlay some of the most economic acreage in North America with the acquisition, increasing our size and scale by extending our reach into the highly active and productive Eddy and Lea counties of New Mexico. We now have several million acres dedicated to us across the Permian Basin, providing decades of future activity that will result in increasing volumes moving across our integrated assets. We acquired the Delaware Basin assets at an attractive 7.5x multiple of estimated 2023 EBITDA and expect volume growth as well as near- and long-term synergies to reduce the acquisition multiple. We expect to capture downstream synergies over time as existing contracts come up for renewal and from new Targa processing expansions. We funded the acquisition with cash on hand and debt and expect to end the year with leverage around 3.5x, comfortably around the midpoint of our 3x to 4x long-term leverage target ratio. Let's now discuss our operations in more detail. Starting in the Permian, our systems across the Midland and Delaware Basins continue to perform well, averaging a record 3.1 Bcf per day reported inlet volume during the second quarter. In Permian Midland, our systems continue to run full, and we expect to bring online our next 275 Mmcf per day Legacy I plant later this month, which is expected to come online highly utilized. A special thanks to our engineering and operations teams for working diligently and safely to bring Legacy online ahead of schedule. Our Legacy II plant in Permian Midland remains on track to begin operations during the second quarter of 2023, and we similarly expect it to be highly utilized when it comes online. In Permian Delaware, volumes across our system are also continuing to ramp. Our new 230 million a day Red Hills VI plant is expected online in September. And our new 275 million a day Midway plant is expected to begin operations during the third quarter of 2023. We expect Red Hills VI to essentially be full when it comes online, and we have flexibility across our Permian Delaware system to handle additional near-term production growth from Eddy and Lea counties with connections to Targa plants. Shifting to the Badlands. Late winter storms impacted our natural gas and crude gathering volumes for the second quarter, but volumes have since rebounded. In our Central region, the acquired assets in South Texas and an uptick in activity levels in Oklahoma and North Texas drove a sequential increase in volumes during the second quarter. Shifting to our Logistics and Transportation segment. NGL transportation volumes were a record 492,000 barrels per day to Mont Belvieu during the second quarter. Throughput volumes sequentially increased 7% driven by increasing NGL production from Targa's Permian plants and third parties. Fractionation volumes at our Mont Belvieu complex during the second quarter were a record 737,000 barrels per day, and the fractionation market in Mont Belvieu continues to tighten. We are moving forward with Train 9 given our outlook for continued supply growth from our Permian G&P systems and third parties. Train 9 is fully permitted and is expected to begin operations during the second quarter of 2024 with an estimated cost of around $450 million. In our LPG export services business at Galena Park, we loaded an average of 10.4 million barrels per month during the second quarter, providing a consistent outlook for our customers despite continued volatility in global commodity markets. We continue to expect to complete our previously announced low-cost expansion project to increase our propane loading capabilities with an incremental 1 million barrels per month of capacity by mid-2023. Lastly, year-to-date, we have purchased almost 2.4 million common shares at a cost of around $154 million. Our balance sheet is strong. We are continuing to invest in our business, both organically and through acquisitions. We are returning an increasing amount of capital to our shareholders, and we are excited about Targa's outlook. Before I turn the call over to Jen, I would like to extend a final thank you to our employees for their continued focus on safety while executing on our strategic priorities and continuing to provide best-in-class services to our customers. Jen?\nJen Kneale: Thanks, Matt. Targa's reported quarterly adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter was $666.4 million, increasing 6% sequentially as we benefited from higher commodity prices and higher volumes across our gathering and processing and logistics and transportation systems, partially offset by lower marketing margin and higher operating expenses. Higher operating expenses were primarily attributable to increasing activity levels across our G&P systems, our recently acquired assets in South Texas and inflation. While costs are higher, inflation continues to be a net tailwind for us across our businesses as we benefit from inflation-linked fee escalators across our commercial contracts. Targa generated adjusted free cash flow of $334 million in the second quarter. During the second quarter, we completed the redemption of all of our outstanding Series A preferred stock for approximately $973 million and also received the proceeds associated with the sale of our interest in Gulf Coast Express pipeline of $857 million. Our consolidated net leverage ratio was 3.1x at the end of the second quarter, and we had about $2.3 billion of available liquidity. We repurchased about $74 million of common shares in the second quarter and repurchased an additional $30 million during July. We have approximately $215 million remaining under our $500 million repurchase program. Since the inception of our common share repurchase program in the fourth quarter of 2020, we have opportunistically repurchased $285 million of common shares or about 8.6 million shares at an average price of $33.12. We continue to expect to pay a common dividend per share of $1.40 for 2022 with our next dividend increase likely to be announced in early 2023, concurrent with when we expect to provide 2023 operational and financial guidance. Throughout the year, we have added hedges and we are significantly hedged for the balance of 2022. We have also continued to add 2023 hedges at higher weighted average hedge prices than 2022. It has been a very active couple of months for the finance team as we were able to attractively finance our Delaware Basin acquisition through a combination of five-year and 30-year senior notes issued in the investment-grade market, a three-year term loan and availability under our revolver. Pro forma for the acquisition, we have about $1.1 billion of liquidity available on our revolver. Benefiting from now being an investment-grade issuer, we also recently entered into a commercial paper program. As Matt mentioned, we are updating our financial estimates to account for a partial year contribution from the Delaware Basin acquisition and now estimate full year 2022 adjusted EBITDA to be between $2.85 billion and $2.95 billion and continue to estimate a year-end leverage ratio of around 3.5x. With the addition of spending in 2022 for the Greenwood plant and Train 9 announced today, plus spending to support the newly acquired Delaware Basin assets, we now estimate 2022 net growth CapEx to be between $1 billion and $1.1 billion. Our estimate for 2022 net maintenance CapEx remains unchanged at approximately $150 million. Our continued investment in growing Targa's underlying businesses, supported by solid business fundamentals and the strength of our balance sheet means we are in excellent position looking forward to continue to return an increasing amount of capital to our shareholders. Lastly, I'd like to echo Matt and thank our employees for their dedication and for continuing to prioritize safety. And with that, I will turn the call back over to Sanjay.\nSanjay Lad: Thanks, Jen. [Operator Instructions] Cole, would you please open the line for Q&A?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question today will come from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan.\nJeremy Tonet: Just wanted to dive into capital allocation thoughts a bit more. Big spend this year with the acquisition and all. But as you start to look into '23, it seems like there's a lot of available cash flow. And I just wanted to kind of get your thoughts with where you see that landing. It seems like the opportunity for buybacks would only increase. And when you think about buybacks, is it more price sensitive to the stock? Or is it more balance sheet capacity that drives time and buybacks?\nMatt Meloy: Yes. Jeremy, we really are in a good position where we're going to have a lot of flexibility as we move through this year with strong EBITDA growth and then as we get into 2023, expecting continued growth in our business. I think we'll continue to focus on investing organically, which is driving some of the really good returns for Targa and then really increasing our ability to return more capital to shareholders over time. But we'll have a lot of flexibility in 2023 to increase that return of capital to shareholders. So this fall, we'll discuss with our Board what the right dividend level is. We'll kind of look at our peers. We'll look at broader industry peers, S&P 400, 500 and then come up with a recommendation for a dividend. That will be one piece of the equation. And then we'll also look at continuing our share buybacks. You've seen us actually ramp that up here even in light of the Lucid acquisition. We've been increasing our share buybacks. I would still like to say that it is an opportunistic program. I don't see us just setting a level and say it's going to be this. We're going to look at the macro environment. We'll look at our organic growth projects, where we set our dividend and then come up with a plan that makes sense but have flexibility in that such that if we see some good opportunities to increase that, then we can do so.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. That's helpful. And just wanted to kind of clarify two points there as my follow-up. When you think about the dividend, is it relative to midstream peers or more kind of like S&P 500? And I guess there's concern in the marketplace with regards to this much free cash flow coming out next year and whether that be returned to shareholders or put to M&A. I'm just wondering any thoughts you could provide on that.\nMatt Meloy: Yes. I think as we look to the dividend, we will look towards broader industry peers. We will be informed by what our midstream peers do. We'll take a look at that. But I think we talked about when we moved our dividend to $1.40, having modest growth. We certainly have the ability to do that and a lot of flexibility and the ability to do more if we so desire to do more than modest growth. That will be a discussion with our Board. Either way, we're going to prioritize financial flexibility as we go forward to continue to invest in our business organically. And then I view M&A kind of similar to how we've talked about it. I think we continue to have a high bar for M&A. We need something that's going to put us in a really strong position coming out of the other side of the M&A with both the Southcross and the Lucid acquisitions. Our balance sheet is strong. We reported 3.1x leverage ratio. We're estimating 3.5x by year-end. So we want to make sure we have a strong balance sheet if we do any M&A. I'd say right now with as active as we've been this year, our focus is going to be on integrating those acquisitions and making sure we do those well and extract the synergies that we think we can get from those acquisitions. So I think our focus is going to be on integration here for a little while, even while we have significant cash flow to invest in our business organically and then increase return of capital to shareholders.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Brian Reynolds with UBS.\nBrian Reynolds: I was curious if you could just a little bit on commodity exposure post the recent Lucid acquisition and how we should think about the evolving kind of 60-40 G&P logistics and transportation earnings mix over time. Is it kind of fair to assume that we should see growth in fee-based in the L&T business going forward relative to G&P and POP exposure?\nMatt Meloy: Yes, sure. Our commodity exposure with Lucid really being, I'd say, entirely fee-based contract. There still is some embedded commodity exposure in there with just the way those contracts are settled, but it's primarily fee-based. So all things equal, that's going to marginally increase our fee-based margin over time. As we look at that mix, what's G&P and what's downstream, we kind of think of it more as we're going to continue to invest in both of those businesses. It's an integrated business. We're going to invest in G&P. And we're going to invest like we are with Train 9 and the export dock as needed to handle those volumes. And then -- so the mix is just going to kind of be a result of investing in our integrated platform. To the extent we get higher commodity prices and we move above our fee floors, then it ends up shifting a little bit more margin into our G&P business. That's really a result of just excess earnings and having a higher commodity price environment. So we don't have a target we're going for. We're just going to continue to invest in both businesses. That said, we see increasing fee-based margin just on an absolute basis continuing to grow. We're going to continue to have growth in our G&P business from fees. We're going to continue to have fee-based margin increase in our downstream business from fees.\nJen Kneale: And we'll also continue to look to add fee-based elements or floors to any existing contracts where we don't already have those particularly as contracts come up for expiration or there's some catalyst to be able to renegotiate those contracts. So that will also help provide additional cash flow stability on the downside going forward.\nBrian Reynolds: Great. I appreciate all that incremental color. Maybe as my one follow-up, the Lucid acquisition appeared to include some carbon and GC waste capabilities. Just given the recent 45Q credit increase included in Inflation Reduction Act proposal, how should we think about the potential opportunity set for Targa as the largest processor in Permian?\nMatt Meloy: Yes. Thank you. We have been working prior to Lucid, just on working on carbon capture to see if there's something we can commercialize across our Permian footprint. Lucid has made really good progress on that as well. And so I'd say I'm excited about the opportunity to be able to develop that, both in the Delaware and on the Midland side. They have some really good people over there who are really smart and knowledgeable about how to do this. And yes, you're right, with the 45Q, if that gets passed, increasing it makes those projects easier to get over the finish line. So I think with their expertise plus the work that we have done, it kind of increases our ability to commercialize that opportunity.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Keith Stanley with Wolfe Research.\nKeith Stanley: I guess to start just on Lucid synergies. Can you talk a little more about near-term, long-term opportunities and how impactful it might be? I guess near term, you referenced potentially shifting some Lucid volumes if it's above your capacity onto other Targa assets. Just any color along those lines and how you're thinking about that over time.\nMatt Meloy: Yes, sure. We think near term, there will be some synergies on the NGL side but just moving some volumes over to excess capacity we have out in our Far West Delaware processing plants. We have excess capacity. Lucid is running overcapacity. And so when we -- they're already tied together. We're actually working on putting in some more pipes to expand the capability to move more gas to and from. So some near term, just from what we call offloads on to our existing Targa system that then pushes those liquids down Grand Prix. And we expect over time as we add processing plants, those processing plants will be undedicated. We'll be able to capture some of those volumes and move those into our downstream business. That's another opportunity. And then as existing NGL dedications roll off over time, we'll be able to move those on to it as well. So I'd say there are some short term, some medium term and then some longer term where it's contracted or tied up. So I think it will be similar to how we think about that from our previous acquisitions we have done, it's going to be kind of a gradual increase in the ability for us to capture those liquids versus probably a cliff or just a really large amount coming all at one day. It's going to be a gradual move of NGLs onto our system over time.\nKeith Stanley: Great. And second question, just with the Inflation Reduction Act. Jen, can you just give an update on when you expect the Company to be a material cash taxpayer and how that bill is currently written could impact the Company?\nJen Kneale: So currently, Keith, it depends on ultimately what our earnings and profits are and the amount of growth capital spending that we undertake. But our current assumption is that we wouldn't really pay any cash taxes of any material amount until 2024, and then it would ramp from there. So it's probably, call it, 2027 before we've worked our way through our existing NOL. And then again, that could be shifting depending on growth capital spending, et cetera. With the Inflation Reduction Act, we could potentially be paying a minimum tax in 2024. But that would really be available -- those taxes would then be available to reduce regular income taxes in the future. So it would really create more of a timing shift of when we pay cash taxes versus anything else.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Colton Bean with Tudor, Pickering & Holt.\nColton Bean: So I apologize in advance for a few bundled questions here. But it looks like Grand Prix reached nearly 500,000 barrels a day during Q2. So one, can you frame the mix between Permian and Mid-Con? And then two, to the extent that Permian utilization continues to climb as new plants come online, is there any ability to push beyond that 550,000 barrel a day upside capacity? And if not, what sort of lead time would you need to loop the line to the 30-inch interconnect in North Texas?\nScott Pryor: Colton, this is Scott. I'll start it off and see if Matt has some other comments that he would want to add. But I would just say that we've not described exactly what the mix is from the West leg of our Grand Prix pipeline versus the Northern leg coming from Conway and in through the Kingfisher connection that we've got with the Williams pipeline with Bluestem. But it is a contributor to that, and that is one contributor that will grow over time as existing contracts with some of our customers roll off with competitors and those volumes roll on to us. We're certainly aware of the need of the west leg that we have today. And we are continuing to add pumps where it's necessary to pump up that pipeline. We are always evaluating what the needs are relative to increasing over and above maybe the 550,000 barrel limit that we have kind of stated publicly. And then we are obviously evaluating what the needs are to add additional transportation needs out of the Permian. It is our goal as we add gas processing plants in the Permian, both -- whether it's with the Delaware acquisition that we recently did or new plants on the Midland side, our goal is to make sure that those volumes run along our transportation legs, whether it's current Grand Prix pipeline or future expansions that we may do.\nColton Bean: Great. Maybe just on that last piece, any early expectations around what sort of lead time you would need to be able to loop the line to that larger interconnect?\nMatt Meloy: Yes. So we are working through that. We've got a number of processing plants underway now that are going to add significant liquids to us. We still have a fair amount of capacity that gives us a lot of lead time to be able to capture those. So I'd say right now, we're kind of working through looking at the timing of our transportation volume in the build and kind of evaluating when the right time to add additional transportation capacity is. So that's kind of something we're actively working on. And so just kind of -- we'll have to just kind of look at that as we go forward.\nColton Bean: Got it. And then just switching over to the G&P segment. A fairly material step-up in OpEx Q-on-Q. Any detail on the trajectory you're expecting here through the balance of the year?\nJen Kneale: Colton, this is Jen. I think you should expect an increased Q3 relative to Q2 just as a result of the Lucid acquisition. We are seeing inflation across our businesses on the cost side in terms of chemical costs and things like that. I think our teams are doing a really good job of trying to manage through that, but costs are higher. And then just as activity levels increase, that also results in higher costs as well. And we certainly have an expectation of activity levels on the G&P side continuing to increase rest of this year, both Delaware Basin plus standalone Targa.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Neal Dingmann with Truist Securities.\nDanny Peak: This is Danny Peak on filling in for Neal today. My first question is really about on expansion. You guys have some attractive plants and attracting areas coming online. Do you guys see any material demand for additional products? And if so, which region would you say is the strongest?\nMatt Meloy: Sorry, just to clarify, you say regional demand for products? Or are you kind of just referring to fractionation demand, is that...\nDanny Peak: Yes. That's correct, yes.\nMatt Meloy: Okay. As I kind of said in the scripted comments, we do see a tight frac market. Our volumes have ramped. A lot of the competitors' volumes, third parties volumes have ramped. So we're seeing a lot of wide-grade hit Belvieu. And so that market is tightening up. A lot of that is coming from the Permian from growth. A lot of it is also coming with some operational upsets we've had in the industry coming from other areas as well. So that's causing to kind of tighten up a bit. We still have some flexibility with our fractionation complex with Train 7 and 8 coming on and giving us some excess capacity. We have flexibility in Lake Charles. And we also are looking at what the right timing for a GCF potential restart is. So we're kind of sorting through that. So I think we'll be able to provide some outlets for that increased Y grade. But it is tightening up, and we do expect it to be tight for a while.\nDanny Peak: Okay. Great. And my last question is on capital allocation. Specifically, is there a leverage level where you would become more aggressive with stock buybacks? I know you guys are at your midpoint or expecting to be at your midpoint by year-end. But can you give any color on that? That will be it for me.\nJen Kneale: This is Jen. I think it's easier to be more aggressive if your leverage ratio is trending towards the lower end of your long-term leverage target range. But that may not be when the best opportunity presents itself in the market. So if you rewind it back to October of 2020, when we put the repurchase program in place, I wouldn't say that we had our leverage where we wanted it to be. But we saw a unique opportunity in the market to go and repurchase shares. And so we stepped into that. I'd expect that it's an important part of how we'll return capital going forward. The most important element of how we want to manage the profile of the Company is with maintaining a very strong balance sheet. So if our balance sheet is strong, which we really believe is within that long-term leverage target range of 3x to 4x, with a preference for that leverage ratio to be the bottom end of that range, I think you'll see us continue to have the flexibility to be active. And then it will just be a matter of what opportunity do we see presented in the market.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Chase Mulvehill with Bank of America.\nChase Mulvehill: I guess the first question is really just coming back to Permian processing capacity. Obviously, we've seen a lot of announcements recently for a lot of your peers adding processing capacity in the Permian. So if we kind of think about that and relative to yours, I think you got about 1.2 b a day of incremental capacity that you to bring online by the end of next year. Could you talk about the confidence you have of filling that? Would you bring those plants online?\nMatt Meloy: Sure. Chase, yes. No, we've got a lot -- I mean we run five plants right now across the Permian. I'd say we feel just kind of starting with the nearest term ones, we feel really good about those being full. I think Legacy I and Red Hills are both going to be highly utilized really the day they turn on. We are running absolutely full in the Midland. And it was actually over full in the Delaware on the Lucid asset. So I think those are going to be full kind of day 1. And when you go to the Midway plant, that is a partial -- that's a replacement. We're going to be idling the Sand Hills plant. So we'll move those volumes over and then have available for growth there. So most of that is going to be utilized just from the Sand Hills volumes day 1. And so then that leaves two more processing plants in the Midland Basin. We've added a number of plants in the Permian Midland. And it's really been the same story for us as soon as we bring it on with the flush production coming from kind of lowering overall field pressures plus the growth. We feel very optimistic we're going to be able to have those highly utilized when they come on and then fill up very quickly. So I think really, the next question becomes when do we need more -- what's the cadence beyond that. We feel like hopefully, with -- on the Midland side with adding Legacy II and adding Greenwood, maybe that gives us a little bit of time. But I think we'll be quickly looking at the Delaware for when we're going to need another plant out there. So I think we're more thinking about when we're going to need another one as opposed to are we going to be able to fill the ones we've announced.\nChase Mulvehill: Well, good to hear. And then can I ask on Waha basis real quick. Obviously, there's some risk of widening out kind of 2Q, 3Q or maybe even before next year. I'm just kind of curious on kind of your thoughts on the risk -- more just the basis risk than the volume risk. But the basis risk that you have out there and maybe how much you kind of hedged of that risk?\nMatt Meloy: Sure. Yes, I'd say our risk out there is we want to make sure that we can flow the volume. So when Waha tightens out, if it gets difficult moving it out, we want to make sure that we can move it. So we've been active at taking out transportation and making sure we can get the volumes away from our plant and to market. As far as the overall Waha basis risk, our length in natural gas, when we hedge, we hedge it at Waha. So really, what we want is kind of an absolute higher Waha price versus a whole lot of exposure to the spread. So we want absolute Waha prices to be high. We want to make sure we can get volumes out.\nChase Mulvehill: Okay. Makes sense. I'll respect the two questions. And hopefully, somebody will ask about Medford.\nMatt Meloy: Thanks.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Sunil Sibal with Seaport Global Securities.\nSunil Sibal: So I wanted to start off on the capital side of things. So obviously, you've raised 2022 budget. I was kind of curious how should we be thinking about puts and takes for the 2023 capital spend. You obviously have outlined a few expansion projects. So from that perspective, what kind of cost inflation you're seeing? And then how should we be thinking about the '23 budget?\nJen Kneale: Sunil, this is Jen. For 2022, we've really accelerated projects that were in our five-year plan, but just we need them sooner given the visibility that we have to volume growth when you think about Train 9 spending shifting into 2022. Think about Greenwood spending shifting into 2022. And then the adder would be the Delaware Basin acquisition and the continued build-out of those assets. As we look into 2023, I think that part of what will impact our growth capital budget for next year will be potential spending on next plants, whether that be on the Delaware side or the next plant needed on the Greenwood side. But I'd expect that we will be spending capital at levels very much commiserate with the size of the Company. And so as we've gotten bigger, we just have more flexibility capacity to spend more. But we also don't have a lot of visibility to what I call additional large projects beyond those that we've already announced other than incremental processing expansions, a looping or other project associated with Grand Prix and NGL transportation down the road. That would be the one that just depending on what we're seeing on volume growth. The next large project that we have on the radar screen and the timing of that, again, will be dependent on the continued growth of NGL transport volumes.\nSunil Sibal: Just to clarify. So what you're saying is that unless you announce more projects, you should see a bit of a step-down in '23 CapEx based on all that you announced?\nJen Kneale: I don't know if I'd say that we'll see a step down. We'll provide formal guidance in February, typical with our time frame of when we provide CapEx guidance for the following year. We do have some spending that's shifting into this year and that spending on frac Train 9 that otherwise may have occurred next year. We've got spending on Greenwood shifting into this year that otherwise may have occurred next year. But I think we're very comfortable with spending around these levels. And then ultimately, it's our visibility to increasing volume growth and where the next pinch point is within our asset footprint that will result in us needing to move forward with the next project. I'd say that there isn't something large looming out there that would have a material impact on growth capital spending at this point in time.\nSunil Sibal: Got it. And then my second question was related to the IRA. I understand that there are some provisions in that with regard to limiting methane emissions from processing facilities. So I was curious if you had a chance to look through that. And how do you think that impacts your footprint? You've obviously highlighted plans to reduce methane emissions. But does your plans kind of tie in with new requirements in IRA. Or how should we think about that?\nMatt Meloy: Yes, sure. So our -- yes, our ES&H group has been really active at kind of evaluating what that methane tax or what the regulations could entail. We actually were looking at it quite a bit in the last round this came about. We took a look at it. We are focused on reducing our emissions, improving our intensity. We have a lot of projects that we're moving forward with to try and reduce that. So we'll -- we're very good at compliance, very good at meeting rules and regulations. And I think our ES&H Group is up to the task on that. And we'll see what the ultimate -- what the fee or what all the operating parameters are for setting those limits and everything else. So it's early. We'll have to see what ultimately gets passed. But I'd say we are actively focused on it, working on it and we'll perform very well.\nOperator: And our next question will come from John Mackay with Goldman Sachs.\nJohn Mackay: I wanted to start on L&T. You guys touched a little bit on marketing being weak. But just given how strong volumes were, could you just talk a little bit about what's going on this quarter? Was it a kind of one-off on margin dipping? Or is this kind of the run rate unit margins that we should think about going forward?\nScott Pryor: I would -- first off, I would say, John, that we had a very strong first quarter as it relates to some of our marketing and optimization around that, not quite as active in the second quarter. And that's -- that would be somewhat seasonal and typical for us when we roll into the second quarter. With that said, when we look at the growth that we've had on the fractionation volume side, obviously, record volumes there. We've had increased volumes flowing down our transportation assets in and through Mont Belvieu. So we've seen some nice increases on that. And then our export business continues to be very consistent, quarter in and quarter out. Obviously, with pricing the way that it is today, with the backwardation that we're seeing across really the U.S. pricing as well as international pricing, that presents itself some challenges. But all in all, with the volume growth that we're seeing on our G&P side of the ledger, those volumes are going to be steered toward our transportation assets to our fractionation footprint. We're going to continue to see volumes increase over time. So we feel very comfortable where we sit. Obviously, we've got a lot of work to do as it relates to our announcement around Trade 9 and bringing those -- bringing that fractionation train back on. And we see opportunities there just to continue to grow with the volumes.\nJohn Mackay: All right. Maybe just unpacking a little bit of what you said there, just in terms of the export business. We've seen some softness in petchem demand overall. Maybe you can just share kind of where you see that sitting right now and how that should trend for the rest of the year.\nScott Pryor: From an international perspective, is that what you're referring to?\nJohn Mackay: Yes, for the export business.\nScott Pryor: Well, again, from our volumes, we've seen consistency quarter in and quarter out. There has probably been more of a challenge on the butane export side of the business. Some of that's related for backwardation, again, that we're seeing on propane as well as butane. But internationally, yes, it's been a little bit more -- a little tougher on the butane side. Spreads have been compressed. We have also seen that internationally, butane prices are actually trailing behind propane prices. And so when you look at the risk of waterborne traders, when you look at the consumption overseas, obviously, dealing with potential issues just with the economies, we'll be facing some challenges. We feel very comfortable, though, with our term contracts. We've not had any cancellations across our dock. So we, again, believe that we'll see consistency with that. We feel very comfortable also with our expansion that will come online mid next year, adding some additional flexibility. So all in all, I think the cadence of our export business looks very smooth relative to overall expansions that we're doing across our entire downstream business that complements our upstream side.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Michael Cusimano with Pickering Energy Partners.\nMichael Cusimano: On my numbers for '22, you have realized almost $300 million of hedge losses year-to-date on the G&P system. And disclosures are kind of stale, but my math shows a couple of hundred remaining for the rest of the year. So I was hoping you could talk about '23 hedges. We're not sure where they're priced necessarily. But given the recent commodity weakness, are those looking like potentially even a net benefit next year even if spot prices stay high? It just seems like there's almost a $500 million tailwind going into next year just from hedge realizations rolling off. I was hoping you can give some more clarity there.\nJen Kneale: We have hedged at higher prices in 2023 relative to 2022. So that will provide a nice tailwind for us. If you look across all commodities, I'd say that our hedge prices right now are, call it, 25% plus higher than where they are for 2022. So I think you're right in saying that, that will be a nice tailwind for us as well as just continued volume growth as well. So if we have continued higher prices like we're seeing more prompt given the backwardation in the market, then as we realize those higher prices on additional volumes, that will be a nice tailwind as well.\nMichael Cusimano: Got it. That's very helpful. And then I'll kind of take the bait and asking about just Medford impact which I've seen on your system. And part of the strength in the frac volumes are a direct result of that.\nMatt Meloy: Yes. So I really kind of answer the overall frac market question previously. The frac market is tied. It's a combination of increased volumes from Y-grade. And you have some operational upsets from the industry that is moving more volumes to Belvieu. So yes, that is tightening up the Belvieu to some extent.\nOperator: And this will conclude our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Sanjay Lad for any closing remarks.\nSanjay Lad: Great. Thanks to everyone that was on the call this morning, and we appreciate your interest in Targa Resources. The IR team will be available for any follow-up questions you may have. Have a great day.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines at this time.",

            "content": "Colton, this is Scott. I'll start it off and see if Matt has some other comments that he would want to add. But I would just say that we've not described exactly what the mix is from the West leg of our Grand Prix pipeline versus the Northern leg coming from Conway and in through the Kingfisher connection that we've got with the Williams pipeline with Bluestem. But it is a contributor to that, and that is one contributor that will grow over time as existing contracts with some of our customers roll off with competitors and those volumes roll on to us. We're certainly aware of the need of the west leg that we have today. And we are continuing to add pumps where it's necessary to pump up that pipeline. We are always evaluating what the needs are relative to increasing over and above maybe the 550,000 barrel limit that we have kind of stated publicly. And then we are obviously evaluating what the needs are to add additional transportation needs out of the Permian. It is our goal as we add gas processing plants in the Permian, both -- whether it's with the Delaware acquisition that we recently did or new plants on the Midland side, our goal is to make sure that those volumes run along our transportation legs, whether it's current Grand Prix pipeline or future expansions that we may do. I would -- first off, I would say, John, that we had a very strong first quarter as it relates to some of our marketing and optimization around that, not quite as active in the second quarter. And that's -- that would be somewhat seasonal and typical for us when we roll into the second quarter. With that said, when we look at the growth that we've had on the fractionation volume side, obviously, record volumes there. We've had increased volumes flowing down our transportation assets in and through Mont Belvieu. So we've seen some nice increases on that. And then our export business continues to be very consistent, quarter in and quarter out. Obviously, with pricing the way that it is today, with the backwardation that we're seeing across really the U.S. pricing as well as international pricing, that presents itself some challenges. But all in all, with the volume growth that we're seeing on our G&P side of the ledger, those volumes are going to be steered toward our transportation assets to our fractionation footprint. We're going to continue to see volumes increase over time. So we feel very comfortable where we sit. Obviously, we've got a lot of work to do as it relates to our announcement around Trade 9 and bringing those -- bringing that fractionation train back on. And we see opportunities there just to continue to grow with the volumes. From an international perspective, is that what you're referring to? Well, again, from our volumes, we've seen consistency quarter in and quarter out. There has probably been more of a challenge on the butane export side of the business. Some of that's related for backwardation, again, that we're seeing on propane as well as butane. But internationally, yes, it's been a little bit more -- a little tougher on the butane side. Spreads have been compressed. We have also seen that internationally, butane prices are actually trailing behind propane prices. And so when you look at the risk of waterborne traders, when you look at the consumption overseas, obviously, dealing with potential issues just with the economies, we'll be facing some challenges.

            "content": "Thanks, Matt. Targa's reported quarterly adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter was $666.4 million, increasing 6% sequentially as we benefited from higher commodity prices and higher volumes across our gathering and processing and logistics and transportation systems, partially offset by lower marketing margin and higher operating expenses. Higher operating expenses were primarily attributable to increasing activity levels across our G&P systems, our recently acquired assets in South Texas and inflation. While costs are higher, inflation continues to be a net tailwind for us across our businesses as we benefit from inflation-linked fee escalators across our commercial contracts. Targa generated adjusted free cash flow of $334 million in the second quarter. During the second quarter, we completed the redemption of all of our outstanding Series A preferred stock for approximately $973 million and also received the proceeds associated with the sale of our interest in Gulf Coast Express pipeline of $857 million. Our consolidated net leverage ratio was 3.1x at the end of the second quarter, and we had about $2.3 billion of available liquidity. We repurchased about $74 million of common shares in the second quarter and repurchased an additional $30 million during July. We have approximately $215 million remaining under our $500 million repurchase program. Since the inception of our common share repurchase program in the fourth quarter of 2020, we have opportunistically repurchased $285 million of common shares or about 8.6 million shares at an average price of $33.12. We continue to expect to pay a common dividend per share of $1.40 for 2022 with our next dividend increase likely to be announced in early 2023, concurrent with when we expect to provide 2023 operational and financial guidance. Throughout the year, we have added hedges and we are significantly hedged for the balance of 2022. We have also continued to add 2023 hedges at higher weighted average hedge prices than 2022. It has been a very active couple of months for the finance team as we were able to attractively finance our Delaware Basin acquisition through a combination of five-year and 30-year senior notes issued in the investment-grade market, a three-year term loan and availability under our revolver. Pro forma for the acquisition, we have about $1.1 billion of liquidity available on our revolver. Benefiting from now being an investment-grade issuer, we also recently entered into a commercial paper program. As Matt mentioned, we are updating our financial estimates to account for a partial year contribution from the Delaware Basin acquisition and now estimate full year 2022 adjusted EBITDA to be between $2.85 billion and $2.95 billion and continue to estimate a year-end leverage ratio of around 3.5x. With the addition of spending in 2022 for the Greenwood plant and Train 9 announced today, plus spending to support the newly acquired Delaware Basin assets, we now estimate 2022 net growth CapEx to be between $1 billion and $1.1 billion. Our estimate for 2022 net maintenance CapEx remains unchanged at approximately $150 million. Our continued investment in growing Targa's underlying businesses, supported by solid business fundamentals and the strength of our balance sheet means we are in excellent position looking forward to continue to return an increasing amount of capital to our shareholders. Lastly, I'd like to echo Matt and thank our employees for their dedication and for continuing to prioritize safety. And with that, I will turn the call back over to Sanjay. And we'll also continue to look to add fee-based elements or floors to any existing contracts where we don't already have those particularly as contracts come up for expiration or there's some catalyst to be able to renegotiate those contracts. So that will also help provide additional cash flow stability on the downside going forward. So currently, Keith, it depends on ultimately what our earnings and profits are and the amount of growth capital spending that we undertake. But our current assumption is that we wouldn't really pay any cash taxes of any material amount until 2024, and then it would ramp from there. So it's probably, call it, 2027 before we've worked our way through our existing NOL. And then again, that could be shifting depending on growth capital spending, et cetera. With the Inflation Reduction Act, we could potentially be paying a minimum tax in 2024. But that would really be available -- those taxes would then be available to reduce regular income taxes in the future. So it would really create more of a timing shift of when we pay cash taxes versus anything else. Colton, this is Jen. I think you should expect an increased Q3 relative to Q2 just as a result of the Lucid acquisition. We are seeing inflation across our businesses on the cost side in terms of chemical costs and things like that. I think our teams are doing a really good job of trying to manage through that, but costs are higher. And then just as activity levels increase, that also results in higher costs as well. And we certainly have an expectation of activity levels on the G&P side continuing to increase rest of this year, both Delaware Basin plus standalone Targa. This is Jen. I think it's easier to be more aggressive if your leverage ratio is trending towards the lower end of your long-term leverage target range. But that may not be when the best opportunity presents itself in the market. So if you rewind it back to October of 2020, when we put the repurchase program in place, I wouldn't say that we had our leverage where we wanted it to be. But we saw a unique opportunity in the market to go and repurchase shares. And so we stepped into that. I'd expect that it's an important part of how we'll return capital going forward. The most important element of how we want to manage the profile of the Company is with maintaining a very strong balance sheet. So if our balance sheet is strong, which we really believe is within that long-term leverage target range of 3x to 4x, with a preference for that leverage ratio to be the bottom end of that range, I think you'll see us continue to have the flexibility to be active. And then it will just be a matter of what opportunity do we see presented in the market. Sunil, this is Jen. For 2022, we've really accelerated projects that were in our five-year plan, but just we need them sooner given the visibility that we have to volume growth when you think about Train 9 spending shifting into 2022. Think about Greenwood spending shifting into 2022. And then the adder would be the Delaware Basin acquisition and the continued build-out of those assets. As we look into 2023, I think that part of what will impact our growth capital budget for next year will be potential spending on next plants, whether that be on the Delaware side or the next plant needed on the Greenwood side. But I'd expect that we will be spending capital at levels very much commiserate with the size of the Company. And so as we've gotten bigger, we just have more flexibility capacity to spend more. But we also don't have a lot of visibility to what I call additional large projects beyond those that we've already announced other than incremental processing expansions, a looping or other project associated with Grand Prix and NGL transportation down the road. That would be the one that just depending on what we're seeing on volume growth. The next large project that we have on the radar screen and the timing of that, again, will be dependent on the continued growth of NGL transport volumes. I don't know if I'd say that we'll see a step down. We'll provide formal guidance in February, typical with our time frame of when we provide CapEx guidance for the following year. We do have some spending that's shifting into this year and that spending on frac Train 9 that otherwise may have occurred next year. We've got spending on Greenwood shifting into this year that otherwise may have occurred next year. But I think we're very comfortable with spending around these levels. And then ultimately, it's our visibility to increasing volume growth and where the next pinch point is within our asset footprint that will result in us needing to move forward with the next project. I'd say that there isn't something large looming out there that would have a material impact on growth capital spending at this point in time. We have hedged at higher prices in 2023 relative to 2022. So that will provide a nice tailwind for us. If you look across all commodities, I'd say that our hedge prices right now are, call it, 25% plus higher than where they are for 2022. So I think you're right in saying that, that will be a nice tailwind for us as well as just continued volume growth as well. So if we have continued higher prices like we're seeing more prompt given the backwardation in the market, then as we realize those higher prices on additional volumes, that will be a nice tailwind as well."

            "name": "Matt Meloy",
            "content": "Thanks, Sanjay, and good morning. This is an exciting time for our company. And given the recent close of our Delaware Basin acquisition, I want to take this opportunity to publicly welcome our new colleagues to the Targa team. I would also like to thank all of our employees for their collective efforts as it has been a very busy first seven months of 2022, and the team has already accomplished a lot. And our strong execution continued across the second quarter, including record-high quarterly EBITDA, record volumes in the Permian, record NGL transportation and fractionation volumes, redemption of Series A preferred stock, completing the successful sale of our interest in Gulf Coast Express Pipeline, integration of our acquired South Texas assets, successful negotiation of our Delaware Basin acquisition and subsequent financing and $74 million of common share repurchases. Looking ahead, continuing to execute on our strategic priorities will drive increasing EBITDA, reduced common share count, a higher common dividend while maintaining leverage within our target range. Our performance this year has been strong, and we expect that to continue. We are updating our financial guidance for the year to account for the completion of the Delaware Basin acquisition effective August 1. We now estimate full year 2022 adjusted EBITDA to be between $2.85 billion and $2.95 billion. We continue to expect volumes to grow across both our Permian Midland and Delaware positions for the remainder of the year and well beyond. We have several gas plants under construction, Legacy I and Legacy II in the Permian Midland and Midway and Red Hill IV in the Permian Delaware. And given our line of sight to increasing G&P volume growth, we are continuing to invest across our NGL business. We are announcing two new projects, a new 275 million cubic feet per day processing plant in the Permian Midland, which we are calling the Greenwood plant; and a new 120,000 barrel per day Train 9 fractionator in Mont Belvieu. Investing in organic growth projects across our integrated footprint provides Targa with attractive returns and puts us in a strong position to continue to return capital to our shareholders. Turning to our Delaware Basin acquisition and our combined Permian Basin footprint. On a combined basis, we now have about 2.8 billion cubic feet per day of processing capacity in the Permian Delaware, complementing our 3.6 Bcf per day processing position in the Permian Midland for a combined total of 6.4 Bcf per day of processing capacity. Our assets in the Delaware Basin overlay some of the most economic acreage in North America with the acquisition, increasing our size and scale by extending our reach into the highly active and productive Eddy and Lea counties of New Mexico. We now have several million acres dedicated to us across the Permian Basin, providing decades of future activity that will result in increasing volumes moving across our integrated assets. We acquired the Delaware Basin assets at an attractive 7.5x multiple of estimated 2023 EBITDA and expect volume growth as well as near- and long-term synergies to reduce the acquisition multiple. We expect to capture downstream synergies over time as existing contracts come up for renewal and from new Targa processing expansions. We funded the acquisition with cash on hand and debt and expect to end the year with leverage around 3.5x, comfortably around the midpoint of our 3x to 4x long-term leverage target ratio. Let's now discuss our operations in more detail. Starting in the Permian, our systems across the Midland and Delaware Basins continue to perform well, averaging a record 3.1 Bcf per day reported inlet volume during the second quarter. In Permian Midland, our systems continue to run full, and we expect to bring online our next 275 Mmcf per day Legacy I plant later this month, which is expected to come online highly utilized. A special thanks to our engineering and operations teams for working diligently and safely to bring Legacy online ahead of schedule. Our Legacy II plant in Permian Midland remains on track to begin operations during the second quarter of 2023, and we similarly expect it to be highly utilized when it comes online. In Permian Delaware, volumes across our system are also continuing to ramp. Our new 230 million a day Red Hills VI plant is expected online in September. And our new 275 million a day Midway plant is expected to begin operations during the third quarter of 2023. We expect Red Hills VI to essentially be full when it comes online, and we have flexibility across our Permian Delaware system to handle additional near-term production growth from Eddy and Lea counties with connections to Targa plants. Shifting to the Badlands. Late winter storms impacted our natural gas and crude gathering volumes for the second quarter, but volumes have since rebounded. In our Central region, the acquired assets in South Texas and an uptick in activity levels in Oklahoma and North Texas drove a sequential increase in volumes during the second quarter. Shifting to our Logistics and Transportation segment. NGL transportation volumes were a record 492,000 barrels per day to Mont Belvieu during the second quarter. Throughput volumes sequentially increased 7% driven by increasing NGL production from Targa's Permian plants and third parties. Fractionation volumes at our Mont Belvieu complex during the second quarter were a record 737,000 barrels per day, and the fractionation market in Mont Belvieu continues to tighten. We are moving forward with Train 9 given our outlook for continued supply growth from our Permian G&P systems and third parties. Train 9 is fully permitted and is expected to begin operations during the second quarter of 2024 with an estimated cost of around $450 million. In our LPG export services business at Galena Park, we loaded an average of 10.4 million barrels per month during the second quarter, providing a consistent outlook for our customers despite continued volatility in global commodity markets. We continue to expect to complete our previously announced low-cost expansion project to increase our propane loading capabilities with an incremental 1 million barrels per month of capacity by mid-2023. Lastly, year-to-date, we have purchased almost 2.4 million common shares at a cost of around $154 million. Our balance sheet is strong. We are continuing to invest in our business, both organically and through acquisitions. We are returning an increasing amount of capital to our shareholders, and we are excited about Targa's outlook. Before I turn the call over to Jen, I would like to extend a final thank you to our employees for their continued focus on safety while executing on our strategic priorities and continuing to provide best-in-class services to our customers. Jen? Yes. Jeremy, we really are in a good position where we're going to have a lot of flexibility as we move through this year with strong EBITDA growth and then as we get into 2023, expecting continued growth in our business. I think we'll continue to focus on investing organically, which is driving some of the really good returns for Targa and then really increasing our ability to return more capital to shareholders over time. But we'll have a lot of flexibility in 2023 to increase that return of capital to shareholders. So this fall, we'll discuss with our Board what the right dividend level is. We'll kind of look at our peers. We'll look at broader industry peers, S&P 400, 500 and then come up with a recommendation for a dividend. That will be one piece of the equation. And then we'll also look at continuing our share buybacks. You've seen us actually ramp that up here even in light of the Lucid acquisition. We've been increasing our share buybacks. I would still like to say that it is an opportunistic program. I don't see us just setting a level and say it's going to be this. We're going to look at the macro environment. We'll look at our organic growth projects, where we set our dividend and then come up with a plan that makes sense but have flexibility in that such that if we see some good opportunities to increase that, then we can do so. Yes. I think as we look to the dividend, we will look towards broader industry peers. We will be informed by what our midstream peers do. We'll take a look at that. But I think we talked about when we moved our dividend to $1.40, having modest growth. We certainly have the ability to do that and a lot of flexibility and the ability to do more if we so desire to do more than modest growth. That will be a discussion with our Board. Either way, we're going to prioritize financial flexibility as we go forward to continue to invest in our business organically. And then I view M&A kind of similar to how we've talked about it. I think we continue to have a high bar for M&A. We need something that's going to put us in a really strong position coming out of the other side of the M&A with both the Southcross and the Lucid acquisitions. Our balance sheet is strong. We reported 3.1x leverage ratio. We're estimating 3.5x by year-end. So we want to make sure we have a strong balance sheet if we do any M&A. I'd say right now with as active as we've been this year, our focus is going to be on integrating those acquisitions and making sure we do those well and extract the synergies that we think we can get from those acquisitions. So I think our focus is going to be on integration here for a little while, even while we have significant cash flow to invest in our business organically and then increase return of capital to shareholders. Yes, sure. Our commodity exposure with Lucid really being, I'd say, entirely fee-based contract. There still is some embedded commodity exposure in there with just the way those contracts are settled, but it's primarily fee-based. So all things equal, that's going to marginally increase our fee-based margin over time. As we look at that mix, what's G&P and what's downstream, we kind of think of it more as we're going to continue to invest in both of those businesses. It's an integrated business. We're going to invest in G&P. And we're going to invest like we are with Train 9 and the export dock as needed to handle those volumes. And then -- so the mix is just going to kind of be a result of investing in our integrated platform. To the extent we get higher commodity prices and we move above our fee floors, then it ends up shifting a little bit more margin into our G&P business. That's really a result of just excess earnings and having a higher commodity price environment. So we don't have a target we're going for. We're just going to continue to invest in both businesses. That said, we see increasing fee-based margin just on an absolute basis continuing to grow. We're going to continue to have growth in our G&P business from fees. We're going to continue to have fee-based margin increase in our downstream business from fees. Yes. Thank you. We have been working prior to Lucid, just on working on carbon capture to see if there's something we can commercialize across our Permian footprint. Lucid has made really good progress on that as well. And so I'd say I'm excited about the opportunity to be able to develop that, both in the Delaware and on the Midland side. They have some really good people over there who are really smart and knowledgeable about how to do this. And yes, you're right, with the 45Q, if that gets passed, increasing it makes those projects easier to get over the finish line. So I think with their expertise plus the work that we have done, it kind of increases our ability to commercialize that opportunity. Yes, sure. We think near term, there will be some synergies on the NGL side but just moving some volumes over to excess capacity we have out in our Far West Delaware processing plants. We have excess capacity. Lucid is running overcapacity. And so when we -- they're already tied together. We're actually working on putting in some more pipes to expand the capability to move more gas to and from. So some near term, just from what we call offloads on to our existing Targa system that then pushes those liquids down Grand Prix. And we expect over time as we add processing plants, those processing plants will be undedicated. We'll be able to capture some of those volumes and move those into our downstream business. That's another opportunity. And then as existing NGL dedications roll off over time, we'll be able to move those on to it as well. So I'd say there are some short term, some medium term and then some longer term where it's contracted or tied up. So I think it will be similar to how we think about that from our previous acquisitions we have done, it's going to be kind of a gradual increase in the ability for us to capture those liquids versus probably a cliff or just a really large amount coming all at one day. It's going to be a gradual move of NGLs onto our system over time. Yes. So we are working through that. We've got a number of processing plants underway now that are going to add significant liquids to us. We still have a fair amount of capacity that gives us a lot of lead time to be able to capture those. So I'd say right now, we're kind of working through looking at the timing of our transportation volume in the build and kind of evaluating when the right time to add additional transportation capacity is. So that's kind of something we're actively working on. And so just kind of -- we'll have to just kind of look at that as we go forward. Sorry, just to clarify, you say regional demand for products? Or are you kind of just referring to fractionation demand, is that... Okay. As I kind of said in the scripted comments, we do see a tight frac market. Our volumes have ramped. A lot of the competitors' volumes, third parties volumes have ramped. So we're seeing a lot of wide-grade hit Belvieu. And so that market is tightening up. A lot of that is coming from the Permian from growth. A lot of it is also coming with some operational upsets we've had in the industry coming from other areas as well. So that's causing to kind of tighten up a bit. We still have some flexibility with our fractionation complex with Train 7 and 8 coming on and giving us some excess capacity. We have flexibility in Lake Charles. And we also are looking at what the right timing for a GCF potential restart is. So we're kind of sorting through that. So I think we'll be able to provide some outlets for that increased Y grade. But it is tightening up, and we do expect it to be tight for a while. Sure. Chase, yes. No, we've got a lot -- I mean we run five plants right now across the Permian. I'd say we feel just kind of starting with the nearest term ones, we feel really good about those being full. I think Legacy I and Red Hills are both going to be highly utilized really the day they turn on. We are running absolutely full in the Midland. And it was actually over full in the Delaware on the Lucid asset. So I think those are going to be full kind of day 1. And when you go to the Midway plant, that is a partial -- that's a replacement. We're going to be idling the Sand Hills plant. So we'll move those volumes over and then have available for growth there. So most of that is going to be utilized just from the Sand Hills volumes day 1. And so then that leaves two more processing plants in the Midland Basin. We've added a number of plants in the Permian Midland. And it's really been the same story for us as soon as we bring it on with the flush production coming from kind of lowering overall field pressures plus the growth. We feel very optimistic we're going to be able to have those highly utilized when they come on and then fill up very quickly. So I think really, the next question becomes when do we need more -- what's the cadence beyond that. We feel like hopefully, with -- on the Midland side with adding Legacy II and adding Greenwood, maybe that gives us a little bit of time. But I think we'll be quickly looking at the Delaware for when we're going to need another plant out there. So I think we're more thinking about when we're going to need another one as opposed to are we going to be able to fill the ones we've announced. Sure. Yes, I'd say our risk out there is we want to make sure that we can flow the volume. So when Waha tightens out, if it gets difficult moving it out, we want to make sure that we can move it. So we've been active at taking out transportation and making sure we can get the volumes away from our plant and to market. As far as the overall Waha basis risk, our length in natural gas, when we hedge, we hedge it at Waha. So really, what we want is kind of an absolute higher Waha price versus a whole lot of exposure to the spread. So we want absolute Waha prices to be high. We want to make sure we can get volumes out. Thanks. Yes, sure. So our -- yes, our ES&H group has been really active at kind of evaluating what that methane tax or what the regulations could entail. We actually were looking at it quite a bit in the last round this came about. We took a look at it. We are focused on reducing our emissions, improving our intensity. We have a lot of projects that we're moving forward with to try and reduce that. So we'll -- we're very good at compliance, very good at meeting rules and regulations. And I think our ES&H Group is up to the task on that. And we'll see what the ultimate -- what the fee or what all the operating parameters are for setting those limits and everything else. So it's early. We'll have to see what ultimately gets passed. But I'd say we are actively focused on it, working on it and we'll perform very well. Yes. So I really kind of answer the overall frac market question previously. The frac market is tied. It's a combination of increased volumes from Y-grade. And you have some operational upsets from the industry that is moving more volumes to Belvieu. So yes, that is tightening up the Belvieu to some extent."

I would now like to hand the conference over to your first speaker today, Sanjay Lad, Vice President of Finance and Investor Relations. Sir, please go ahead.\nSanjay Lad: Thanks, RJ. Good morning, and welcome to the first quarter 2022 earnings call for Targa Resources Corp. The first quarter earnings release, along with the first quarter earnings supplement presentation for Targa Resources that accompany our call, are available on our website at targaresources.com in the Investors Section. In addition, an updated investor presentation has also been posted to our website.  Statements made during this call that might include Targa Resources' expectations or predictions should be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in forward-looking statements. For a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ, please refer to our latest SEC filings.  Our speakers for the call today will be Matt Meloy, Chief Executive Officer; and Jen Kneale, Chief Financial Officer. Additionally, the following senior management team members will be available for Q&A. Pat McDonie, President, Gathering and Processing; Scott Pryor, President, Logistics and Transportation; and Bobby Muraro, Chief Commercial Officer.  And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Matt.\nMatthew Meloy: Thanks, Sanjay, and good morning. We are continuing to perform well and are off to a good start to the year on a number of fronts. Record high quarterly EBITDA of $626 million, record volumes in the Permian and record NGL transportation and fractionation volumes.  We also achieved investment-grade ratings from all 3 agencies during the quarter. We completed our corporate simplification, with the DevCo repurchase in January and with the redemption of our preferred stock earlier this week.  We continue to invest across our businesses with ongoing construction of the Legacy I, Legacy II and Midway plants in the Permian, plus the acquisition of bolt-on assets in South Texas.  We repurchased additional common shares as part of our increasing return of capital to investors. And our reported leverage ratio at 3.4x is in the bottom half of our long-term target range of 3x to 4x.  Pro forma for the repurchase of our DevCo interest, our preferred stock redemption, our South Texas acquisition and our GCX sale, our leverage is 3.3x.  While we had a strong first quarter with EBITDA up $55 million versus Q4, commodity prices really began to move higher late in the quarter. So we did not see a lot of first quarter price benefit, as our realized prices were relatively flat compared to the fourth quarter. But since then, prices are providing some nice tailwinds for the balance of the year. Given the strong underlying fundamentals of Targa's businesses, we continue to expect that if prices average around current levels for 2022, we would exceed the top end of our previously disclosed full year financial guidance range.  Let's now turn the call -- or let's now discuss operational in more detail. Starting in the Permian, our systems across the Midland and Delaware Basins continued to perform well, averaging over 3 billion cubic feet per day inlet volume during the first quarter. Volumes across our Permian systems increased quarter-over-quarter despite being impacted by winter weather conditions, particularly in January and February. Volumes quickly rebounded, with March and April volumes up nicely over the first quarter average. We continued to see strong activity levels across both our Midland and Delaware footprint, and expect to benefit from this positive momentum as we move through 2022.  In Permian Midland, our systems continued to run near full and our engineering and operations teams are working diligently to bring our next 275 million cubic feet per day Legacy plant online safely later this year. Our Legacy II plant, another new 275 million cubic feet per day plant in Permian Midland, is expected to begin operations during the second quarter of 2023.  In Permian Delaware, volumes across our system are also continuing to ramp. Our new 275 million cubic feet per day Midway plant is expected to begin operations during the third quarter of 2023. Midway will provide us with additional flexibility to flow volumes between our Midland and Delaware systems in addition to improving our overall operational performance in the region.  For full year 2022, we continue to expect our average Permian inlet volumes to increase by 12% to 15% over 2021 volumes.  In our Central and Badlands regions, first quarter volumes were impacted by winter weather conditions, most notably in the Badlands. We are seeing stronger activity levels across several regions given the higher commodity price environment.  In April, we completed the acquisition of assets in South Texas and are quickly integrating the assets and related contracts acquired in our South Texas gathering and processing operations and expect the acquisition to be immediately accretive. We would like to thank everyone involved in helping make the integration go smoothly.  Shifting to our Logistics and Transportation segment. NGL transportation volumes continued to increase, and we transported a record 460,000 barrels per day to Mont Belvieu during the first quarter. Throughput volumes sequentially increased 6%, driven by increasing NGL production from Targa's Permian plants and third parties. Fractionation volumes at our Mont Belvieu complex during the first quarter rebounded at 703,000 per day following fourth quarter's unplanned outage. Looking ahead, we expect NGL transportation and fractionation volumes to continue to benefit from increasing supply from our growing Permian G&P position.  In our LPG export services business at Galena Park, we loaded an average of 10.2 million barrels per month during the first quarter. The outlook for our LPG export business remains strong. We are advancing our previously announced low-cost expansion project to increase our propane loading capabilities, which will add an incremental 1 million barrels per month of capacity by mid-2023.  The longer-term outlook for Targa remains strong. Our premier integrated Permian NGL business, complemented by our talented employees and strong balance sheet, position Targa to deliver safe, reliable energy domestically and globally.  And before I turn the call over to Jen, I would like to thank our employees for their continued focus on safety, while executing on our strategic priorities and continuing to provide best-in-class services to our customers.  With that, I will turn the call over to Jen.\nJennifer Kneale: Thanks, Matt. Targa's reported quarterly adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter was $626 million, increasing 10% sequentially as we benefited from the repurchase of our DevCo joint ventures and higher volumes across most of our assets, offset by the sale of our equity interest in Gulf Coast Express pipeline and lower marketing margin.  Targa generated adjusted free cash flow of $373 million in the first quarter. We are significantly hedged for 2022 and continue to add hedges for 2023 and beyond, while still benefiting from higher prices across our unhedged equity volume exposure and prices above fee floors.  Looking ahead, as a reminder, the integration of the recently acquired bolt-on midstream assets and associated contracts to our South Texas G&P operations will be reflected in consolidated G&P segment earnings for the second quarter.  Our consolidated leverage ratio was 3.4x at the end of the first quarter, and we had about $2 billion of available liquidity. In April, we successfully completed our inaugural TRGP notes offering in the investment-grade market, issuing $750 million of 4.2% senior notes due 2033 and $750 million of 4.95% senior notes due 2052. We really appreciate the support of our new and existing fixed income investors in our initial IG offering and are pleased to have been able to access the 30-year market for the first time.  Earlier this week, we completed the redemption of all of our outstanding Series A preferred stock for approximately $973 million. The redemption of the preferred completes an important strategic goal to simplify our capital structure, and we were able to do so sooner than previous expectations as a result of our strong company performance.  With respect to the sale of our interest in GCX, the call right process has concluded, and we expect to receive final payment on or around May 20.  As Matt mentioned, our pro forma leverage ratio is 3.3x and trending lower, which puts us in excellent financial position with a lot of flexibility.  We continue to expect to spend $700 million to $800 million on attractive organic growth capital opportunities in 2022, with approximately $121 million spent through the first quarter to support continued volume growth across our systems.  We are paying an attractive $1.40 annualized dividend per common share for 2022, and have been able to return additional capital to our common shareholders through opportunistic repurchases, with $50 million of shares repurchased in the first quarter.  Our continued investment in growing Targa's underlying businesses, supported by an attractive macro backdrop and the strength of our balance sheet means we are in excellent position looking forward to continue to return an increasing amount of capital to our shareholders.  Lastly, I'd like to echo Matt and thank our employees for their dedication and for continuing to prioritize safety. And with that, I will turn the call back over to Sanjay.\nSanjay Lad: Thanks, Jen. [Operator Instructions]. RJ, would you please open the line for Q&A?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Theresa Chen with Barclays.\nTheresa Chen: First, I would just like to ask about your capital allocation priorities from here, given that you've streamlined your structure and fundamentals seem to be trending well. Can you talk about common share repurchases, increasing the dividend and so on?\nJennifer Kneale: Theresa, this is Jen. I think from our perspective, you'll see us kind of execute going forward, sort of as we are today, increase the common share dividend 2022 versus 2021, and that's the dividend that we'll have for this year, and then we'll revisit next February. You're seeing us continue to invest in our business. And also, you're seeing us to execute on opportunistic share repurchases.  So I think that's going to be the formula for us going forward. And then, it's just going to be a matter of the opportunities in front of us to figure out where we think our capital is best spent.\nTheresa Chen: Got it. And there's been so much momentum in your story in the macro tailwinds. I think all of that is pretty clear. In your mind, what do you think the key risks are from here?\nMatthew Meloy: Theresa, I think we feel really good about our business. We've made a lot of improvements to the balance sheet over the years, we've simplified our structure. So the risks that are out there inherent in our business are commodity prices and volumes. But even from both of those, I feel like we're better insulated and better protected to the downside today than we were a year or 2 ago. So I think it's the same risks that we look at.  We've made a lot of progress on recontracting and putting in fee floors in our G&P business. We also have a significant amount of hedges, which reduces our commodity price exposure. And just as we continue to grow across our footprints, we have really strong diverse customers across our G&P in multiple basins and have good diverse customer set out in the Permian.  So the risk kind of remain in our business, but I think we've done a good job at trying to protect ourselves from the downside.\nJennifer Kneale: I think the starting point, if any risks do present themselves, is just so different for us today than it ever has been before. We've just never been stronger, Theresa. So I think we'll be able to withstand and perform exceptionally well even if those risks do present themselves going forward.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan.\nJeremy Tonet: Just wanted to start off with the guidance here, if I could, the EBITDA guidance, I recognize it's early in the year. But just doing some simple math here. It seems like if you annualize first quarter, you'd be at the top end of the guide. In first quarter, didn't seem to benefit from commodity prices, I think, as you said there. And then also, January had a freeze-off weather impact weighing on the quarter. And it doesn't seem like the guide includes the Southcross benefit. And if I overlay spot commodity prices, it's something like a $250 million add to it.  So just reconcile these different things. I know the commodity price isn't baked into the guide where it is right now, but Southcross annualizing first quarter all points to above the high end. Is there any offsets over the balance of the year that we should be thinking about?\nJennifer Kneale: The only offset that I'd just start with, and then I'll turn it over to Matt, is just the sale of GCX was not part of our guidance. Oh, it was. I'm sorry, it was contemplated in our guidance. So yes, I think that you've got the pieces directionally correct. Current spot prices, just given the backwardation that still exists as we look out for the balance of 2022 is part of the unknown for us right now, but we are very well hedged and are continuing to add hedges. So I think we are in just an excellent position.  Matt, anything else?\nMatthew Meloy: Yes. Yes, Jeremy, I think you laid it out pretty well. I feel like Q1 was a really good quarter for us. We had increasing volumes in the Permian. But if you look in the Permian Midland, it was up a little bit, almost flat Q1 to Q4. We had some winter weather and operational issues in January and February, but we've seen volumes rebound nicely in March and April. So it sets us up for good volume growth from now through year-end.  And if you look at prices, NGLs were up a little bit, but gas was actually quarter-to-quarter for us, realized, down. And as you know, Waha prices now are much, much higher than our average in Q1. So between gas and NGL, if prices hang around here, we're going to have a lot of uplift as we go throughout the year.  We also had lower volumes due to some weather impacts up in the Badlands and across our central regions, too. So with a little bit warmer weather, higher prices, I think it sets up really nicely for the balance of the year.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. So I didn't hear anything to walk me away from kind of $2.7 billion, $2.8 billion or more if commodity prices...\nMatthew Meloy: We have not been that specific. We just said, I think we're in good shape as we kind of move throughout the rest of this year if prices hang around here -- even if prices don't hang around here, I think we're in really good shape.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. Yes, it looks like that way to us as well. And maybe just pivoting more towards Permian logistics here. The numbers we run on the basin seems like processing capacity is pretty tight. Egress for natural gas, pretty tight as well. There's a number of solutions, I guess, out there on the egress side. Just wondering, your appetite to participate in nat gas takeaway kind of to match, I guess, yours -- your equity and your customers' nat gas production needs. And then, on the G&P side, you have several plants in the hopper, but just wondering, I guess, overall growth expectations moving forward in the Permian on those 2 fronts?\nMatthew Meloy: Sure. We've seen pretty good growth here in the Permian, just in the aggregate and on our system over the last 12 months, and we think there's going to be continued growth as we look forward. I'm going to turn it over to Bobby, who can talk a little bit just about how we're thinking about residue takeaway opportunities.\nRobert Muraro: This is Bobby. So on the residue side, we were excited to see the most recent announcements on the expansions. At the end of the day, we look like a producer relative to our exposure. So what we want to know is that the gas flows and then ultimately, we will obviously want basis as flat possible. So we've known about it for a long time, we've known about the expectations of where our expectations of where supply was going. So we're fully prepped for it on the target side even before any of the new pipes come online. But yes, we expect and hope for more pipes to get announced. And whether we participate in it or not really, you'll see us end them at times when they need us to go. And if they don't need us to go, we won't be in them, right? So I think as we think through those things, we just want to see the pipes get built, and the takeaway, egress get there in time for us to not see big basis blowouts.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. That's very helpful. I'll leave it there.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Colton Bean with Tudor, Pickering, Holt.\nColton Bean: So you all mentioned the weather impacts on the Badlands in Q1. And I think we've seen kind of a continuation of that severe weather here quarter-to-date. So can you just update us what you've seen as we move through April? And then are there any longer-term infrastructure damage and considerations that you have as you think about the balance of the year?\nMatthew Meloy: Yes, sure. I'm going to turn it over to Pat to answer that one.\nPatrick McDonie: Yes, you're right. I mean, obviously, there's been a couple of pretty significant weather events in April in the Badlands. And about the time you get back up from the first one, you know the second one follows up behind. And they were pretty severe. They took production across the Badlands almost to nothing across everybody's systems.  Certainly, we're in the rebound mode, we're coming back up, we are not fully up. So will it impact our second quarter? Sure. April, it was impacted. We're still not fully up in May, but we're getting closer, hopefully, mid, late May, we'll appreciably be fully back up to where we were before the weather impact. But on our side, at least, we do have some things that are positive throughout the remainder of the year that will help offset some of the occurrences relative to the weather here in April.\nColton Bean: Got it. And maybe just to clarify that. On the offsets, is that thinking for DMP in aggregate or Badlands specific?\nPatrick McDonie: Badlands-specific.\nColton Bean: Okay. Great. And then, Jen, last quarter, I think you mentioned that M&A was a consideration for the first time in a while. Can you just update us on what you all are seeing in the market and if that may still be a use of cash going forward?\nJennifer Kneale: I think for us, you saw us execute on the Southcross acquisition, a great acquisition for us. We're excited to have those employees join the Targa team. Integration is going well, and that's an example of a transaction where we think we're able to buy at really attractive prices and then benefit from synergies, both near term and over the medium and longer term.  There are more assets and companies available in the market today than there certainly have been over the last couple of years, which is understandable given the strength of commodity prices. And so for us, the bar continues to be very, very high. And that means that there are a number of unique characteristics that any transaction would have to meet in order for us to even consider looking at it. So I think you'll see us continue to be very selective about anything that we spend our time on.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Reynolds with UBS.\nBrian Reynolds: Maybe, to start off a little bit on future growth projects. No CapEx change with the earnings release, but kind of looking ahead towards 2023, we started hearing from many of your peers of adding additional frac capacity. I'm just kind of curious around Targa's thought process around pursuing a new build versus securing 100% of the economics versus potentially unidling the JV frac that's in Mont Belvieu currently?\nScott Pryor: Brian, this is Scott Pryor. Just to touch base, we do feel like the fractionation market is starting to tighten up. The number of inquiries that have come into us, both for short-term as well as long-term frac needs has increased. And some of those are actually folks that I think are trying to get a little bit ahead of the tightening of the market by trying to secure a fractionation that may start more dated into the future.  We've got a permit in hand for Train 9. We continuously are evaluating when we need to formally start that -- the construction of that. And we will stay well ahead of that relative to what our needs are. Recognize that we've got good transparency back to our producers behind our gas processing plant. And as a result of that, the timing of that, we will be well ahead of that.  So Again, I feel like the market is starting to tighten up, the number of inquiries coming in and the view that we have back to our producers, we feel like it -- there will be a time here in the near future that we'll look at starting Train 9 and the construction of that.\nBrian Reynolds: Great. Appreciate that color. And then maybe, just as a quick follow-up on guidance and specifically, the Permian inlet volumes. So far this year, we've seen a major customer in the Delaware increase their production guidance expectations for the year. And the Midland seems to be a little bit flattish for the last 2 quarters. And ultimately, wondering if this is related to, one, is there any change to any change in cadence to that Permian outlook? Or maybe, said differently, does the guidance effectively imply just a really strong back half of the year as it relates to just volumes flowing through your system downstream?\nMatthew Meloy: Yes. I think we continue to see really strong activity across our overall Permian footprint. Part of what you've seen in the Permian Midland, as we've seen in previous years, we tend to get more of our growth in that system over the summer when it warms up, spring/summer time frame. So it has some seasonality in it. And again, we had January and February, which was kind of impacted more by cold weather and some operational issues, and we are seeing some of that increase already in March and April.  So we continue to expect growth across both Permian Midland and Delaware. But we also have seen some of our larger producers stick with their -- kind of stick with their previous guidance and what they're telling us in terms of volume growth. So just because you're getting higher prices doesn't necessarily mean they're going to ramp up production.  But it is a mixed bag there. We have seen some of our larger customers point to increasing the growth rate. So I think that may have some impact on 2022, but perhaps that's more 2023 and as we go forward. We are still seeing good activity across our smaller private E&P customers who are continuing to drill. So no, I think we are pretty optimistic about our Permian growth from here going forward.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Keith Stanley with Wolfe Research.\nKeith Stanley: First question, just with Gulf Coast Express, the sale proceeds coming in. Should we assume you use that to repay any short-term borrowings you might have done to take out the prefs? Or should we think of GCX cash as available for allocation with free cash flow over the rest of the year?\nJennifer Kneale: The expectation would be that when we receive those proceeds, we'll use it to reduce borrowings under our revolver right now, Keith.\nKeith Stanley: Okay. Got it. And second question, can you just give an update on where you're at for 2023 hedging, particularly for Permian gas basis, just percent of equity volumes or however you want to frame it?\nMatthew Meloy: Yes, sure. So we're significantly hedged on the gas side. And when we do hedge, most of our volumes are Permian related, so we do hedge Waha basis. So we try and cover as best we can kind of the basis risk associated with our hedges. And where we have gas in Oklahoma, we'll hedge at those physical points as well.  We were significantly hedged kind of earlier in the year, and we've added as we've seen strength in gas prices and NGLs. We've continued to layer on additional hedges not only for this year but for the next several years. So I'd say with prices hanging around here, we'll continue with our programmatic approach to continue to add more hedges.\nJennifer Kneale: And Keith, our 10-Q will be published later today so you'll be able to see in there the volumes that are now hedged across both gas, NGLs and condensate.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Spiro Dounis with Credit Suisse.\nSpiro Dounis: Just wanted to talk about the quarter-over-quarter variance on Slide 7. Two things that stuck out to me there. Just on OpEx, it looks like -- I guess I was a little surprised to see costs actually come down for G&P, for labor and chemicals, just given the inflationary environment that we're in. So just curious, is that sustainable? Is that part of a broader cost control initiative?  And the other item there was just on the G&P margin. Matt, I know you mentioned the commodity really to pick up until the end of the quarter, was just was surprised that, that was a negative contributing factor. So curious if there was a mix shift in the quarter, any hedging impact there to be aware of?\nJennifer Kneale: Spiro, this is Jen. I'll take the first part of the question. So some of what we did in our G&P business was in the fourth quarter. We actually went ahead and bought fairly significant amount of chemicals ahead of time. So our chemical costs for the first quarter went down as a result of that. I'd expect our Q2 through, really, Q4 OpEx to step up as we move through time here, as we are seeing higher costs as a result of inflation and just difficulty getting certain things.  So Q1, I think a little bit of an anomaly. And then also, on the compensation side, we had a higher bonus that we ended up paying for the fourth quarter. And so that was reflected in the fourth quarter, and then we tend to accrue at a lower number as we begin a new year, and so that's what we're doing in the first quarter. So that's part of what you're seeing as well that I think is, again, creating a little bit of an anomaly in Q1 relative to Q4.\nMatthew Meloy: Yes. And then, on the mix shift. When you look at first quarter versus fourth quarter, really, the big increase in commodity price was relative to crude oil prices. We don't have that much exposure directly to crude oil prices. We have some, but not that much. It's really on the gas side and the NGL side and gas was down and NGLs were up almost offsetting. So a lot of the run that we saw was in March, so we had some benefit kind of late in the quarter, but it's really kind of through April and then into kind of where we are now.  So not a mix shift. It's just kind of the way all 3 of those different commodity prices move relative to Q4.\nSpiro Dounis: Got it. Okay. That's really helpful. Second one, just going back to some comments from last quarter around energy transition. I think you all had mentioned evaluating a few renewable or carbon capture opportunities. Just curious if there's been any update on that front?\nMatthew Meloy: I'd say we are continuing to work on a potential carbon capture solution. So I'd say that is ongoing. It's going to take a while for us to develop that. I think we're in a good position to develop that. And so we are working with others trying to put something together there to see if we can capture CO2 out in the Permian and move it down hole, there are discussions at other parts in and around our business as well. I think it's just going to continue to make progress, but I think it's going to be a while before we can move anything over the finish line, too.\nSpiro Dounis: Got it. Great. We'll stay tuned.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Blum with Wells Fargo.\nMichael Blum: I wanted to ask about LPG export markets. I know you're more heavily weighted to South America, but wondering if you're seeing any drop in demand in China given the COVID-related lockdowns there. And then I guess, just more broadly, any impact to volumes from some of the global supply constraints and some of the shipping bottlenecks we've been reading about?\nScott Pryor: Michael, this is Scott. First off, I would say that when we initially started our export business, we were -- yes, we were heavily weighted towards South America. Since then, much like the rest of the players in the marketplace, we have diversified more heavily, if you will, to the Far East and that growing demand that is there. Places like China for PDH plants, for chemical plants and even for domestic... I would say, when you look at our performance on a quarter-by-quarter basis, we continue to be very consistent. At times, there are some weather issues that may impact it. There might be some logistical challenges as it relates to the shipping market from time to time. And we have seen some of that and did see some of that in the first quarter of this year.  But all in all, the market is still very solid. Over time, it will continue to grow. We feel very good about the expansion that we're doing. It's very -- it's small, but yet very complementary to our business, which will allow us for some incremental capacity, and provides additional reliability to our customers that are historical lifters.  So again, we've got a good portfolio of customers. They're strong, they stick with us, they appreciate the reliability that we provide, and I think as we continue to see LPG's production increase here in the U.S., we will look for incremental ways to continue to debottleneck where it makes sense and push those across the water.\nMichael Blum: Great. I appreciate it. Other question I wanted to ask was just about ethane rejection and what you're seeing across your system right now, and then, how you see that trending for the balance of the year? And is there any upside to volumes related to that?\nMatthew Meloy: Yes, Michael, we are in recovery across our systems, and we have been for some time. So I don't really see a big change for us there. Our exposure to ethane is really more on the price side than the volume side. So as ethane moves up, we have some hedge, but we do have some length on that. So we benefit from higher prices on ethane, but I wouldn't expect to see with ethane prices moving up, much of a volume impact, really.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Sunil Sibal with Seaport Global Securities.\nSunil Sibal: Thanks for all the clarity on the call. I just had one follow-up from previous discussion on OpEx. So it seems like OpEx, over the last couple of quarters, has kind of swung around a bit. I was wondering, is there a good way to think about your OpEx in fixed versus variable buckets, especially when you think about exposure to commodity chemicals and all that?\nJennifer Kneale: I don't think that there's an easy framework that I can give you, Sunil, related to that. I think that as we think about OpEx Q2 going forward, it's likely to begin to look more like the fourth quarter than the first quarter. So that's probably the best visibility that I can give you right now. But we're also seeing prices increase real time. So it's a little bit tough to predict as well.  I think our operations teams and engineering teams are doing an excellent job of trying to stay in front of inflation and rising costs as much as they possibly can and are doing an excellent job working with our suppliers, but it's just a little bit difficult to predict right now. But I think the best visibility I can give you is that second quarter and go forward will look more like the fourth quarter than the first quarter.\nSunil Sibal: Okay. Got it. And then on the NGL marketing side, I think you mentioned in the press release also that there was less optimization opportunities. Obviously, some of that is seasonal, too. But I was curious, is there a good way to think about that part of your business? And what are the drivers of this optimization revenues for you?\nMatthew Meloy: Yes, sure. I'd say it's really probably more in the comparison. If you look at last quarter, we had some contango trades that were still unwinding when we had contango that we put on some dated trade. So there's really just less of that in the first quarter relative to previous periods. So I think that is the primary driver of that.\nSunil Sibal: So then going forward, I guess, Q2, Q3 are normally seasonally weak -- seasonally weaker than you would expect that to kind of pick up, obviously, overlaying some contango opportunities which may show up?\nMatthew Meloy: Well, the seasonality part of it, we do have some -- we get some benefit in both Q4 and Q1 from our seasonal wholesale propane business. And so that will come off in Q2 and Q3. Yes, as far as the contango or backwardation or those kind of opportunities that present our marketing team, that really just depends on market conditions. So I'd say, in Q1, there was just relatively less of those compared to prior periods, and it will -- we'll see what Q2 and the go-forward quarters present us.\nScott Pryor: And Matt, just to add -- this is Scott real quick. On the wholesale side of our business, we did see a strong fourth quarter in certain areas of our business, especially those areas where we have nice pockets of field inventory. So more of those volumes moved out during the fourth quarter than they did in the first quarter. So as a result of that, we had some uplift, probably earlier in the winter season than we did in the latter part of the winter season, just where our position is on inventories.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Harry Mateer with Barclays.\nHarry Mateer: First question, it seems like you guys made it up to investment grade just some time for the rates market to get turnarounds ahead a bit, but I'm curious whether you see more opportunities to optimize the capital structure and your interest expense in the second half now you've done your inaugural IG deal?\nJennifer Kneale: Harry, this is Jen. I think we'll have continued opportunities just moving forward. We do have some higher coupon notes. So depending on the callability and call prices of those notes, we'll be continuing to try to figure out how to best manage our liquidity and our notes positions going forward. I do think there is continued opportunities to benefit from savings, but the cadence of that is largely going to be dependent on the prices that we can call in those notes and then where can we issue notes in the market going forward. So we'll just have to see how that plays out. But I think we're in an excellent position anyway.\nHarry Mateer: Okay. And then, earlier on the call, you answered that the call on the GCX proceeds is going to be towards paying down the revolver. Just would love to get a sense for how you structurally like to plan out liquidity, whether it's a cash balance you'd like to have? Or what are some guardrails we can think about it on a quarter-to-quarter basis that you'd like to keep in terms of available liquidity?\nJennifer Kneale: I think a lot of the cash that you see on our balance sheet quarter-to-quarter really has more to do with the JVs and the terms of the JVs and when cash is distributed out of those joint ventures than anything else.  So we're generally trying to manage our liquidity position as optimally as we can. And so that means utilizing the available tools that we have, whether that be our revolver or accounts receivable facility or just maintaining cash on the balance sheet.  So there isn't a hard and fast rule that we're following that I can give you. It's really just us trying to manage as best as possible to minimize interest expense and maximize the liquidity that we have at all times.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of John Mackay with Goldman Sachs.\nJohn Mackay: I wanted to go back to some of the questions -- some of the comments on capital returns. Have you seen some of your peers that saw distribution or dividend cuts in the past kind of aiming to get back to where they used to be and they've kind of started that process now. Just curious if that's on the table for you guys or maybe just a little more detail on how you're thinking about that and whether or not it could be a payout that's more in line with the S&P 500 type framework?\nMatthew Meloy: Yes. Sure, John. Yes, good question. I think as we really review our dividend payout, as Jen mentioned, we'll plan to provide an update for you early part of next year. It's not our goal to get back to where we used to be. I think we're looking at market indicators. We are looking at S&P 400, S&P 500 in terms of -- we'll look at yield. I know that moves around with the share price. So we'll look at percent return based on free cash flow and other cash flow metrics as well.  So I think we're going to be in a really good position to continue to move our dividend higher given all the free cash flow that we have. So we'll just evaluate it. I'd say similar to the way we evaluated it last year. We'll look and say where do we want to be? Well, we will look at our peers and see what they are paying out, but we'll also look at, I'd say, a broader peer group of the S&P 400, S&P 500. And I think both of those will inform our decision as we think about what we want to do for '23, but then also, as we think about kind of a multiyear, how do we want to be kind of layering in to increase payout over time.\nJohn Mackay: That's great. Appreciate that, Matt. Definitely in the buyback camp over here, for what it's worth. Maybe just one more from my side. Some of the weather issues kind of masked some of the basin trends. So just wondering if you could give us an update on kind of what you're seeing in terms of green shoots or not in some of your other basins kind of outside of the Permian?\nMatthew Meloy: Sure. Pat, do you want to give a bit of an update there?\nPatrick McDonie: Sure. We have seen increased activity level across all our basins. We've seen not a huge uptick, but a pretty steady, nice uptick in our Oklahoma regions, more so on the southeast side of the state versus Western Oklahoma. Certainly, we've seen people that haven't drilled in 2, 3 years employing rigs and drilling wells. We've seen a lot of recompletions. So I'd say, we're stemming the tide there relative to past steady declines over the last 3, 4 years. We're seeing enough activity to offset decline and, frankly, in some areas to actually grow.  In the Barnett, we're seeing activity that we haven't seen in the past. And frankly, that's a little more lumpy. So you'll see that showing up in our volumes as we go throughout the year, but we have some positive tailwinds there.  South Texas is such a competitive environment, it kind of gets lost in the sauce. But certainly, with our new acquisition, there's different opportunities relative to sour gas capture, et cetera. So we see opportunity in our South Texas region.  And the Badlands is steady, is the best way to put it. The activity level is steady. Certainly, we've had weather events, but we haven't seen a huge uptick, but we've seen good, steady activity levels.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Neel Mitra with Bank of America.\nIndraneel Mitra: I wanted to follow up on the ethane recovery, specifically how it relates to Grand Prix. In 2023, the basin should probably move to full ethane recovery. And I'm wondering how your third-party shippers will fare on this, whether your incentive rates will go up or your volumes, how do you see the outlook for Grand Prix with ethane recovery for the basin just trending up?\nScott Pryor: Neel, this is Scott. As Matt said earlier, when we look at our pipeline as we're getting into our fractionation facility in Mont Belvieu, both of the plants that are operating on our systems -- we do have a few third-party plants that will evaluate ethane recovery based upon their situation where, they're located and whatever their contracts are around their system. But all in all, for the most part, we don't see a lot of swing on both our pipeline as well as the third-party pipelines that are coming into our system.  So I would say that it's not a big needle mover. Matt kind of indicated that earlier. But I think that when you look at where the pricing is today, most plants should be in recovery, and that's what we're seeing on our system. And given the price advantage that we see on the petrochemical side, I think that, that will continue for a while. But there's going to be some noise from time to time that all in all, for the most part in our system, we assume that we're going to have some recovery [indiscernible] fractionation footprint.\nIndraneel Mitra: Okay. And then second question, I know you market a lot of your producer volumes, residue gas volumes at the tailgate and you've been planning for a while for the gas egress issue. But can you kind of just walk me through how you plan for that when you have such massive growth on your systems, 10-plus percent every year. How far in advance you do that? And whether you see any potential issues running into 2023, even though you've started to plan for it early?\nRobert Muraro: This is Bobby. What I'd tell you is it's important to both have your own transport out of the basin, but then, a vast majority of what we do is we team up with, I'll call it, partners in the basin that have their own transport out of the basin. So as you think about us being Waha-exposed and we look to go sell gas at Waha, we will sell it to people that we know -- for lots of different reasons -- have that physical transport to get it out of the basin. They're very large counterparties that everyone on this call would know. And that's how we focus it.  Then when you think about how long to go forward, we obviously we look at when we think pipes will be coming online, when we expect our -- there to be capacity issues out of the basin, and we make sure we're crossing across that. And we don't try to get cute within months. We make sure we're well beyond when those expansions and pipes will come online.  So we've been doing that, we're still doing that, we've got everything that we think we need covered. And we even take out some insurance beyond that over time. So yes, so it's one where we're able to plan as far out as we want because people want to buy the gas for as long as we're willing to sell it. And then, we try to do it and match it up with when we think the -- there could be issues.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Robert Mosca with Mizuho Securities.\nRobert Mosca: Just one question for me. Grand Prix volumes have grown pretty strongly over the last few quarters. Just hoping to get your latest thoughts on how that pipeline could be expanded in the medium term? And how early you think an expansion on the Permian segment would be required, just assuming that the potential residue constraint gets addressed?\nScott Pryor: Robert, this is Scott. Yes, we have been very pleased with the continuation of increased volumes on our transportation side of our business, quarter in and quarter out. First quarter averaging 460,000 barrels a day into out Mont Belvieu complex. So -- and again, we had good transparency back to our customers and our producers behind our plant and the additive of gas processing plants in the Permian.  So we will continue to add pumps along the pipeline sector. We've got good operating leverage today. And remember, when we throw out those stats around 460,000 barrels, again, to the first quarter, that -- part of that contribution is coming from North Texas and into Oklahoma from our applications in that area.  So we will evaluate the need for additional pipe and pipe expansions. We will be well ahead of that relative to what our needs are and the producers behind our system. So it's something that we're going to be well ahead of when it's necessary.\nOperator: And there are no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back to Sanjay.\nSanjay Lad: Thanks to everyone that was on the call this morning, and we appreciate your interest in Targa Resources. The Investor Relations team will be available for any follow-up questions you may have. Thanks, and have a great day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. We thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Patrick McDonie",
            "content": "Yes, you're right. I mean, obviously, there's been a couple of pretty significant weather events in April in the Badlands. And about the time you get back up from the first one, you know the second one follows up behind. And they were pretty severe. They took production across the Badlands almost to nothing across everybody's systems.  Certainly, we're in the rebound mode, we're coming back up, we are not fully up. So will it impact our second quarter? Sure. April, it was impacted. We're still not fully up in May, but we're getting closer, hopefully, mid, late May, we'll appreciably be fully back up to where we were before the weather impact. But on our side, at least, we do have some things that are positive throughout the remainder of the year that will help offset some of the occurrences relative to the weather here in April. Badlands-specific. Sure. We have seen increased activity level across all our basins. We've seen not a huge uptick, but a pretty steady, nice uptick in our Oklahoma regions, more so on the southeast side of the state versus Western Oklahoma. Certainly, we've seen people that haven't drilled in 2, 3 years employing rigs and drilling wells. We've seen a lot of recompletions.

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Matthew Meloy",
            "content": "Thanks, Sanjay, and good morning. We are continuing to perform well and are off to a good start to the year on a number of fronts. Record high quarterly EBITDA of $626 million, record volumes in the Permian and record NGL transportation and fractionation volumes.  We also achieved investment-grade ratings from all 3 agencies during the quarter. We completed our corporate simplification, with the DevCo repurchase in January and with the redemption of our preferred stock earlier this week.  We continue to invest across our businesses with ongoing construction of the Legacy I, Legacy II and Midway plants in the Permian, plus the acquisition of bolt-on assets in South Texas.  We repurchased additional common shares as part of our increasing return of capital to investors. And our reported leverage ratio at 3.4x is in the bottom half of our long-term target range of 3x to 4x.  Pro forma for the repurchase of our DevCo interest, our preferred stock redemption, our South Texas acquisition and our GCX sale, our leverage is 3.3x.  While we had a strong first quarter with EBITDA up $55 million versus Q4, commodity prices really began to move higher late in the quarter. So we did not see a lot of first quarter price benefit, as our realized prices were relatively flat compared to the fourth quarter. But since then, prices are providing some nice tailwinds for the balance of the year. Given the strong underlying fundamentals of Targa's businesses, we continue to expect that if prices average around current levels for 2022, we would exceed the top end of our previously disclosed full year financial guidance range.  Let's now turn the call -- or let's now discuss operational in more detail. Starting in the Permian, our systems across the Midland and Delaware Basins continued to perform well, averaging over 3 billion cubic feet per day inlet volume during the first quarter. Volumes across our Permian systems increased quarter-over-quarter despite being impacted by winter weather conditions, particularly in January and February. Volumes quickly rebounded, with March and April volumes up nicely over the first quarter average. We continued to see strong activity levels across both our Midland and Delaware footprint, and expect to benefit from this positive momentum as we move through 2022.  In Permian Midland, our systems continued to run near full and our engineering and operations teams are working diligently to bring our next 275 million cubic feet per day Legacy plant online safely later this year. Our Legacy II plant, another new 275 million cubic feet per day plant in Permian Midland, is expected to begin operations during the second quarter of 2023.  In Permian Delaware, volumes across our system are also continuing to ramp. Our new 275 million cubic feet per day Midway plant is expected to begin operations during the third quarter of 2023. Midway will provide us with additional flexibility to flow volumes between our Midland and Delaware systems in addition to improving our overall operational performance in the region.  For full year 2022, we continue to expect our average Permian inlet volumes to increase by 12% to 15% over 2021 volumes.  In our Central and Badlands regions, first quarter volumes were impacted by winter weather conditions, most notably in the Badlands. We are seeing stronger activity levels across several regions given the higher commodity price environment.  In April, we completed the acquisition of assets in South Texas and are quickly integrating the assets and related contracts acquired in our South Texas gathering and processing operations and expect the acquisition to be immediately accretive. We would like to thank everyone involved in helping make the integration go smoothly.  Shifting to our Logistics and Transportation segment. NGL transportation volumes continued to increase, and we transported a record 460,000 barrels per day to Mont Belvieu during the first quarter. Throughput volumes sequentially increased 6%, driven by increasing NGL production from Targa's Permian plants and third parties. Fractionation volumes at our Mont Belvieu complex during the first quarter rebounded at 703,000 per day following fourth quarter's unplanned outage. Looking ahead, we expect NGL transportation and fractionation volumes to continue to benefit from increasing supply from our growing Permian G&P position.  In our LPG export services business at Galena Park, we loaded an average of 10.2 million barrels per month during the first quarter. The outlook for our LPG export business remains strong. We are advancing our previously announced low-cost expansion project to increase our propane loading capabilities, which will add an incremental 1 million barrels per month of capacity by mid-2023.  The longer-term outlook for Targa remains strong. Our premier integrated Permian NGL business, complemented by our talented employees and strong balance sheet, position Targa to deliver safe, reliable energy domestically and globally.  And before I turn the call over to Jen, I would like to thank our employees for their continued focus on safety, while executing on our strategic priorities and continuing to provide best-in-class services to our customers.  With that, I will turn the call over to Jen. Theresa, I think we feel really good about our business. We've made a lot of improvements to the balance sheet over the years, we've simplified our structure. So the risks that are out there inherent in our business are commodity prices and volumes. But even from both of those, I feel like we're better insulated and better protected to the downside today than we were a year or 2 ago. So I think it's the same risks that we look at.  We've made a lot of progress on recontracting and putting in fee floors in our G&P business. We also have a significant amount of hedges, which reduces our commodity price exposure. And just as we continue to grow across our footprints, we have really strong diverse customers across our G&P in multiple basins and have good diverse customer set out in the Permian.  So the risk kind of remain in our business, but I think we've done a good job at trying to protect ourselves from the downside. Yes. Yes, Jeremy, I think you laid it out pretty well. I feel like Q1 was a really good quarter for us. We had increasing volumes in the Permian. But if you look in the Permian Midland, it was up a little bit, almost flat Q1 to Q4. We had some winter weather and operational issues in January and February, but we've seen volumes rebound nicely in March and April. So it sets us up for good volume growth from now through year-end.  And if you look at prices, NGLs were up a little bit, but gas was actually quarter-to-quarter for us, realized, down. And as you know, Waha prices now are much, much higher than our average in Q1. So between gas and NGL, if prices hang around here, we're going to have a lot of uplift as we go throughout the year.  We also had lower volumes due to some weather impacts up in the Badlands and across our central regions, too. So with a little bit warmer weather, higher prices, I think it sets up really nicely for the balance of the year. We have not been that specific. We just said, I think we're in good shape as we kind of move throughout the rest of this year if prices hang around here -- even if prices don't hang around here, I think we're in really good shape. Sure. We've seen pretty good growth here in the Permian, just in the aggregate and on our system over the last 12 months, and we think there's going to be continued growth as we look forward. I'm going to turn it over to Bobby, who can talk a little bit just about how we're thinking about residue takeaway opportunities. Yes, sure. I'm going to turn it over to Pat to answer that one. Yes. I think we continue to see really strong activity across our overall Permian footprint. Part of what you've seen in the Permian Midland, as we've seen in previous years, we tend to get more of our growth in that system over the summer when it warms up, spring/summer time frame. So it has some seasonality in it. And again, we had January and February, which was kind of impacted more by cold weather and some operational issues, and we are seeing some of that increase already in March and April.  So we continue to expect growth across both Permian Midland and Delaware. But we also have seen some of our larger producers stick with their -- kind of stick with their previous guidance and what they're telling us in terms of volume growth. So just because you're getting higher prices doesn't necessarily mean they're going to ramp up production.  But it is a mixed bag there. We have seen some of our larger customers point to increasing the growth rate. So I think that may have some impact on 2022, but perhaps that's more 2023 and as we go forward. We are still seeing good activity across our smaller private E&P customers who are continuing to drill. So no, I think we are pretty optimistic about our Permian growth from here going forward. Yes, sure. So we're significantly hedged on the gas side. And when we do hedge, most of our volumes are Permian related, so we do hedge Waha basis. So we try and cover as best we can kind of the basis risk associated with our hedges. And where we have gas in Oklahoma, we'll hedge at those physical points as well.  We were significantly hedged kind of earlier in the year, and we've added as we've seen strength in gas prices and NGLs. We've continued to layer on additional hedges not only for this year but for the next several years. So I'd say with prices hanging around here, we'll continue with our programmatic approach to continue to add more hedges. Yes. And then, on the mix shift. When you look at first quarter versus fourth quarter, really, the big increase in commodity price was relative to crude oil prices. We don't have that much exposure directly to crude oil prices. We have some, but not that much. It's really on the gas side and the NGL side and gas was down and NGLs were up almost offsetting. So a lot of the run that we saw was in March, so we had some benefit kind of late in the quarter, but it's really kind of through April and then into kind of where we are now.  So not a mix shift. It's just kind of the way all 3 of those different commodity prices move relative to Q4. I'd say we are continuing to work on a potential carbon capture solution. So I'd say that is ongoing. It's going to take a while for us to develop that. I think we're in a good position to develop that. And so we are working with others trying to put something together there to see if we can capture CO2 out in the Permian and move it down hole, there are discussions at other parts in and around our business as well. I think it's just going to continue to make progress, but I think it's going to be a while before we can move anything over the finish line, too. Yes, Michael, we are in recovery across our systems, and we have been for some time. So I don't really see a big change for us there. Our exposure to ethane is really more on the price side than the volume side. So as ethane moves up, we have some hedge, but we do have some length on that. So we benefit from higher prices on ethane, but I wouldn't expect to see with ethane prices moving up, much of a volume impact, really. Yes, sure. I'd say it's really probably more in the comparison. If you look at last quarter, we had some contango trades that were still unwinding when we had contango that we put on some dated trade. So there's really just less of that in the first quarter relative to previous periods. So I think that is the primary driver of that. Well, the seasonality part of it, we do have some -- we get some benefit in both Q4 and Q1 from our seasonal wholesale propane business. And so that will come off in Q2 and Q3. Yes, as far as the contango or backwardation or those kind of opportunities that present our marketing team, that really just depends on market conditions. So I'd say, in Q1, there was just relatively less of those compared to prior periods, and it will -- we'll see what Q2 and the go-forward quarters present us. Yes. Sure, John. Yes, good question. I think as we really review our dividend payout, as Jen mentioned, we'll plan to provide an update for you early part of next year. It's not our goal to get back to where we used to be. I think we're looking at market indicators. We are looking at S&P 400, S&P 500 in terms of -- we'll look at yield. I know that moves around with the share price. So we'll look at percent return based on free cash flow and other cash flow metrics as well.  So I think we're going to be in a really good position to continue to move our dividend higher given all the free cash flow that we have. So we'll just evaluate it. I'd say similar to the way we evaluated it last year. We'll look and say where do we want to be? Well, we will look at our peers and see what they are paying out, but we'll also look at, I'd say, a broader peer group of the S&P 400, S&P 500. And I think both of those will inform our decision as we think about what we want to do for '23, but then also, as we think about kind of a multiyear, how do we want to be kind of layering in to increase payout over time. Sure. Pat, do you want to give a bit of an update there?"

            "name": "Jennifer Kneale",
            "content": "Thanks, Matt. Targa's reported quarterly adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter was $626 million, increasing 10% sequentially as we benefited from the repurchase of our DevCo joint ventures and higher volumes across most of our assets, offset by the sale of our equity interest in Gulf Coast Express pipeline and lower marketing margin.  Targa generated adjusted free cash flow of $373 million in the first quarter. We are significantly hedged for 2022 and continue to add hedges for 2023 and beyond, while still benefiting from higher prices across our unhedged equity volume exposure and prices above fee floors.  Looking ahead, as a reminder, the integration of the recently acquired bolt-on midstream assets and associated contracts to our South Texas G&P operations will be reflected in consolidated G&P segment earnings for the second quarter.  Our consolidated leverage ratio was 3.4x at the end of the first quarter, and we had about $2 billion of available liquidity. In April, we successfully completed our inaugural TRGP notes offering in the investment-grade market, issuing $750 million of 4.2% senior notes due 2033 and $750 million of 4.95% senior notes due 2052. We really appreciate the support of our new and existing fixed income investors in our initial IG offering and are pleased to have been able to access the 30-year market for the first time.  Earlier this week, we completed the redemption of all of our outstanding Series A preferred stock for approximately $973 million. The redemption of the preferred completes an important strategic goal to simplify our capital structure, and we were able to do so sooner than previous expectations as a result of our strong company performance.  With respect to the sale of our interest in GCX, the call right process has concluded, and we expect to receive final payment on or around May 20.  As Matt mentioned, our pro forma leverage ratio is 3.3x and trending lower, which puts us in excellent financial position with a lot of flexibility.  We continue to expect to spend $700 million to $800 million on attractive organic growth capital opportunities in 2022, with approximately $121 million spent through the first quarter to support continued volume growth across our systems.  We are paying an attractive $1.40 annualized dividend per common share for 2022, and have been able to return additional capital to our common shareholders through opportunistic repurchases, with $50 million of shares repurchased in the first quarter.  Our continued investment in growing Targa's underlying businesses, supported by an attractive macro backdrop and the strength of our balance sheet means we are in excellent position looking forward to continue to return an increasing amount of capital to our shareholders.  Lastly, I'd like to echo Matt and thank our employees for their dedication and for continuing to prioritize safety. And with that, I will turn the call back over to Sanjay. Theresa, this is Jen. I think from our perspective, you'll see us kind of execute going forward, sort of as we are today, increase the common share dividend 2022 versus 2021, and that's the dividend that we'll have for this year, and then we'll revisit next February. You're seeing us continue to invest in our business. And also, you're seeing us to execute on opportunistic share repurchases.  So I think that's going to be the formula for us going forward. And then, it's just going to be a matter of the opportunities in front of us to figure out where we think our capital is best spent. I think the starting point, if any risks do present themselves, is just so different for us today than it ever has been before. We've just never been stronger, Theresa. So I think we'll be able to withstand and perform exceptionally well even if those risks do present themselves going forward. The only offset that I'd just start with, and then I'll turn it over to Matt, is just the sale of GCX was not part of our guidance. Oh, it was. I'm sorry, it was contemplated in our guidance. So yes, I think that you've got the pieces directionally correct. Current spot prices, just given the backwardation that still exists as we look out for the balance of 2022 is part of the unknown for us right now, but we are very well hedged and are continuing to add hedges. So I think we are in just an excellent position.  Matt, anything else? I think for us, you saw us execute on the Southcross acquisition, a great acquisition for us. We're excited to have those employees join the Targa team. Integration is going well, and that's an example of a transaction where we think we're able to buy at really attractive prices and then benefit from synergies, both near term and over the medium and longer term.  There are more assets and companies available in the market today than there certainly have been over the last couple of years, which is understandable given the strength of commodity prices. And so for us, the bar continues to be very, very high. And that means that there are a number of unique characteristics that any transaction would have to meet in order for us to even consider looking at it. So I think you'll see us continue to be very selective about anything that we spend our time on. The expectation would be that when we receive those proceeds, we'll use it to reduce borrowings under our revolver right now, Keith. And Keith, our 10-Q will be published later today so you'll be able to see in there the volumes that are now hedged across both gas, NGLs and condensate. Spiro, this is Jen. I'll take the first part of the question. So some of what we did in our G&P business was in the fourth quarter. We actually went ahead and bought fairly significant amount of chemicals ahead of time. So our chemical costs for the first quarter went down as a result of that. I'd expect our Q2 through, really, Q4 OpEx to step up as we move through time here, as we are seeing higher costs as a result of inflation and just difficulty getting certain things.  So Q1, I think a little bit of an anomaly. And then also, on the compensation side, we had a higher bonus that we ended up paying for the fourth quarter. And so that was reflected in the fourth quarter, and then we tend to accrue at a lower number as we begin a new year, and so that's what we're doing in the first quarter. So that's part of what you're seeing as well that I think is, again, creating a little bit of an anomaly in Q1 relative to Q4. I don't think that there's an easy framework that I can give you, Sunil, related to that. I think that as we think about OpEx Q2 going forward, it's likely to begin to look more like the fourth quarter than the first quarter. So that's probably the best visibility that I can give you right now. But we're also seeing prices increase real time. So it's a little bit tough to predict as well.  I think our operations teams and engineering teams are doing an excellent job of trying to stay in front of inflation and rising costs as much as they possibly can and are doing an excellent job working with our suppliers, but it's just a little bit difficult to predict right now. But I think the best visibility I can give you is that second quarter and go forward will look more like the fourth quarter than the first quarter. Harry, this is Jen. I think we'll have continued opportunities just moving forward. We do have some higher coupon notes. So depending on the callability and call prices of those notes, we'll be continuing to try to figure out how to best manage our liquidity and our notes positions going forward. I do think there is continued opportunities to benefit from savings, but the cadence of that is largely going to be dependent on the prices that we can call in those notes and then where can we issue notes in the market going forward. So we'll just have to see how that plays out. But I think we're in an excellent position anyway. I think a lot of the cash that you see on our balance sheet quarter-to-quarter really has more to do with the JVs and the terms of the JVs and when cash is distributed out of those joint ventures than anything else.  So we're generally trying to manage our liquidity position as optimally as we can. And so that means utilizing the available tools that we have, whether that be our revolver or accounts receivable facility or just maintaining cash on the balance sheet.  So there isn't a hard and fast rule that we're following that I can give you. It's really just us trying to manage as best as possible to minimize interest expense and maximize the liquidity that we have at all times."

            "content": "This is Bobby. So on the residue side, we were excited to see the most recent announcements on the expansions. At the end of the day, we look like a producer relative to our exposure. So what we want to know is that the gas flows and then ultimately, we will obviously want basis as flat possible. So we've known about it for a long time, we've known about the expectations of where our expectations of where supply was going. So we're fully prepped for it on the target side even before any of the new pipes come online. But yes, we expect and hope for more pipes to get announced. And whether we participate in it or not really, you'll see us end them at times when they need us to go. And if they don't need us to go, we won't be in them, right? So I think as we think through those things, we just want to see the pipes get built, and the takeaway, egress get there in time for us to not see big basis blowouts. This is Bobby. What I'd tell you is it's important to both have your own transport out of the basin, but then, a vast majority of what we do is we team up with, I'll call it, partners in the basin that have their own transport out of the basin. So as you think about us being Waha-exposed and we look to go sell gas at Waha, we will sell it to people that we know -- for lots of different reasons -- have that physical transport to get it out of the basin. They're very large counterparties that everyone on this call would know. And that's how we focus it.  Then when you think about how long to go forward, we obviously we look at when we think pipes will be coming online, when we expect our -- there to be capacity issues out of the basin, and we make sure we're crossing across that. And we don't try to get cute within months. We make sure we're well beyond when those expansions and pipes will come online.  So we've been doing that, we're still doing that, we've got everything that we think we need covered. And we even take out some insurance beyond that over time. So yes, so it's one where we're able to plan as far out as we want because people want to buy the gas for as long as we're willing to sell it. And then, we try to do it and match it up with when we think the -- there could be issues."

            "content": "Brian, this is Scott Pryor. Just to touch base, we do feel like the fractionation market is starting to tighten up. The number of inquiries that have come into us, both for short-term as well as long-term frac needs has increased. And some of those are actually folks that I think are trying to get a little bit ahead of the tightening of the market by trying to secure a fractionation that may start more dated into the future.  We've got a permit in hand for Train 9. We continuously are evaluating when we need to formally start that -- the construction of that. And we will stay well ahead of that relative to what our needs are. Recognize that we've got good transparency back to our producers behind our gas processing plant. And as a result of that, the timing of that, we will be well ahead of that.  So Again, I feel like the market is starting to tighten up, the number of inquiries coming in and the view that we have back to our producers, we feel like it -- there will be a time here in the near future that we'll look at starting Train 9 and the construction of that. Michael, this is Scott. First off, I would say that when we initially started our export business, we were -- yes, we were heavily weighted towards South America. Since then, much like the rest of the players in the marketplace, we have diversified more heavily, if you will, to the Far East and that growing demand that is there. Places like China for PDH plants, for chemical plants and even for domestic... I would say, when you look at our performance on a quarter-by-quarter basis, we continue to be very consistent. At times, there are some weather issues that may impact it. There might be some logistical challenges as it relates to the shipping market from time to time. And we have seen some of that and did see some of that in the first quarter of this year.  But all in all, the market is still very solid. Over time, it will continue to grow. We feel very good about the expansion that we're doing. It's very -- it's small, but yet very complementary to our business, which will allow us for some incremental capacity, and provides additional reliability to our customers that are historical lifters.  So again, we've got a good portfolio of customers. They're strong, they stick with us, they appreciate the reliability that we provide, and I think as we continue to see LPG's production increase here in the U.S., we will look for incremental ways to continue to debottleneck where it makes sense and push those across the water. And Matt, just to add -- this is Scott real quick. On the wholesale side of our business, we did see a strong fourth quarter in certain areas of our business, especially those areas where we have nice pockets of field inventory. So more of those volumes moved out during the fourth quarter than they did in the first quarter. So as a result of that, we had some uplift, probably earlier in the winter season than we did in the latter part of the winter season, just where our position is on inventories. Neel, this is Scott. As Matt said earlier, when we look at our pipeline as we're getting into our fractionation facility in Mont Belvieu, both of the plants that are operating on our systems -- we do have a few third-party plants that will evaluate ethane recovery based upon their situation where, they're located and whatever their contracts are around their system. But all in all, for the most part, we don't see a lot of swing on both our pipeline as well as the third-party pipelines that are coming into our system.  So I would say that it's not a big needle mover. Matt kind of indicated that earlier. But I think that when you look at where the pricing is today, most plants should be in recovery, and that's what we're seeing on our system. And given the price advantage that we see on the petrochemical side, I think that, that will continue for a while. But there's going to be some noise from time to time that all in all, for the most part in our system, we assume that we're going to have some recovery [indiscernible] fractionation footprint. Robert, this is Scott. Yes, we have been very pleased with the continuation of increased volumes on our transportation side of our business, quarter in and quarter out. First quarter averaging 460,000 barrels a day into out Mont Belvieu complex. So -- and again, we had good transparency back to our customers and our producers behind our plant and the additive of gas processing plants in the Permian.  So we will continue to add pumps along the pipeline sector. We've got good operating leverage today. And remember, when we throw out those stats around 460,000 barrels, again, to the first quarter, that -- part of that contribution is coming from North Texas and into Oklahoma from our applications in that area.  So we will evaluate the need for additional pipe and pipe expansions. We will be well ahead of that relative to what our needs are and the producers behind our system. So it's something that we're going to be well ahead of when it's necessary."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Sanjay Lad, Vice President of Finance and Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nSanjay Lad: Thanks, Shannon. Good morning and welcome to the fourth quarter 2023 earnings call for Targa Resources Corp. The fourth quarter earnings release, along with the fourth quarter earnings supplement presentation for Targa that accompany our call, are available on our website at targaresources.com in the Investors section. In addition, an updated investor presentation has also been posted to our website. Statements made during this call that might include Targa's expectations or predictions should be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in forward-looking statements. For a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ, please refer to our latest SEC filings. Our speakers for the call today will be Matt Meloy, Chief Executive Officer; and Jen Kneale, Chief Financial Officer. Additionally, we'll have the following senior management team members available for Q&A: Pat McDonie, President, Gathering and Processing; Scott Pryor, President, Logistics and Transportation; and Bobby Muraro, Chief Commercial Officer. And with that, I will now turn the call over to Matt.\nMatt Meloy : Thanks, Sanjay, and good morning. 2023 was another record year for Targa. And I would like to recognize and thank our employees for their focus, dedication and execution throughout the year. Some of our highlights for 2023 include record safety performance; record Gathering and Processing volumes in the Permian; record volumes across our logistics and transportation assets; record adjusted EBITDA of $3.53 billion, a 22% increase over 2022, while also reducing our share count; major projects came online on time, on budget and have been highly utilized since start-up; ended the year with 90% of our G&P volumes fee-based or with fee floor; positive outlook to our current investment-grade ratings with each of the three agencies and the completion of two successful notes offerings; and higher year-over-year return of capital to our shareholders through both an increased common dividend and record common share repurchases. Our performance was particularly strong given Waha natural gas and NGL prices were about 64% and 34% lower year-over-year. And we benefited from margin from fee floors in our Gathering and Processing business across 10 of 12 months, demonstrating our business is more insulated to downside -- to downward commodity prices than ever before. We also exited 2023 with a lot of volume momentum in the Permian. Our December reported inlet averaged 5.5 billion cubic feet per day, a 450 million cubic feet per day improvement from our third quarter average. While our volume ramp materialized later than we forecasted for 2023, we are pleased that we ended the year with December actuals in line with our original guidance expectations for the Permian, providing us with strong momentum in 2024. We expect another year of record financial and operational metrics with full year adjusted EBITDA estimated to be between $3.7 billion and $3.9 billion for 2024.  The significant year-over-year increase in adjusted EBITDA is primarily driven by higher expected Permian Gathering and Processing volumes and higher expected NGL transport fractionation and export volumes. Consensus growth expectations for Permian-associated gas in 2024 is about 9%. And given our track record of outperforming the basin, we are installing over 400 million cubic feet per day of compression in the first half of 2024, which will drive increasing volumes through our downstream assets. We currently estimate between $2.3 billion and $2.5 billion of growth capital spending in 2024 as we bring online two Permian plants, three fractionators in an NGL pipeline while also spending on projects that will come online beyond 2024, including additional Permian plants and fractionation trains. Beyond these projects already announced and under construction, we're also ordering long lead time items for our next Permian plants and frac Train 11 to ensure we keep pace with the significant activity we continue to see. Backed by the strength of our outlook and increasing stability of our cash flows we announced in November an expectation of a 50% year-over-year increase to our annualized 2024 common dividend per share. The increased dividend will be recommended to our board in April for the first quarter of 2024 with payment to shareholders in May.  We also repurchased a record $374 million of common shares in 2023 and continue to be in position to execute on our opportunistic share repurchase program in 2024. Beyond 2024, we really like our positioning driven by a view of cost-advantaged basins like the Permian continuing to be a key supplier of hydrocarbons for decades to come. As we look to 2025, we estimate about $1.4 billion of growth capital spending burdened by the next major projects that are not currently board approved but would be necessary to support continued volume growth, including Train 11 and additional Permian G&P plants.  With increasing EBITDA in 2025 relative 2024 and lower estimated growth capital spending, we expect to generate significant free cash flow in 2025. Also, we included in our presentation slides this morning an illustrative buildup of multiyear average spending that would approximate about $1.7 billion per year. This assumes high single digit gas volume growth in the Permian, requiring us to continue to add infrastructure across our value chain. $1.7 billion of capital spending at a 5.5 times multiple would drive over $300 million of EBITDA growth year-over-year and increasing free cash flow, supporting our ability to continue to return an increasing amount of capital to our shareholders. We also included our estimated spending to maintain volumes currently on our system, which we think is helpful in demonstrating the resiliency of our business. Growth capital spending to maintain existing volumes is estimated at around $300 million annually, which is informed by how quickly we're able to rationalize spending in 2020 and 2021, when we still had strong volume growth across our assets.  In a scenario of $300 million of annual growth capital spend, we would be in a position to utilize significant free cash flow to continue to return capital to shareholders while maintaining a very strong balance sheet.  As we look forward, our excitement is our -- our excitement and our outlook is driven by a few things. First, we have the largest Permian Gathering and Processing footprint in the industry with several million dedicated acres across Midland and Delaware Basins. That, coupled with an integrated NGL system, positions us nicely to generate high return organic opportunities to invest around $1.7 billion annually over a multiyear average, delivering over $300 million of annual EBITDA growth, driving significant free cash flow and positions Targa to continue to meaningfully increase the amount of capital returned to shareholders and deliver significant value to our shareholders over the long term. Let's now discuss our operations in more detail. Starting in the Permian, activity continues to remain strong across our dedicated acreage. Fourth quarter inlet volumes averaged a record 5.3 billion cubic feet per day, an 11% increase when compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. We brought online significant compression across our Midland and Delaware systems during the fourth quarter, driving a 5% sequential increase in volumes. In Permian Midland, our new 275 million a day Greenwood plant, which commenced operations during the fourth quarter, is already highly utilized. Our next Midland plant, Greenwood II, remains on track to begin operations in the fourth quarter of 2024 and is expected to be much needed when it comes online. In the Permian Delaware, activity in volumes across our footprint are also running strong. We brought online our new 275 million a day Wildcat II plant in late fourth quarter, and it's already highly utilized. Our Roadrunner II and Bull Moose plants remain on track to begin operations in the second quarters of 2024 and 2025, respectively. As mentioned earlier, we are ordering long lead time items for our next Permian plants to support continued production growth across our footprint. Shifting to our Logistics and Transportation segment. Targa's NGL pipeline transportation volumes were a record 722,000 barrels per day, and fractionation volumes were a record 845,000 barrels per day during the fourth quarter. Our Grand Prix NGL pipeline deliveries into Mont Belvieu increased 9% sequentially as we benefited from increased supply from our Permian G&P systems and higher third-party volumes. The outlook for NGL supply growth from our G&P footprint and third parties remains robust, and our Daytona NGL pipeline expansion will be much needed to handle growth from our system. We have obtained all required permits and have commenced construction on Daytona. We now expect the pipeline to begin operations ahead of schedule in early fourth quarter of this year, assuming favorable weather conditions. Our fractionation complex in Mont Belvieu continues to operate near capacity. And we expect our Train 9 fractionator to be highly utilized when it commences operations during the second quarter of 2024. The restart of GCF will also provide much-needed capacity when it is fully online during the second quarter of 2024. Our Train 10 fractionator is also expected to be much needed given the anticipated growth in our G&P business and corresponding plan additions and remains on track for the first quarter of 2025.  As mentioned earlier, also ordering long lead items for Train 11 support continued production growth across our footprint. In our LPG export business at Galena Park, our loadings were a record 13.3 million barrels per month during the fourth quarter as we benefited from our recently completed expansion, strong market conditions and the Houston Ship Channel allowance of nighttime transits for larger vessels, providing strong momentum for 2024. Before I turn the call over to Jen to discuss fourth quarter results in more detail as well as our expectations for 2024, I would like to extend a second thank you to the Targa team for their continued focus on safety and execution while continuing to provide best-in-class service and reliability to our customers.\nJen Kneale : Thanks, Matt. Good morning, everyone. Targa's reported quarterly adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $960 million, a 14% increase over the third quarter. The sequential increase was attributable to higher Permian volumes, which resulted in higher system volumes across our integrated NGL business.  Full year 2023 adjusted EBITDA was roughly $3.53 billion, supported by record financial and operational metrics across the company. We spent approximately $2.2 billion on growth capital projects and $223 million in net maintenance capital during 2023, largely in line with our previous estimates.  In November, we successfully completed a $1 billion offering of 6.15% coupon senior notes due 2029 and a $1 billion offering of 6.5% coupon senior notes due 2034. This allowed us to reduce our term loan borrowings by $1 billion and enhance our liquidity position. At the end of the fourth quarter, we had $2.7 billion of available liquidity and our net consolidated leverage ratio was approximately 3.6 times, well within our long-term leverage ratio target range of 3 to 4 times. Also, this morning in an announcement that was made public while we were on this call, S&P has upgraded us to BBB, reflective of the progress we have made to date and our outlook for the future. Turning to our expectations for 2024. We are really excited about that short and longer term outlook. We estimate full year 2024 adjusted EBITDA to be between $3.7 billion and $3.9 billion, an 8% increase over 2023 based on the midpoint of our range, assuming commodity prices of $1.80 per MMBtu for Waha natural gas, $0.65 per gallon for our weighted average NGL barrel and $75 per WTI crude oil barrel.  We expect first quarter 2024 adjusted EBITDA to be lower than fourth quarter 2023 as volumes across our systems were impacted by very cold winter weather, and operating expenses are increasing in anticipation of system expansions across both our segments. We expect quarterly adjusted EBITDA to increase sequentially as we move through the year and benefit from increasing volumes across our systems. We estimate $2.3 billion to $2.5 billion of growth capital spending for 2024, including the vast majority of spending on Greenwood II, Bull Moose, Daytona and Train 10. Our estimate for net maintenance capital spending is about $225 million reflective of our spending in 2023 and the increased assets that our operations teams are managing. We expect to end 2024 with our leverage ratio comfortably within our long-term leverage ratio target range of 3 to 4 times, providing continued flexibility going forward. We are well hedged across all commodities for the balance of 2024 and continue to add hedges for 2025 and beyond. The combination of hedges and fee-based margin across our businesses will continue to provide us with cash flow stability. Our fee floors in our G&P business support our ability to invest across lower commodity price environments while positioning us to benefit from higher commodity prices.  Relative to our full year 2024 financial guidance, a 30% move higher in commodity prices would increase full year adjusted EBITDA by around $165 million, while a 30% decrease would reduce adjusted EBITDA by around $75 million. As Matt described earlier, we also provided you with our current view of 2025 growth capital spending and an illustrative multiyear buildup across a couple of scenarios. We hope these are helpful. Our goal in providing them was to highlight some key points. We believe that there will continue to be strong growth in Permian volumes on our system going forward, which is going to drive incremental volumes through our downstream assets, requiring continued investments, which will continue to be at attractive returns, particularly given our efforts around adding fees and fee floors.  Downstream projects are larger and spending is lumpier. As those projects come online and we benefit from the operating leverage associated with increased available capacity, our growth capital spending moderates as evidenced by our current expectation of $1.4 billion of capital spend in 2025. Across multiple years, we would expect growth capital spend in an environment of continued volume growth to approximate around $1.7 billion. We are bullish Permian growth going forward but are often asked the question, how much capital would it take to maintain volumes? And our answer is approximately $300 million. This is not a scenario that we anticipate. It is merely intended to be instructive and hopefully helpful in demonstrating the strength of the Targa value proposition across the downside scenario, when the strength of our free cash flow generation and balance sheet would leave us very well positioned. Shifting to capital allocation. Our priorities remain the same, which are to maintain a strong investment-grade balance sheet to continue to invest in high-returning integrated projects and to return an increasing amount of capital to our shareholders across cycles.  As Matt described, underpinned by the strength of our business outlook for 2024 and beyond, we plan to recommend to our board a 50% increase in the 2024 annual common dividend, $3 per share, and we expect to be able to grow our dividend meaningfully thereafter. We also expect to remain in a position to continue to execute opportunistically under our common share repurchase program. In 2023, we repurchased a Targa record $374 million of common shares at a weighted average price of $76.72 with $41 million repurchased during the fourth quarter. We had about $770 million remaining under our $1 billion share repurchase program at the end of the fourth quarter. Across our base scenarios, we are continuing to model the ability over time to return 40% to 50% of cash flow from operations to equity holders, providing a framework for thinking through our return of capital proposition looking forward. As it relates to taxes, based on our estimate for earnings and spending and current tax policy, there's no change to our assumptions that we may be subject to the federal minimum tax in 2026 and a full cash taxpayer in 2027. We believe that we continue to offer a unique value proposition for our shareholders and potential shareholders, growing EBITDA, a growing common dividend per share, reducing share count and excellent short, medium and long-term assets -- outlook, excuse me. Our talented team continues to execute on our strategic priorities and safely operate our assets to deliver the energy that enhances our everyday life. And we are very thankful for the efforts of all of our employees. And with that, I will turn the call back over to Sanjay.\nSanjay Lad : Thanks, Jen. For the Q&A session, we kindly ask that you limit to one question and one follow up and enter the Q&A line up if you have additional question. Shannon, would you please open the line for Q&A?\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jeremy Tonet with JP Morgan Securities, LLC. Your line is now open \nJeremy Tonet : Hi, good morning. \nMatt Meloy : Hey, good morning, Jeremy. \nJeremy Tonet : Just wanted to start off, I guess, with the news about 2025 CapEx stepping down so significantly versus 2024, creating a lot of flexibility there as it relates to return on capital. Just wondering if you might be able to provide a little bit more detail as far as thoughts on capital allocation at that point in weighting dividend growth relative to buybacks. Just kind of any other -- any incremental color would be helpful there with that extra -- with that $1 billion step-down in CapEx.\nJen Kneale : Good morning, Jeremy. This is Jen. I think that we're really excited about 2025 and the possibilities for Targa and our shareholders. There's really no change to how we are thinking about return of capital. I think part of the excitement that we have around this year, next year and really many years to come is that we believe we offer a really unique value proposition, where we will be in position from a significantly increasing amount of free cash flow to meaningfully increase our common dividends per share and continue to execute under our opportunistic share repurchase program. We published the framework in November that said that we would expect to be in a position to return 40% to 50% of cash flow from operations to our shareholders. And that's what we're modeling. And as we get into 2025 and beyond, that means that there's a lot of incremental capital that can flow to our shareholders. And again, that's really what is underpinning what we think should be a very exciting Targa story for both our company and our shareholders.\nJeremy Tonet : Got it. Thank you for that. And maybe just pivoting towards LPG exports, a good step-up there. Just wondering if you could comment a bit more if the lifting of daylight hour restriction, I think, it is planned and we expect the Port Authority to drop the trial moniker not too far down the road here. I'm just wondering how you think that impacts Targa capacity when the daylight hour restriction is fully removed then?\nScott Pryor : Hey, Jeremy, this is Scott. First off, you're right, fourth quarter was a really nice quarter for us with over 13 million barrels per month, which was a combination of both propanes and butanes across the dock. Certainly, a couple of benefits there that we took in -- to our advantage. One was obviously the export expansion project that we had that increased our refrigeration capacity, increased our ability to load vessels faster. And we were able to operate through the -- really the entire fourth quarter, so we got the step up with that. The nighttime transits that were lifted or provided another benefit. So the Houston Ship Channel, along with the Houston pilots, collaborated together to provide that to the industry as a whole. Targa benefited from that as a result of that. I would say that nominally speaking, we think that, that probably provided us about a 5% to 10% benefit. It's difficult to really pin that down because there's a variety of factors that play into that. And on top of that, we were able to benefit from spot activity as a result of those increased liftings. I would like to add that I give a huge thank you to the Houston pilots and the Houston Ship Channel. That provides that change in nighttime transit that they have done very safely, effectively and efficiently, not only benefits Targa, but it really benefits a wide variety of industries along the Houston Ship Channel that help drive Texas economy as well as the U.S. economy. So going forward into 2024, you're right, currently today it is kind of labeled as a trial period. But I think based upon the success that they've had, the safe operating environment that they've been able to conduct themselves under, we view this really as a long-term change. And we will continue to benefit from it. We hope to find other ways to optimize around that as we learn more about the nighttime transits and the vessels that are available to move through that process.\nJeremy Tonet : Got it. Okay. So it sounds like there could be upside down the road versus the 5 to 10?\nScott Pryor : Well, what I would say is, I think that in the fourth quarter, it was not -- the nighttime transits were not a part of the entire fourth quarter. It really got instituted in November. And I think that we will hopefully find some better ways to optimize around it, again, as we learn more about the program. So it benefited us now, and we'll continue to see how that fares for us going forward.\nMatt Meloy : Yeah. It's still early, Jeremy. So I think we're thinking 5% to 10% is a good -- kind of a good range of upside right now, but it's still pretty early.\nJeremy Tonet : Got it. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. \nSanjay Lad: Okay, thank you. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Spiro Dounis with Citi. Your line is now open. \nSpiro Dounis : Thanks, operator. Good morning, team. Wanted to go back to Permian production quickly. Jen, you had mentioned maybe a slower start to the year, and I think that's pretty consistent with what producers are saying. Just curious, though, as we think about the year as a whole, can you give us a sense of what Permian production growth is underwriting the guidance? And to the extent that it's back half loaded, what that implies about 2025?\nJen Kneale : I think that we're continuing to see a lot of very robust growth on our Permian assets. A couple of important points that I think were mentioned in scripted comments were, one, that by the time that we got to the end of 2023, we actually outpaced our initial expectations for the year. While that growth materialized a little bit more slowly than we expected, it did materialize and ended up exceeding expectations at year-end. What I was trying to highlight was we did experience some extreme winter weather here thus far to start the year, and that will impact our Q1 results. But our operations teams are doing an excellent job of getting our assets back up and running. So as we think about the balance of this year and beyond, I think you've seen our track record that we outperform the expectations for growth out of the Permian Basin on the gas side. And there's nothing that we're seeing that would change that trend in any meaningful way. We didn't give a statistic this year for Permian growth relative to what we've provided previously in the past. One, just because we think that individual operational statistics are less meaningful than some of the high-level corporate information that we give. And I think that our performance in 2023 highlighted that a little bit, right? Our volumes ended up coming in a little bit lower than our initial guidance for the full year average. But again, we exited higher than we initially anticipated. So everything is just really setting up well for our continued execution across both the Midland and the Delaware Basin. And we have a very strong outlook for robust continued growth for as long as we can see.\nSpiro Dounis : Got it. Thanks a lot, Jen. Second question, maybe going to 2025. I know you're not providing '25 EBITDA today, but some of the materials did maybe give us some tools on how to help think about that. You guys are pointing to significant growth. You've also talked about in the slides $300 million of annual EBITDA growth with $1.7 billion of spending. So I guess, if I look back at '23-'24, spending over $2 billion in each of these years, it would seem like as we think about the lease of '25, over $300 million of EBITDA growth would seem like an easy hurdle. But I don't want to get too ahead of myself.\nMatt Meloy : Yeah, yeah. I think what I'd say is we feel really good about our position coming out of '24 going into '25. I think '25 is going to set up very well. I think we see significant EBITDA growth in '25, and frankly, beyond '25.  We guided 2.3 to 2.5 of CapEx this year. We were about 2.2 last year. So the kind of 5.5 times investment multiple is a multiyear average. It's not -- you spend a set amount in one year so it results in EBITDA in that year. It's a multiyear average that we think we can do, call it, 5 to 6 times EBITDA on our CapEx. So when you kind of look at what we spent the last couple of years, I think it just sets up for a very strong 2025. We decided not to give EBITDA guidance for '25, but just kind of point you to our historical spending and just the overall volume trajectory that we're seeing across our footprint is just going to set up very nice for us in '25.\nSpiro Dounis : Fair enough. Thanks for that, Matt. Appreciate the time today. \nSanjay Lad: Okay. Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Reynolds with UBS. Your line is now open. \nBrian Reynolds : Hi, good morning everyone. Maybe to follow up on some of the kind of long-term EBITDA growth outlook, I think you outlined kind of a build multiple around 5.5 times. I think a quarter or two ago, you kind of outlined in the past three years that some of these projects came in at much lower multiples. So kind of just trying to understand maybe the difference there if you can -- maybe there's some doses of conservatism in the build or whether the commodity has anything to play with that and whether we could maybe see some upside to the EBITDA build multiple. Thanks. \nMatt Meloy : Sure. No, good question. I mean, really, historically, you go back years, we kind of said 5 to 7 times build multiple is kind of what we targeted. We've been able to do better than that. I think that was just kind of some cushion in that 5 to 7. If you look back at the last five years, we've really been kind of closer to a 4 times build multiple. We've had really good volume growth across our system. And the Permian, Grand Prix filled up much quicker even than our expectations, which just drove the returns even higher.  So I think we've really had some strong performance. But I'd say there's really nothing fundamentally different in what we're investing in this year and next year, go forward than what we invested in, in the past where we did have a lower investment multiple. I'd say perhaps there's a little bit of conservatism put into that number. But it's not -- there's not a large delta from commodity prices one way or the other. I'd say we have more commodity price upside given the fee floors that Jen and we've talked about, which could drive that lower if we get some commodity price tailwinds.\nJen Kneale : I would just add that, I think, Brian, the conservatism is further highlighted by how highly utilized we think our projects will be that are in progress right now when they come online, which has been really the same playbook that we benefited from over the last many years. It feels like we're just in time on a number of our assets, which is great for the finance person in the room because it means that they're very highly utilized at start-up and provide significant incremental cash flow very quickly. It makes it a little bit tougher for our operations and engineering teams, of course, as they try to plan.  But I think that that's part of the conservatism as well that really is reflective in the 5.5 times versus the realized multiples that you've seen across our footprint.\nBrian Reynolds : Great. Thanks. And maybe as a follow-up to Spiro's question on just Permian and the growth. Previously, you kind of gave more of a firm number around 10%. And then the illustrative guide, you kind of talk high single digits. Maybe just talk about that's kind of your base expectation at this point. And then kind of as a follow-up, has any of the M&A -- any updated view on some acquisitions in the Midland impacting your thought process there?  And then just on the operational hiccups, are we past that? And as it relates to H2S gas quality issues, how does your system able to manage that sour gas and potentially grow at a higher clip than the rest of the basin? Thanks. \nMatt Meloy : Okay. I'll start and then Pat can probably touch on a little bit of this, too. I think when you look at our Permian growth for the year, we really feel good about where we're starting the year. December was our highest month, and it really just sets us up for really good production growth just where we exited 2023 going into '24. So even with relatively modest growth from here, we're going to see a really strong year-over-year. And that's why we've said consensus is about 9%. We've typically beat that. But even if we get anywhere around high single digits or a little bit better, I think it sets us up very well, not only for '24 'but 25. And then I'll let Pat speak a little bit to kind of the M&A landscape from our E&P customers.\nPat McDonie : Yeah. There's been a lot of M&A activity over the last three to four years. So it's not something we're unfamiliar with. And frankly, we don't see a material difference with these new announcements as we've seen in the past. Frankly, we've seen pretty consistent growth across the combined companies relative to our position with the individual companies.  The new ones that are coming out, we have meaningful positions with all the parties. We have long-term contracts with all the parties. We have great relationships with all those producers. If you look at what's been publicly announced by those parties, you wouldn't expect a significant impact to what their expected growth levels are going to be. Frankly, at least on one of the major -- the bigger mergers, there's -- you could allow that there's going to be an expectation of incremental growth on our assets on the Midland side of the basin.  So there is a lot of activity, a lot going on, but we've benefited from it because we've got great assets, we're reliable. We've got good contracts, and we've got good relationships.\nMatt Meloy : Yeah. And just to add to that, too, the other part of your question was around gas quality and trading. A lot of the -- we are spending a lot of capital, and we spent last year and this year 4 additional treating facilities primarily in the Delaware Basin. We're putting in some additional treaters to handle both CO2 and H2S, and we're drilling multiple wells to handle that as gas injection wells and pipelines and connectivity to handle that. So I think that really positions us nicely as the Delaware continues to grow and gas quality becomes another issue that the producer are going to have to deal with, we'll be in a really good position to handle that. And most of that capital will be in or the large -- the lion's share of it will be in kind of by the end of this year.\nJen Kneale : And then I think the very last question in your question was around whether volumes had rebounded as a result of the impact of winter storm. And I'm really proud -- I think we're all really proud of the efforts of our operations teams to get volumes back online. So we're close to back to levels that we were seeing before we experienced the extreme weather.\nBrian Reynolds : Great. Thanks. Appreciate all the color this morning. Thanks. \nSanjay Lad: Okay, thank you. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tristan Richardson with Scotiabank. Your line is now open. \nTristan Richardson : Hi, good morning. Jen, pardon, my voice this morning, but really appreciate the CapEx sensitivity you guys laid out and really curious about the flexibility you have in that '25 outlook. Certainly, you talked about that high single digit embedded in that assumption. But can you talk about timing that spend in the event producers deviate from that assumption, whether that is deferring Train 11 timing your plan towards the end of '25? And then also maybe just about does Greenwood II and Bull Moose coming on towards the second half of '24? Is that adequate capacity to support that sort of high single-digit inlet for '25 in the illustrative?\nMatt Meloy : Yeah. So as we think about '24 and then going into '25, we're ordering some long lead time, have some spending for Train 11, which will both be in '24 and '25. And then we also mentioned there's additional plants, call it, two plants, maybe one in the Delaware, one in the Midland, of additional ordering long lead time and in kind of our base assumption that we're going to need to start spending capital on this going to have '24 and '25 budget.  So that's kind of what we have in our budget right now. Sure, if there's even more production growth in the Permian, could that move that plant timing up a little bit? It could move it up a little bit. If it's perhaps on the lower end of the growth ranges, could we push those out? Yeah, we could push that out a little bit. Really, the big sensitivities to our CapEx does -- it really tends to be more on the downstream side. Are we going to need -- when is the next fractionator? What about -- Daytona's coming on, should give us some good runway from an NGL perspective. But when will you need more transportation and then export? Those are the larger projects that can be a bit lumpier. So I think '25, a lot of that up and down really could just be around our G&P business and some of the plant timing and related field capital.\nTristan Richardson : Super helpful. Appreciate it, Matt. And then just a quick follow-up. Talking about the 90% fee-based now. I mean, I think a substantial move from '23. Clearly, this is a multiyear priority for you guys and has been a game of inches. Are you seeing a big change in '24 really a function of mix? And where -- which of your producers are growing? Or did you see some substantial kind of recuts or recontracting occur throughout '23?\nMatt Meloy : Yeah. We've been making steady progress on getting more fee-based components, primarily fee floors but also just fee-based G&P business, over the last several years. Our commercial team really did a fantastic job in 2023. And I would say there was a step-change in just the number of contracts that we were able to get redone. So no, it was a step-change late in '23, which significantly changed our overall downside risk profile and is done.  So now we're estimating 90%. You see that on our commodity price sensitivity. We still have some length. So there is some downside if prices moved down. But relative to our overall size of 30% downside, $60 million, $70 million, that's not much sensitivity. That is fundamentally different than where we were really 12-24 and certainly 36 months ago.\nTristan Richardson : Yeah, appreciate. Thanks very much, Matt. \nMatt Meloy : Okay, thank you. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Theresa Chen with Barclays. Your line is now open. \nTheresa Chen : Good morning. I have a question following up on Tristan's question related to the fee floors within your G&P segment. Just thinking about the 90% at this point, as you have put in additional fee floors within your POP contracts overtime, is the mix of fee-based versus POP with the floor within that 90% changing, i.e. is the incremental fee-based contract really putting in fee floors for POP? Or have you exchanged some previous legacy fee-based contracts for POP with the floors as you renegotiate? And just really trying to understand the rationale behind why your customers would allow you to put in fee floors overtime.\nJen Kneale : This is Jen. It's actually a mixture of what you talked about but for different reasons. You've seen the percent of our G&P business that is fee-based increase largely as a result of acquisition. When we bought Lucid, primarily underpinning the Lucid contracts that we acquired were largely fee-based contracts. And so we saw a big step change in the increase of fees generated from our G&P business associated with that acquisition. But what our commercial team has been really successful at doing, and I would also like to take my hats off to all of them because it's been just a huge effort that I think has very meaningful implications for our company, is they have gone in and worked with producers to really demonstrate that in order to incentivize Targa to be willing to spend capital. And this goes back to 2020. This is an effort that we have been building on -- building momentum on over the last many, many years. But going back to those conversations, in order for Targa to be willing to continue to invest capital, what you've seen us consistently do over the last many years. We need to make sure that we will get an adequate rate of return in a downside commodity price environment. It's simply just the math. And our producers have been very supportive of that construct. So we've gone into existing POP contracts, and we've been able to restructure those to put the fee floors in place that, again, have incentivized us to continue to spend capital even as commodity prices are lower while not giving up the upside to the extent commodity prices rise. And so it's really been a mix of we've acquired a lot of fee-based assets on the G&P side, and then we've gone in and we've either restructured existing contracts or as new contracts have been put in place by our commercial team, they've been put in place with that fee floor structure while also generating returns across our integrated system.  And the commercial teams have really just done a very good job supporting our producers with what our producers need but under a construct that also works for us to continue to capital.\nTheresa Chen : That's helpful. Thank you. And then when we think about the long-term illustrative CapEx, so going from 1.4 back to the 1.7 on a multiyear basis and thinking through the next lumpy projects in the downstream segment. In addition to additional fractionation and export capacity, the eventual looping of the 30-inch segment of Grand Prix, can you talk about at this juncture with the growth that you have had you and Daytona coming online by year-end and filling up thereafter, what the cadence of build and spend would be for that 30-inch loop? And how do we get from 1.4 to 1.7 or beyond in the years to come?\nMatt Meloy : Yeah. Sure. Good question. So I would say the primary delta from the 1.4 to 1.7 is downstream spending, having multiple fractionation facilities and that's really more this year. But really the delta between 1.4 and 1.7 is primarily downstream. One of the larger projects that we don't have any meaningful spending on next year is transportation, another NGL pipe. We have Daytona coming on this year. That's going to provide us some good runway. So then how much runway that provides really depends on what the overall growth rate in the Permian and our capture of those NGL barrels to move on to Daytona. So that is something we're thinking about. These pipes take a couple of years to get billed, probably even a little bit longer than that. So we had to look out two-three years and say, when do we need to think about looping that 30-inch segment. There's also available transport out there from some of our competitors. So we can move -- I think we'll move the lion's share of our volumes on our own pipe. There can be transportation agreements that can be had with some of our competitors as well. So really, for us, all options are on the table, whether it's us building a 30-inch down the road or utilizing some excess capacity from some other NGL pipes.\nScott Pryor : Yeah. And Matt, I would just add the fact that our West leg, we've shown that we can actually operate that above the 600,000 barrel a day nameplate that we have kind of put out there. So that volume along the West leg, along with volumes that are coming in from the north are all feeding through the 30-inch pipeline. We've got still a lot of operating leverage with the 30-inch pipeline. And certainly, Daytona provides us a lot of operating leverage going forward for periods of time.\nTheresa Chen : Thank you. \nMatt Meloy : Okay, thank you. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Neel Mitra with Bank of America. Your line is now open. \nNeel Mitra : Hi, good morning. Thanks for all the detail on the CapEx spend. I wanted to follow up on the last question and the $550 million related mostly to downstream. Assuming you're spending about half of a frac each year, that leaves about $300 million each year for, on average, transportation and exports. So first of all, is there any ability to meaningfully expand Galena Park at this time? Are there land constraints?  And then second, with the NGL pipe build oversupply, do you see your need for expanding pipe elongated just because you're able to hold your pricing power when others are competing for barrels?\nScott Pryor : Neel, this is Scott. I'll start it off and just say that let's -- when we first think about the pipe, recognize that today, we utilize third-party pipes for volumes that are coming into our Belvieu facility today. And when we think about the growth that we have on the G&P side and the Daytona pipeline, we are not out there fighting for fees relative to fill up our existing capacity and our expected capacity that we would have on Daytona. So all of that kind of folds hand-in-hand with the growth that Pat and his team on the G&P side have relative to transportation. Matt alluded to the fact that if there is capacity on industry pipes, we -- again, because we utilize that today, we can always look for opportunities to utilize that to bridge us to whenever we might need to do a loop around our existing system. As it relates to Galena Park, we have a really good idea of what the next expansion project looks like. And it's a variety of factors from adding refrigeration to adding pipe, to adding potential docks and things of that nature. So we're keeping, obviously, a close eye on what that timing needs to be relative to our growth, again, driven by our G&P business. And we'll continue to evaluate that. So I will say, again, the expansion that we had in the fourth quarter that we're benefiting from today, the nighttime transits, both of those really are hand-in-hand expansion projects on their own without having to spend a lot of capital. So we'll continue to look for ways to debottleneck if possible to get incremental capacity as well.  So I think we've got a lot of opportunity and some runway with the existing assets that we have. But we do have space available to expand at Galena Park.\nNeel Mitra : Perfect. And if I could just follow up quickly. One of your peers mentioned for their oil outlook in the Permian that almost all of the growth would come out of the Delaware versus the Midland. I know that you aren't necessarily representative of the overall basin. But could you just perhaps break out what you're seeing with producer activity between the two basins in the Permian?\nMatt Meloy : Yeah. I mean we see growth in the Delaware, but we see significant growth in the Midland as well. So we see growth across both of our footprints, really active producers in both. So on our footprint, we see growth in the Midland and we see growth in the Delaware.\nNeel Mitra : Okay, thank you. \nMatt Meloy : Thank you. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Keith Stanley with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. \nKeith Stanley : Hi, good morning. One follow-up on Daytona just thinking to next year, 2025. Do you expect volumes on Daytona to simply tie to Targa G&P volumes? Or are there material third-party volumes that you're expecting to pick up when the pipeline comes into service?\nScott Pryor : Hi, Keith, this is Scott. I would say it's predominantly driven by our G&P footprint as to what we'll be feeding into Daytona. So it is a combination, but I would say the largest proportionate share of that is going to be related to our G&P and the additive of the plants that we've already announced and any potential plants going forward.\nKeith Stanley : Got it. Thanks. And then, Jen, wanted to clarify on the cash taxes. So expectation, I think you said full 15% AMT cash tax rate in '26 and then statutory 21% tax rate in 2027. And then relatedly, how would that house pass legislation, which brings back bonus depreciation potentially impact that outlook?\nJen Kneale : We are pretty borderline right now, whether we would be subject to the AMT in 2026 or 2027. It's actually pretty close. So that -- we're trying to give you a conservative look right now that -- based on our latest forecast we may be subject to the AMT. And then in that scenario, in 2027, we'll have worked our way through our net operating losses and would be fully subject to the statutory tax rate. To the extent the existing bill that -- moving its way through gets passed, and we do see a return of accelerated bonus depreciation, that would be a big help to us. And that may delay things, call it, a year or so based on current forecast. Ultimately, we'd have to see what the final policy is that gets passed, but that would be our early read right now.\nKeith Stanley : Thank you.\nJen Kneale : Thank you. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of John Mackay with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. \nJohn Mackay : Hey, thanks for the time. I wanted to go back to the potential export expansions. Maybe this is one for Scott. I appreciate the color. But I guess when you guys are looking high-level, top-down from a strategy standpoint, if we think about the quantity of NGLs coming off your Permian processing footprint and how much of that on a percentage basis moves its way on to the export side, do you want to be able to hold that percentage going forward? Are you comfortable with that percentage dropping? Do you want to increase it? Just any kind of directional strategy thought would be interesting.\nMatt Meloy : Yeah. Sure. Yeah. As we think about really from G&P all the way through our dock, we want to make sure we have the capacity to handle the volumes coming from our G&P footprint. And so that's kind of how we think about staging transportation, fractionation. And that goes for export as well. We want to make sure we have a good market for propane and butanes. As Scott mentioned, that's really what we export. So with the expansion that just came on and the nighttime allowance of kind of, call it, 5% to 10%, I think that gives us some cushion as we go forward. And as we see really how much capacity that nighttime opens up for us, that gives us some good cushion before we're going to need another export project. But we are already looking at scoping. And so the timing is kind of to be determined, but do we need refrigeration, do we need a pipeline, are we looking at dock. But those projects are not the really large-scale, I'd say, greenfields or brownfield. I kind of view those as more debottlenecking. You have one pinch point, you spend a couple of hundred million dollars and you get some excess capacity, then you do the next and then you do the next.  So those are the things we're kind of looking at over the longer term. But yeah, we want to make sure we can handle the volumes coming across our system.\nJohn Mackay : That's clear. Thank you. Maybe just one last quick one. You mentioned you'd caught up on the compression side. Obviously, we've been hearing about tightness in the compression market across the board. One of your peers talked about this as being a potential relative guardian on growth even going forward from here in the Permian. Maybe just your high level thoughts and whether that actually is a bit of a constraint at this point or it's gotten better versus third quarter.\nMatt Meloy : Yeah. I mean we have the issues we talked about last year was really just kind of being behind on our -- getting the compression all said and getting that done last year. We had a lot of compression come on late last year, and then you saw our volumes in Q4 really move up. We have another talked about $400 million of compression. So we ordered that out about a year right now for compressors. So we tried to get ahead of it as we saw we were getting behind last year. We just approved another AFE the other day to order some more inventory to try and get ahead of it and stay for 2025.  So part of that does depend on volume growth. When you see a lot of volumes, if it exceeds our forecast, you can end up having some pinch points. But we're trying to be smart, look at the forecast and stay ahead of it.\nPat McDonie : Yeah. And I think the only thing I'd add, Matt, is lead times have not come down. The lead times are still long. So that problem still exists. We've just gotten out in front of it.\nJohn Mackay : If I could just ask one follow-up on that. Caterpillar announced a capacity expansion on their large engine line, I guess, a week or two ago. Any initial read on whether that should bring that down from a year to something a little better?\nMatt Meloy : I have not heard any change in lead times.\nJohn Mackay : Fair enough, thank you. Appreciate the time. \nMatt Meloy : Okay, thank you. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Blum with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.\nMichael Blum : Thanks for squeezing me in. Just wanted to ask if any update on the Apex Permian gas pipeline? And I'm assuming the $1.7 billion run-rate does not contemplate that project.\nBobby Muraro : This is Bobby. We continue to work on all the options to get gas out of the basin, which includes Apex. We've said it before and we'll say it again, our number one priority is that gas continues to flow out of the basin so that NGLs can come out of our plants and go down Grand Prix and go across our docks. Last call, I think I talked about the fact that several other projects that fit the parameters that we would want to -- back have raised their heads. And we're working hard on those along with Apex and everything else. So I am -- every month that passes, I get more encouraged by the work we're doing to make sure that a pipe gets built and comes online '26-ish. And I'm confident that something will get done this year, whether that's an Apex or one of the multiple options that we're looking at to increase egress out of the basin. \nMatt Meloy : Yeah. No. And then, Michael, on the CapEx part, that is not included in the 1.4. In any project that goes, we'll evaluate does it make sense for us to be a partner. So for a partner in it that would increase that CapEx. There's also some of these pipes that will be project financed for the majority of the capital. So any amount of equity we were to put into it would be relatively small, so it may or may not be project financed. But that is not included in the -- in our outlook.\nJen Kneale : And I'd just add one last point that in the $1.7 billion, we have been spending some capital in the last couple of years on what I call intra-basin Permian residue just to ensure we've got really good redundancy on the residue side between our plants. So to the extent that we're contemplating any of that in the future, that will be included in that $1.7 billion multiyear outlook, but no major projects.\nMichael Blum : Okay. Got it. No, that helps. And then just on Frac 11 that I guess you're starting to spend a little bit on this year, what's the timing of when that would be in service? Thanks. \nScott Pryor : Yeah. Hey, Michael, this is Scott. We've not defined what the timing would be for that in-service date. Ordering long lead items gives us some flexibility on what that needs to be out into the future. We're just finding that supply chain planning -- or supply chain issues are creating some issues with certain equipment. And so as a result of that, we can take some small capital dollars to ensure that we can hold whatever date we put out there in the future. So we don't have a defined date at this point, but it's certainly something that we want to keep on our radar and keep ahead of.\nMichael Blum : Thank you. \nMatt Meloy : Yeah, thanks, Michael. \nOperator: Thank you. This concludes the question-and-answer session. I'd now like to hand the call back over to Sanjay Lad for closing remarks.\nSanjay Lad: Thanks to everyone that was on the call this morning, and we appreciate your interest in Targa Resources.

            "content": "Thanks, Matt. Good morning, everyone. Targa's reported quarterly adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $960 million, a 14% increase over the third quarter. The sequential increase was attributable to higher Permian volumes, which resulted in higher system volumes across our integrated NGL business.  Full year 2023 adjusted EBITDA was roughly $3.53 billion, supported by record financial and operational metrics across the company. We spent approximately $2.2 billion on growth capital projects and $223 million in net maintenance capital during 2023, largely in line with our previous estimates.  In November, we successfully completed a $1 billion offering of 6.15% coupon senior notes due 2029 and a $1 billion offering of 6.5% coupon senior notes due 2034. This allowed us to reduce our term loan borrowings by $1 billion and enhance our liquidity position. At the end of the fourth quarter, we had $2.7 billion of available liquidity and our net consolidated leverage ratio was approximately 3.6 times, well within our long-term leverage ratio target range of 3 to 4 times. Also, this morning in an announcement that was made public while we were on this call, S&P has upgraded us to BBB, reflective of the progress we have made to date and our outlook for the future. Turning to our expectations for 2024. We are really excited about that short and longer term outlook. We estimate full year 2024 adjusted EBITDA to be between $3.7 billion and $3.9 billion, an 8% increase over 2023 based on the midpoint of our range, assuming commodity prices of $1.80 per MMBtu for Waha natural gas, $0.65 per gallon for our weighted average NGL barrel and $75 per WTI crude oil barrel.  We expect first quarter 2024 adjusted EBITDA to be lower than fourth quarter 2023 as volumes across our systems were impacted by very cold winter weather, and operating expenses are increasing in anticipation of system expansions across both our segments. We expect quarterly adjusted EBITDA to increase sequentially as we move through the year and benefit from increasing volumes across our systems. We estimate $2.3 billion to $2.5 billion of growth capital spending for 2024, including the vast majority of spending on Greenwood II, Bull Moose, Daytona and Train 10. Our estimate for net maintenance capital spending is about $225 million reflective of our spending in 2023 and the increased assets that our operations teams are managing. We expect to end 2024 with our leverage ratio comfortably within our long-term leverage ratio target range of 3 to 4 times, providing continued flexibility going forward. We are well hedged across all commodities for the balance of 2024 and continue to add hedges for 2025 and beyond. The combination of hedges and fee-based margin across our businesses will continue to provide us with cash flow stability. Our fee floors in our G&P business support our ability to invest across lower commodity price environments while positioning us to benefit from higher commodity prices.  Relative to our full year 2024 financial guidance, a 30% move higher in commodity prices would increase full year adjusted EBITDA by around $165 million, while a 30% decrease would reduce adjusted EBITDA by around $75 million. As Matt described earlier, we also provided you with our current view of 2025 growth capital spending and an illustrative multiyear buildup across a couple of scenarios. We hope these are helpful. Our goal in providing them was to highlight some key points. We believe that there will continue to be strong growth in Permian volumes on our system going forward, which is going to drive incremental volumes through our downstream assets, requiring continued investments, which will continue to be at attractive returns, particularly given our efforts around adding fees and fee floors.  Downstream projects are larger and spending is lumpier. As those projects come online and we benefit from the operating leverage associated with increased available capacity, our growth capital spending moderates as evidenced by our current expectation of $1.4 billion of capital spend in 2025. Across multiple years, we would expect growth capital spend in an environment of continued volume growth to approximate around $1.7 billion. We are bullish Permian growth going forward but are often asked the question, how much capital would it take to maintain volumes? And our answer is approximately $300 million. This is not a scenario that we anticipate. It is merely intended to be instructive and hopefully helpful in demonstrating the strength of the Targa value proposition across the downside scenario, when the strength of our free cash flow generation and balance sheet would leave us very well positioned. Shifting to capital allocation. Our priorities remain the same, which are to maintain a strong investment-grade balance sheet to continue to invest in high-returning integrated projects and to return an increasing amount of capital to our shareholders across cycles.  As Matt described, underpinned by the strength of our business outlook for 2024 and beyond, we plan to recommend to our board a 50% increase in the 2024 annual common dividend, $3 per share, and we expect to be able to grow our dividend meaningfully thereafter. We also expect to remain in a position to continue to execute opportunistically under our common share repurchase program. In 2023, we repurchased a Targa record $374 million of common shares at a weighted average price of $76.72 with $41 million repurchased during the fourth quarter. We had about $770 million remaining under our $1 billion share repurchase program at the end of the fourth quarter. Across our base scenarios, we are continuing to model the ability over time to return 40% to 50% of cash flow from operations to equity holders, providing a framework for thinking through our return of capital proposition looking forward. As it relates to taxes, based on our estimate for earnings and spending and current tax policy, there's no change to our assumptions that we may be subject to the federal minimum tax in 2026 and a full cash taxpayer in 2027. We believe that we continue to offer a unique value proposition for our shareholders and potential shareholders, growing EBITDA, a growing common dividend per share, reducing share count and excellent short, medium and long-term assets -- outlook, excuse me. Our talented team continues to execute on our strategic priorities and safely operate our assets to deliver the energy that enhances our everyday life. And we are very thankful for the efforts of all of our employees. And with that, I will turn the call back over to Sanjay. Good morning, Jeremy. This is Jen. I think that we're really excited about 2025 and the possibilities for Targa and our shareholders. There's really no change to how we are thinking about return of capital. I think part of the excitement that we have around this year, next year and really many years to come is that we believe we offer a really unique value proposition, where we will be in position from a significantly increasing amount of free cash flow to meaningfully increase our common dividends per share and continue to execute under our opportunistic share repurchase program. We published the framework in November that said that we would expect to be in a position to return 40% to 50% of cash flow from operations to our shareholders. And that's what we're modeling. And as we get into 2025 and beyond, that means that there's a lot of incremental capital that can flow to our shareholders. And again, that's really what is underpinning what we think should be a very exciting Targa story for both our company and our shareholders. I think that we're continuing to see a lot of very robust growth on our Permian assets. A couple of important points that I think were mentioned in scripted comments were, one, that by the time that we got to the end of 2023, we actually outpaced our initial expectations for the year. While that growth materialized a little bit more slowly than we expected, it did materialize and ended up exceeding expectations at year-end. What I was trying to highlight was we did experience some extreme winter weather here thus far to start the year, and that will impact our Q1 results. But our operations teams are doing an excellent job of getting our assets back up and running. So as we think about the balance of this year and beyond, I think you've seen our track record that we outperform the expectations for growth out of the Permian Basin on the gas side. And there's nothing that we're seeing that would change that trend in any meaningful way. We didn't give a statistic this year for Permian growth relative to what we've provided previously in the past. One, just because we think that individual operational statistics are less meaningful than some of the high-level corporate information that we give. And I think that our performance in 2023 highlighted that a little bit, right? Our volumes ended up coming in a little bit lower than our initial guidance for the full year average. But again, we exited higher than we initially anticipated. So everything is just really setting up well for our continued execution across both the Midland and the Delaware Basin. And we have a very strong outlook for robust continued growth for as long as we can see. I would just add that, I think, Brian, the conservatism is further highlighted by how highly utilized we think our projects will be that are in progress right now when they come online, which has been really the same playbook that we benefited from over the last many years. It feels like we're just in time on a number of our assets, which is great for the finance person in the room because it means that they're very highly utilized at start-up and provide significant incremental cash flow very quickly. It makes it a little bit tougher for our operations and engineering teams, of course, as they try to plan.  But I think that that's part of the conservatism as well that really is reflective in the 5.5 times versus the realized multiples that you've seen across our footprint. And then I think the very last question in your question was around whether volumes had rebounded as a result of the impact of winter storm. And I'm really proud -- I think we're all really proud of the efforts of our operations teams to get volumes back online. So we're close to back to levels that we were seeing before we experienced the extreme weather. This is Jen. It's actually a mixture of what you talked about but for different reasons. You've seen the percent of our G&P business that is fee-based increase largely as a result of acquisition. When we bought Lucid, primarily underpinning the Lucid contracts that we acquired were largely fee-based contracts. And so we saw a big step change in the increase of fees generated from our G&P business associated with that acquisition. But what our commercial team has been really successful at doing, and I would also like to take my hats off to all of them because it's been just a huge effort that I think has very meaningful implications for our company, is they have gone in and worked with producers to really demonstrate that in order to incentivize Targa to be willing to spend capital. And this goes back to 2020. This is an effort that we have been building on -- building momentum on over the last many, many years. But going back to those conversations, in order for Targa to be willing to continue to invest capital, what you've seen us consistently do over the last many years. We need to make sure that we will get an adequate rate of return in a downside commodity price environment. It's simply just the math. And our producers have been very supportive of that construct. So we've gone into existing POP contracts, and we've been able to restructure those to put the fee floors in place that, again, have incentivized us to continue to spend capital even as commodity prices are lower while not giving up the upside to the extent commodity prices rise. And so it's really been a mix of we've acquired a lot of fee-based assets on the G&P side, and then we've gone in and we've either restructured existing contracts or as new contracts have been put in place by our commercial team, they've been put in place with that fee floor structure while also generating returns across our integrated system.  And the commercial teams have really just done a very good job supporting our producers with what our producers need but under a construct that also works for us to continue to capital. We are pretty borderline right now, whether we would be subject to the AMT in 2026 or 2027. It's actually pretty close. So that -- we're trying to give you a conservative look right now that -- based on our latest forecast we may be subject to the AMT. And then in that scenario, in 2027, we'll have worked our way through our net operating losses and would be fully subject to the statutory tax rate. To the extent the existing bill that -- moving its way through gets passed, and we do see a return of accelerated bonus depreciation, that would be a big help to us. And that may delay things, call it, a year or so based on current forecast. Ultimately, we'd have to see what the final policy is that gets passed, but that would be our early read right now. Thank you. And I'd just add one last point that in the $1.7 billion, we have been spending some capital in the last couple of years on what I call intra-basin Permian residue just to ensure we've got really good redundancy on the residue side between our plants. So to the extent that we're contemplating any of that in the future, that will be included in that $1.7 billion multiyear outlook, but no major projects."

We've said it before and we'll say it again, our number one priority is that gas continues to flow out of the basin so that NGLs can come out of our plants and go down Grand Prix and go across our docks. Last call, I think I talked about the fact that several other projects that fit the parameters that we would want to -- back have raised their heads. And we're working hard on those along with Apex and everything else. So I am -- every month that passes, I get more encouraged by the work we're doing to make sure that a pipe gets built and comes online '26-ish. And I'm confident that something will get done this year, whether that's an Apex or one of the multiple options that we're looking at to increase egress out of the basin."

            "name": "Scott Pryor",
            "content": "Hey, Jeremy, this is Scott. First off, you're right, fourth quarter was a really nice quarter for us with over 13 million barrels per month, which was a combination of both propanes and butanes across the dock. Certainly, a couple of benefits there that we took in -- to our advantage. One was obviously the export expansion project that we had that increased our refrigeration capacity, increased our ability to load vessels faster. And we were able to operate through the -- really the entire fourth quarter, so we got the step up with that. The nighttime transits that were lifted or provided another benefit. So the Houston Ship Channel, along with the Houston pilots, collaborated together to provide that to the industry as a whole. Targa benefited from that as a result of that. I would say that nominally speaking, we think that, that probably provided us about a 5% to 10% benefit. It's difficult to really pin that down because there's a variety of factors that play into that. And on top of that, we were able to benefit from spot activity as a result of those increased liftings. I would like to add that I give a huge thank you to the Houston pilots and the Houston Ship Channel. That provides that change in nighttime transit that they have done very safely, effectively and efficiently, not only benefits Targa, but it really benefits a wide variety of industries along the Houston Ship Channel that help drive Texas economy as well as the U.S. economy. So going forward into 2024, you're right, currently today it is kind of labeled as a trial period. But I think based upon the success that they've had, the safe operating environment that they've been able to conduct themselves under, we view this really as a long-term change. And we will continue to benefit from it. We hope to find other ways to optimize around that as we learn more about the nighttime transits and the vessels that are available to move through that process. Well, what I would say is, I think that in the fourth quarter, it was not -- the nighttime transits were not a part of the entire fourth quarter. It really got instituted in November. And I think that we will hopefully find some better ways to optimize around it, again, as we learn more about the program. So it benefited us now, and we'll continue to see how that fares for us going forward. Yeah. And Matt, I would just add the fact that our West leg, we've shown that we can actually operate that above the 600,000 barrel a day nameplate that we have kind of put out there. So that volume along the West leg, along with volumes that are coming in from the north are all feeding through the 30-inch pipeline. We've got still a lot of operating leverage with the 30-inch pipeline. And certainly, Daytona provides us a lot of operating leverage going forward for periods of time. Neel, this is Scott. I'll start it off and just say that let's -- when we first think about the pipe, recognize that today, we utilize third-party pipes for volumes that are coming into our Belvieu facility today. And when we think about the growth that we have on the G&P side and the Daytona pipeline, we are not out there fighting for fees relative to fill up our existing capacity and our expected capacity that we would have on Daytona. So all of that kind of folds hand-in-hand with the growth that Pat and his team on the G&P side have relative to transportation. Matt alluded to the fact that if there is capacity on industry pipes, we -- again, because we utilize that today, we can always look for opportunities to utilize that to bridge us to whenever we might need to do a loop around our existing system. As it relates to Galena Park, we have a really good idea of what the next expansion project looks like. And it's a variety of factors from adding refrigeration to adding pipe, to adding potential docks and things of that nature. So we're keeping, obviously, a close eye on what that timing needs to be relative to our growth, again, driven by our G&P business. And we'll continue to evaluate that. So I will say, again, the expansion that we had in the fourth quarter that we're benefiting from today, the nighttime transits, both of those really are hand-in-hand expansion projects on their own without having to spend a lot of capital. So we'll continue to look for ways to debottleneck if possible to get incremental capacity as well.  So I think we've got a lot of opportunity and some runway with the existing assets that we have. But we do have space available to expand at Galena Park. Hi, Keith, this is Scott. I would say it's predominantly driven by our G&P footprint as to what we'll be feeding into Daytona. So it is a combination, but I would say the largest proportionate share of that is going to be related to our G&P and the additive of the plants that we've already announced and any potential plants going forward. Yeah. Hey, Michael, this is Scott. We've not defined what the timing would be for that in-service date. Ordering long lead items gives us some flexibility on what that needs to be out into the future. We're just finding that supply chain planning -- or supply chain issues are creating some issues with certain equipment. And so as a result of that, we can take some small capital dollars to ensure that we can hold whatever date we put out there in the future. So we don't have a defined date at this point, but it's certainly something that we want to keep on our radar and keep ahead of."

            "name": "Matt Meloy",
            "content": "Thanks, Sanjay, and good morning. 2023 was another record year for Targa. And I would like to recognize and thank our employees for their focus, dedication and execution throughout the year. Some of our highlights for 2023 include record safety performance; record Gathering and Processing volumes in the Permian; record volumes across our logistics and transportation assets; record adjusted EBITDA of $3.53 billion, a 22% increase over 2022, while also reducing our share count; major projects came online on time, on budget and have been highly utilized since start-up; ended the year with 90% of our G&P volumes fee-based or with fee floor; positive outlook to our current investment-grade ratings with each of the three agencies and the completion of two successful notes offerings; and higher year-over-year return of capital to our shareholders through both an increased common dividend and record common share repurchases. Our performance was particularly strong given Waha natural gas and NGL prices were about 64% and 34% lower year-over-year. And we benefited from margin from fee floors in our Gathering and Processing business across 10 of 12 months, demonstrating our business is more insulated to downside -- to downward commodity prices than ever before. We also exited 2023 with a lot of volume momentum in the Permian. Our December reported inlet averaged 5.5 billion cubic feet per day, a 450 million cubic feet per day improvement from our third quarter average. While our volume ramp materialized later than we forecasted for 2023, we are pleased that we ended the year with December actuals in line with our original guidance expectations for the Permian, providing us with strong momentum in 2024. We expect another year of record financial and operational metrics with full year adjusted EBITDA estimated to be between $3.7 billion and $3.9 billion for 2024.  The significant year-over-year increase in adjusted EBITDA is primarily driven by higher expected Permian Gathering and Processing volumes and higher expected NGL transport fractionation and export volumes. Consensus growth expectations for Permian-associated gas in 2024 is about 9%. And given our track record of outperforming the basin, we are installing over 400 million cubic feet per day of compression in the first half of 2024, which will drive increasing volumes through our downstream assets. We currently estimate between $2.3 billion and $2.5 billion of growth capital spending in 2024 as we bring online two Permian plants, three fractionators in an NGL pipeline while also spending on projects that will come online beyond 2024, including additional Permian plants and fractionation trains. Beyond these projects already announced and under construction, we're also ordering long lead time items for our next Permian plants and frac Train 11 to ensure we keep pace with the significant activity we continue to see. Backed by the strength of our outlook and increasing stability of our cash flows we announced in November an expectation of a 50% year-over-year increase to our annualized 2024 common dividend per share. The increased dividend will be recommended to our board in April for the first quarter of 2024 with payment to shareholders in May.  We also repurchased a record $374 million of common shares in 2023 and continue to be in position to execute on our opportunistic share repurchase program in 2024. Beyond 2024, we really like our positioning driven by a view of cost-advantaged basins like the Permian continuing to be a key supplier of hydrocarbons for decades to come. As we look to 2025, we estimate about $1.4 billion of growth capital spending burdened by the next major projects that are not currently board approved but would be necessary to support continued volume growth, including Train 11 and additional Permian G&P plants.  With increasing EBITDA in 2025 relative 2024 and lower estimated growth capital spending, we expect to generate significant free cash flow in 2025. Also, we included in our presentation slides this morning an illustrative buildup of multiyear average spending that would approximate about $1.7 billion per year. This assumes high single digit gas volume growth in the Permian, requiring us to continue to add infrastructure across our value chain. $1.7 billion of capital spending at a 5.5 times multiple would drive over $300 million of EBITDA growth year-over-year and increasing free cash flow, supporting our ability to continue to return an increasing amount of capital to our shareholders. We also included our estimated spending to maintain volumes currently on our system, which we think is helpful in demonstrating the resiliency of our business. Growth capital spending to maintain existing volumes is estimated at around $300 million annually, which is informed by how quickly we're able to rationalize spending in 2020 and 2021, when we still had strong volume growth across our assets.  In a scenario of $300 million of annual growth capital spend, we would be in a position to utilize significant free cash flow to continue to return capital to shareholders while maintaining a very strong balance sheet.  As we look forward, our excitement is our -- our excitement and our outlook is driven by a few things. First, we have the largest Permian Gathering and Processing footprint in the industry with several million dedicated acres across Midland and Delaware Basins. That, coupled with an integrated NGL system, positions us nicely to generate high return organic opportunities to invest around $1.7 billion annually over a multiyear average, delivering over $300 million of annual EBITDA growth, driving significant free cash flow and positions Targa to continue to meaningfully increase the amount of capital returned to shareholders and deliver significant value to our shareholders over the long term. Let's now discuss our operations in more detail. Starting in the Permian, activity continues to remain strong across our dedicated acreage. Fourth quarter inlet volumes averaged a record 5.3 billion cubic feet per day, an 11% increase when compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. We brought online significant compression across our Midland and Delaware systems during the fourth quarter, driving a 5% sequential increase in volumes. In Permian Midland, our new 275 million a day Greenwood plant, which commenced operations during the fourth quarter, is already highly utilized. Our next Midland plant, Greenwood II, remains on track to begin operations in the fourth quarter of 2024 and is expected to be much needed when it comes online. In the Permian Delaware, activity in volumes across our footprint are also running strong. We brought online our new 275 million a day Wildcat II plant in late fourth quarter, and it's already highly utilized. Our Roadrunner II and Bull Moose plants remain on track to begin operations in the second quarters of 2024 and 2025, respectively. As mentioned earlier, we are ordering long lead time items for our next Permian plants to support continued production growth across our footprint. Shifting to our Logistics and Transportation segment. Targa's NGL pipeline transportation volumes were a record 722,000 barrels per day, and fractionation volumes were a record 845,000 barrels per day during the fourth quarter. Our Grand Prix NGL pipeline deliveries into Mont Belvieu increased 9% sequentially as we benefited from increased supply from our Permian G&P systems and higher third-party volumes. The outlook for NGL supply growth from our G&P footprint and third parties remains robust, and our Daytona NGL pipeline expansion will be much needed to handle growth from our system. We have obtained all required permits and have commenced construction on Daytona. We now expect the pipeline to begin operations ahead of schedule in early fourth quarter of this year, assuming favorable weather conditions. Our fractionation complex in Mont Belvieu continues to operate near capacity. And we expect our Train 9 fractionator to be highly utilized when it commences operations during the second quarter of 2024. The restart of GCF will also provide much-needed capacity when it is fully online during the second quarter of 2024. Our Train 10 fractionator is also expected to be much needed given the anticipated growth in our G&P business and corresponding plan additions and remains on track for the first quarter of 2025.  As mentioned earlier, also ordering long lead items for Train 11 support continued production growth across our footprint. In our LPG export business at Galena Park, our loadings were a record 13.3 million barrels per month during the fourth quarter as we benefited from our recently completed expansion, strong market conditions and the Houston Ship Channel allowance of nighttime transits for larger vessels, providing strong momentum for 2024. Before I turn the call over to Jen to discuss fourth quarter results in more detail as well as our expectations for 2024, I would like to extend a second thank you to the Targa team for their continued focus on safety and execution while continuing to provide best-in-class service and reliability to our customers. Hey, good morning, Jeremy. Yeah. It's still early, Jeremy. So I think we're thinking 5% to 10% is a good -- kind of a good range of upside right now, but it's still pretty early. Yeah, yeah. I think what I'd say is we feel really good about our position coming out of '24 going into '25. I think '25 is going to set up very well. I think we see significant EBITDA growth in '25, and frankly, beyond '25.  We guided 2.3 to 2.5 of CapEx this year. We were about 2.2 last year. So the kind of 5.5 times investment multiple is a multiyear average. It's not -- you spend a set amount in one year so it results in EBITDA in that year. It's a multiyear average that we think we can do, call it, 5 to 6 times EBITDA on our CapEx. So when you kind of look at what we spent the last couple of years, I think it just sets up for a very strong 2025. We decided not to give EBITDA guidance for '25, but just kind of point you to our historical spending and just the overall volume trajectory that we're seeing across our footprint is just going to set up very nice for us in '25. Sure. No, good question. I mean, really, historically, you go back years, we kind of said 5 to 7 times build multiple is kind of what we targeted. We've been able to do better than that. I think that was just kind of some cushion in that 5 to 7. If you look back at the last five years, we've really been kind of closer to a 4 times build multiple. We've had really good volume growth across our system. And the Permian, Grand Prix filled up much quicker even than our expectations, which just drove the returns even higher.  So I think we've really had some strong performance. But I'd say there's really nothing fundamentally different in what we're investing in this year and next year, go forward than what we invested in, in the past where we did have a lower investment multiple. I'd say perhaps there's a little bit of conservatism put into that number. But it's not -- there's not a large delta from commodity prices one way or the other. I'd say we have more commodity price upside given the fee floors that Jen and we've talked about, which could drive that lower if we get some commodity price tailwinds. Okay. I'll start and then Pat can probably touch on a little bit of this, too. I think when you look at our Permian growth for the year, we really feel good about where we're starting the year. December was our highest month, and it really just sets us up for really good production growth just where we exited 2023 going into '24. So even with relatively modest growth from here, we're going to see a really strong year-over-year. And that's why we've said consensus is about 9%. We've typically beat that. But even if we get anywhere around high single digits or a little bit better, I think it sets us up very well, not only for '24 'but 25. And then I'll let Pat speak a little bit to kind of the M&A landscape from our E&P customers. Yeah. And just to add to that, too, the other part of your question was around gas quality and trading. A lot of the -- we are spending a lot of capital, and we spent last year and this year 4 additional treating facilities primarily in the Delaware Basin. We're putting in some additional treaters to handle both CO2 and H2S, and we're drilling multiple wells to handle that as gas injection wells and pipelines and connectivity to handle that. So I think that really positions us nicely as the Delaware continues to grow and gas quality becomes another issue that the producer are going to have to deal with, we'll be in a really good position to handle that. And most of that capital will be in or the large -- the lion's share of it will be in kind of by the end of this year. Yeah. So as we think about '24 and then going into '25, we're ordering some long lead time, have some spending for Train 11, which will both be in '24 and '25. And then we also mentioned there's additional plants, call it, two plants, maybe one in the Delaware, one in the Midland, of additional ordering long lead time and in kind of our base assumption that we're going to need to start spending capital on this going to have '24 and '25 budget.  So that's kind of what we have in our budget right now. Sure, if there's even more production growth in the Permian, could that move that plant timing up a little bit? It could move it up a little bit. If it's perhaps on the lower end of the growth ranges, could we push those out? Yeah, we could push that out a little bit. Really, the big sensitivities to our CapEx does -- it really tends to be more on the downstream side. Are we going to need -- when is the next fractionator? What about -- Daytona's coming on, should give us some good runway from an NGL perspective. But when will you need more transportation and then export? Those are the larger projects that can be a bit lumpier. So I think '25, a lot of that up and down really could just be around our G&P business and some of the plant timing and related field capital. Yeah. We've been making steady progress on getting more fee-based components, primarily fee floors but also just fee-based G&P business, over the last several years. Our commercial team really did a fantastic job in 2023. And I would say there was a step-change in just the number of contracts that we were able to get redone. So no, it was a step-change late in '23, which significantly changed our overall downside risk profile and is done.  So now we're estimating 90%. You see that on our commodity price sensitivity. We still have some length. So there is some downside if prices moved down. But relative to our overall size of 30% downside, $60 million, $70 million, that's not much sensitivity. That is fundamentally different than where we were really 12-24 and certainly 36 months ago. Okay, thank you. Yeah. Sure. Good question. So I would say the primary delta from the 1.4 to 1.7 is downstream spending, having multiple fractionation facilities and that's really more this year. But really the delta between 1.4 and 1.7 is primarily downstream. One of the larger projects that we don't have any meaningful spending on next year is transportation, another NGL pipe. We have Daytona coming on this year. That's going to provide us some good runway. So then how much runway that provides really depends on what the overall growth rate in the Permian and our capture of those NGL barrels to move on to Daytona. So that is something we're thinking about. These pipes take a couple of years to get billed, probably even a little bit longer than that. So we had to look out two-three years and say, when do we need to think about looping that 30-inch segment. There's also available transport out there from some of our competitors. So we can move -- I think we'll move the lion's share of our volumes on our own pipe. There can be transportation agreements that can be had with some of our competitors as well. So really, for us, all options are on the table, whether it's us building a 30-inch down the road or utilizing some excess capacity from some other NGL pipes. Okay, thank you. Yeah. I mean we see growth in the Delaware, but we see significant growth in the Midland as well. So we see growth across both of our footprints, really active producers in both. So on our footprint, we see growth in the Midland and we see growth in the Delaware. Thank you. Yeah. Sure. Yeah. As we think about really from G&P all the way through our dock, we want to make sure we have the capacity to handle the volumes coming from our G&P footprint. And so that's kind of how we think about staging transportation, fractionation. And that goes for export as well. We want to make sure we have a good market for propane and butanes. As Scott mentioned, that's really what we export. So with the expansion that just came on and the nighttime allowance of kind of, call it, 5% to 10%, I think that gives us some cushion as we go forward. And as we see really how much capacity that nighttime opens up for us, that gives us some good cushion before we're going to need another export project. But we are already looking at scoping. And so the timing is kind of to be determined, but do we need refrigeration, do we need a pipeline, are we looking at dock. But those projects are not the really large-scale, I'd say, greenfields or brownfield. I kind of view those as more debottlenecking. You have one pinch point, you spend a couple of hundred million dollars and you get some excess capacity, then you do the next and then you do the next.  So those are the things we're kind of looking at over the longer term. But yeah, we want to make sure we can handle the volumes coming across our system. Yeah. I mean we have the issues we talked about last year was really just kind of being behind on our -- getting the compression all said and getting that done last year. We had a lot of compression come on late last year, and then you saw our volumes in Q4 really move up. We have another talked about $400 million of compression. So we ordered that out about a year right now for compressors. So we tried to get ahead of it as we saw we were getting behind last year. We just approved another AFE the other day to order some more inventory to try and get ahead of it and stay for 2025.  So part of that does depend on volume growth. When you see a lot of volumes, if it exceeds our forecast, you can end up having some pinch points. But we're trying to be smart, look at the forecast and stay ahead of it. I have not heard any change in lead times. Okay, thank you. Yeah. No. And then, Michael, on the CapEx part, that is not included in the 1.4. In any project that goes, we'll evaluate does it make sense for us to be a partner. So for a partner in it that would increase that CapEx. There's also some of these pipes that will be project financed for the majority of the capital. So any amount of equity we were to put into it would be relatively small, so it may or may not be project financed. But that is not included in the -- in our outlook. Yeah, thanks, Michael."

And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Matt.\nMatt Meloy: Thanks, Sanjay and good morning. We are very proud of the efforts of our employees across the third quarter. While battling an extended stretch of hot weather, we continued to operate at a high level, demonstrated by record NGL pipeline transportation volumes, 6% higher sequential adjusted EBITDA and completion of our expansion at our LPG export facility in Galena Park, increasing our propane loading capacity by an incremental one million barrels per month. We also continue to return an increasing amount of capital to our shareholders in the quarter with 132 million of common share repurchases. Since the end of the third quarter, positive momentum continues across our organization highlighted by the commencement of operations, of our new Greenwood plant in Permian Midland ahead of schedule and on budget. The expected rebound in our Permian volumes with current reported inlet about 150 million cubic feet per day higher than our third quarter average, publishing our annual sustainability report, demonstrating our continued progress across ESG pillars as an operator of critical natural gas and NGL infrastructure, receiving a two-notch upgrade in our ESG rating from MSCI to AA and the announcement today that we expect to recommend to our board, an increase to the 2024 annual common dividend to $3 per share, a 50% increase over the 2023 dividend level. The strength of our operational and financial outlook has resulted in consistent questions from investors and potential investors around how Targa will return additional capital to shareholders going forward, which is why, we wanted to provide some clarity today around our expectations for our 2024 common dividend and our current thoughts around our return of capital framework. We believe that we offer a unique value proposition for investors given the strength of our outlook for annual increases in adjusted EBITDA reflective of an excellent integrated asset footprint that will continue to provide high return organic investment opportunities, increasing fee-based margin and cash flow stability from our continued progress around fee floor contracts in our G&P business, a strong credit and ESG ratings profile, demonstrating our commitment to a stable balance sheet and sustainable operations, continued opportunistic share repurchases further reducing our share count, a competitive common dividend with an expectation of meaningful best-in-class annual growth looking forward. And an outlook of significantly increasing free cash flow as some of our large fractionation and NGL transportation projects come online in 2024 and early 2025. Our return of capital strategy is informed by a lot of internal and external information including leverage and balance sheet flexibility, along with our positioning relative to our midstream peers S&P Energy and broader S&P 500. Across our base scenarios we are modelling the ability to return 40% to 50% of adjusted cash flow from operations to equity holders. This is not a target or a bright line as we place a high priority on flexibility, but it is a framework that we believe can be helpful in thinking through our return of capital -- our return of capital proposition going forward. Let's now discuss our operations in more detail. Starting in the Permian, high activity levels continue across our dedicated acreage despite lower-than-expected third quarter volumes largely driven by the extended periods of heat across New Mexico and Texas. We also had about 200 million cubic feet per day of lower-margin high-pressure volumes move off our system in the Delaware Basin. Our Permian Midland volumes increased 2% sequentially and were offset by reduced Permian Delaware volumes resulting in flat Permian inlet volumes. Through the first three quarters of this year average reported inlet volumes across our system have increased over 300 million cubic feet per day in comparison to average fourth quarter 2022. Our Permian volumes are currently operating at about 150 million cubic feet per day higher than our third quarter average, as the growth we expected to see a bit earlier in the year is now materializing in the fourth quarter. In Permian Midland our new 275 million a day Greenwood plant commenced operations in October and is quickly ramping up, a big thank you to our engineering and operations team for bringing Greenwood online safely ahead of schedule and on budget despite challenging operating conditions this past summer. Our next plant in the Midland, Greenwood II remains on track to begin operations in the fourth quarter of 2024 and is expected to be much needed when it comes online. In Permian Delaware activity and volumes across our footprint are also running strong. Our Wildcat II and Roadrunner II plants remain on track to begin operations in the first and second quarters of 2024 respectively and both plants are expected to be much needed at start-up. In our Central region and the Badlands our combined Natural Gas volumes increased 2% sequentially and our systems are performing well. Shifting to our Logistics and Transportation segment Targa's NGL pipeline transportation volumes were a record 660,000 barrels per day and fractionation volumes remained strong averaging 793,000 barrels per day during the third quarter. Our Grand Prix NGL pipeline deliveries into Mont Belvieu increased 6% sequentially as we benefited from higher third-party supply volumes. Our fractionation complex in Mont Belvieu continues to operate near capacity. The restart of GCF will provide much needed capacity when it is fully restarted late in the first quarter of 2024 and we continue to expect our Train nine fractionator to be highly utilized when it commences operations during the second quarter of 2024. Our Train 10 fractionator is also expected to be much needed given the anticipated growth in our G&P business and corresponding plant additions and remains on track for the first quarter of 2025. In our LPG export business at Galena Park, our loadings increased 15% sequentially due to improved market conditions. We loaded an average of 10.7 million barrels per month of LPGs during the third quarter even though our loading capability was reduced for part of the quarter, due to a previously disclosed required 10-year inspection. Our low-cost expansion project to increase our propane loading capabilities by an incremental one million barrels per month of capacity was completed at the end of the third quarter and we expect our loadings to ramp during the fourth quarter providing strong momentum for 2024. We are excited about the long-term outlook at Targa and remain focused on continuing to execute on our strategic priorities.  Before I turn the call over to Jen, to discuss our third quarter results in more detail I would like to extend a thank you to the Targa team for their continued focus on safety and execution while continuing to provide best-in-class service and reliability to our customers.\nJen Kneale: Thanks Matt. Good morning everyone. Targa's reported quarterly adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter was $840 million a 6% increase over the second quarter. Sequential increase was attributable to higher system volumes across our integrated NGL businesses higher commodity prices partially offset by higher operating and G&A expenses. With three quarters of the year completed, we are tracking towards the lower end of our 2023 adjusted EBITDA range of $3.5 billion to $3.7 billion, but believe that our performance through a lower commodity price environment and a tough operating environment relative to our guidance assumptions is reflective of the significant progress that we have made adding fee floors to our G&P business, our successful hedging program and the resiliency of our operations. For a good part of this year, we have benefited from margin associated with fee floor contracts as natural gas and NGL prices were below fee floor levels. We believe that 2023 provides an example of the financial durability of our business in a lower commodity price environment and the benefits of the fee floor structure where we retain upside if commodity prices move higher. We are well hedged across all commodities for the balance of the year and continue to add hedges for 2024 and beyond. Through three quarters we have spent approximately $1.6 million on growth capital projects and our current estimates for balance of year spending lead us towards the higher end of our $2 billion to $2.2 billion range. Our net maintenance capital spending is tracking a little bit higher than initial expectations and our current estimate for 2023 is approximately $200 million. At the end of the third quarter, we had $1.8 billion of available liquidity and our pro forma net leverage ratio is approximately 3.7 times, well within our long-term leverage ratio target range of three to four times. Shifting to capital allocation. Our priorities remain the same, which are to maintain a strong investment grade balance sheet to continue to invest in high-returning integrated projects and to return an increasing amount of capital to our shareholders across cycles. Our major projects in progress are core to our business. For new Permian gas processing plants, Train 9 and Train 10 fractionators and our Daytona NGL pipeline, and while we continue to project 2024 growth capital spend to approximate spending levels similar to 2023, spending in 2025 is expected to be meaningfully lower as we will have completed the lumpier expansions in our downstream business. As Matt described underpinned by the strength of our business outlook for 2024 and beyond, we plan to recommend to our Board a 50% increase to the 2024 annual common dividend to $3 per share and we expect to be able to grow the annual common dividend meaningfully thereafter. We also expect to remain in a position to continue to execute opportunistically under our common share repurchase program. During the third quarter, we repurchased $132 million of common shares at a weighted average price of $83.38 and have repurchased $333 million year-to-date through September. We had about $811 million remaining under our $1 billion share repurchase program at the end of the third quarter. We remain excited about the long-term outlook at Targa. Our talented team continues to execute on our strategic priorities and safely operate our assets to deliver the energy that enhances our everyday lives. And with that I will turn the call back over to Sanjay.\nSanjay Lad: Thanks Jen. For the Q&A session, we kindly ask that you limit to one question and one follow-up and reenter the lineup if you have additional questions. Brittney, would you please open the line for Q&A?\nOperator: Yes, thank you. At this time, we will conduct the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Theresa Chen with Barclays. Your line is now open.\nTheresa Chen: Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. It's great to see a very strong dividend increase in your new capital return framework, really a capital accountability framework if anything. Can you talk about your view of dividend growth within all this, how did you arrive at the 50% increase over 2023? Is there a yield you would like to achieve? And how you generally plan to balance dividend growth with share repurchases within that new 50% cash from ops framework while maintaining a healthy balance sheet?\nJen Kneale: Good morning, Theresa, this is Jen. As we said in our scripted remarks, the most consistent question that we've gotten from investors and especially potential investors is related to how we intend to return capital to our investors. And we believe that we've got a really strong story there when we think about where we are today and where we are going forward. Clearly this morning, you can see that we've got significant conviction in the underlying strength of our business as evidenced by our continued activity under our share repurchase program. Our return on capital strategy begins with numerous multiyear scenarios, and hopefully it's becoming more evident that increasing G&P fees and fee floors, are really positioning us to be able to invest in the business to support the activities of our upstream producers despite a lower Waha and NGL environment which are meaningful to us while also increasing our cash flow stability and resiliency across lower commodity price environments. So as we look out across multiple years, we've got the flexibility to return an increasing amount of our adjusted cash flow from operations to shareholders. And that's where we're saying that we think we're in position over multi years to return call it 40% to 50% of CFFO. It's not a bright line as we certainly continue to balance and really prioritize balance sheet strength and flexibility. But I do think it's part of how we're thinking about the world and it's important for us to provide a little bit more transparency around how Targa and our Board of Directors look at the dividend. Beyond that we start to look at our peers broader S&P Energy and S&P 500 and how they're returning capital and then Targa's relative positioning across all of that. And all of that is really at the end of the day informing a return of capital strategy that we believe can maximize shareholder value. We've been very transparent since we instituted the program in October of 2020 that we want to have an opportunistic share repurchase program. And hopefully we are demonstrating a track record of activity when given that opportunity. As we look forward and move through time. We'll have to see what the opportunities present themselves in the market and that will ultimately balance the approach to dividends and repurchases. But I think this is an important indication that clearly we are in a position to return more capital to shareholders. And can do that through a stable and meaningfully growing dividend and then also can continue to supplement that with opportunistic repurchases. It continues to be that all of the above approach, but I think you're really seeing us execute on.\nTheresa Chen: Thank you. And on the topic of the continued volume growth, just with the recent announcements of upstream consolidation in the Permian, especially the news related to your Midland JV partner and anchor shipper. What do you think this all means for Targa in terms of volume growth trajectory and the duration of the resource underlying your acreage?\nMatt Meloy: Yes, sure. Hi Theresa, this is Matt. With the announcements we've seen recently, they are consistent with the previous announcements, we have really good relationships with the parties involved in those transactions. So whether you're talking about Exxon or Chevron or others, we have good relationships and really growing relationships with them. We handle a lot of their volumes today. And as we think about it at least in the short-term, we have contracts in place with all those parties mentioned. And so those contracts are typically long-term contracts. So we'll just have to see how it plays out over time. We think the outlook for growth in the Permian Basin continues to be very strong. When you look at some of those parties mentioned they have pretty robust growth outlook. So I think over the longer term, I think we're optimistic on what it ultimately means for our underlying business. But we'll just have to kind of see how that plays out. I think it's going to play out over time.\nTheresa Chen: Thank you.\nMatt Meloy: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you so much. One moment for our next question please. All right. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Blum with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.\nMichael Blum: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I wanted to just ask about your views now on the trajectory of Permian volume growth. I just wanted to understand that the third quarter, would you say these were just really temporary operational issues? Are you seeing any real material change in producer activity which would drive a change in the slope of future growth?\nMatt Meloy: Yes. Hey, Michael. Yes, good question. We're seeing strong growth from the Permian. So talking about Midland first and then will get on Delaware. Really the Midland volumes are tracking in line with our guidance that we gave at the beginning of the year. Continued strong growth is really on track and we've seen that even ramp here in the fourth quarter. So it really kind of comes into the Delaware. We did have 200 million a day kind of roll off in between Q2 and Q3 when you kind of look at the averages. Now that was -- we knew that was going to happen so that was factored in to our guidance. But that just does illustrate we had underlying growth in the third quarter. But it's not quite enough to offset the $200 million that was rolling off. We're seeing a lot of activity in the Delaware. We've got a lot of compression that we're adding frankly it's coming in a little bit later than we had thought we were going to have it in place at the beginning of the year. We've got 200 million a day scheduled to come online between now and year-end. So, it's just coming in a little bit later but the volumes are there. We're frankly still a little bit behind and trying to catch up and be there to handle all the volumes. But the underlying outlook I think we're very confident that Permian volumes are going to continue to grow both in the Midland side and on the Delaware side not just for Q4, but as you look out 2024, 2025, and beyond.\nMichael Blum: Great. No, that's perfect. And then that actually just ties into my second question which is as I'm sure you're aware you and many others have announced NGL pipeline takeaway expansions. And so it's clearly getting pretty competitive. So, just wondering how should we think about your contracted position in that market? You obviously had the 200 roll off this quarter. Is there any other major roll-offs to flag in the future? And just in general how are you thinking about your contracted position.\nScott Pryor: And specifically to the Grand Prix pipeline Michael?\nMichael Blum: Yes.\nScott Pryor: Okay. This is Scott. Sorry I just wanted to clarify. When we look the quarter -- the third quarter, we had some volume improvements that came across in the quarter. Those were predominantly third-party volumes. Our upstream volumes as Matt indicated we're relatively flat on the quarter. But we continue to see volume growth overall. As we look into 2024 and really in the fourth quarter and into 2024, we would expect those volumes to continue both from our upstream growth as well as some third-party volumes that will roll on to us as contracts mature into their in the beginning. With Daytona pipeline coming online in the fourth quarter of next year we feel very comfortable with the timing of that relative to the volume growth that we will have and we've seen a number of announcements in the marketplace obviously off late. But the operating leverage that we get with Daytona coming online for our West leg the operating leverage we have on our pipeline moving into Mont Belvieu gives us a lot of runway. That runway will allow us to basically evaluate what it looks like with our volume growth whether or not there's opportunities to move on other people's pipes as our volumes grow. So, we've got a lot of time to evaluate what that looks like over time.\nMichael Blum: Great. Thank you.\nMatt Meloy: Thanks Michael.\nOperator: Thank you so much. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Reynolds with UBS. Your line is now open.\nMatt Meloy: Hey Brian.\nSanjay Lad: We can't hear anything. I don't know if anyone else can.\nOperator: Hello Mr. Reynolds?\nSanjay Lad: Brittney would you go ahead and to the next person in the Q&A please?\nOperator: Yes, we will. Our next line comes -- I'm sorry our next question comes from the line of Spiro Dounis with Citi. Your line is now open.\nSpiro Dounis: Thanks operator. Good morning guys. Maybe just going back to maybe coming back to NGL pipeline volumes quickly. You guys hit record levels this quarter third-party volumes are coming on to the system. But still a lot of time before Daytona comes online. So, just to between now and Daytona any chance you guys could be offloading volumes? Do you feel like you're pretty secure on that front?\nScott Pryor: Spiro, this is Scott again. We feel comfortable. I would say that from time to time where we've seen maintenance on the pipeline or managing the start-up of our pump stations along Grand Prix on the West side as well as on the south side. We have from time to time taking the availability of industry capacity where necessary to offload. But with the start-up of pump stations those getting fully energized that gives us a long runway going into 2024. We'll certainly, evaluate what that looks like, but we feel comfortable that with the timing of the ramp-up of the volumes how we can facilitate offloads where it may be necessary that we'll look forward to Daytona coming online in the fourth quarter of next year.\nMatt Meloy: And just to add to that too of the 660 that we moved barrels per day, most of that is from the Permian but there's still a significant amount of that is coming in from the North -- like kind of from the North Texas, Oklahoma segment. We can move call it up to when all the pump stations get on 650-ish maybe low 600s in terms of barrels per day from the West leg. So, we still have some running room between now and when Daytona comes on.\nSpiro Dounis: Okay. Yes. So, thanks Matt. That's helpful color. And switching gears a bit to [indiscernible] seems like a real bright spot once again with the ARB open. Just wonder, if you can just give us a sense of what that looks like today for you guys. You're passing inspection now. You've got the new capacity online. I imagine that's going pretty well.\nScott Pryor: Yes. Our volumes in the third quarter certainly benefited from increased demand and improved spot opportunities. We were very pleased, with the quarter-to-quarter volume improvement that we saw despite obviously, having to work around the planned outage for required inspections and the completion of our export expansion project. Now, with that expansion project online, we are already seeing benefits of that and we'd expect to see that end in through the fourth quarter. So our volumes in the fourth quarter, we would expect them to be equal to or better than what we saw in the third quarter as the ARB opportunities have improved. First and foremost, we're going to make sure that we're performing for our term contracts and taking advantage of spot opportunities that we can squeeze into our lineup relative to the schedule as we optimize around the facility. We are still learning quite frankly, what the full capabilities will be of this expansion and we will continue to look for ways to optimize in and around that moving forward through the fourth quarter and into 2024.\nSpiro Dounis: Helpful color. I\u2019ll leave it there. Thanks, team.\nMatt Meloy: Okay. Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you so much. Please standby for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Keith Stanley with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.\nQ \u2013 Keith Stanley: Hi. Good morning. First, -- Hi Matt. Just are any of the -- I want to make sure any of the constraint issues you saw in Q3 expected to have a sustained impact going forward? Or do you view this as a onetime event and we should see a good bounce back in Q4. I just want to make sure there's an expectation that, this was kind of a onetime thing and there's no lingering kind of issues that could pop-up in future quarters?\nMatt Meloy: And I guess, are you referring to the volumes in the G&P side on the Delaware or?\nQ \u2013 Keith Stanley: Yes, that's, right. Just G&P volumes and what you referred to in the quarter.\nMatt Meloy: It's I think part of it goes back to when we made the acquisition last year of Lucid, there was a lot of growth on the system. And we were immediately, offloading a lot of volumes on to Targa. And frankly, it was just kind of behind out in the field laying pipelines and getting compression and it's about a year, wait time to get more compression. So we were frankly, just a little bit more behind than we want it to be and those volumes are coming in a little bit later in the year. I don't want to make it sound like come 30 days everything is fixed. We're adding a lot of compression, but we're going to be adding a lot of compression next year too. So we are trying to handle and resolve the pressure issues that we're seeing out in the Delaware, out in the field. We're going to be adding a lot of compression not only in this quarter, but next quarter and throughout next year. So part of that was exacerbated because of the heat and operational issues and upsets that we had. So, we're really trying to address and kind of get ahead of where the producers are going. So Pat, anything you want to add to that?\nPat McDonie: Well, I think we showed the level of confidence in what we think our volume is going to be. We've got two plants under construction, in the process of clearing a third plant site. And we're not building because, we don't think the volume growth is there certainly through the producer discussions that we have and what we're seeing getting done and as Matt alluded to, we're behind getting compression in place, et cetera. Some of the producers lag a few weeks, there's equipment delays, et cetera. So I would look at the third quarter's anomaly. Certainly, when you walk into a winter you don't know what weather expectations and what impact that has on production. But I think the key answer there is the underlying business is solid. The activity levels are high and we have a lot of confidence as indicated by what we're investing in the Delaware for future volume growth.\nKeithStanley: That's helpful. Second I just want to clarify the capital return framework. So 40% to 50% of operating cash flow to equity holders, which could be buybacks and dividends. It sounds like the frameworks effectively allows the company to meet its growth objectives and still keep you in that leverage target of three to four times overall. I'm asking just because it seems -- it just feels like a pretty big step change. You have this 50% dividend hike and 40% to 50% would also imply a pretty big step-up in buybacks as well. So just want to make sure I'm understanding that right.\nJen Kneale : Keith, this is Jen. I think what we're trying to do is just provide some visibility into some of the target specific metrics that we look at. If you look at our LTM return of capital as a percent of cash flow from operations here over the last 12 months, you'll see that we're lower than peers lower than the S&P 500 lower than the S&P Energy average. And so part of this is indicating we've had really strong total return performance and believe that we will have strong total return performance going forward, which is really based on the value proposition that we think we provide, significant EBITDA growth continued ability to return and high return organic growth capital projects. And because of that and having a strong balance sheet the ability to also return more capital to shareholders. So one of the big questions we get is, well, how much more and what does that look like and how are you thinking about it? And that's why we're really trying to articulate that this isn't a bright line and this isn't a we must. It's really just instructive as we look out over our multiyear forecast across a number of different scenarios. That's one of the important elements or quantitative metrics that we are looking at. And I think as we think about a multiyear framework so 2024, 2025, 2026, 2027, 2028 five-year planning horizon we look across those multiple years and believe that it's reasonable to say that we will have the business that could support returning that much capital to shareholders and ultimately we've made one decision that we've announced today which says this is our expectation that we'll recommend dividend to our Board for approval effective the first quarter of 2024, and then we'll continue to evaluate. But it is one of the important metrics that I think we are looking at to inform how we believe we can return capital over multiple years.\nKeith Stanley: Got it. Thank you.\nJen Kneale : Thank you.\nMatt Meloy : Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you so much. One moment for our next question please. Our next question comes from the line of Tristan Richardson with Scotiabank. Your line is now open.\nTristan Richardson : Hey, good morning guys. I may have missed it in the prepared remarks, but can you talk about any updates you're seeing broadly in the market on the gas solutions side maybe how that market has evolved since you first planted a flag with your potential solution? And then maybe any updates on commercial development of your specific project?\nBobby Muraro : Hi. This is Bobby. So what I'd tell you is the message around APEX and the effort on APEX and residue solutions for the Permian Basin does not change for Targa. Our priority is to make sure that solutions for the Basin get built. We've talked about a solution needed in the 2026-ish time frame, which is why we have been pushing at APEX. And I'd say, why we've been pushing APEX. It's really been a group of investment-grade counterparties shippers and markets that has driven the design of that. But what I'd tell you is that some of the changes, which are positive is there, I think are multiple options that have started to come to fruition maybe be too strong of a word, but opportunities for other solutions. And at the end of the day, Targa has one priority and that's to make sure that the gas gets out of the basin. So whether it ends up being APEX or another pipe and whether we -- they need our help to back another pipe or not that's where we'll be is to make sure that pipe gets built or APEX get built or something gets built for the 2026 time frame. Again, if APEX goes it will be, because it's in a framework that works for us and works for the counterparties that are out there. But if APEX doesn't go we stand ready to make sure another solution goes in 2026 and that the Basin has that takeaway such that gas can continue to flow in our plants and NGLs down our integrated system.\nTristan Richardson: Appreciate that context, Bobby. And then I know we've just now gotten the export expansion online. But as we think about Daytona and third-party volumes coming into the frac, do you see the export market starting to tighten up? And then does your capacity today really allow for headroom assuming a reasonable utilization of Daytona once we've been ramping on that asset late in 2024 and into 2025.\nScott Pryor: Hi, Tristan. This is Scott. Yes, I would say that today the market feels tight. We were very pleased with the timing of our most recent export expansion coming online because we are seeing benefits. And again as I stated earlier we will continue to look for ways to optimize around that capacity and better ways to facilitate movements across the dog. So we're very pleased with that being online. With that said, as we look to as we look at further expansions at our facility, we continuously explore opportunities in the form of small projects or debottlenecking projects at our Galena Park facility that will provide meaningful capacity improvements while being capital efficient. We are very fortunate to have an existing facility today that we have a lot of runway to add projects to that are very capital efficient that will provide us capabilities moving forward. So we'll continue to watch the volume growth in and through our system and we'll time those various projects accordingly. But again we're very fortunate to already have an existing facility that we can kind of bolt on to very effectively.\nTristan Richardson: Appreciate it, Scott. Thank you, guys and congrats on the capital allocation plan.\nScott Pryor: Okay. Thank you.\nMatt Meloy: Thank you.\nOperator: All right. Thank you so much. Please standby for our next question everyone. Our next question comes from the line of Neel Mitra or Mitra -- I apologize, with Bank of America. Your line is now open. \nNeel Mitra: Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Matt, I think, you alluded to 200 million cubic feet rolling off in the New Mexico, Delaware. I know there's another probably smaller contract roll off in 2024. Can you speak to the dynamics in that area just because it's so competitive are competitors kind of undercutting you on price to try to win some acreage dedications? Or is kind of the Red Hills complex just so big that some producers want to diversify away and have a few players versus a very big concentrated player in the area?\nMatt Meloy: Yes, sure. Good question. Let me just clarify. I think I did say roll off. It's really contracted volumes that we have coming to us that it was really contracted for it to move. And we're not losing to third-party midstream. That's not where that went. So Bobby do you want to?\nBobby Muraro: Yes, this is Bobby. For clarity a producer own plant came online and that 200 million a day move to that producer own plan. And when that plant goes up we get more debt. So it's part of our planning all along. And it's -- contracts didn't change, contracts didn't expire, contracts didn't roll off producer plant that takes no third-party gas came online.\nMatt Meloy: And so -- and the reason we're highlighting the 200 million is just because we were down 75 million quarter-to-quarter. So there was an underlying 125 million of growth from the quarter kind of why we see strength. We see growth in that business. It was just contractually as Bobby said it moved off the system.\nPat McDonie: And frankly we're backfilling high-pressure low-margin gas with low-pressure higher-margin gas which is kind of what our bread and butter, right?\nNeel Mitra: Yes. Perfect. And then maybe just a follow-up on potential Apex opportunities. Could you maybe book end the spend you would look at just in terms of 2025 being a lower CapEx year than 2024. And kind of the maximum you would be willing to undertake in that investment for Apex if needed would you be the operator, would you take a small equity interest? How would you go about looking about that to keep the capital down?\nMatt Meloy: Yeah, sure. I'll -- let me kind of start here and then if others want to jump in. Yeah, I think Apex or I'd say the next pipe out of the Permian is going to likely be a joint venture between either multiple midstreams, midstream and producers. So there will be a partial ownership so if we participate in something we could have an ownership interest in the JV or we could move volumes on it, and frankly not have an ownership interest if it gets a pipe done. So I'd say, the book-end and the low end, if we could be putting no capital into the next pipeline. I think we'd like to have our options open where we could have an ownership interest. We've seen that that creates value for Targa. GCX is a good example. We own 25% we invested in it and then ultimately monetize it. So I think we're trying to be open to opportunities like that that give us the ability to invest in that project and whether we end up holding it, whether we operate it, what percentage level, those are all discussions and it depends on which pipe ends up going whether it is Apex or it is another pipe led by someone else. As Bobby said, our primary focus is getting a pipe build where our ownership is, and what -- and how we would finance that, if we project finance it, it would be very little capital out the door right? So we have all those options to us. I think as we look forward on our capital spend as Jen has mentioned in the past is, we see 2024 in being kind of in a similar area and we see 2025 spending coming down. I think the trajectory of our capital should be kind of down once we get past 2024, and we'll look to kind of optimize how much spending and how that all works in that framework.\nNeel Mitra: Okay. Perfect. Thanks for the answer.\nMatt Meloy: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you so much. Please standby for our next question. All right. Our next question comes from the line of Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan Securities LLC. Your line is now open.\nJeremy Tonet: Hi. Good morning.\nMatt Meloy: Hey, good morning, Jeremy.\nJeremy Tonet: So with the caveat upfront granted you're not giving 2024 guidance here and you've talked about a number of moving pieces talked about, I think some volume trends and maybe the LPG outlook. But just wondering, if there's any other big moving pieces that we should think about when we're shaping our 2024 thoughts from where we sit. And maybe just at a high level how you see Targa's EBITDA growth being able to trend organically from where you are -- would Targa largely track kind of Permian growth trends in general? Or are there other kind of pieces to the puzzle we should think about?\nMatt Meloy: Hey, Jeremy good question. As we look out into 2024, I think we're optimistic that not only 2024 is going to be -- have good EBITDA growth of 2025 and beyond. And it's really just kind of the timing as you mentioned what's that shaping going to look like. I think, it does for us start in the Permian G&P business. What volumes are moving through both the Delaware and the Midland that's going to provide the more volumes into NGL transport fractionation and available for export. So, I think, it's kind of starts with what is overall Permian look like. And I think we see a pretty strong outlook for 2024, 2025 and really five-plus years, I'd say 5 to 10 years and even longer on the gas side. So I think short term it looks good and longer term it looks good. I'd say the only other thing to think about is we do have a lot of fractionation coming on in 2024. We have GCF coming on at the end of the quarter. We'll have Train 9 and then Train 10. So that's an outsized amount of fractionation relative to just kind of normal volume growth that we're seeing. We have the export expansion just done. I think we're set up well for exports in 2024. But ultimately, it kind of comes back to Permian gathering and processing growth will be the primary driver.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. That makes sense there. And you talked about upstream consolidation earlier in the call and just want to shift the focus towards midstream. We have seen a bit of an uptick in consolidation in the industry. And just wondering, from where Targa sits right now do you feel comfortable with, I guess, how the business is right now? Or do you see -- how do you see Targa's rule I guess in industry consolidation going forward at this point?\nMatt Meloy: Yeah, sure. I'd say where -- I think we said is our internal business prospects look very good. We have a very good case just to continue to operate in our core business. Gathering and Processing in the Permian largest G&P footprint in the Permian Basin is going to afford us multiple years of growth. So I think we just sit in a very fortunate position to just focus on Targa. We're going to invest in G&P. We're going to invest in transport like we are with Daytona, invest in fractionation. We're being in three fractionators on and continue to invest in export. So in terms of us looking at bolt-ons or tack-ons, I think that's really kind of far down our capital priority list. I think we want to execute on the organic growth projects we have in front of us and then increase and then distribute an increasing amount of that to our shareholders as Jen talked about and up 40% to 50% over time. It's not in any one exact year, but we see being able to do all of those things distribute 40% to 50% lower our leverage invest in our business. So I think we're focused on Targa right now and just executing our plan in front of us.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. Makes sense. That\u2019s helpful. I\u2019ll leave it there.\nMatt Meloy: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: All right. Thank you so much. One moment for our next question please. Our next question comes from the line of Sunil Sibal with Seaport Global. Your line is now open.\nSunil Sibal: Yeah. Hi. Good morning, everybody, and thanks for taking my question. So my first question related to some of the operational issues et cetera in the third quarter that you talked about. In addition to I think the weather and compression some of the operators have also talked about higher CO2 concentration in the gas streams. I believe that's an issue Targa is pretty familiar with. So I was curious, how do you handle that going forward? And also, does it kind of accelerate your CO2 sequestration solution?\nPat McDonie: This is Pat. CO2 wasn't really a major contributor to operational issues for us in the third quarter. We have a lot of capabilities and are adding capabilities to handle CO2 and frankly H2S sour gas. We do see CO2 production growing in the Delaware Basin specifically. There are a lot of producers that do things at the wellhead that are capital inefficient and expensive for them to do. So as we move forward, we are putting infrastructure in place that allows us to handle handling high CO2 volumes, sequestering CO2, dealing with sour gas H2S and other components, but as far as the operational issues I mean, you hit it. It's weather a little late on compression, residue gas pipeline issues which is more felt in the Delaware because we don't quite have the system fungibility in the Delaware that we do in Midland. We're building that infrastructure, as you can see from our capital spend. We've gotten a lot of benefit from integrating our Northern Delaware or Lucid system with our other two Delaware systems. But over time, when we have issues on specific plant sites and/or compressor sites will have that fungibility where we can move gas around and keep production flowing. It's a little more exacerbated right now. And as we move forward that will get better. So that's kind of where we're at right now and it looks better forward.\nBobby Muraro: And then this is Bobby. On the CO2 sequestration side, we've been pushing a bunch of projects forward. I think people have seen public filings relative to MRP plans that are already in place and wells that we have permitted out there. And that continues to move forward. That -- those businesses are not predicated on an increasing amount of CO2 being in the stream. But to your point and/or question, if the concentrations do come up over time, that would be additive to the CO2 business. We expect to start getting 45Q this coming year. And again, over time composition starts to go up in the CO2 stream and we've already got those assets and wells and injection capability in place that will just up the 45Q credits and profitability of that business that were put together.\nSunil Sibal: Okay. Thanks for that. And then on the capital allocation front, thanks for providing that clarity. I was just curious now that you put some guardrails around that does that impact also your targeted returns on investments? I know previously we talked about 5x to 7x kind of multiples. Does that range change in any way with the guardrails that you're putting around?\nJen Kneale: I think that we have a lot of organic growth capital investment opportunities at higher returns as we look out across our footprint. That's part of why the fee floor structure has been so important allowing us to continue to invest to support our producers' activities even in lower and across lower commodity price environment. So as we look forward, I wouldn't say that, anything that we've described today around return of capital is changing how we think about investments or investment opportunities. We've described it as a multiyear approach, where we believe we can distribute call it 40% to 50% of cash flow from operations. But ultimately, we'll be assessing everything across the business including balance sheet, stability, organic growth opportunities, everything that is involved in a Targa forecast and then sensitivities of those forecasts to ultimately drive the return of capital decisions each year. But that's one of the ways that we're certainly thinking about it.\nSunil Sibal: Got it. Thanks for the time.\nMatt Meloy: Thank you.\nJen Kneale: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you so much. Please standby for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Neal Dingmann with Truist Securities.\nJake Nivasch: This is Jake Nivasch on for Neal. Thanks for the question. I just had one quick one here. Just strategically, I know given how all these fee-based contracts have been ramping up for you guys over the past several years. Just at a high level, I'm just curious do you feel now that you're in a good state as a percent of your contracts being fee-based? Or should we expect a little bit more of a ramp going forward? Have you \u2013 if you can quantify that that would be great. But really just thinking strategically, where are we at with that kind of transition here. Thank you.\nMatt Meloy: Yes, so this is Matt. And then Jen, if you want to add on. Yes we've made a lot of progress at adding or really having fee-based growth in both our G&P business and our downstream business but also putting in fee-based floors and components into our G&P business as contracts come up. Yes, as you look at really through this year, where we've had fee floors and those hybrid contracts we are kind of at or below the floors. So as you think about just kind of earnings power going forward, most of those are at or below. And so as we get some tailwind, if we get some tailwinds from commodity prices that would just be upside. But on those fee floor contracts there's not a lot of downside from here. So we think we're in a good spot.\nJen Kneale: And I'd just add that our commercial team has done a great job of putting ourselves in a position to continue to invest for producers by getting those fee floors in place. But ultimately, if commodity prices are higher and our percentage of fee margin is going down from our gathering and processing business because commodity prices are higher. I think that will be a huge win for us and our shareholders and that's one of the reasons that we really like the fee floor structure. Ultimately, where we'd like to get to is having fee floors and really all of our gathering and processing contracts or have them be fee-based because that combined with our fee-based downstream business just provides us with a lot more cash flow stability across commodity price environment. So ultimately, that's sort of the direction that we're heading in. And our teams have done a great job of pushing us towards that.\nJake Nivasch: Got it. Thank you. If I could just squeeze one more in and I know we've touched on this a few times but I just want to clarify something. So the compression issues that you guys have seen it sounds like things have improved \u2013 but does that mean \u2013 because things have been delayed and I know you guys mentioned, you have a good amount coming in 2024 as well. Does that mean the delays pushed back the initial 2024 orders? Or should we just expect I guess more of an acceleration or just a little bit more in 2024, given these delays here. Just trying to get clarification here.\nMatt Meloy: Yes, I mean for the most part those have been ordered. Part of it was delivery delays. So I don't know that the CapEx it shifts \u2013 necessarily shift all that much. We're just really constantly kind of buying compressors and adding to inventory. So there's some flex there but it just does take some time there. And then one thing to note too, as we're kind of waiting on those compression delays, we're still coordinated for the most part with our producers such that we can capture the initial production from there. So we're working with them to make sure we're there for the IP and that we're getting that production. So it's not really lost it's just kind of deferred and pushed into other periods.\nJake Nivasch: Yeah. That's makes sense. Okay. That's it for me. Thank you, guys.\nJen Kneale: Take care.\nMatt Meloy: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you so much. [Operator Instructions] All right. Our final question comes from the line of Brian Reynolds with UBS. Your line is now open.\nSanjay Lad: Good morning, Brian. We can't hear you.\nBrian Reynolds: Hello. Can you hear me?\nMatt Meloy: Yeah. There you go, Brian.\nSanjay Lad: Yeah. There you are. We can hear you.\nBrian Reynolds: Okay. Thank you. I'm sorry about that this morning. Just a follow-up on the Permian, at this point it seems like Targa is not close to its potential full integration of GMP assets to NGL long haul at this point. So I know basically all the Midland volumes make it downstream on the Targa integrated system. But could you talk about maybe the process Delaware volumes that are -- that are not being transported on Targa downstream is it like roughly 50%? And kind of how should we think about those volumes rolling on to Targa's long-haul system on 2024 or 2025 to kind of get to that 100% number.\nMatt Meloy: Yeah. Sure. I mean, I'd say we have a lot of our G&P business is pointing liquids into our downstream business. I don't know that we ever get to 100%. That's not really a goal. There's going to be some amount of volumes that are going on third-party pipes. The vast majority on the Midland side move, but it's not 100% on the Midland side. And in the Delaware, I'd say it's a majority, but because of some acquisitions and just legacy dedications onto other pipes that's going to take time. But as we grow, I'd say, a disproportionate amount of the growth is tied to target. And I think that's going to continue. So I think we have a majority out there. I see that number moving north just as you go -- as we go forward. But I think we're in a really strong position of capturing the majority of volumes across the Permian and moving those into the downstream assets.\nBrian Reynolds: Great. Thanks. And as a follow-up I know you talked about CapEx a little bit but kind of curious if you could help sensitize us a little bit if we think about G&P capital three processing plants and perhaps the need for frac 11, as we look ahead of 2025 how would that look to 2024? Is it 1.5, 1.7 or something like that? And then, ultimately ethane exports is very intriguing part of the business an NGL value chain at this point seems to be getting more competitive based on announced projects. Is there an opportunity for Targa to participate as we look to the middle to end of the decade? Thanks.\nMatt Meloy: Yeah. I think on CapEx we pointed to with Daytona multiple fractionation trains we see 2024 being kind of similar-ish levels which I'd characterize as kind of higher than a normal run rate levels because the downstream projects are a bit lumpier. So that's why we have some confidence as we get into 2025 and beyond potentially having urgent 2025 having it be lower and then maybe a more normalized rate thereafter. As you look at ethane exports there's, a number of expansions and parties that do that. That is something we have talked about in the past. We have the capability to do that. Right now what we're really focused on is increasing our connectivity to the domestic pet chem market and flexibility to other I'd say just other customers for ethane demand. I'd say that's -- it's out there. We don't -- I wouldn't put that on the front of our list of something we are looking at right now but that is on the potential that we kind of keep on the list.\nScott Pryor: Yeah. And I would just add Matt this is Scott. That -- again Matt alluded to the fact, we are continuously improving our deliverability out of our system to the domestic petrochemical operators in and around Mont Belvieu and the surrounding area. So that will be a primary focus as we see volume growth continue over the course of the next several years. And given the increase in ethane consumption with those petrochemical plants we believe we'll get a large proportion of that just based upon our own upstream growth and into our assets.\nBrian Reynolds: Great. Thanks. Appreciate all the colour and have a excellent morning.\nSanjay Lad: Okay. Thank you.\nJen Kneale: Thanks Brian.\nOperator: All right. Thank you so much for that. This concludes the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn it back to Sanjay Lad for closing remarks.\nSanjay Lad: Thanks to everyone that was on the call this morning. And we appreciate your interest in Targa Resources. The IR team will be available for any follow-up questions you have. Have a great day.\nOperator: Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Pat McDonie",
            "content": "Well, I think we showed the level of confidence in what we think our volume is going to be. We've got two plants under construction, in the process of clearing a third plant site. And we're not building because, we don't think the volume growth is there certainly through the producer discussions that we have and what we're seeing getting done and as Matt alluded to, we're behind getting compression in place, et cetera. Some of the producers lag a few weeks, there's equipment delays, et cetera. So I would look at the third quarter's anomaly. Certainly, when you walk into a winter you don't know what weather expectations and what impact that has on production. But I think the key answer there is the underlying business is solid. The activity levels are high and we have a lot of confidence as indicated by what we're investing in the Delaware for future volume growth. And frankly we're backfilling high-pressure low-margin gas with low-pressure higher-margin gas which is kind of what our bread and butter, right? This is Pat. CO2 wasn't really a major contributor to operational issues for us in the third quarter. We have a lot of capabilities and are adding capabilities to handle CO2 and frankly H2S sour gas. We do see CO2 production growing in the Delaware Basin specifically. There are a lot of producers that do things at the wellhead that are capital inefficient and expensive for them to do.

            "name": "Jen Kneale",
            "content": "Thanks Matt. Good morning everyone. Targa's reported quarterly adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter was $840 million a 6% increase over the second quarter. Sequential increase was attributable to higher system volumes across our integrated NGL businesses higher commodity prices partially offset by higher operating and G&A expenses. With three quarters of the year completed, we are tracking towards the lower end of our 2023 adjusted EBITDA range of $3.5 billion to $3.7 billion, but believe that our performance through a lower commodity price environment and a tough operating environment relative to our guidance assumptions is reflective of the significant progress that we have made adding fee floors to our G&P business, our successful hedging program and the resiliency of our operations. For a good part of this year, we have benefited from margin associated with fee floor contracts as natural gas and NGL prices were below fee floor levels. We believe that 2023 provides an example of the financial durability of our business in a lower commodity price environment and the benefits of the fee floor structure where we retain upside if commodity prices move higher. We are well hedged across all commodities for the balance of the year and continue to add hedges for 2024 and beyond. Through three quarters we have spent approximately $1.6 million on growth capital projects and our current estimates for balance of year spending lead us towards the higher end of our $2 billion to $2.2 billion range. Our net maintenance capital spending is tracking a little bit higher than initial expectations and our current estimate for 2023 is approximately $200 million. At the end of the third quarter, we had $1.8 billion of available liquidity and our pro forma net leverage ratio is approximately 3.7 times, well within our long-term leverage ratio target range of three to four times. Shifting to capital allocation. Our priorities remain the same, which are to maintain a strong investment grade balance sheet to continue to invest in high-returning integrated projects and to return an increasing amount of capital to our shareholders across cycles. Our major projects in progress are core to our business. For new Permian gas processing plants, Train 9 and Train 10 fractionators and our Daytona NGL pipeline, and while we continue to project 2024 growth capital spend to approximate spending levels similar to 2023, spending in 2025 is expected to be meaningfully lower as we will have completed the lumpier expansions in our downstream business. As Matt described underpinned by the strength of our business outlook for 2024 and beyond, we plan to recommend to our Board a 50% increase to the 2024 annual common dividend to $3 per share and we expect to be able to grow the annual common dividend meaningfully thereafter. We also expect to remain in a position to continue to execute opportunistically under our common share repurchase program. During the third quarter, we repurchased $132 million of common shares at a weighted average price of $83.38 and have repurchased $333 million year-to-date through September. We had about $811 million remaining under our $1 billion share repurchase program at the end of the third quarter. We remain excited about the long-term outlook at Targa. Our talented team continues to execute on our strategic priorities and safely operate our assets to deliver the energy that enhances our everyday lives. And with that I will turn the call back over to Sanjay. Good morning, Theresa, this is Jen. As we said in our scripted remarks, the most consistent question that we've gotten from investors and especially potential investors is related to how we intend to return capital to our investors. And we believe that we've got a really strong story there when we think about where we are today and where we are going forward. Clearly this morning, you can see that we've got significant conviction in the underlying strength of our business as evidenced by our continued activity under our share repurchase program. Our return on capital strategy begins with numerous multiyear scenarios, and hopefully it's becoming more evident that increasing G&P fees and fee floors, are really positioning us to be able to invest in the business to support the activities of our upstream producers despite a lower Waha and NGL environment which are meaningful to us while also increasing our cash flow stability and resiliency across lower commodity price environments. So as we look out across multiple years, we've got the flexibility to return an increasing amount of our adjusted cash flow from operations to shareholders. And that's where we're saying that we think we're in position over multi years to return call it 40% to 50% of CFFO. It's not a bright line as we certainly continue to balance and really prioritize balance sheet strength and flexibility. But I do think it's part of how we're thinking about the world and it's important for us to provide a little bit more transparency around how Targa and our Board of Directors look at the dividend. Beyond that we start to look at our peers broader S&P Energy and S&P 500 and how they're returning capital and then Targa's relative positioning across all of that. And all of that is really at the end of the day informing a return of capital strategy that we believe can maximize shareholder value. We've been very transparent since we instituted the program in October of 2020 that we want to have an opportunistic share repurchase program. And hopefully we are demonstrating a track record of activity when given that opportunity. As we look forward and move through time. We'll have to see what the opportunities present themselves in the market and that will ultimately balance the approach to dividends and repurchases. But I think this is an important indication that clearly we are in a position to return more capital to shareholders. And can do that through a stable and meaningfully growing dividend and then also can continue to supplement that with opportunistic repurchases. It continues to be that all of the above approach, but I think you're really seeing us execute on. Keith, this is Jen. I think what we're trying to do is just provide some visibility into some of the target specific metrics that we look at. If you look at our LTM return of capital as a percent of cash flow from operations here over the last 12 months, you'll see that we're lower than peers lower than the S&P 500 lower than the S&P Energy average. And so part of this is indicating we've had really strong total return performance and believe that we will have strong total return performance going forward, which is really based on the value proposition that we think we provide, significant EBITDA growth continued ability to return and high return organic growth capital projects. And because of that and having a strong balance sheet the ability to also return more capital to shareholders. So one of the big questions we get is, well, how much more and what does that look like and how are you thinking about it? And that's why we're really trying to articulate that this isn't a bright line and this isn't a we must. It's really just instructive as we look out over our multiyear forecast across a number of different scenarios. That's one of the important elements or quantitative metrics that we are looking at. And I think as we think about a multiyear framework so 2024, 2025, 2026, 2027, 2028 five-year planning horizon we look across those multiple years and believe that it's reasonable to say that we will have the business that could support returning that much capital to shareholders and ultimately we've made one decision that we've announced today which says this is our expectation that we'll recommend dividend to our Board for approval effective the first quarter of 2024, and then we'll continue to evaluate. But it is one of the important metrics that I think we are looking at to inform how we believe we can return capital over multiple years. Thank you. I think that we have a lot of organic growth capital investment opportunities at higher returns as we look out across our footprint. That's part of why the fee floor structure has been so important allowing us to continue to invest to support our producers' activities even in lower and across lower commodity price environment. So as we look forward, I wouldn't say that, anything that we've described today around return of capital is changing how we think about investments or investment opportunities. We've described it as a multiyear approach, where we believe we can distribute call it 40% to 50% of cash flow from operations. But ultimately, we'll be assessing everything across the business including balance sheet, stability, organic growth opportunities, everything that is involved in a Targa forecast and then sensitivities of those forecasts to ultimately drive the return of capital decisions each year. But that's one of the ways that we're certainly thinking about it. Thank you. And I'd just add that our commercial team has done a great job of putting ourselves in a position to continue to invest for producers by getting those fee floors in place. But ultimately, if commodity prices are higher and our percentage of fee margin is going down from our gathering and processing business because commodity prices are higher. I think that will be a huge win for us and our shareholders and that's one of the reasons that we really like the fee floor structure. Ultimately, where we'd like to get to is having fee floors and really all of our gathering and processing contracts or have them be fee-based because that combined with our fee-based downstream business just provides us with a lot more cash flow stability across commodity price environment. So ultimately, that's sort of the direction that we're heading in. And our teams have done a great job of pushing us towards that. Take care. Thanks Brian."

            "content": "Hi. This is Bobby. So what I'd tell you is the message around APEX and the effort on APEX and residue solutions for the Permian Basin does not change for Targa. Our priority is to make sure that solutions for the Basin get built. We've talked about a solution needed in the 2026-ish time frame, which is why we have been pushing at APEX. And I'd say, why we've been pushing APEX. It's really been a group of investment-grade counterparties shippers and markets that has driven the design of that. But what I'd tell you is that some of the changes, which are positive is there, I think are multiple options that have started to come to fruition maybe be too strong of a word, but opportunities for other solutions. And at the end of the day, Targa has one priority and that's to make sure that the gas gets out of the basin. So whether it ends up being APEX or another pipe and whether we -- they need our help to back another pipe or not that's where we'll be is to make sure that pipe gets built or APEX get built or something gets built for the 2026 time frame. Again, if APEX goes it will be, because it's in a framework that works for us and works for the counterparties that are out there. But if APEX doesn't go we stand ready to make sure another solution goes in 2026 and that the Basin has that takeaway such that gas can continue to flow in our plants and NGLs down our integrated system. Yes, this is Bobby. For clarity a producer own plant came online and that 200 million a day move to that producer own plan. And when that plant goes up we get more debt. So it's part of our planning all along. And it's -- contracts didn't change, contracts didn't expire, contracts didn't roll off producer plant that takes no third-party gas came online. And then this is Bobby. On the CO2 sequestration side, we've been pushing a bunch of projects forward. I think people have seen public filings relative to MRP plans that are already in place and wells that we have permitted out there. And that continues to move forward. That -- those businesses are not predicated on an increasing amount of CO2 being in the stream. But to your point and/or question, if the concentrations do come up over time, that would be additive to the CO2 business. We expect to start getting 45Q this coming year. And again, over time composition starts to go up in the CO2 stream and we've already got those assets and wells and injection capability in place that will just up the 45Q credits and profitability of that business that were put together."

            "name": "Scott Pryor",
            "content": "And specifically to the Grand Prix pipeline Michael? Okay. This is Scott. Sorry I just wanted to clarify. When we look the quarter -- the third quarter, we had some volume improvements that came across in the quarter. Those were predominantly third-party volumes. Our upstream volumes as Matt indicated we're relatively flat on the quarter. But we continue to see volume growth overall. As we look into 2024 and really in the fourth quarter and into 2024, we would expect those volumes to continue both from our upstream growth as well as some third-party volumes that will roll on to us as contracts mature into their in the beginning. With Daytona pipeline coming online in the fourth quarter of next year we feel very comfortable with the timing of that relative to the volume growth that we will have and we've seen a number of announcements in the marketplace obviously off late. But the operating leverage that we get with Daytona coming online for our West leg the operating leverage we have on our pipeline moving into Mont Belvieu gives us a lot of runway. That runway will allow us to basically evaluate what it looks like with our volume growth whether or not there's opportunities to move on other people's pipes as our volumes grow. So, we've got a lot of time to evaluate what that looks like over time. Spiro, this is Scott again. We feel comfortable. I would say that from time to time where we've seen maintenance on the pipeline or managing the start-up of our pump stations along Grand Prix on the West side as well as on the south side. We have from time to time taking the availability of industry capacity where necessary to offload. But with the start-up of pump stations those getting fully energized that gives us a long runway going into 2024. We'll certainly, evaluate what that looks like, but we feel comfortable that with the timing of the ramp-up of the volumes how we can facilitate offloads where it may be necessary that we'll look forward to Daytona coming online in the fourth quarter of next year. Yes. Our volumes in the third quarter certainly benefited from increased demand and improved spot opportunities. We were very pleased, with the quarter-to-quarter volume improvement that we saw despite obviously, having to work around the planned outage for required inspections and the completion of our export expansion project. Now, with that expansion project online, we are already seeing benefits of that and we'd expect to see that end in through the fourth quarter. So our volumes in the fourth quarter, we would expect them to be equal to or better than what we saw in the third quarter as the ARB opportunities have improved. First and foremost, we're going to make sure that we're performing for our term contracts and taking advantage of spot opportunities that we can squeeze into our lineup relative to the schedule as we optimize around the facility. We are still learning quite frankly, what the full capabilities will be of this expansion and we will continue to look for ways to optimize in and around that moving forward through the fourth quarter and into 2024. Hi, Tristan. This is Scott. Yes, I would say that today the market feels tight. We were very pleased with the timing of our most recent export expansion coming online because we are seeing benefits. And again as I stated earlier we will continue to look for ways to optimize around that capacity and better ways to facilitate movements across the dog. So we're very pleased with that being online. With that said, as we look to as we look at further expansions at our facility, we continuously explore opportunities in the form of small projects or debottlenecking projects at our Galena Park facility that will provide meaningful capacity improvements while being capital efficient. We are very fortunate to have an existing facility today that we have a lot of runway to add projects to that are very capital efficient that will provide us capabilities moving forward. So we'll continue to watch the volume growth in and through our system and we'll time those various projects accordingly. But again we're very fortunate to already have an existing facility that we can kind of bolt on to very effectively. Okay. Thank you. Yeah. And I would just add Matt this is Scott. That -- again Matt alluded to the fact, we are continuously improving our deliverability out of our system to the domestic petrochemical operators in and around Mont Belvieu and the surrounding area. So that will be a primary focus as we see volume growth continue over the course of the next several years. And given the increase in ethane consumption with those petrochemical plants we believe we'll get a large proportion of that just based upon our own upstream growth and into our assets."

            "name": "Matt Meloy",
            "content": "Thanks, Sanjay and good morning. We are very proud of the efforts of our employees across the third quarter. While battling an extended stretch of hot weather, we continued to operate at a high level, demonstrated by record NGL pipeline transportation volumes, 6% higher sequential adjusted EBITDA and completion of our expansion at our LPG export facility in Galena Park, increasing our propane loading capacity by an incremental one million barrels per month. We also continue to return an increasing amount of capital to our shareholders in the quarter with 132 million of common share repurchases. Since the end of the third quarter, positive momentum continues across our organization highlighted by the commencement of operations, of our new Greenwood plant in Permian Midland ahead of schedule and on budget. The expected rebound in our Permian volumes with current reported inlet about 150 million cubic feet per day higher than our third quarter average, publishing our annual sustainability report, demonstrating our continued progress across ESG pillars as an operator of critical natural gas and NGL infrastructure, receiving a two-notch upgrade in our ESG rating from MSCI to AA and the announcement today that we expect to recommend to our board, an increase to the 2024 annual common dividend to $3 per share, a 50% increase over the 2023 dividend level. The strength of our operational and financial outlook has resulted in consistent questions from investors and potential investors around how Targa will return additional capital to shareholders going forward, which is why, we wanted to provide some clarity today around our expectations for our 2024 common dividend and our current thoughts around our return of capital framework. We believe that we offer a unique value proposition for investors given the strength of our outlook for annual increases in adjusted EBITDA reflective of an excellent integrated asset footprint that will continue to provide high return organic investment opportunities, increasing fee-based margin and cash flow stability from our continued progress around fee floor contracts in our G&P business, a strong credit and ESG ratings profile, demonstrating our commitment to a stable balance sheet and sustainable operations, continued opportunistic share repurchases further reducing our share count, a competitive common dividend with an expectation of meaningful best-in-class annual growth looking forward. And an outlook of significantly increasing free cash flow as some of our large fractionation and NGL transportation projects come online in 2024 and early 2025. Our return of capital strategy is informed by a lot of internal and external information including leverage and balance sheet flexibility, along with our positioning relative to our midstream peers S&P Energy and broader S&P 500. Across our base scenarios we are modelling the ability to return 40% to 50% of adjusted cash flow from operations to equity holders. This is not a target or a bright line as we place a high priority on flexibility, but it is a framework that we believe can be helpful in thinking through our return of capital -- our return of capital proposition going forward. Let's now discuss our operations in more detail. Starting in the Permian, high activity levels continue across our dedicated acreage despite lower-than-expected third quarter volumes largely driven by the extended periods of heat across New Mexico and Texas. We also had about 200 million cubic feet per day of lower-margin high-pressure volumes move off our system in the Delaware Basin. Our Permian Midland volumes increased 2% sequentially and were offset by reduced Permian Delaware volumes resulting in flat Permian inlet volumes. Through the first three quarters of this year average reported inlet volumes across our system have increased over 300 million cubic feet per day in comparison to average fourth quarter 2022. Our Permian volumes are currently operating at about 150 million cubic feet per day higher than our third quarter average, as the growth we expected to see a bit earlier in the year is now materializing in the fourth quarter. In Permian Midland our new 275 million a day Greenwood plant commenced operations in October and is quickly ramping up, a big thank you to our engineering and operations team for bringing Greenwood online safely ahead of schedule and on budget despite challenging operating conditions this past summer. Our next plant in the Midland, Greenwood II remains on track to begin operations in the fourth quarter of 2024 and is expected to be much needed when it comes online. In Permian Delaware activity and volumes across our footprint are also running strong. Our Wildcat II and Roadrunner II plants remain on track to begin operations in the first and second quarters of 2024 respectively and both plants are expected to be much needed at start-up. In our Central region and the Badlands our combined Natural Gas volumes increased 2% sequentially and our systems are performing well. Shifting to our Logistics and Transportation segment Targa's NGL pipeline transportation volumes were a record 660,000 barrels per day and fractionation volumes remained strong averaging 793,000 barrels per day during the third quarter. Our Grand Prix NGL pipeline deliveries into Mont Belvieu increased 6% sequentially as we benefited from higher third-party supply volumes. Our fractionation complex in Mont Belvieu continues to operate near capacity. The restart of GCF will provide much needed capacity when it is fully restarted late in the first quarter of 2024 and we continue to expect our Train nine fractionator to be highly utilized when it commences operations during the second quarter of 2024. Our Train 10 fractionator is also expected to be much needed given the anticipated growth in our G&P business and corresponding plant additions and remains on track for the first quarter of 2025. In our LPG export business at Galena Park, our loadings increased 15% sequentially due to improved market conditions. We loaded an average of 10.7 million barrels per month of LPGs during the third quarter even though our loading capability was reduced for part of the quarter, due to a previously disclosed required 10-year inspection. Our low-cost expansion project to increase our propane loading capabilities by an incremental one million barrels per month of capacity was completed at the end of the third quarter and we expect our loadings to ramp during the fourth quarter providing strong momentum for 2024. We are excited about the long-term outlook at Targa and remain focused on continuing to execute on our strategic priorities.  Before I turn the call over to Jen, to discuss our third quarter results in more detail I would like to extend a thank you to the Targa team for their continued focus on safety and execution while continuing to provide best-in-class service and reliability to our customers. Yes, sure. Hi Theresa, this is Matt. With the announcements we've seen recently, they are consistent with the previous announcements, we have really good relationships with the parties involved in those transactions. So whether you're talking about Exxon or Chevron or others, we have good relationships and really growing relationships with them. We handle a lot of their volumes today. And as we think about it at least in the short-term, we have contracts in place with all those parties mentioned. And so those contracts are typically long-term contracts. So we'll just have to see how it plays out over time. We think the outlook for growth in the Permian Basin continues to be very strong. When you look at some of those parties mentioned they have pretty robust growth outlook. So I think over the longer term, I think we're optimistic on what it ultimately means for our underlying business. But we'll just have to kind of see how that plays out. I think it's going to play out over time. Okay. Thank you. Yes. Hey, Michael. Yes, good question. We're seeing strong growth from the Permian. So talking about Midland first and then will get on Delaware. Really the Midland volumes are tracking in line with our guidance that we gave at the beginning of the year. Continued strong growth is really on track and we've seen that even ramp here in the fourth quarter. So it really kind of comes into the Delaware. We did have 200 million a day kind of roll off in between Q2 and Q3 when you kind of look at the averages. Now that was -- we knew that was going to happen so that was factored in to our guidance. But that just does illustrate we had underlying growth in the third quarter. But it's not quite enough to offset the $200 million that was rolling off. We're seeing a lot of activity in the Delaware. We've got a lot of compression that we're adding frankly it's coming in a little bit later than we had thought we were going to have it in place at the beginning of the year. We've got 200 million a day scheduled to come online between now and year-end. So, it's just coming in a little bit later but the volumes are there. We're frankly still a little bit behind and trying to catch up and be there to handle all the volumes. But the underlying outlook I think we're very confident that Permian volumes are going to continue to grow both in the Midland side and on the Delaware side not just for Q4, but as you look out 2024, 2025, and beyond. Thanks Michael. Hey Brian. And just to add to that too of the 660 that we moved barrels per day, most of that is from the Permian but there's still a significant amount of that is coming in from the North -- like kind of from the North Texas, Oklahoma segment. We can move call it up to when all the pump stations get on 650-ish maybe low 600s in terms of barrels per day from the West leg. So, we still have some running room between now and when Daytona comes on. Okay. Thank you. And I guess, are you referring to the volumes in the G&P side on the Delaware or?\nQ \u2013 Keith Stanley: Yes, that's, right. Just G&P volumes and what you referred to in the quarter. It's I think part of it goes back to when we made the acquisition last year of Lucid, there was a lot of growth on the system. And we were immediately, offloading a lot of volumes on to Targa. And frankly, it was just kind of behind out in the field laying pipelines and getting compression and it's about a year, wait time to get more compression. So we were frankly, just a little bit more behind than we want it to be and those volumes are coming in a little bit later in the year. I don't want to make it sound like come 30 days everything is fixed. We're adding a lot of compression, but we're going to be adding a lot of compression next year too. So we are trying to handle and resolve the pressure issues that we're seeing out in the Delaware, out in the field. We're going to be adding a lot of compression not only in this quarter, but next quarter and throughout next year. So part of that was exacerbated because of the heat and operational issues and upsets that we had. So, we're really trying to address and kind of get ahead of where the producers are going. So Pat, anything you want to add to that? Thank you. Thank you. Yes, sure. Good question. Let me just clarify. I think I did say roll off. It's really contracted volumes that we have coming to us that it was really contracted for it to move. And we're not losing to third-party midstream. That's not where that went. So Bobby do you want to? And so -- and the reason we're highlighting the 200 million is just because we were down 75 million quarter-to-quarter. So there was an underlying 125 million of growth from the quarter kind of why we see strength. We see growth in that business. It was just contractually as Bobby said it moved off the system. Yeah, sure. I'll -- let me kind of start here and then if others want to jump in. Yeah, I think Apex or I'd say the next pipe out of the Permian is going to likely be a joint venture between either multiple midstreams, midstream and producers. So there will be a partial ownership so if we participate in something we could have an ownership interest in the JV or we could move volumes on it, and frankly not have an ownership interest if it gets a pipe done. So I'd say, the book-end and the low end, if we could be putting no capital into the next pipeline. I think we'd like to have our options open where we could have an ownership interest. We've seen that that creates value for Targa. GCX is a good example. We own 25% we invested in it and then ultimately monetize it. So I think we're trying to be open to opportunities like that that give us the ability to invest in that project and whether we end up holding it, whether we operate it, what percentage level, those are all discussions and it depends on which pipe ends up going whether it is Apex or it is another pipe led by someone else. As Bobby said, our primary focus is getting a pipe build where our ownership is, and what -- and how we would finance that, if we project finance it, it would be very little capital out the door right? So we have all those options to us. I think as we look forward on our capital spend as Jen has mentioned in the past is, we see 2024 in being kind of in a similar area and we see 2025 spending coming down. I think the trajectory of our capital should be kind of down once we get past 2024, and we'll look to kind of optimize how much spending and how that all works in that framework. Okay. Thank you. Hey, good morning, Jeremy. Hey, Jeremy good question. As we look out into 2024, I think we're optimistic that not only 2024 is going to be -- have good EBITDA growth of 2025 and beyond. And it's really just kind of the timing as you mentioned what's that shaping going to look like. I think, it does for us start in the Permian G&P business. What volumes are moving through both the Delaware and the Midland that's going to provide the more volumes into NGL transport fractionation and available for export. So, I think, it's kind of starts with what is overall Permian look like. And I think we see a pretty strong outlook for 2024, 2025 and really five-plus years, I'd say 5 to 10 years and even longer on the gas side. So I think short term it looks good and longer term it looks good. I'd say the only other thing to think about is we do have a lot of fractionation coming on in 2024. We have GCF coming on at the end of the quarter. We'll have Train 9 and then Train 10. So that's an outsized amount of fractionation relative to just kind of normal volume growth that we're seeing. We have the export expansion just done. I think we're set up well for exports in 2024. But ultimately, it kind of comes back to Permian gathering and processing growth will be the primary driver. Yeah, sure. I'd say where -- I think we said is our internal business prospects look very good. We have a very good case just to continue to operate in our core business. Gathering and Processing in the Permian largest G&P footprint in the Permian Basin is going to afford us multiple years of growth. So I think we just sit in a very fortunate position to just focus on Targa. We're going to invest in G&P. We're going to invest in transport like we are with Daytona, invest in fractionation. We're being in three fractionators on and continue to invest in export. So in terms of us looking at bolt-ons or tack-ons, I think that's really kind of far down our capital priority list. I think we want to execute on the organic growth projects we have in front of us and then increase and then distribute an increasing amount of that to our shareholders as Jen talked about and up 40% to 50% over time. It's not in any one exact year, but we see being able to do all of those things distribute 40% to 50% lower our leverage invest in our business. So I think we're focused on Targa right now and just executing our plan in front of us. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Yes, so this is Matt. And then Jen, if you want to add on. Yes we've made a lot of progress at adding or really having fee-based growth in both our G&P business and our downstream business but also putting in fee-based floors and components into our G&P business as contracts come up. Yes, as you look at really through this year, where we've had fee floors and those hybrid contracts we are kind of at or below the floors. So as you think about just kind of earnings power going forward, most of those are at or below. And so as we get some tailwind, if we get some tailwinds from commodity prices that would just be upside. But on those fee floor contracts there's not a lot of downside from here. So we think we're in a good spot. Yes, I mean for the most part those have been ordered. Part of it was delivery delays. So I don't know that the CapEx it shifts \u2013 necessarily shift all that much. We're just really constantly kind of buying compressors and adding to inventory. So there's some flex there but it just does take some time there. And then one thing to note too, as we're kind of waiting on those compression delays, we're still coordinated for the most part with our producers such that we can capture the initial production from there. So we're working with them to make sure we're there for the IP and that we're getting that production. So it's not really lost it's just kind of deferred and pushed into other periods. Thank you. Yeah. There you go, Brian. Yeah. Sure. I mean, I'd say we have a lot of our G&P business is pointing liquids into our downstream business. I don't know that we ever get to 100%. That's not really a goal. There's going to be some amount of volumes that are going on third-party pipes. The vast majority on the Midland side move, but it's not 100% on the Midland side. And in the Delaware, I'd say it's a majority, but because of some acquisitions and just legacy dedications onto other pipes that's going to take time. But as we grow, I'd say, a disproportionate amount of the growth is tied to target. And I think that's going to continue. So I think we have a majority out there. I see that number moving north just as you go -- as we go forward. But I think we're in a really strong position of capturing the majority of volumes across the Permian and moving those into the downstream assets. Yeah. I think on CapEx we pointed to with Daytona multiple fractionation trains we see 2024 being kind of similar-ish levels which I'd characterize as kind of higher than a normal run rate levels because the downstream projects are a bit lumpier. So that's why we have some confidence as we get into 2025 and beyond potentially having urgent 2025 having it be lower and then maybe a more normalized rate thereafter. As you look at ethane exports there's, a number of expansions and parties that do that. That is something we have talked about in the past. We have the capability to do that. Right now what we're really focused on is increasing our connectivity to the domestic pet chem market and flexibility to other I'd say just other customers for ethane demand. I'd say that's -- it's out there. We don't -- I wouldn't put that on the front of our list of something we are looking at right now but that is on the potential that we kind of keep on the list."

And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Matt.\nMatt Meloy: Thanks, Sanjay, and good morning. The second quarter results were consistent with our expectations as the strength of our business drove record volumes for the quarter, which really set us up well for a strong year. Adjusted EBITDA was lower sequentially given our significant marketing gains in the first quarter but consistent with previous disclosures, we expect EBITDA to ramp over the balance of the year and we remain confident in our full year 2023 adjusted EBITDA estimate of $3.5 billion to $3.7 billion. During the second quarter, we had record volumes in the Permian, driving record NGL transportation and fractionation volumes downstream. We fully brought online our Legacy II Plant in Permian Midland and commenced operations on our Midway plant in Permian Delaware, and we executed on a quarterly record $149 million of common share repurchases, which is reflective of our strong conviction in the outlook for our business going forward. Natural gas volumes across our Permian systems continue to grow and the recent completion of our Legacy II and Midway Plants provide us with incremental Midland and Delaware processing capacity to handle a continued ramp in inlet volumes driving incremental volumes through our integrated NGL downstream assets. Given our increasing Permian volumes and consistent with our previous messaging that we are already ordering long lead items, today, we officially announced our next plant in the Permian Midland and our next plant in the Permian Delaware to support the infrastructure needs of our producer customers. We continue to estimate 2023 growth CapEx spending of between $2 billion and $2.2 billion and all of our previously announced projects remain on track and on budget. As we think about 2024 growth capital, we will continue to have spending to complete a number of our major projects already underway, including Frac Trains 9 and 10, the majority of capital on our Daytona NGL pipeline and five Permian gas plants driving expenditures for 2024, which may approximate spending levels similar to 2023. Growth capital spend beyond '24 is likely to come down as we will have caught up on the downstream side of the business as those major growth capital projects will be complete. Investing in organic growth projects across our core integrated footprint provides Targa with attractive returns and puts us in a strong position to continue to return incremental capital to our shareholders. Let's now discuss our operations in more detail. Starting in the Permian, high activity levels continue across our dedicated acreage. Our systems across the Midland and Delaware basins averaged of record 5.1 billion cubic feet per day of reported inlet volumes during the second quarter, increasing 5% sequentially. In Permian Midland, we continue to see strong producer activity and our system continues to operate near capacity. Capacity for our new Legacy II Plant became fully available partway through the second quarter and is currently running near full. Our next Midland plant, Greenwood remains on track to begin operations in the late fourth quarter of 2023 and is expected to be highly utilized when it comes online. In Permian Delaware, activity and volumes across our footprint are also running strong. Our Midway plant commenced operations late in the second quarter and is providing much needed incremental processing capacity. Midway became fully operational this week and we idled our Sand Hills facility. These actions will increase operational reliability and enhance plant recoveries for our customers. Our Wildcat II and Roadrunner II Plants remain on track to begin operations in the first and second quarters of 2024, respectively, and both plants are expected to start up highly utilized given the robust activity across our entire Delaware footprint. We are currently offloading an average of around 70 million cubic feet per day of gas in the Permian and are in the process of adding significant compression horsepower during the balance of the year and are continuing to see strong producer activity across our acreage, which gives us the confidence that we remain on track for our average 2023 Permian inlet gas volumes to increase 10% over the fourth quarter of 2022. In our Central region in the Badlands, our combined natural gas volumes increased 3% sequentially, and we are currently not seeing any material change in activity across our producer customers despite lower commodity prices. Shifting to our Logistics and Transportation segment. Targa's NGL pipeline transportation volumes were a record 621,000 barrels per day and fractionation volumes were a record 794,000 barrels per day during the second quarter. The ramp in supply volumes from our Permian systems and third parties drove the record sequential increase in NGL transportation. Additionally, Grand Prix pipeline volumes also benefited from the expiration of certain medium term commitments we had on third party pipes. Our fractionation facilities in Mont Belvieu remain highly utilized and the restart of GCF will provide some much needed capacity when it is fully restarted in the first quarter of 2024, and we expect to continue -- and we continue to expect our Train 9 fractionator to be highly utilized when it commences operations during the second quarter of 2024. Our recently announced Train 10 fractionator is expected to be much needed given the expected continued growth in our G&P business and plant expansions and remains on track for the first quarter of 2025. At Galena Park, we loaded an average of 9.2 million barrels per month of LPGs during the second quarter. In the third quarter, our loading capability will be reduced for about a month due to a portion of our facility undergoing its required 10 year inspection. Our low cost expansion project increased our propane loading capabilities with an incremental 1 million barrels per month of capacity will be complete this quarter and we expect our loadings to ramp after the inspection is complete and through the balance of 2023. We are excited about the long term outlook at Targa and remain focused on executing our strategic priorities. We believe that we offer a unique value proposition for our shareholders and potential shareholders, growing EBITDA, growing the dividend and reducing share count while maintaining leverage within our target range. Before I turn the call over to Jen to discuss our second quarter results in more detail, I would like to extend a thank you to the Targa team for their continued focus on safety and execution while continuing to provide best-in-class service and reliability to our customers.\nJen Kneale: Thanks, Matt. Good morning, everyone. Targa's reported adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter was $789 million. The sequential decrease was predominantly attributable to the significant optimization opportunities we benefited from in our marketing and LPG export businesses during the first quarter. Higher volumes were offset by lower realized natural gas and NGL prices and higher operating expenses. As Matt mentioned, we expect adjusted EBITDA to be higher in the third and fourth quarters as we benefit from strong volume tailwinds across our Permian and downstream assets, and are comfortable with our full year 2023 adjusted EBITDA estimate of between $3.5 billion and $3.7 billion. We are well hedged across all commodities for the balance of 2023 and continue to add hedges for 2024 and beyond. Coupled with our fee floor contracts, we have significantly derisked our earnings and cash flow outlook while preserving the upside when commodity prices increase. Inclusive of our newly announced Greenwood II and Bull Moose plants in the Permian, there is no change to our estimate for 2023 growth capital spending of between $2 billion and $2.2 billion. Our current year estimate for net maintenance capital spending remains $175 million. At quarter end, we had $2.2 billion of available liquidity and our pro forma leverage was at the midpoint of our long term leverage ratio target range, which provides us with a lot of flexibility looking forward. We continue to expect year end leverage around the midpoint of our long term leverage ratio target range of 3 to 4 times. Maintaining a strong investment grade balance sheet across cycles continues to be a priority. Our balance sheet strength remains the foundation that affords us the financial flexibility to continue to execute on our strategic priorities, that is investing in high returning integrated projects and prudently returning an increasing amount of capital to our shareholders. The strength of our balance sheet and outlook were recognized recently by both Fitch and S&P that place Targa on positive watch. We repurchased a quarterly record of $149 million of common shares in the second quarter at a weighted average price of $71.37 per share and have repurchased over $200 million in common stock through the first half of the year. During the quarter, we exhausted our $500 million share repurchase program and had about $943 million remaining under our $1 billion share repurchase program as of June 30th. Looking ahead, we have significant flexibility to continue to execute under our opportunistic repurchase framework and further increase our return of capital to shareholders and reduce our share count over time. Lastly, I'd like to echo Matt and extend a thank you to our employees for their continued focus on safety and commitment to Targa. And with that, I will turn the call back over to Sanjay.\nSanjay Lad: Thanks, Jen. For the Q&A session, we kindly ask that you limit to one question and one follow up and reenter the line up if you have additional questions. Tes, would you please open the line for Q&A? Tes, we\u2019re ready for the Q&A session.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Theresa Chen from Barclays.\nTheresa Chen: First, I'd like to touch on the CapEx outlook over the medium to long term. To your comments earlier, Matt, about 2024 being similar to 2023, and then beyond that, the expectations for cap to step down. Do you have a sense of what do you think a post 2024 run rate CapEx could look like? And then on the heels of that in terms of capital allocation, what do you view the split in the return of capital to shareholders between dividend growth and buybacks as that free cash flow generation becomes more visible?\nMatt Meloy: I talked about capital for 2024 and pointed to really some of the major projects. So let's talk about Daytona. Most of the spending we're going to have on Daytona is next year. We have two fractionators, Train 9 and Train 10, and we're also spending some money this year on GCS. So we're -- that's not a normal cadence to have that much fractionation being added, the lion's share of a transportation -- NGL pipeline being added is kind of higher than normal. Now we have a lot of that spending in 2023, too. And so that's why when you look at the major projects, those are the ones we see in process through '23 and then through \u201824. Once the fractionation Train 9 and 10 in Daytona are on line by the end of '24, then we do see a step down kind of thereafter. I don't have that exactly what it's going to look like as a run rate, what that would be. But we do see that stepping down because the lion's share of the spending for those large projects come off and it's adding our processing plants and some of the other kind of normal course capital that we have. And in terms of return of capital, our focus has been investing in our core business that gets really good returns for us. So we're going to continue to focus on investing in both the G&P side and the downstream side to take care of our volumes for our customers. And then that should provide good EBITDA growth and good ability for us to continue to return capital to shareholders, meaningfully increasing the dividend, meaningfully buying back shares. And so I think it's going to be a little bit of all of the above approach, investing in our business, increasing the dividend and repurchasing shares. And you saw us repurchase a significant amount of shares in the second quarter. So I think it's going to be all of those things.\nTheresa Chen: And then looking to the second half of 2023, clearly, there's been a lot of volatility on the NGL side, whether in terms of pricing or volumes or different parts of the value chain across the industry. What is your implied contribution in the second half for NGL marketing to hit your guidance for the year?\nMatt Meloy: We had a really strong first quarter in terms of marketing, really across our export business, across gas marketing, NGL marketing and we have some seasonality in the wholesale marketing business. In the second quarter, I would say it was relatively modest amount of marketing, kind of probably a low point for us if you look at it through the year. So we have some expectation for more normalized kind of marketing as you go into second and third -- into the third and fourth quarter but nothing like we saw kind of at the beginning part of the year. We're starting to see some opportunities for spreads to open up where we can capture some, but there's not any kind of outsized amount baked in for the second half of the year.\nJen Kneale: And on the LPG export side, you may have heard that we announced on this call that we expect the facility or parts of the facility on the export side to be down for a month as we complete a required 10 year review of the facilities. So that will impact the third quarter. And to the extent, though, that we see good demand internationally in the fourth quarter, we will have completed our million barrel per month expansion, Acalina Park, and we'll have that inspection behind us. We'll have a lot more flexibility to move additional cargoes in the fourth quarter on the LPG export side to the extent that there is global demand for additional volumes.\nOperator: And then we will have our next question, Jeremy Tonet from JPMorgan Securities.\nJeremy Tonet: I appreciate that we are not giving '24 guidance at this juncture, but just wondering if you could help us sketch out the future a little bit more. Clearly, a lot of capital being deployed, very accretive terms, a lot of growth in the Permian. But is there any flavor you could give us for what post 2023 Targa trajectory could look like, just given the amount of capital being deployed?\nJen Kneale: I think that part of our conviction around all things Targa right now is the fact that we do see such a strong multiyear growth outlook on the EBITDA side. I don't think we're at a point where we want to articulate any advanced guidance for 2024. Really, it will largely be dependent on the producer forecast that we receive as we go through our planning forecast this fall. But certainly, we expect the assets that we have in progress right now to be very highly utilized when they come online, that's part of what we said this morning. And with that volume growth filling those facilities, we would certainly expect meaningful underlying EBITDA growth in a commodity environment that looks anything like we have seen this year.\nJeremy Tonet: So is it fair to say the volumes would deliver strong growth year-over-year, this is not like a step down with the hedging book, that's a big offset. Just trying to think gives and takes as we look forward here.\nJen Kneale: As I think about hedge prices right now for 2024 relative to where they are this year, I wouldn't say that there's a step down, both natural gas and NGL prices sort of approximate same prices for '23 in 2024. So I really think it's the volumes that are going to drive significant underlying EBITDA growth for us. Begins in the Permian Basin and then increasing Permian Basin volumes, of course, moving through our transportation and fractionation assets and then having those volumes available either to sell domestically or into the export market is really what positions us so well not only for 2024 but beyond that and is part of what is driving our conviction in the Targa story.\nJeremy Tonet: And just looking at the midstream industry more broadly, we've seen some kind of bigger moves take place, some mergers out there. And just wondering if we're in the midst of a period of industry consolidation, how does Targa think about that, what's Targa's role moving forward here?\nMatt Meloy: Jeremy, we are really focused on investing in our core business. We have a lot of really attractive organic growth opportunities with a budget of $2 billion to $2.2 billion this year and significant capital spending next year as well. Those are really good projects for us. We've seen significant volume growth. You saw our volumes really move up across Permian, across the NGL footprint here in the second quarter. We expect continued growth the back half of '23 and into '24 and '25. So we're really focused on what we can do on an organic growth basis. That's the focus, that's where we're going to get the best returns. And so what others are doing, it's interesting, we pay attention, but our focus is on our core business.\nOperator: And then we will have our next question, Michael Blum from Wells Fargo.\nMichael Blum: I wanted to just go back to LPG exports for a second, notwithstanding the planned downtime in Q3. I was wondering if you could just speak to what you're seeing in end market demand for the balance of the year?\nScott Pryor: We continue to see good demand across our dock. Obviously, in the first quarter, we benefited from the outline that Matt communicated earlier and then in the second quarter, we've seen less spot opportunities. Some of that's just been driven by a less arb in the overall marketplace. We've seen some headwinds as it relates to freight economics that has tightened things up, and just when you think about just the overall seasonal demand that we came off of from the first quarter. When we go into the third quarter, again, we continue to extend the existing contracts that we have, adding contracts to our portfolio, especially as we have the expansion project coming on during this third quarter where we are getting some benefit as it relates to that today. When we look at the third quarter, despite the downtime that we were going to have because of the mandatory inspection that we have on some of our vessels at the facility, we would expect our third quarter volumes to be similar or better than what we saw in the second quarter. And then as Jen alluded to, when we look at the fourth quarter with the expansion online, with a ramp-up in demand, the seasonal demand that we typically see in the fourth quarter and first quarter we just really see a good outlook for that. Volumes through our systems will continue to ramp up and we just view that as a very positive for us overall.\nMichael Blum: Also just wanted to ask about this recent spike we've seen in ethane prices. It's had some impacts on some processing plant efficiencies, some frac outages. Just curious if that impacted Targa at all for Q3 either positive or negative?\nScott Pryor: I would say it did not impact us negatively. Ethane found itself really in a volatile market during the month of July and some of that was brought on as the market was pinched between weeks of rejection and improved petrochemical operating rates. The petchem operating rates probably were likely just above 90% operating rates in the month of July and along with that, with increased ethane exports. As the price ramped up that improved some of the recovery economics as it relates to ethane rejection recovery, but there's some time lags with that. So I think the market found itself in some opportunities where it spiked in order for folks to cover various positions. For us, as we see those opportunities, we can utilize our storage, we can take advantage of the storage position that we have. So I would say that it was probably a net benefit to us to a certain degree but I would suggest that some of that may come later in the year than it would be in kind of the prompt month. So things feel like they're a little more balanced. Prices have now really come back down to more of a moderate level around $0.27 per gallon this morning. They feel a little more balanced. September is trading a little bit stronger than August currently, which would suggest there may be some mild tightness. But again, I think overall, things have balanced themselves out with the recovery economics improving.\nOperator: And then we will have our next question, Neel Mitra from Bank of America.\nNeel Mitra: I just wanted to drill down a little bit more on the ongoing CapEx needs and two particular topics. First, it seemed like you were maybe two processing plants behind on leased when you acquired them. Are we trending on that? And then second, when we look at the Grand Prix expansion from North Texas to Belvieu, when would that be necessary from the volumes that you're getting from Daytona and Grand Prix?\nPat McDonie: Listed was behind and frankly we're still running hard to catch up. Obviously, the Red Hills plant came on shortly after the acquisition, we've added capacity at Midway, we're adding capacity pretty quickly with Wildcat II, and now we've -- and Roadrunner, and we've made the announcement on Bull Moose. All of those things are to get out in front of the activity level we're seeing from our producers in the Delaware Basin. Frankly, we have a ton of compression getting set between now and the end of the year. We're still behind a little bit and we're playing catch up, and we expect to get hopefully caught up by the end of the year on that. The production is there, the drilling activity is there. We just got to execute and get it connected and online. So the capacity adds you're seeing in the Delaware are really directly related to the producer activity levels that we have direct line of sight to. So we're not caught up but we're getting there.\nScott Pryor: As it relates to Grand Prix and Daytona, certainly, we welcome the expansion project that we have with Daytona coming online that will complement the western portion of our Grand Prix pipeline that feeds into our South leg moving into Mont Belvieu. Recognize that the South Lake has over -- 1just over 1 million barrels a day of capacity moving into Mont Belvieu, in the second quarter, we moved just over 600,000 barrels a day. So we've got a lot of operating leverage as it relates to that South lag. When Daytona comes online, we had announced initially they would have a capacity of roughly 400,000 barrels a day with a couple of pump stations that would be a part of that expansion project. So we've got a lot of operating leverage as it relates to that. With that said, obviously, we are evaluating what is the next step for us. For additional pipeline requirements, we're certainly going to watch and see how [paths] plants on the Western side in the Permian continue to ramp up over time, the additive of plants over time, but we'll certainly be in a position to expand when it's necessary and evaluate that.\nNeel Mitra: And then as a quick follow-up on the ethane question. We were in rejection, I guess, for most of June. So did that impact results negatively for 2Q? And then I think I heard that you would benefit later in the year from some of the higher ethane prices, and I was just wondering how you would benefit and some commentary behind that.\nScott Pryor: I think what I would allude to there is we saw some opportunities where we actually saw some contango in the marketplace on ethane that was priced later in the year and actually into 2024. So utilizing our storage, we were able to benefit from that contango market that was presented. So I would say that it's moderate levels at this point. That's something that we, obviously, with our storage have the ability to take advantage of when there is contango plays in the marketplace. Those are not present today per se but that's where we get some slight benefits when the market moves in those directions.\nNeel Mitra: And was there a negative hit on volumes on your systems just from rejection that we wouldn't otherwise have seen from the heat in Texas in June?\nScott Pryor: I would say not really on our system. Certainly, as we watch the percentage of ethane that's contained and the raw that comes into our Mont Belvieu facility it usually is more impactful in the third party pipelines than it is on the Grand Prix pipeline. I will say that we saw in the latter part of July and here in August that the percentage has moved up a little bit, probably more on the third party pipes than on Grand Prix. So that is certainly an indicator that industry as a whole is recovering more of the ethane and the field, which should benefit us over time. I think the other thing that you'll see is that given the fact that we've had a couple of industry players have brought on some additional frac capacity, that also lends to calming down, if you will, the spikes that we saw in the month of July on ethane.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Colton Bean, please proceed to your question from TPH & Company.\nColton Bean: Just on the G&P segment, a decent drop in sequential processing margins. Can you comment on where Q2 results sit relative to fee floors, and then just any general expectations for margins through the balance of the year?\nJen Kneale: In the second quarter, I'd say that our fee floors kicked in, reflecting, I think, the importance of them. I think the second quarter is illustrative of how well Targa can perform even across a lower commodity price environment, where we even saw Waha prices first of month in April, print was $0.08, $0.09. So again, I think it is reflective of the importance to us of the fee floors that we are able to continue to invest because with those floors in place, we can at least get a required minimum rate of return on that invested capital. But where we sit today, we're seeing improved prices here in the third quarter. For full year, I'd say that commodity prices on the NGL and natural gas side are, call it, 5% lower than the guidance that we set out. So we'll have to see how the rest of the year plays out. And hopefully, prices can be more of a tailwind than a headwind given we are very well hedged and given, again, in the second quarter, we were at fee floor levels.\nColton Bean: And then shifting over to the Logistics and Transportation segment. You had some very impressive NGL throughput across Grand Prix and the frac fleet, but it looks like the weighted average F&P rate moved lower quarter-on-quarter. Any basin mix shift or recontracting impacts that drove the drop and then again, your expectations for that rate trajectory moving forward?\nMatt Meloy: So yes, we had really good volumes across the Downstream segment. You saw a significant ramp in Grand Prix, which was part of a contract. Part of it was just the organic growth, part was a contract roll-off we had on transport. And so you saw also really good volume increase on frac. No, I don't think there was really a mix or a degradation in our overall margins. Typically, these TNF contracts are kind of escalate over time and move up. So there just might be some volatility with marketing or what all you're including in the overall L&T margin and how much you're attributing to transport and frac.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We have Keith Stanley from Wolfe Research.\nKeith Stanley: I wanted to ask about the big step-up in buybacks during Q2. Should we view that as kind of a unique opportunity because the stock fell in May and June, or is this possibly kind of a normal pace and how you think about buybacks and your capacity to do that going forward?\nMatt Meloy: I think our buybacks have been a part of the way we're returning capital to shareholders. We look at -- really, I'd say it's underpinned by just our really strong outlook for not only the remainder of '23 but as we look out '24 and '25, we look at our overall cash flow profile, our leverage profile outlook for the business, it led us to step up our repurchases for the second quarter. So that was very attractive to us. In the past, in the first quarter, we had just completed the acquisition of the 25% interest in Grand Prix. So it's kind of a mix of what's our overall spending for the quarter and then what's our outlook. And I think we feel very confident in not only back half of the year, but really kind of multiyear outlook for Targa, and so that led us to step up the repurchases for the second quarter.\nKeith Stanley: Second question, just the Grand Prix volumes are really high, as you said, in part from a contract roll-off on transportation. Are there any other major contract roll-offs coming up, I guess, through the end of next year that we should be mindful of that could cause another big pop in Grand Prix volumes?\nScott Pryor: I would say that no, not really. We certainly benefited in the second quarter as we had some of those midterm contracts that had rolled off. I would say that going forward, there's not really a large step up. We will basically benefit from the additive of new plants that are going on in the Permian Basin for us. Certainly, the next two plants that were announced today are something that will contribute to our Grand Prix pipeline over time.\nOperator: Brian Reynolds from UBS, please proceed with your question.\nBrian Reynolds: Just a quick follow-up on the CapEx cadence in the outer years with the focus on nat gas takeaway opportunities in [Apex]. Is this natural gas takeaway opportunity included in that kind of outer year CapEx decline and perhaps can you update us on perhaps Targa's equity interest or ability to fund the whole pipe on its own?\nJen Kneale: On the financing side, I think that we've consistently said, Brian, that if Apex was a project that got commercialized, it's one that lends itself really nicely to bring in JV partners and also to consider project finance. So I think we've been very consistent that if that is a project that does move forward, the likely outcome is that we would be funding it with a small portion of the equity of the project and would then utilize either joint ventures and/or project finance for the bulk of the financing.\nBobby Muraro: When you look at the parties sitting around the table, both on the producer shipper side and on the market side, it's kind of a who's who and [indiscernible] great parties, which lends itself to what Jen is talking about, the line out the door relative to the ability to raise capital in a multitude of ways to do it.\nBrian Reynolds: And maybe just a quick follow-up on the NGL market. Thanks for all the prior color. But kind of just curious if you can provide a little bit more color around your propane outlook. We're trading at historical lows for propane relative to WTI. Just looking ahead into winter and a lot of the PDH demand is going online in China and competition with naphtha, just kind of curious of what you're seeing across your system in terms of interest going into winter time this year?\nScott Pryor: Currently, today, pricing sits around $0.72 we view the outer months currently today is slight contango. Fourth quarter is around $0.78. First quarter is around $0.79. The challenge that propane has today is that our current inventories stand around 88 million barrels, which is about 25 million barrels above this time last year. So that is part of the reason why you're seeing pricing relative to WTI from a percentage basis, down from what you've seen of late. I think really, when you look at it, production obviously is moving up. I think as overall global demand continues to increase, albeit there are times where you see some lulls in that. But the PDH plant -- PDH additives that you see in China that you mentioned, obviously, is a big pool of propane over time. So for us, I think it's as an industry, I think we've got adequate inventory, certainly, and I think that will provide us. The inventories have been higher historically. So this is not like it's a high watermark for us and we've been able to pull the inventories down. The other thing when you look at it from an export market perspective, you're seeing the industry continue to add vessels for LPGs, current fleet size is around 360 VLGCs. With the second half of this year, we're adding another 25 or so vessels and probably in 2024, we'll exceed 400 vessels on the water. So that clearly is an indication as an industry and as a market demand that the market is gearing up for increased demand globally as more markets mature.\nOperator: We have Tristan Richardson from Scotiabank.\nTristan Richardson: Just a question. You just mentioned on offloading levels that you're seeing now. Should we think of those as sort of normal levels that you would see in any given year, or are those perhaps elevated currently in anticipation of Greenwood, Wildcat, Roadrunner? Maybe just your thoughts on offloading as a part of the portfolio?\nPat McDonie: I mean I think you're going to see it in [indiscernible] periods, right, where we're in the process of adding capacity and we need to move some gas off system until we get our incremental plant started up. So I don't know that there's a normal cadence to that. Obviously, we're building a lot of additional plant capacity with the hopes that we're out in front of our producer growth and that we're going to be able to take 100% of it. But frankly, our producers, even though we are -- we have a robust outlook on their growth, they've outperformed and it means that we've needed more capacity than we've even built. And obviously, we've built a lot. So hopefully, our offloads will remain only as needed and for short periods of time and kind of an emergency situation. And outside of that, we'll have plant capacity in place to provide those services on our own.\nTristan Richardson: And then just on your point there on customers, just always kind of curious about producer dynamics and customer activity. Like certainly, your view on inlet growth this year hasn't changed and we know your large scale customers are the major drivers. But maybe just anything on the smaller to midsize customers and change in behavior, shifts in activity, et cetera.\nPat McDonie: No. I mean, obviously, you've seen a little bit of consolidation through the acquisition market. Short term, it has no impact. And even longer term, the impact on growth on our systems is inconsequential. We really have seen a continued high activity level across both the Delaware and Midland sides of the basin. So no material will change.\nOperator: We have Neal Dingmann from Truist Securities.\nJake Nivasch: This is Jake Nivasch on for Neal. Just a quick one here for me, and I know we've kind of touched on this a couple of times. So if I can tackle it a different way. Just the CapEx on the outer years, I'm just trying to get a sense strategically what that implies, I guess, from a capital allocation standpoint, it doesn't sound like especially the comments today, there's a big M&A appetite and given that the CapEx spend is coming down and the fundamental backdrop that you guys have with cash flow generation. Just trying to get a sense of what that means either for the target leverage ratio, if you think maybe bring that down or I guess, even from a buyback standpoint, would you consider going into a formulaic program? Just trying to get a sense of, I guess, how you guys are thinking about that just in general.\nJen Kneale: I think from our perspective, it really all begins with the Permian growth and the cadence of Permian growth, and how much additional infrastructure that we'll need to service our Permian customers based on that, call it, medium and longer term growth rate and then what larger assets we\u2019ll need on the downstream side to help manage those volumes through our integrated system. But certainly, part of why we've got so much conviction in our target story is as we look out to 2025 and beyond, we expect significantly higher EBITDA growth capital coming down. That means that we'll have a lot more free cash flow available to allocate and return more capital to shareholders while also continuing to invest in the business. I think that you've heard currently the appetite for M&A is very, very low. We did two excellent acquisitions last year that are performing very, very well for us this year. And we expect, particularly the Lucid assets to perform very well for us on a growth basis as we move forward through really the short, medium and long term. I think that's all setting us up to be in an excellent position looking forward and then we'll have to figure out the ideal mix of increasing dividends and also repurchases. We like the opportunistic share repurchase program right now. I think that it's working for us, particularly as we are trying to manage leverage, a leverage ratio today of about the midpoint of our long term leverage ratio target range. I think we've spoken to our preference to manage our leverage ratio in the bottom half of that long term leverage ratio target range, but we're very comfortable running this business between 3 to 4 times. And I think again, that's what gives us a lot of flexibility going forward on that, all of the above approach that says we will continue to invest in the business in really attractive returning projects and that will help underpin an exceptionally strong balance sheet with the flexibility to return more capital to shareholders across a multitude of ways.\nOperator: We have Sunil Sibal from Seaport Global.\nSunil Sibal: So I just wanted to understand a little bit better the gas takeaway situation in Permian. So obviously, you're developing your project and you also announced a number of processing additions. So from a gas take rate perspective, when do we need to see new pipelines announced to basically really service this gas out of the basin?\nBobby Muraro: What I'd say is we are relatively comfortable over the short term -- short to medium term for gas takeaway, you see something like a pipeline that went down earlier this week and the weekend. Tight enough that a whole pipeline going away does not work for the basin. But as you see, two expansions coming online in the short term and then [indiscernible] coming online next year, we feel comfortable that those will satisfy the needs over the short to medium term, depending on how you define those. And then the way we see we think another pipe needs to be in service in the 2026 time frame, so that probably means early '24. Hopefully, something else goes FID, we've said it before. If there is a meeting of the minds on the shipper side, with the market side on Apex and Apex ends up being that pipe grade. If it's not, it's another pipe, at the end of the day, Targa just wants to see that infrastructure gets built, whether it's Targa led or another party leading it. So sometime next year, we will be very supportive of our pipe or someone else's pipe, making sure it goes to make sure that all that gas is flowing if there's adequate takeaway in that 2026 time frame.\nSunil Sibal: And then my second question was related to returns. So obviously, I think in the last few years, you've posted 26% of ROIC. I was curious, when you're looking at new investments, you're approving new projects. What's a good way of thinking about your threshold on returns for [proven] projects?\nMatt Meloy: The returns have been very good for Targa across our integrated gathering and processing and then following the NGL molecule through Grand Prix frac and export. So when you put that slide together, I said 26% ROIC is investment in our core business, and that's what we're investing in now. So a lot of those contracts are the same contracts, really long term, 10, 15 year contracts. So we're doing the very similar kinds of things that we did kind of last build cycle. So we feel good about the returns going forward being well in excess of our cost of capital. Typically, in the past, we have described organic growth as kind of 5 to 7 times multiple, there's perhaps a little bit of sand in there. You saw us do about 4 times was kind of what we were able to execute on. I don't know that we'll hit exactly 4 times. I think if we say 5 to 7, perhaps kind of the lower end of that is something I think we could kind of target and be able to get there. Part of it will be dependent on when you're investing what our commodity prices doing throughout that time period that can move up, can move down, that can kind of move that overall multiple. But either way, we're becoming less commodity price sensitive. With the fee based and fee margins we have in there, we see really strong returns for us on these projects, investing in our core business, GMP and then following the NGL molecule to the water.\nSunil Sibal: And just one clarification on that. So the new contracts that you're signing are basically helping you push more towards fixed fee or are they just keep the fixed fee versus the commodity sensitivity constant where it is?\nMatt Meloy: Well, on the -- we're always entering into new contracts. We're amending, we're extending, entering into new contracts on the G&P side and on the downstream side. So it's a constantly moving and changing dynamic. But as we're talking with our producer customers, we have been successful and we're going to continue to push for more fee based components in our gathering and processing contracts where we had just direct straight POP exposure, we are now putting floors in place. Some of them as they come up, we're moving to fee based, there's hybrids, it's a mix. And so as those come up, as we extend, as we modify those contracts, we'll be adding more fee based component. So I just expect that to continue to move more and more fee based as we move forward.\nOperator: Thank you. And I'm now showing no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the conference back to Sanjay Lad, Vice President of Finance and Investor Relations, for closing remarks.\nSanjay Lad: Thanks, everyone that was on the call this morning, and we appreciate your interest in Targa Resources. The IR team will be available for any follow-up questions you may have. Thanks, and have a great day.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Listed was behind and frankly we're still running hard to catch up. Obviously, the Red Hills plant came on shortly after the acquisition, we've added capacity at Midway, we're adding capacity pretty quickly with Wildcat II, and now we've -- and Roadrunner, and we've made the announcement on Bull Moose. All of those things are to get out in front of the activity level we're seeing from our producers in the Delaware Basin. Frankly, we have a ton of compression getting set between now and the end of the year. We're still behind a little bit and we're playing catch up, and we expect to get hopefully caught up by the end of the year on that. The production is there, the drilling activity is there. We just got to execute and get it connected and online. So the capacity adds you're seeing in the Delaware are really directly related to the producer activity levels that we have direct line of sight to. So we're not caught up but we're getting there. I mean I think you're going to see it in [indiscernible] periods, right, where we're in the process of adding capacity and we need to move some gas off system until we get our incremental plant started up. So I don't know that there's a normal cadence to that. Obviously, we're building a lot of additional plant capacity with the hopes that we're out in front of our producer growth and that we're going to be able to take 100% of it. But frankly, our producers, even though we are -- we have a robust outlook on their growth, they've outperformed and it means that we've needed more capacity than we've even built. And obviously, we've built a lot. So hopefully, our offloads will remain only as needed and for short periods of time and kind of an emergency situation. And outside of that, we'll have plant capacity in place to provide those services on our own. No. I mean, obviously, you've seen a little bit of consolidation through the acquisition market. Short term, it has no impact. And even longer term, the impact on growth on our systems is inconsequential. We really have seen a continued high activity level across both the Delaware and Midland sides of the basin. So no material will change."

            "content": "Thanks, Matt. Good morning, everyone. Targa's reported adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter was $789 million. The sequential decrease was predominantly attributable to the significant optimization opportunities we benefited from in our marketing and LPG export businesses during the first quarter. Higher volumes were offset by lower realized natural gas and NGL prices and higher operating expenses. As Matt mentioned, we expect adjusted EBITDA to be higher in the third and fourth quarters as we benefit from strong volume tailwinds across our Permian and downstream assets, and are comfortable with our full year 2023 adjusted EBITDA estimate of between $3.5 billion and $3.7 billion. We are well hedged across all commodities for the balance of 2023 and continue to add hedges for 2024 and beyond. Coupled with our fee floor contracts, we have significantly derisked our earnings and cash flow outlook while preserving the upside when commodity prices increase. Inclusive of our newly announced Greenwood II and Bull Moose plants in the Permian, there is no change to our estimate for 2023 growth capital spending of between $2 billion and $2.2 billion. Our current year estimate for net maintenance capital spending remains $175 million. At quarter end, we had $2.2 billion of available liquidity and our pro forma leverage was at the midpoint of our long term leverage ratio target range, which provides us with a lot of flexibility looking forward. We continue to expect year end leverage around the midpoint of our long term leverage ratio target range of 3 to 4 times. Maintaining a strong investment grade balance sheet across cycles continues to be a priority. Our balance sheet strength remains the foundation that affords us the financial flexibility to continue to execute on our strategic priorities, that is investing in high returning integrated projects and prudently returning an increasing amount of capital to our shareholders. The strength of our balance sheet and outlook were recognized recently by both Fitch and S&P that place Targa on positive watch. We repurchased a quarterly record of $149 million of common shares in the second quarter at a weighted average price of $71.37 per share and have repurchased over $200 million in common stock through the first half of the year. During the quarter, we exhausted our $500 million share repurchase program and had about $943 million remaining under our $1 billion share repurchase program as of June 30th. Looking ahead, we have significant flexibility to continue to execute under our opportunistic repurchase framework and further increase our return of capital to shareholders and reduce our share count over time. Lastly, I'd like to echo Matt and extend a thank you to our employees for their continued focus on safety and commitment to Targa. And with that, I will turn the call back over to Sanjay. And on the LPG export side, you may have heard that we announced on this call that we expect the facility or parts of the facility on the export side to be down for a month as we complete a required 10 year review of the facilities. So that will impact the third quarter. And to the extent, though, that we see good demand internationally in the fourth quarter, we will have completed our million barrel per month expansion, Acalina Park, and we'll have that inspection behind us. We'll have a lot more flexibility to move additional cargoes in the fourth quarter on the LPG export side to the extent that there is global demand for additional volumes. I think that part of our conviction around all things Targa right now is the fact that we do see such a strong multiyear growth outlook on the EBITDA side. I don't think we're at a point where we want to articulate any advanced guidance for 2024. Really, it will largely be dependent on the producer forecast that we receive as we go through our planning forecast this fall. But certainly, we expect the assets that we have in progress right now to be very highly utilized when they come online, that's part of what we said this morning. And with that volume growth filling those facilities, we would certainly expect meaningful underlying EBITDA growth in a commodity environment that looks anything like we have seen this year. As I think about hedge prices right now for 2024 relative to where they are this year, I wouldn't say that there's a step down, both natural gas and NGL prices sort of approximate same prices for '23 in 2024. So I really think it's the volumes that are going to drive significant underlying EBITDA growth for us. Begins in the Permian Basin and then increasing Permian Basin volumes, of course, moving through our transportation and fractionation assets and then having those volumes available either to sell domestically or into the export market is really what positions us so well not only for 2024 but beyond that and is part of what is driving our conviction in the Targa story. In the second quarter, I'd say that our fee floors kicked in, reflecting, I think, the importance of them. I think the second quarter is illustrative of how well Targa can perform even across a lower commodity price environment, where we even saw Waha prices first of month in April, print was $0.08, $0.09. So again, I think it is reflective of the importance to us of the fee floors that we are able to continue to invest because with those floors in place, we can at least get a required minimum rate of return on that invested capital. But where we sit today, we're seeing improved prices here in the third quarter. For full year, I'd say that commodity prices on the NGL and natural gas side are, call it, 5% lower than the guidance that we set out. So we'll have to see how the rest of the year plays out. And hopefully, prices can be more of a tailwind than a headwind given we are very well hedged and given, again, in the second quarter, we were at fee floor levels. On the financing side, I think that we've consistently said, Brian, that if Apex was a project that got commercialized, it's one that lends itself really nicely to bring in JV partners and also to consider project finance. So I think we've been very consistent that if that is a project that does move forward, the likely outcome is that we would be funding it with a small portion of the equity of the project and would then utilize either joint ventures and/or project finance for the bulk of the financing. I think from our perspective, it really all begins with the Permian growth and the cadence of Permian growth, and how much additional infrastructure that we'll need to service our Permian customers based on that, call it, medium and longer term growth rate and then what larger assets we'll need on the downstream side to help manage those volumes through our integrated system. But certainly, part of why we've got so much conviction in our target story is as we look out to 2025 and beyond, we expect significantly higher EBITDA growth capital coming down. That means that we'll have a lot more free cash flow available to allocate and return more capital to shareholders while also continuing to invest in the business. I think that you've heard currently the appetite for M&A is very, very low. We did two excellent acquisitions last year that are performing very, very well for us this year. And we expect, particularly the Lucid assets to perform very well for us on a growth basis as we move forward through really the short, medium and long term. I think that's all setting us up to be in an excellent position looking forward and then we'll have to figure out the ideal mix of increasing dividends and also repurchases. We like the opportunistic share repurchase program right now. I think that it's working for us, particularly as we are trying to manage leverage, a leverage ratio today of about the midpoint of our long term leverage ratio target range. I think we've spoken to our preference to manage our leverage ratio in the bottom half of that long term leverage ratio target range, but we're very comfortable running this business between 3 to 4 times. And I think again, that's what gives us a lot of flexibility going forward on that, all of the above approach that says we will continue to invest in the business in really attractive returning projects and that will help underpin an exceptionally strong balance sheet with the flexibility to return more capital to shareholders across a multitude of ways."

            "content": "When you look at the parties sitting around the table, both on the producer shipper side and on the market side, it's kind of a who's who and [indiscernible] great parties, which lends itself to what Jen is talking about, the line out the door relative to the ability to raise capital in a multitude of ways to do it. What I'd say is we are relatively comfortable over the short term -- short to medium term for gas takeaway, you see something like a pipeline that went down earlier this week and the weekend. Tight enough that a whole pipeline going away does not work for the basin. But as you see, two expansions coming online in the short term and then [indiscernible] coming online next year, we feel comfortable that those will satisfy the needs over the short to medium term, depending on how you define those. And then the way we see we think another pipe needs to be in service in the 2026 time frame, so that probably means early '24. Hopefully, something else goes FID, we've said it before. If there is a meeting of the minds on the shipper side, with the market side on Apex and Apex ends up being that pipe grade. If it's not, it's another pipe, at the end of the day, Targa just wants to see that infrastructure gets built, whether it's Targa led or another party leading it. So sometime next year, we will be very supportive of our pipe or someone else's pipe, making sure it goes to make sure that all that gas is flowing if there's adequate takeaway in that 2026 time frame."

            "name": "Scott Pryor",
            "content": "We continue to see good demand across our dock. Obviously, in the first quarter, we benefited from the outline that Matt communicated earlier and then in the second quarter, we've seen less spot opportunities. Some of that's just been driven by a less arb in the overall marketplace. We've seen some headwinds as it relates to freight economics that has tightened things up, and just when you think about just the overall seasonal demand that we came off of from the first quarter. When we go into the third quarter, again, we continue to extend the existing contracts that we have, adding contracts to our portfolio, especially as we have the expansion project coming on during this third quarter where we are getting some benefit as it relates to that today. When we look at the third quarter, despite the downtime that we were going to have because of the mandatory inspection that we have on some of our vessels at the facility, we would expect our third quarter volumes to be similar or better than what we saw in the second quarter. And then as Jen alluded to, when we look at the fourth quarter with the expansion online, with a ramp-up in demand, the seasonal demand that we typically see in the fourth quarter and first quarter we just really see a good outlook for that. Volumes through our systems will continue to ramp up and we just view that as a very positive for us overall. I would say it did not impact us negatively. Ethane found itself really in a volatile market during the month of July and some of that was brought on as the market was pinched between weeks of rejection and improved petrochemical operating rates. The petchem operating rates probably were likely just above 90% operating rates in the month of July and along with that, with increased ethane exports. As the price ramped up that improved some of the recovery economics as it relates to ethane rejection recovery, but there's some time lags with that. So I think the market found itself in some opportunities where it spiked in order for folks to cover various positions. For us, as we see those opportunities, we can utilize our storage, we can take advantage of the storage position that we have. So I would say that it was probably a net benefit to us to a certain degree but I would suggest that some of that may come later in the year than it would be in kind of the prompt month. So things feel like they're a little more balanced. Prices have now really come back down to more of a moderate level around $0.27 per gallon this morning. They feel a little more balanced. September is trading a little bit stronger than August currently, which would suggest there may be some mild tightness. But again, I think overall, things have balanced themselves out with the recovery economics improving. As it relates to Grand Prix and Daytona, certainly, we welcome the expansion project that we have with Daytona coming online that will complement the western portion of our Grand Prix pipeline that feeds into our South leg moving into Mont Belvieu. Recognize that the South Lake has over -- 1just over 1 million barrels a day of capacity moving into Mont Belvieu, in the second quarter, we moved just over 600,000 barrels a day. So we've got a lot of operating leverage as it relates to that South lag. When Daytona comes online, we had announced initially they would have a capacity of roughly 400,000 barrels a day with a couple of pump stations that would be a part of that expansion project. So we've got a lot of operating leverage as it relates to that. With that said, obviously, we are evaluating what is the next step for us. For additional pipeline requirements, we're certainly going to watch and see how [paths] plants on the Western side in the Permian continue to ramp up over time, the additive of plants over time, but we'll certainly be in a position to expand when it's necessary and evaluate that. I think what I would allude to there is we saw some opportunities where we actually saw some contango in the marketplace on ethane that was priced later in the year and actually into 2024. So utilizing our storage, we were able to benefit from that contango market that was presented. So I would say that it's moderate levels at this point. That's something that we, obviously, with our storage have the ability to take advantage of when there is contango plays in the marketplace. Those are not present today per se but that's where we get some slight benefits when the market moves in those directions. I would say not really on our system. Certainly, as we watch the percentage of ethane that's contained and the raw that comes into our Mont Belvieu facility it usually is more impactful in the third party pipelines than it is on the Grand Prix pipeline. I will say that we saw in the latter part of July and here in August that the percentage has moved up a little bit, probably more on the third party pipes than on Grand Prix. So that is certainly an indicator that industry as a whole is recovering more of the ethane and the field, which should benefit us over time. I think the other thing that you'll see is that given the fact that we've had a couple of industry players have brought on some additional frac capacity, that also lends to calming down, if you will, the spikes that we saw in the month of July on ethane. I would say that no, not really. We certainly benefited in the second quarter as we had some of those midterm contracts that had rolled off. I would say that going forward, there's not really a large step up. We will basically benefit from the additive of new plants that are going on in the Permian Basin for us. Certainly, the next two plants that were announced today are something that will contribute to our Grand Prix pipeline over time. Currently, today, pricing sits around $0.72 we view the outer months currently today is slight contango. Fourth quarter is around $0.78. First quarter is around $0.79. The challenge that propane has today is that our current inventories stand around 88 million barrels, which is about 25 million barrels above this time last year. So that is part of the reason why you're seeing pricing relative to WTI from a percentage basis, down from what you've seen of late. I think really, when you look at it, production obviously is moving up. I think as overall global demand continues to increase, albeit there are times where you see some lulls in that. But the PDH plant -- PDH additives that you see in China that you mentioned, obviously, is a big pool of propane over time. So for us, I think it's as an industry, I think we've got adequate inventory, certainly, and I think that will provide us. The inventories have been higher historically. So this is not like it's a high watermark for us and we've been able to pull the inventories down. The other thing when you look at it from an export market perspective, you're seeing the industry continue to add vessels for LPGs, current fleet size is around 360 VLGCs. With the second half of this year, we're adding another 25 or so vessels and probably in 2024, we'll exceed 400 vessels on the water. So that clearly is an indication as an industry and as a market demand that the market is gearing up for increased demand globally as more markets mature."

            "name": "Matt Meloy",
            "content": "Thanks, Sanjay, and good morning. The second quarter results were consistent with our expectations as the strength of our business drove record volumes for the quarter, which really set us up well for a strong year. Adjusted EBITDA was lower sequentially given our significant marketing gains in the first quarter but consistent with previous disclosures, we expect EBITDA to ramp over the balance of the year and we remain confident in our full year 2023 adjusted EBITDA estimate of $3.5 billion to $3.7 billion. During the second quarter, we had record volumes in the Permian, driving record NGL transportation and fractionation volumes downstream. We fully brought online our Legacy II Plant in Permian Midland and commenced operations on our Midway plant in Permian Delaware, and we executed on a quarterly record $149 million of common share repurchases, which is reflective of our strong conviction in the outlook for our business going forward. Natural gas volumes across our Permian systems continue to grow and the recent completion of our Legacy II and Midway Plants provide us with incremental Midland and Delaware processing capacity to handle a continued ramp in inlet volumes driving incremental volumes through our integrated NGL downstream assets. Given our increasing Permian volumes and consistent with our previous messaging that we are already ordering long lead items, today, we officially announced our next plant in the Permian Midland and our next plant in the Permian Delaware to support the infrastructure needs of our producer customers. We continue to estimate 2023 growth CapEx spending of between $2 billion and $2.2 billion and all of our previously announced projects remain on track and on budget. As we think about 2024 growth capital, we will continue to have spending to complete a number of our major projects already underway, including Frac Trains 9 and 10, the majority of capital on our Daytona NGL pipeline and five Permian gas plants driving expenditures for 2024, which may approximate spending levels similar to 2023. Growth capital spend beyond '24 is likely to come down as we will have caught up on the downstream side of the business as those major growth capital projects will be complete. Investing in organic growth projects across our core integrated footprint provides Targa with attractive returns and puts us in a strong position to continue to return incremental capital to our shareholders. Let's now discuss our operations in more detail. Starting in the Permian, high activity levels continue across our dedicated acreage. Our systems across the Midland and Delaware basins averaged of record 5.1 billion cubic feet per day of reported inlet volumes during the second quarter, increasing 5% sequentially. In Permian Midland, we continue to see strong producer activity and our system continues to operate near capacity. Capacity for our new Legacy II Plant became fully available partway through the second quarter and is currently running near full. Our next Midland plant, Greenwood remains on track to begin operations in the late fourth quarter of 2023 and is expected to be highly utilized when it comes online. In Permian Delaware, activity and volumes across our footprint are also running strong. Our Midway plant commenced operations late in the second quarter and is providing much needed incremental processing capacity. Midway became fully operational this week and we idled our Sand Hills facility. These actions will increase operational reliability and enhance plant recoveries for our customers. Our Wildcat II and Roadrunner II Plants remain on track to begin operations in the first and second quarters of 2024, respectively, and both plants are expected to start up highly utilized given the robust activity across our entire Delaware footprint. We are currently offloading an average of around 70 million cubic feet per day of gas in the Permian and are in the process of adding significant compression horsepower during the balance of the year and are continuing to see strong producer activity across our acreage, which gives us the confidence that we remain on track for our average 2023 Permian inlet gas volumes to increase 10% over the fourth quarter of 2022. In our Central region in the Badlands, our combined natural gas volumes increased 3% sequentially, and we are currently not seeing any material change in activity across our producer customers despite lower commodity prices. Shifting to our Logistics and Transportation segment. Targa's NGL pipeline transportation volumes were a record 621,000 barrels per day and fractionation volumes were a record 794,000 barrels per day during the second quarter. The ramp in supply volumes from our Permian systems and third parties drove the record sequential increase in NGL transportation. Additionally, Grand Prix pipeline volumes also benefited from the expiration of certain medium term commitments we had on third party pipes. Our fractionation facilities in Mont Belvieu remain highly utilized and the restart of GCF will provide some much needed capacity when it is fully restarted in the first quarter of 2024, and we expect to continue -- and we continue to expect our Train 9 fractionator to be highly utilized when it commences operations during the second quarter of 2024. Our recently announced Train 10 fractionator is expected to be much needed given the expected continued growth in our G&P business and plant expansions and remains on track for the first quarter of 2025. At Galena Park, we loaded an average of 9.2 million barrels per month of LPGs during the second quarter. In the third quarter, our loading capability will be reduced for about a month due to a portion of our facility undergoing its required 10 year inspection. Our low cost expansion project increased our propane loading capabilities with an incremental 1 million barrels per month of capacity will be complete this quarter and we expect our loadings to ramp after the inspection is complete and through the balance of 2023. We are excited about the long term outlook at Targa and remain focused on executing our strategic priorities. We believe that we offer a unique value proposition for our shareholders and potential shareholders, growing EBITDA, growing the dividend and reducing share count while maintaining leverage within our target range. Before I turn the call over to Jen to discuss our second quarter results in more detail, I would like to extend a thank you to the Targa team for their continued focus on safety and execution while continuing to provide best-in-class service and reliability to our customers. I talked about capital for 2024 and pointed to really some of the major projects. So let's talk about Daytona. Most of the spending we're going to have on Daytona is next year. We have two fractionators, Train 9 and Train 10, and we're also spending some money this year on GCS. So we're -- that's not a normal cadence to have that much fractionation being added, the lion's share of a transportation -- NGL pipeline being added is kind of higher than normal. Now we have a lot of that spending in 2023, too. And so that's why when you look at the major projects, those are the ones we see in process through '23 and then through \u201824. Once the fractionation Train 9 and 10 in Daytona are on line by the end of '24, then we do see a step down kind of thereafter. I don't have that exactly what it's going to look like as a run rate, what that would be. But we do see that stepping down because the lion's share of the spending for those large projects come off and it's adding our processing plants and some of the other kind of normal course capital that we have. And in terms of return of capital, our focus has been investing in our core business that gets really good returns for us. So we're going to continue to focus on investing in both the G&P side and the downstream side to take care of our volumes for our customers. And then that should provide good EBITDA growth and good ability for us to continue to return capital to shareholders, meaningfully increasing the dividend, meaningfully buying back shares. And so I think it's going to be a little bit of all of the above approach, investing in our business, increasing the dividend and repurchasing shares. And you saw us repurchase a significant amount of shares in the second quarter. So I think it's going to be all of those things. We had a really strong first quarter in terms of marketing, really across our export business, across gas marketing, NGL marketing and we have some seasonality in the wholesale marketing business. In the second quarter, I would say it was relatively modest amount of marketing, kind of probably a low point for us if you look at it through the year. So we have some expectation for more normalized kind of marketing as you go into second and third -- into the third and fourth quarter but nothing like we saw kind of at the beginning part of the year. We're starting to see some opportunities for spreads to open up where we can capture some, but there's not any kind of outsized amount baked in for the second half of the year. Jeremy, we are really focused on investing in our core business. We have a lot of really attractive organic growth opportunities with a budget of $2 billion to $2.2 billion this year and significant capital spending next year as well. Those are really good projects for us. We've seen significant volume growth. You saw our volumes really move up across Permian, across the NGL footprint here in the second quarter. We expect continued growth the back half of '23 and into '24 and '25. So we're really focused on what we can do on an organic growth basis. That's the focus, that's where we're going to get the best returns. And so what others are doing, it's interesting, we pay attention, but our focus is on our core business. So yes, we had really good volumes across the Downstream segment. You saw a significant ramp in Grand Prix, which was part of a contract. Part of it was just the organic growth, part was a contract roll-off we had on transport. And so you saw also really good volume increase on frac. No, I don't think there was really a mix or a degradation in our overall margins. Typically, these TNF contracts are kind of escalate over time and move up. So there just might be some volatility with marketing or what all you're including in the overall L&T margin and how much you're attributing to transport and frac. I think our buybacks have been a part of the way we're returning capital to shareholders. We look at -- really, I'd say it's underpinned by just our really strong outlook for not only the remainder of '23 but as we look out '24 and '25, we look at our overall cash flow profile, our leverage profile outlook for the business, it led us to step up our repurchases for the second quarter. So that was very attractive to us. In the past, in the first quarter, we had just completed the acquisition of the 25% interest in Grand Prix. So it's kind of a mix of what's our overall spending for the quarter and then what's our outlook. And I think we feel very confident in not only back half of the year, but really kind of multiyear outlook for Targa, and so that led us to step up the repurchases for the second quarter. The returns have been very good for Targa across our integrated gathering and processing and then following the NGL molecule through Grand Prix frac and export. So when you put that slide together, I said 26% ROIC is investment in our core business, and that's what we're investing in now. So a lot of those contracts are the same contracts, really long term, 10, 15 year contracts. So we're doing the very similar kinds of things that we did kind of last build cycle. So we feel good about the returns going forward being well in excess of our cost of capital. Typically, in the past, we have described organic growth as kind of 5 to 7 times multiple, there's perhaps a little bit of sand in there. You saw us do about 4 times was kind of what we were able to execute on. I don't know that we'll hit exactly 4 times. I think if we say 5 to 7, perhaps kind of the lower end of that is something I think we could kind of target and be able to get there. Part of it will be dependent on when you're investing what our commodity prices doing throughout that time period that can move up, can move down, that can kind of move that overall multiple. But either way, we're becoming less commodity price sensitive. With the fee based and fee margins we have in there, we see really strong returns for us on these projects, investing in our core business, GMP and then following the NGL molecule to the water. Well, on the -- we're always entering into new contracts. We're amending, we're extending, entering into new contracts on the G&P side and on the downstream side. So it's a constantly moving and changing dynamic. But as we're talking with our producer customers, we have been successful and we're going to continue to push for more fee based components in our gathering and processing contracts where we had just direct straight POP exposure, we are now putting floors in place. Some of them as they come up, we're moving to fee based, there's hybrids, it's a mix. And so as those come up, as we extend, as we modify those contracts, we'll be adding more fee based component. So I just expect that to continue to move more and more fee based as we move forward."

And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Matt.\nMatt Meloy: Thanks, Sanjay, and good morning to everyone. This year is off to a strong start at Targa, and we are very proud of our execution across the company in the first quarter. In Q1, we had quarterly EBITDA that was up 50% over prior year with a lower common share count. Record volumes in the Permian, record NGL transportation and fractionation volumes and strong LPG export volumes. We also finished construction and are in the process of bringing our Legacy II and plant fully online. And we are also returning an increasing amount of capital to our shareholders. We increased our quarterly cash dividend by 43% and executed on $52 million of common share repurchases during the first quarter. With a strong first quarter complete and given the strength of the business fundamentals underpinning our assets, we remain comfortable with our full year 2023 adjusted EBITDA estimate despite natural gas and NGL prices being about 30% and 10% lower than the price assumptions underpinning our 2023 EBITDA guidance range. Natural gas volumes across our Permian systems are growing. Our current aggregate volumes are over five billion cubic feet per day of reported inlet and are expected to ramp as we move through the year, driving incremental volumes through our integrated downstream assets. We have four plants under construction in the Permian and are ordering long lead times for an additional two plants. Given our increasing Permian volumes and resulting NGL supply growth, we announced this morning that we are moving forward with a new 120,000 barrel per day fractionator Train 10 and at our Mont Belvieu complex, which is expected to be online in the first quarter of 2025. With the addition of Train 10 and additional spending on long lead items for our next Permian plants, we now estimate full year 2023 growth CapEx spending to be between $2 billion and $2.2 billion. Investing in organic growth projects across our integrated footprint provides Targa with attractive returns and puts us in a strong position to continue to return incremental capital to our shareholders. Let's now discuss our operations in more detail. Starting in the Permian, high activity levels continue across our dedicated acreage. Our systems across the Midland and Delaware Basins averaged a record 4.8 billion cubic feet per day of reported inlet volumes during the quarter. In Permian Midland, our system has essentially been running above nameplate capacity, absent the impact of first quarter winter weather and is currently operating up over 100 million cubic feet per day versus Q1 average inlet. Our new Legacy II plant partially came online in late March, limited by electricity capacity to the site and is expected to be able to be fully available later this quarter. And kudos to our engineering and operations team for safely bringing the plant online ahead of schedule and on budget. Our next Midland plant Greenwood remains on track to begin operations in late fourth quarter of 2023 and is expected to be highly utilized when it comes online. In Permian Delaware, inlet volumes across our system increased 5% sequentially. Activity in volumes across our Northern Delaware footprint are running strong, and we have bolstered our connectivity across our Delaware assets to handle the near-term growth. Our Midway plan is close to completion and is expected to begin operations later in the second quarter. Our Wildcat 1 and Roadrunner II plants remain on track to begin operations in the first and second quarters of 2024, respectively. We continue to expect volume growth across both our Permian Midland and Delaware positions for the remainder of the year and well beyond. Beyond those projects already announced and in progress, we are evaluating when we will need additional gas processing capacity in the Permian, and we are ordering long lead items for our next Midland and Delaware plant. To that end, some of you may have seen a filing with the Texas Railroad Commission around the proposed gas pipeline we call Apex. This filing allows for preliminary survey work to be completed on proposed routes. Given how rapid we are growing with over 1 billion cubic feet of incremental residue gas from just the plants we currently have under construction, we continue to work to ensure sufficient residue take-away from the basin. As we have said previously, we remain in position to support as needed residue pipes to get Permian gas to market, whether we are leading those efforts or participating with third parties. The next pipe is needed in both our producers and markets on the Gulf Coast are keenly aware of that need. We are also continuing to add intra-basin connectivity and redundancy in both the Midland and Delaware to move residue gas from Targa plants to enhance flow assurance to get volumes from Targa assets to market. In our Central region and the Badlands volumes were sequentially flat during the quarter. Overall volumes remained steady as we are currently not seeing any material change in activity despite lower commodity prices. Shifting to our Logistics and Transportation segment, Targa's NGL transportation volumes were a record 537,000 barrels per day and fractionation volumes were a record 759,000 barrels per day during the first quarter. With the ramp in supply volumes from our Permian systems and third parties, our Grand Prix deliveries into Mont Belvieu are currently averaging around 600,000 barrels per day with fractionation volumes currently running near capacity of around 800,000 barrels per day. GCF will provide some much needed help when it is fully restarted in the first quarter of 2024 and we expect our Train 9 fractionator to open up highly utilized when it commences operations during the second quarter of 2024. Our newly announced Train 10 with an in-service date of the first quarter of 2025 is expected to be much needed given the expected continued growth in our G&P business. Turning to our LPG export business at our Galena Park facilities, we loaded an average of 11.2 million barrels per month during the first quarter as we benefited from increased demand from stronger global market conditions. Our low-cost expansion project to increase our propane loading capabilities with an incremental one million barrels per month of capacity remains on track for mid-2023. We are well contracted across our export facility and continue to expect that 2023 will be a record year for LPG export volumes. We remain excited about the long-term outlook at Targa. Looking ahead, we continue to execute on our strategic priorities will drive increasing EBITDA, a higher common dividend and reduced common share count while maintaining leverage within our target range. We announced this morning that our Board has approved a new $1 billion common share repurchase program, which provides us with flexibility going forward to continue to be opportunistic on repurchases. Before I turn the call over to Jen to discuss our first quarter results in more detail, I would like to extend a thank you to the Targa team for their continued focus on safety and execution while continuing to provide best-in-class services to our customers.\nJennifer Kneale: Thanks, Matt. Good morning, everyone. Targa's reported quarterly adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter was $941 million, increasing 12% sequentially as we benefited from increased optimization opportunities in our marketing and LPG export businesses, contribution from our recent acquisition of the remaining 25% interest in our Grand Prix NGL pipeline earlier this year and higher overall system volumes despite lower commodity prices. As we think about the shape of quarterly adjusted EBITDA across 2023, given the benefits of optimization opportunities in Q1 and seasonality in some of our businesses, we currently expect second quarter adjusted EBITDA to be the lowest of the year, ramping from there as our system volumes continue to grow. As Matt mentioned, for the first quarter, we declared a cash dividend of $0.50 per common share or $2 per share on an annualized basis, representing a 43% increase over the first quarter of 2022. Consistent with previous messaging, we expect to maintain the same quarterly dividend for the remainder of the year. We also repurchased $52 million of common shares in the first quarter at a weighted average price of $71.82. As of quarter end, we had approximately $92 million remaining under our $500 million program and now also have a new $1 billion share repurchase program authorized and in place. Our full year 2023 adjusted EBITDA estimate continues to be between $3.5 billion to $3.7 billion, and we expect year-end leverage around the midpoint of our long-term target leverage ratio range of three to 4x. At the end of the first quarter, our pro forma leverage ratio was approximately 3.5x. We are well hedged across all commodities for the balance of 2023 and continue to add hedges for 2024 and beyond. Coupled with our fee floor contracts, we have significantly de-risked our earnings and cash flow outlook while preserving the upside when commodity prices increase. With our plans to move forward with the construction of frac Train 10 in Mont Belvieu, and acquiring long lead items for our next Permian gas plant, we now estimate 2023 growth capital spending between $2 billion and $2.2 billion. There is no change to our current year estimate for net maintenance capital spending of $175 million. At quarter end, we had about $2.6 billion of available liquidity, which provides us with a lot of flexibility looking forward. Maintaining a strong investment-grade balance sheet across cycles continues to be a priority at Targa. We believe that a strong balance sheet and continued investment in high-return projects positions us to continue to prudently return an increasing amount of capital to our shareholders across cycles. Lastly, I'd like to echo Matt and extend a thank you to our employees for their continued focus on safety while executing on our strategic priorities. And with that, I will turn the call back over to Sanjay.\nSanjay Lad: Thanks, Jen. For the Q&A session, we finally ask that you limit to one question and one follow-up and reenter the lineup if you have additional questions. Bella, would you please open the line for Q&A?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Michael Blum with Wells Fargo.\nMichael Blum: I wanted to ask about frac Train 10. Maybe just walk us through the thought process there. It seems like there's a lot of frac capacity being added to the market right now. And as some people are starting to talk about pressure on rates. So how much of Train 9 is contracting and how much of Train 10 would be contracted or would you need to be contracted to move forward?\nScott Pryor: Michael, this is Scott. Our frac Train 10 will have a similar cost to our Train 9 facility. And as we stated in our remarks, Train 9 is expected to come online in the second quarter of 2024. Given the number of current plants that we have under construction in the Permian and our comments around ordering long lead items for additional plants, we will obviously need to with fractionation capacity for the expected production stemming from our own plants. There have been times over the course of the last few quarters that in order to manage our inventories, the influx of volumes that are coming on to our system. There are times that we have been offloading volumes both on transportation as well as fractionation. So our belief is, is that we have a strong need for frac Train 9 as it comes online. And again, frac Train 10 is trying to stay ahead of the cadence of the number of plants that we are building on the upstream side, along with the overall growth that we're seeing from the industry.\nMatt Meloy: And just to add to that, Michael, this is Matt here. We see the underlying growth in our G&P business, and we're pointing that to frac Train 9, 10 and the restart of GCF. So I would suspect others as they're bringing additional fractionation on, they have volumes that they see from their customers and their contracts. We need to make sure we have sufficient fractionation capacity for our underlying G&P business so we can provide an integrated NGL service to our G&P customers.\nMichael Blum: Got it. And then I just wanted to ask about the increase in growth CapEx. It seems like you're kind of moving towards that $2 billion a year, plus or minus level. Is that a fair way to think about the run rate going forward? And if not, where do you think that does kind of long-term shake out?\nMatt Meloy: Yes. Michael, it is a little bit tough to do run rate as it does get lumpy during certain years when you have large long-haul NGL pipes, for example, that can be in and give you more runway. I'd also say when we made the acquisition of the North Delaware assets in the summer of last year, there was not sufficient processing capacity. So we do have a little bit of catch-up here with five plants being kind of brought online and ordering long lead time for two, that's likely a little bit heavy, if you were to do a multiyear model. That said, I think we're going to continue to have strong G&P growth. We're going to be needing to continue to add plants. So it really comes down a little bit to the lumpiness of some of the larger projects and the timing of our processing plants. But with our underlying acreage position and strong producer contracts we have in the Permian as long as they keep growing, which we see for years to come, we're going to continue to invest in gathering and processing plants, expanding NGL transportation, fractionation and export. But there could be some lumpiness from year-to-year.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Brian Reynolds with UBS.\nBrian Reynolds: Maybe just touch on the return of capital outlook just given the lumpiness in CapEx over the next two years. We saw some buyback in the quarter with likely some dividend increases for the next few years. So just given the rising CapEx and EBITDA outlook for the next few years from these growth projects, was kind of curious if you could discuss how Targa's balance sheet capacity moves over the next few years given that free cash flow after dividends is pretty flattish until '25.\nJennifer Kneale: This is Jen, Brian. I think we have a very strong balance sheet right now sitting at the end of the quarter around the midpoint of our long-term leverage ratio target range despite making a $1 billion acquisition in the first quarter. And we think that our capital spending really helps to create significant long-term shareholder value and position us to be able to return an increasing amount of capital to our shareholders. As Matt described in his answer to Michael, there is some lumpiness associated with our growth capital spending, particularly around our large projects like Daytona and that means that there are some periods where we may have less free cash flow than other periods. But we believe that this sets us up to continue to execute on really where we already are, which is a road map that says we will continue to maintain a really strong balance sheet. We've got increasing year-over-year EBITDA growth really as far as we can see under a variety of scenarios and then also are able to return increasing amounts of capital to our shareholders through a significantly increasing dividend and also opportunistic share repurchases. I think that's the road map that we've shown over the last couple of years, and I think that's the road map that will continue to follow going forward.\nBrian Reynolds: Great. Appreciate that. And as a follow-up, it just seems like Targa is using -- or going after a little bit more third-party contracts historically, it just seems like Targa was very much historically focused on its internal equity volumes for both the G&P and L&T side. Curious if you could just opine further on some of these new third-party opportunities that you're seeing? Is it specifically on the long-haul side or G&P as well. and whether this is a business strategy shift to win new business? Or is there perhaps just more industry cooperation to maximize asset utilization.\nMatt Meloy: I'm not sure exactly which piece on the third party you're referring to, but let me just kind of answer it generally. Here at Targa, we try and really service our existing customers and our gathering and processing business, but we have been for years to get more acreage positions, more underlying volumes in our G&P business to continue to grow that business and then move those NGLs downstream. So we've been very active in managing our existing contracts and going after new customers, new areas in our G&P business. And I'd say the same goes for transportation, fractionation and export is we have a lot of those volumes from GMP moving into our system. Most of those volumes have been moving more towards GMP based on our downstream side versus just third parties that are unaffiliated with G&P. That's been a trend that's been continuing. I don't know that that's really been changing. But that said, our downstream commercial team is still focused on trying to get new business, whether it's for Grand Prix or for our fractionators to provide that level of service for customers, whether they're our G&P customers or just downstream customers. So we're continuing that effort. I don't think that's really changed for us.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan.\nJeremy Tonet: Just wanted to come back to, I guess, CapEx and how you guys think about hurdle rates and accretion. Clearly, in this market, there's greater scrutiny on all CapEx. And just wondering, even with the lower commodity prices, I guess, if you could give us a feeling for what type of operation you see here where your hurdle rates and right now? That would be very helpful.\nJennifer Kneale: Jeremy, this is Jen. We put an ROIC slide in our February materials, partially just to very explicitly highlight just how well, we believe we've been able to invest over the last several years, particularly in projects and opportunities that we consider core. And the spending that we've announced this morning with our frac Train 10 and also additional spending around another Permian gas plant is core. Just like the spending that we're already doing for additional gas plants, fractionation and NGL transportation is core to us. So I wouldn't say that our hurdle rate has really shifted. Continues to be, call it, 5x to 7x. I think that we have been able to execute better than that, partially because our assets are so well utilized when they come online. It feels like we're almost behind every time a new asset comes online. So it's base loaded very quickly, which creates incremental more incremental returns that accrue to us more quickly than maybe before when we grew into our capacity, maybe a little bit more slowly. So I'd say that we continue to look at each and every opportunity and try to really scrub our capital spend plan are in a cycle right now where we are spending a little bit more and partially, that is a result of the lumpiness of some of our bigger projects. But ultimately, it's really across our core value chain, and we believe it's going to generate significant incremental returns for Targa and for our shareholders. To the extent that we get into an environment where we see producer activities slow down, I think we've demonstrated a track record where we've rationalized spending before. When you think about our 2020 spending of $600 million, 2021 spending of just a little bit over $400 million. We clearly have executed previously, where if activity levels are lower, we rationalize our spend. Currently, we just have a lot of expectations given the strength of the producers underlying our G&P systems for significant incremental volume growth. And that's going to necessitate a digital volumes across both our G&P and logistics and transportation footprints.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. That's very helpful there. And then just wanted to dive in a little bit more on reaffirming the guidance here even with the big move in commodity prices. Just wondering if you could provide a little bit more color on some of the offset there. Just wondering how you're tracking versus the 10% Permian growth is you outlined there are better than that? And then also just LPG export trends seem pretty robust as well. So wondering if you could just help us think through some of those tailwinds.\nJennifer Kneale: We now have 1 quarter under our belt, so it's always easier to affirm guidance when part of it is already accounted for. And I think Q1 was a really strong quarter for us across the board. Record volumes in a number of different areas, and our employees also did an excellent job of optimizing our assets and generating additional opportunities from our footprint. So as we look out at the rest of the year, prices are lower, but I think we continue to see and expect excellent volume growth, again, really across all of our assets. And that's really what is underpinning our reaffirmation of our guidance despite lower prices.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Tristan Richardson with Scotiabank.\nTristan Richardson: Appreciate it, Matt. Maybe just a question on the residue side. You talked a little bit about Apex. Obviously, this is very early days here and really just emphasize the longer-term need for residue at a high level, but maybe kind of curious what this could look like in terms of potential end market destinations. Maybe just a little bit more detail on what the preliminary plans for this look like, maybe timing, capital, et cetera? And just thinking about is this a project that you guys are full speed ahead on or really just exploring potential options?\nMatt Meloy: Yes. Thanks, Tristan. Good question. What really underlines or underlies our overall strategy for residue is to make sure that there's takeaway -- and so we want to support whether it's this Apex pipeline or others, we want to make sure that there's takeaway. We have a lot of volumes in the Permian, a lot of plants coming online. So for us to be able to charge a processing fee and the liquids down Grand Prix and into our frac, we need to make sure we're processing those volumes. We need to make sure that there's residue takeaway. So we are working -- we're doing some preliminary work on Apex. We're also talking to other customers. But I'm going to turn it over to Bobby just to talk a little bit more about that project and what we're thinking there.\nRobert Muraro: Yes. So this is Bobby. At the end of day, what we want to see is we want to see all the residue move out of the Permian Basin. So whether it's on a pipeline like Apex or a third-party pipeline or 1 that we're a part of. We'll just be excited to see pipelines go. And then as we think about what Apex could look like if it did go we ultimately have no shortage of residue supply to put to a pipe between us and our customers. And I think everybody knows what's going on with the market down there in that general vicinity of the state with LNG and other demand coming on. So as we think about that, the potential for that project to come together at some point in the future, kind of goes to what happens with other pipes what we end up doing on other pipes versus Apex and then what the market does down there and how it develops. Taking these things all up is a fairly complicated process. And we just want to make sure that there are options out there that we can execute on to make sure the residue flows, whether it's the pipe in '26 that will be needed or a pipe that's needed in '28 as all those facilities down there in the Sabine River corridor come online and have a very strong demand for gas.\nTristan Richardson: Appreciate it, Bobby. And then maybe just a follow-up. I think we all know the scale and the quality of your customers, both in the Midland and the Delaware. But maybe curious to the extent you're seeing any discussion of change in development plans or responding to price signals in the market, even if it's at the margin and on very small customers, but just any comments on maybe the long tail there.\nPatrick McDonie: Yes. This is Pat. Really, we haven't had any change in activity. Activity levels remain high. rigs are running on acreage all around our system, on our system. We haven't -- the big guys obviously are disciplined. They tell you guys what they're going to do, and they continue to execute on their plans. Some of them are a little more back-loaded this year than in previous years. But the rigs are running the wells are getting drilled. The little guys, frankly, we haven't seen any change in activity there yet either. They continue to be very active, and we're bringing on a lot of incremental volumes for the median and smaller guys. So to date, we have not seen a change in activity levels are high.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Theresa Chen with Barclays.\nTheresa Chen: On frac 10, in terms of the time line, that seems to match with when you may be able to move over some of the Y-grade volumes coming off with the legacy loss processing plants onto your own system. Now that you've had these assets under your belt for some time, can you give us a sense of when do you expect that to ramp up higher in the cadence?\nMatt Meloy: Yes. Sure. Theresa, it's Matt. For frac train, whether it's 9, 10 or GCF, we really see that our underlying G&P business and continued volume growth and just execution from our producer customers. We do have some contracts that roll off from time to time. Those are -- most of those are T&F where it'd be more transportation and fractionation. So between now and 2025, we do have some of those. But the lion's share of the need for frac Train 10 is just from underlying continued activity from our producers in our G&P business.\nTheresa Chen: Got it. And then in terms of capital allocation and on the buybacks specifically, I understand that you don't have a programmatic approach to this, and it's more on an opportunistic basis. But just given the volatility in the dislocation in the market we saw during the first quarter, was there a reason why you didn't want to utilize this tool kit this tool in your toolkit more?\nJennifer Kneale: Theresa, this is Jen. You saw us partially utilize the tool by buying a little bit more than $50 million in the first quarter. We also made a $1 billion acquisition of our remaining interest in Grand Prix during the quarter. So part of what we're just trying to balance each and every quarter and then annually is just our spending requirements, whether that be a result of acquisition activity, like in the case of Q1 with the Grand Prix acquisition or other capital spending with the opportunities that we see in the market. And we were able to step in, we believe, when given the opportunity in Q1 in a manner that we are very comfortable with.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Keith Stanley with Wolfe Research.\nKeith Stanley: I wanted to start on the NGL and gas marketing for the quarter. I mean it looks just based on the percentage of margin like a record quarter for the company. So can you talk a little more to the types of activities? I guess did you fully anticipate the strength you saw this quarter as of the last call? Or did you see more opportunities in March? And then just overall expectations for the rest of the year, should we assume you kind of go back to normal on marketing? Or are you continuing to see opportunities to do better?\nMatt Meloy: Yes. Sure. Keith, I'd say when we gave our guidance, part of that was already factored in. The guidance was given in February, we already had some of those seasonal opportunities, I'd say, and saw the strong LPG export market. We really had good performance across traditional kind of NGL marketing, gas marketing and LPG exports, part of which was known when we gave the guidance. So that was factored in to some extent. . As we go forward, I'd say we do see kind of a more normalized level as we go throughout the year. That's why Jen kind of pointed to a weaker Q2. So I think Q2 is going to be a little bit weaker. We don't see those kind of outsized opportunities that we saw in but kind of more normalized as we move throughout the year.\nKeith Stanley: Great. And then I guess just on the frac capacity. So I think you said in your prepared remarks, you were already at 800,000 a day recently, which I think is your capacity and then you reactivate GCF early next year. So can you still grow frac volumes within your system over the balance of the year? Or are you at a point where you need to start offloading a little more already into the second half of the year?\nMatt Meloy: Yes. We do have the ability to grow more. So we said we're around 800. We can do low 800s of Y-grade at Bellevue. We also have our Lake Charles frac, which we can push some more volumes over there. And we do have ability to push volumes to other fracs. And in any given month, we're unloading and offloading back and forth between different players in Bellevue for different reasons. So we feel good about being able to handle all of our volumes between now and when GCF comes on the first part of next year, and then we'll get even more relief when Train 9 comes on. But that gives us comfort that we're going to have volumes for our GCF startup and when it comes on.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Colton Bean with TPH & Co.\nColton Bean: Matt, I thought I heard you reference securing long lead items on two additional plants. So first, I wanted to verify the plural versus singular there. And then any comments on the planning horizon and how you see potential constraints shaping up across your Midland and Delaware footprint?\nMatt Meloy: Sure. Yes, you did hear that correctly. Last call, we talked about long lead items for one plant. Now we're securing long lead items for two plants. So I'd expect us to be greenlighting 1 or both of those plants relatively shortly. So we're kind of signaling that. In terms of constraints, we have had really strong performance. We kind of gave those updates here where we are currently running. We have enough capacity to handle our volumes from processing and transport and frac, but that is why we're adding more capacity along kind of that whole value chain as we see continued growth through the rest of this year, we think it really sets us up for a strong 2024 as our volumes really ramp through the back half of the year, and we'll have more capacity coming on in 2024. For gathering and processing, I'd say it's getting pretty tight on the processing side in both the Delaware and the Midland. The good thing about our plants and just the way our engineering teams have designed these is we have stretched above nameplate. So we're putting in 275 million a day plants. So even when we're at capacity, we can stretch up on these plants and go to, call it, 300 or so on most of these plants. So that gives us good flexibility and we've got gross capacity of almost 6 Bcf a day out there. So if you can move that 10% it gives you a pretty good flex on the processing side. Then on the NGL side, we've been adding pumps on Grand Prix. That's giving us some running room, but that's why we're adding Daytona as we see pretty good line of sight to needing that when that comes on, and then we've talked about the frac expansions. I'd say the other piece that we're looking at. We have an expansion coming on in the export business this summer, one million barrels a month of propane loading. That is our next one. We're taking a hard look at and trying to determine for us what the right next project is for us. So we're still kind of working through that with engineering operations and just timing of our overall volumes when we may need further export expansion.\nColton Bean: Great. And just in terms of planning horizon, I think the latest dated plant we've got right now is Roadrunner II and kind of mid-'24. So should we think about these as being biased to the back half of '24, maybe early '25?\nMatt Meloy: Yes, that's probably reasonable. Yes.\nColton Bean: Great. And then just back on the power supply issues you saw at Legacy II. I guess, one, can you expand on that? And then two, do you see any additional timing risk to ERCOT interconnects as you move toward completion on your other plants?\nMatt Meloy: Yes. So we have Legacy I there already. So we're able to -- using the existing infrastructure. We had some extra capacity, which is why we're running Legacy I is kind of in that it has the ability to be about 100 million a day. If you load up legacy One, we can load Legacy II to about $100 million or so a day. that should be -- we should have all the electricity work done, the infrastructure done later this quarter. So we'll have full access to the full $275 million. That is 1 of our timing constraints as we're putting in future plants. That tends to be 1 of the longer lead items to get put in place is the infrastructure. These plants that we're putting in I mean the last 12 or so plants we put in have all been electric. And it just takes time to get all that situated as it's a very large electric load.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Sunil Sibal with Seaport Global.\nSunil Sibal: So when I look at processing ads in Permian, it seems like one to 1.2 Bcf per day of total processing adds you're going through end I was curious if you know out of that, how much visibility you have on the residue gas take away just as a ballpark page?\nMatt Meloy: Yes. So for the plants that we're putting in, we are connecting to various residue outlets to make sure we have transport intra-basin to Waha that we can then get to market from there. So we'll have connectivity within the Permian Basin for those plants. And then it really just goes to the broader basin is their takeaway out of the basin and what does that look like? We have some compression expansions coming on. We have a long-haul pipes coming on mid next year, which should provide some relief. So it feels like when the long-haul pipe comes on next year, we'll have some runway. But that's why, as Bobby talked about, we're beginning -- we've begun work and discussions on Apex and what this next pipeline is after Matterhorn.\nSunil Sibal: Got it. And my second question was a bit more longer term. Where do you see the balance sheet in terms of credit ratings over the medium to long term. I think some of your competitors kind of looked at shoring up ratings to mid-BBB. Is that the thought process with your team also.\nJennifer Kneale: Sunil, this is Jen. I think that ideally we'd like to be at least a mid-BBB company. And right now, we're sitting one notch lower than that. I think that we have a very strong balance sheet right now. So we're really comfortable with where our leverage ratio is today and the trajectory of that leverage ratio. So ultimately, we believe that we'll continue to execute as we have historically, which is execute across all dimensions of our business plan and then the ratings will be a result of that execution. But I would expect as we continue to manage through this year and into next year and our leverage ratio continues to improve, we'll be looking to inquire about a potential upgrade with the agencies.\nOperator: And your last question comes from the line of Neal Dingmann with Cap securities.\nNeal Dingmann: This is Jamison for Neal. Thank you for the questions here. I know we've touched on this a couple of times, but I just want to go back to the EBITDA guide for the year. I know you end marketing specifically. So I know you guys said marketing was, I guess, a little bit stronger than expected to some extent and that is going to be normalized for the rest of the year. And so given the fact that you also said that volume growth is looking strong for the remainder of the year as well. Just trying to figure out, is there -- does this mean there's upside to the maintained EBITDA guide, given that 1Q strength in marketing? And I said that because I see a bullet in the slide deck that cite higher marketing and optimization, which I don't think was there prior. So just trying to get a sense of, I guess, what implications are there?\nJennifer Kneale: I think as we think about balance of the year, there's always the potential for additional upside in terms of higher commodity prices, if volumes exceed our expectation. If we see more optimization opportunities or if we've got commercial success beyond what we've already got baked into our forecast and that materializes this year. So we'll have to see how the rest of the year plays out. But certainly, you're hopefully hearing our excitement, not only that we have a really strong Q1 under our belt, but also that our outlook is as strong as it is. But we'll have to see what happens with prices and ultimately when volumes materialize. And if we see more volumes than we expect our volumes ramp a little bit more slowly than we expect.\nOperator: And I see no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call back over to Sanjay Lad.\nSanjay Lad: Thanks, everyone that was on the call this morning, and we appreciate your interest in Targa Resources. The IR team will be available for any follow-up questions you may have. Thanks, and have a great day.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a good day.",

The little guys, frankly, we haven't seen any change in activity there yet either. They continue to be very active, and we're bringing on a lot of incremental volumes for the median and smaller guys.

            "name": "Jennifer Kneale",
            "content": "Thanks, Matt. Good morning, everyone. Targa's reported quarterly adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter was $941 million, increasing 12% sequentially as we benefited from increased optimization opportunities in our marketing and LPG export businesses, contribution from our recent acquisition of the remaining 25% interest in our Grand Prix NGL pipeline earlier this year and higher overall system volumes despite lower commodity prices. As we think about the shape of quarterly adjusted EBITDA across 2023, given the benefits of optimization opportunities in Q1 and seasonality in some of our businesses, we currently expect second quarter adjusted EBITDA to be the lowest of the year, ramping from there as our system volumes continue to grow. As Matt mentioned, for the first quarter, we declared a cash dividend of $0.50 per common share or $2 per share on an annualized basis, representing a 43% increase over the first quarter of 2022. Consistent with previous messaging, we expect to maintain the same quarterly dividend for the remainder of the year. We also repurchased $52 million of common shares in the first quarter at a weighted average price of $71.82. As of quarter end, we had approximately $92 million remaining under our $500 million program and now also have a new $1 billion share repurchase program authorized and in place. Our full year 2023 adjusted EBITDA estimate continues to be between $3.5 billion to $3.7 billion, and we expect year-end leverage around the midpoint of our long-term target leverage ratio range of three to 4x. At the end of the first quarter, our pro forma leverage ratio was approximately 3.5x. We are well hedged across all commodities for the balance of 2023 and continue to add hedges for 2024 and beyond. Coupled with our fee floor contracts, we have significantly de-risked our earnings and cash flow outlook while preserving the upside when commodity prices increase. With our plans to move forward with the construction of frac Train 10 in Mont Belvieu, and acquiring long lead items for our next Permian gas plant, we now estimate 2023 growth capital spending between $2 billion and $2.2 billion. There is no change to our current year estimate for net maintenance capital spending of $175 million. At quarter end, we had about $2.6 billion of available liquidity, which provides us with a lot of flexibility looking forward. Maintaining a strong investment-grade balance sheet across cycles continues to be a priority at Targa. We believe that a strong balance sheet and continued investment in high-return projects positions us to continue to prudently return an increasing amount of capital to our shareholders across cycles. Lastly, I'd like to echo Matt and extend a thank you to our employees for their continued focus on safety while executing on our strategic priorities. And with that, I will turn the call back over to Sanjay. This is Jen, Brian. I think we have a very strong balance sheet right now sitting at the end of the quarter around the midpoint of our long-term leverage ratio target range despite making a $1 billion acquisition in the first quarter. And we think that our capital spending really helps to create significant long-term shareholder value and position us to be able to return an increasing amount of capital to our shareholders. As Matt described in his answer to Michael, there is some lumpiness associated with our growth capital spending, particularly around our large projects like Daytona and that means that there are some periods where we may have less free cash flow than other periods. But we believe that this sets us up to continue to execute on really where we already are, which is a road map that says we will continue to maintain a really strong balance sheet. We've got increasing year-over-year EBITDA growth really as far as we can see under a variety of scenarios and then also are able to return increasing amounts of capital to our shareholders through a significantly increasing dividend and also opportunistic share repurchases. I think that's the road map that we've shown over the last couple of years, and I think that's the road map that will continue to follow going forward. Jeremy, this is Jen. We put an ROIC slide in our February materials, partially just to very explicitly highlight just how well, we believe we've been able to invest over the last several years, particularly in projects and opportunities that we consider core. And the spending that we've announced this morning with our frac Train 10 and also additional spending around another Permian gas plant is core. Just like the spending that we're already doing for additional gas plants, fractionation and NGL transportation is core to us. So I wouldn't say that our hurdle rate has really shifted. Continues to be, call it, 5x to 7x. I think that we have been able to execute better than that, partially because our assets are so well utilized when they come online. It feels like we're almost behind every time a new asset comes online. So it's base loaded very quickly, which creates incremental more incremental returns that accrue to us more quickly than maybe before when we grew into our capacity, maybe a little bit more slowly. So I'd say that we continue to look at each and every opportunity and try to really scrub our capital spend plan are in a cycle right now where we are spending a little bit more and partially, that is a result of the lumpiness of some of our bigger projects. But ultimately, it's really across our core value chain, and we believe it's going to generate significant incremental returns for Targa and for our shareholders. To the extent that we get into an environment where we see producer activities slow down, I think we've demonstrated a track record where we've rationalized spending before. When you think about our 2020 spending of $600 million, 2021 spending of just a little bit over $400 million. We clearly have executed previously, where if activity levels are lower, we rationalize our spend. Currently, we just have a lot of expectations given the strength of the producers underlying our G&P systems for significant incremental volume growth. And that's going to necessitate a digital volumes across both our G&P and logistics and transportation footprints. We now have 1 quarter under our belt, so it's always easier to affirm guidance when part of it is already accounted for. And I think Q1 was a really strong quarter for us across the board. Record volumes in a number of different areas, and our employees also did an excellent job of optimizing our assets and generating additional opportunities from our footprint. So as we look out at the rest of the year, prices are lower, but I think we continue to see and expect excellent volume growth, again, really across all of our assets. And that's really what is underpinning our reaffirmation of our guidance despite lower prices. Theresa, this is Jen. You saw us partially utilize the tool by buying a little bit more than $50 million in the first quarter. We also made a $1 billion acquisition of our remaining interest in Grand Prix during the quarter. So part of what we're just trying to balance each and every quarter and then annually is just our spending requirements, whether that be a result of acquisition activity, like in the case of Q1 with the Grand Prix acquisition or other capital spending with the opportunities that we see in the market. And we were able to step in, we believe, when given the opportunity in Q1 in a manner that we are very comfortable with. Sunil, this is Jen. I think that ideally we'd like to be at least a mid-BBB company. And right now, we're sitting one notch lower than that. I think that we have a very strong balance sheet right now. So we're really comfortable with where our leverage ratio is today and the trajectory of that leverage ratio. So ultimately, we believe that we'll continue to execute as we have historically, which is execute across all dimensions of our business plan and then the ratings will be a result of that execution. But I would expect as we continue to manage through this year and into next year and our leverage ratio continues to improve, we'll be looking to inquire about a potential upgrade with the agencies. I think as we think about balance of the year, there's always the potential for additional upside in terms of higher commodity prices, if volumes exceed our expectation. If we see more optimization opportunities or if we've got commercial success beyond what we've already got baked into our forecast and that materializes this year. So we'll have to see how the rest of the year plays out. But certainly, you're hopefully hearing our excitement, not only that we have a really strong Q1 under our belt, but also that our outlook is as strong as it is. But we'll have to see what happens with prices and ultimately when volumes materialize. And if we see more volumes than we expect our volumes ramp a little bit more slowly than we expect."

            "content": "Yes. So this is Bobby. At the end of day, what we want to see is we want to see all the residue move out of the Permian Basin. So whether it's on a pipeline like Apex or a third-party pipeline or 1 that we're a part of. We'll just be excited to see pipelines go. And then as we think about what Apex could look like if it did go we ultimately have no shortage of residue supply to put to a pipe between us and our customers. And I think everybody knows what's going on with the market down there in that general vicinity of the state with LNG and other demand coming on. So as we think about that, the potential for that project to come together at some point in the future, kind of goes to what happens with other pipes what we end up doing on other pipes versus Apex and then what the market does down there and how it develops. Taking these things all up is a fairly complicated process. And we just want to make sure that there are options out there that we can execute on to make sure the residue flows, whether it's the pipe in '26 that will be needed or a pipe that's needed in '28 as all those facilities down there in the Sabine River corridor come online and have a very strong demand for gas."

And as we stated in our remarks, Train 9 is expected to come online in the second quarter of 2024. Given the number of current plants that we have under construction in the Permian and our comments around ordering long lead items for additional plants, we will obviously need to with fractionation capacity for the expected production stemming from our own plants. There have been times over the course of the last few quarters that in order to manage our inventories, the influx of volumes that are coming on to our system. There are times that we have been offloading volumes both on transportation as well as fractionation. So our belief is, is that we have a strong need for frac Train 9 as it comes online. And again, frac Train 10 is trying to stay ahead of the cadence of the number of plants that we are building on the upstream side, along with the overall growth that we're seeing from the industry."

            "name": "Matt Meloy",
            "content": "Thanks, Sanjay, and good morning to everyone. This year is off to a strong start at Targa, and we are very proud of our execution across the company in the first quarter. In Q1, we had quarterly EBITDA that was up 50% over prior year with a lower common share count. Record volumes in the Permian, record NGL transportation and fractionation volumes and strong LPG export volumes. We also finished construction and are in the process of bringing our Legacy II and plant fully online. And we are also returning an increasing amount of capital to our shareholders. We increased our quarterly cash dividend by 43% and executed on $52 million of common share repurchases during the first quarter. With a strong first quarter complete and given the strength of the business fundamentals underpinning our assets, we remain comfortable with our full year 2023 adjusted EBITDA estimate despite natural gas and NGL prices being about 30% and 10% lower than the price assumptions underpinning our 2023 EBITDA guidance range. Natural gas volumes across our Permian systems are growing. Our current aggregate volumes are over five billion cubic feet per day of reported inlet and are expected to ramp as we move through the year, driving incremental volumes through our integrated downstream assets. We have four plants under construction in the Permian and are ordering long lead times for an additional two plants. Given our increasing Permian volumes and resulting NGL supply growth, we announced this morning that we are moving forward with a new 120,000 barrel per day fractionator Train 10 and at our Mont Belvieu complex, which is expected to be online in the first quarter of 2025. With the addition of Train 10 and additional spending on long lead items for our next Permian plants, we now estimate full year 2023 growth CapEx spending to be between $2 billion and $2.2 billion. Investing in organic growth projects across our integrated footprint provides Targa with attractive returns and puts us in a strong position to continue to return incremental capital to our shareholders. Let's now discuss our operations in more detail. Starting in the Permian, high activity levels continue across our dedicated acreage. Our systems across the Midland and Delaware Basins averaged a record 4.8 billion cubic feet per day of reported inlet volumes during the quarter. In Permian Midland, our system has essentially been running above nameplate capacity, absent the impact of first quarter winter weather and is currently operating up over 100 million cubic feet per day versus Q1 average inlet. Our new Legacy II plant partially came online in late March, limited by electricity capacity to the site and is expected to be able to be fully available later this quarter. And kudos to our engineering and operations team for safely bringing the plant online ahead of schedule and on budget. Our next Midland plant Greenwood remains on track to begin operations in late fourth quarter of 2023 and is expected to be highly utilized when it comes online. In Permian Delaware, inlet volumes across our system increased 5% sequentially. Activity in volumes across our Northern Delaware footprint are running strong, and we have bolstered our connectivity across our Delaware assets to handle the near-term growth. Our Midway plan is close to completion and is expected to begin operations later in the second quarter. Our Wildcat 1 and Roadrunner II plants remain on track to begin operations in the first and second quarters of 2024, respectively. We continue to expect volume growth across both our Permian Midland and Delaware positions for the remainder of the year and well beyond. Beyond those projects already announced and in progress, we are evaluating when we will need additional gas processing capacity in the Permian, and we are ordering long lead items for our next Midland and Delaware plant. To that end, some of you may have seen a filing with the Texas Railroad Commission around the proposed gas pipeline we call Apex. This filing allows for preliminary survey work to be completed on proposed routes. Given how rapid we are growing with over 1 billion cubic feet of incremental residue gas from just the plants we currently have under construction, we continue to work to ensure sufficient residue take-away from the basin. As we have said previously, we remain in position to support as needed residue pipes to get Permian gas to market, whether we are leading those efforts or participating with third parties. The next pipe is needed in both our producers and markets on the Gulf Coast are keenly aware of that need. We are also continuing to add intra-basin connectivity and redundancy in both the Midland and Delaware to move residue gas from Targa plants to enhance flow assurance to get volumes from Targa assets to market. In our Central region and the Badlands volumes were sequentially flat during the quarter. Overall volumes remained steady as we are currently not seeing any material change in activity despite lower commodity prices. Shifting to our Logistics and Transportation segment, Targa's NGL transportation volumes were a record 537,000 barrels per day and fractionation volumes were a record 759,000 barrels per day during the first quarter. With the ramp in supply volumes from our Permian systems and third parties, our Grand Prix deliveries into Mont Belvieu are currently averaging around 600,000 barrels per day with fractionation volumes currently running near capacity of around 800,000 barrels per day. GCF will provide some much needed help when it is fully restarted in the first quarter of 2024 and we expect our Train 9 fractionator to open up highly utilized when it commences operations during the second quarter of 2024. Our newly announced Train 10 with an in-service date of the first quarter of 2025 is expected to be much needed given the expected continued growth in our G&P business. Turning to our LPG export business at our Galena Park facilities, we loaded an average of 11.2 million barrels per month during the first quarter as we benefited from increased demand from stronger global market conditions. Our low-cost expansion project to increase our propane loading capabilities with an incremental one million barrels per month of capacity remains on track for mid-2023. We are well contracted across our export facility and continue to expect that 2023 will be a record year for LPG export volumes. We remain excited about the long-term outlook at Targa. Looking ahead, we continue to execute on our strategic priorities will drive increasing EBITDA, a higher common dividend and reduced common share count while maintaining leverage within our target range. We announced this morning that our Board has approved a new $1 billion common share repurchase program, which provides us with flexibility going forward to continue to be opportunistic on repurchases. Before I turn the call over to Jen to discuss our first quarter results in more detail, I would like to extend a thank you to the Targa team for their continued focus on safety and execution while continuing to provide best-in-class services to our customers. And just to add to that, Michael, this is Matt here. We see the underlying growth in our G&P business, and we're pointing that to frac Train 9, 10 and the restart of GCF. So I would suspect others as they're bringing additional fractionation on, they have volumes that they see from their customers and their contracts. We need to make sure we have sufficient fractionation capacity for our underlying G&P business so we can provide an integrated NGL service to our G&P customers. Yes. Michael, it is a little bit tough to do run rate as it does get lumpy during certain years when you have large long-haul NGL pipes, for example, that can be in and give you more runway. I'd also say when we made the acquisition of the North Delaware assets in the summer of last year, there was not sufficient processing capacity. So we do have a little bit of catch-up here with five plants being kind of brought online and ordering long lead time for two, that's likely a little bit heavy, if you were to do a multiyear model. That said, I think we're going to continue to have strong G&P growth. We're going to be needing to continue to add plants. So it really comes down a little bit to the lumpiness of some of the larger projects and the timing of our processing plants. But with our underlying acreage position and strong producer contracts we have in the Permian as long as they keep growing, which we see for years to come, we're going to continue to invest in gathering and processing plants, expanding NGL transportation, fractionation and export. But there could be some lumpiness from year-to-year. I'm not sure exactly which piece on the third party you're referring to, but let me just kind of answer it generally. Here at Targa, we try and really service our existing customers and our gathering and processing business, but we have been for years to get more acreage positions, more underlying volumes in our G&P business to continue to grow that business and then move those NGLs downstream. So we've been very active in managing our existing contracts and going after new customers, new areas in our G&P business. And I'd say the same goes for transportation, fractionation and export is we have a lot of those volumes from GMP moving into our system. Most of those volumes have been moving more towards GMP based on our downstream side versus just third parties that are unaffiliated with G&P. That's been a trend that's been continuing. I don't know that that's really been changing. But that said, our downstream commercial team is still focused on trying to get new business, whether it's for Grand Prix or for our fractionators to provide that level of service for customers, whether they're our G&P customers or just downstream customers. So we're continuing that effort. I don't think that's really changed for us. Yes. Thanks, Tristan. Good question. What really underlines or underlies our overall strategy for residue is to make sure that there's takeaway -- and so we want to support whether it's this Apex pipeline or others, we want to make sure that there's takeaway. We have a lot of volumes in the Permian, a lot of plants coming online. So for us to be able to charge a processing fee and the liquids down Grand Prix and into our frac, we need to make sure we're processing those volumes. We need to make sure that there's residue takeaway. So we are working -- we're doing some preliminary work on Apex. We're also talking to other customers. But I'm going to turn it over to Bobby just to talk a little bit more about that project and what we're thinking there. Yes. Sure. Theresa, it's Matt. For frac train, whether it's 9, 10 or GCF, we really see that our underlying G&P business and continued volume growth and just execution from our producer customers. We do have some contracts that roll off from time to time. Those are -- most of those are T&F where it'd be more transportation and fractionation. So between now and 2025, we do have some of those. But the lion's share of the need for frac Train 10 is just from underlying continued activity from our producers in our G&P business. Yes. Sure. Keith, I'd say when we gave our guidance, part of that was already factored in. The guidance was given in February, we already had some of those seasonal opportunities, I'd say, and saw the strong LPG export market. We really had good performance across traditional kind of NGL marketing, gas marketing and LPG exports, part of which was known when we gave the guidance. So that was factored in to some extent. . As we go forward, I'd say we do see kind of a more normalized level as we go throughout the year. That's why Jen kind of pointed to a weaker Q2. So I think Q2 is going to be a little bit weaker. We don't see those kind of outsized opportunities that we saw in but kind of more normalized as we move throughout the year. Yes. We do have the ability to grow more. So we said we're around 800. We can do low 800s of Y-grade at Bellevue. We also have our Lake Charles frac, which we can push some more volumes over there. And we do have ability to push volumes to other fracs. And in any given month, we're unloading and offloading back and forth between different players in Bellevue for different reasons. So we feel good about being able to handle all of our volumes between now and when GCF comes on the first part of next year, and then we'll get even more relief when Train 9 comes on. But that gives us comfort that we're going to have volumes for our GCF startup and when it comes on. Sure. Yes, you did hear that correctly. Last call, we talked about long lead items for one plant. Now we're securing long lead items for two plants. So I'd expect us to be greenlighting 1 or both of those plants relatively shortly. So we're kind of signaling that. In terms of constraints, we have had really strong performance. We kind of gave those updates here where we are currently running. We have enough capacity to handle our volumes from processing and transport and frac, but that is why we're adding more capacity along kind of that whole value chain as we see continued growth through the rest of this year, we think it really sets us up for a strong 2024 as our volumes really ramp through the back half of the year, and we'll have more capacity coming on in 2024. For gathering and processing, I'd say it's getting pretty tight on the processing side in both the Delaware and the Midland. The good thing about our plants and just the way our engineering teams have designed these is we have stretched above nameplate. So we're putting in 275 million a day plants. So even when we're at capacity, we can stretch up on these plants and go to, call it, 300 or so on most of these plants. So that gives us good flexibility and we've got gross capacity of almost 6 Bcf a day out there. So if you can move that 10% it gives you a pretty good flex on the processing side. Then on the NGL side, we've been adding pumps on Grand Prix. That's giving us some running room, but that's why we're adding Daytona as we see pretty good line of sight to needing that when that comes on, and then we've talked about the frac expansions. I'd say the other piece that we're looking at. We have an expansion coming on in the export business this summer, one million barrels a month of propane loading. That is our next one. We're taking a hard look at and trying to determine for us what the right next project is for us. So we're still kind of working through that with engineering operations and just timing of our overall volumes when we may need further export expansion. Yes, that's probably reasonable. Yes. Yes. So we have Legacy I there already. So we're able to -- using the existing infrastructure. We had some extra capacity, which is why we're running Legacy I is kind of in that it has the ability to be about 100 million a day. If you load up legacy One, we can load Legacy II to about $100 million or so a day. that should be -- we should have all the electricity work done, the infrastructure done later this quarter. So we'll have full access to the full $275 million. That is 1 of our timing constraints as we're putting in future plants. That tends to be 1 of the longer lead items to get put in place is the infrastructure. These plants that we're putting in I mean the last 12 or so plants we put in have all been electric. And it just takes time to get all that situated as it's a very large electric load. Yes. So for the plants that we're putting in, we are connecting to various residue outlets to make sure we have transport intra-basin to Waha that we can then get to market from there. So we'll have connectivity within the Permian Basin for those plants. And then it really just goes to the broader basin is their takeaway out of the basin and what does that look like? We have some compression expansions coming on. We have a long-haul pipes coming on mid next year, which should provide some relief. So it feels like when the long-haul pipe comes on next year, we'll have some runway. But that's why, as Bobby talked about, we're beginning -- we've begun work and discussions on Apex and what this next pipeline is after Matterhorn."

I'll now turn the call over to Matt.\nMatt Meloy: Thanks, Tristan, and good morning to everyone. Before we get started, I want to welcome Tristan Richardson to Targa. Tristan will be leading our Investor Relations and Fundamentals functions after previously working in energy sell-side research for the last 13 years. With Tristan and Sanjay, we are in excellent position to continue to support our investors, analysts and potential investors with our best-in-class team. The third quarter was very strong on a number of fronts, record volumes, record adjusted EBITDA and continued execution across our footprint, which sets us up well for the balance of this year and provides a lot of momentum as we turn to 2025. Given our outperformance through the first 9 months of the year, we expect to beat the high end of our previously provided adjusted EBITDA range, which means more than $500 million of year-over-year growth, exceeding the midpoint of our initially provided guidance range for 2024 by more than $250 million. Over the past several years, we have deliberately taken steps to successfully position Targa across volatile markets, and we are benefiting from those steps. We have largely removed exposure to downside commodity prices, with 90% of our margin now fee-based or supported by fee floor contracts. We have continued to invest in growth capital and attractive opportunities with best-in-class customers with a focus on deals that allow us to move volumes all the way through our integrated system. We have significantly strengthened our balance sheet, and are now a strong investment-grade credit across all 3 agencies. We have returned an increasing amount of capital to our shareholders while maintaining financial flexibility. We believe that these important steps enhance our abilities to generate attractive returns for our shareholders across commodity price cycles. Our excitement around Targa's short-, medium- and long-term outlook begins with our Permian position, and there are a lot of good things going on there. Our new plants have continued to come online, essentially full and given our expectation that our plans in progress will do the same, today, we announced that we are moving forward with our next 2 new Permian plants in response to higher anticipated growth we are seeing and to ensure we keep pace with our producers. We are continuing to enhance our sour gas treating position in the Delaware Basin with additional investments in front-end treating and AGI infrastructure. Our new 800 million cubic feet per day sour gas treater and injection well comes online in early 2025 at our Bull Moose complex, which, along with our current 6 active acid gas injection wells, will increase our treating capacity to over 2.3 billion cubic feet per day in the Delaware. Additionally, we are utilizing and enhancing existing infrastructure to capture and sequester CO2 in the Permian, and we'll be accruing some 45Q tax credits in the fourth quarter of this year and increasing over time. Our Permian growth drives increasing volumes through our downstream assets. Daytona was much needed when it came online. Train 9 has been full since it came online. And Train 10 and GCF are much needed and will be highly utilized. Our premier Permian supply aggregation position, coupled with our integrated NGL system, positions us nicely to continue to generate strong returns on our invested capital and be able to continue to return increasing capital to our shareholders over time. Before I turn the call over to Jen to discuss operations and capital allocation in more detail, I would like to extend a thank you to the Targa team for their continued focus on safety and execution while continuing to provide best-in-class service and reliability to our customers. The growth we are experiencing requires a lot of coordination across our organization, and we are proud of our employees.\nJen Kneale: Thanks, Matt. Good morning, everyone. Let's talk about the strength of our operational results in more detail. Starting in the Permian, our natural gas inlet volumes averaged a record 6 billion cubic feet per day during the third quarter, a 5% increase when compared to the second quarter. Versus last year, our Permian volumes were up 18%, over 900 million cubic feet per day or more than 3 full plants, driving record NGL transportation and fractionation volumes. Our G&P volume growth has led to an acceleration of timing of our processing plants, including the two that we announced today. In Permian Midland, our new Greenwood 2 plant commenced operations in early October, essentially full. Our next Midland plant, Pembrook 2 and East Pembrook, will be much needed and remain on track to begin operations in the fourth quarter of 2025 and second quarter of 2026. The new Midland plant that we announced this morning, East Driver, is expected to begin operations in the third quarter of 2026. In Permian Delaware, we are continuing to benefit from increasing volumes. Our next Delaware plant, Bonus and Bonus 2, will be much needed and remain on track to begin operations in the first quarter of 2025 and the first quarter of 2026. Our next new Delaware plant, Falcon 2, is expected to begin operations in the second quarter of 2026. Shifting to our Logistics and Transportation segment. Targa's NGL pipeline transportation volumes averaged a record 829,000 barrels per day, and fractionation volumes averaged a record 954,000 barrels per day during the third quarter. Our NGL transportation and fractionation volumes increased 6% sequentially as we benefited from increased supply from our Permian G&P systems. Given the anticipated growth in our Permian G&P business and corresponding plant additions, our outlook for NGL supply growth is robust, and our downstream system expansions are very much needed to handle growth from our systems. Our next fractionator in Mont Belvieu, Train 11, remains on track for the third quarter of 2026. In our LPG export business at Galena Park, our loadings averaged 12.4 million barrels per month during the third quarter despite our volumes being impacted by a required 10-year inspection that reduced our loading capability from mid-June through late July. We see continued strength in global demand for U.S.-sourced LPGs, and we remain on track to complete our next expansion, which will increase our loading capacity an incremental 650,000 barrels per month in the second half of 2025. Turning to capital allocation. Our priorities remain the same, which are to maintain a strong investment-grade balance sheet, to continue to invest in high-returning integrated projects and to return an increasing amount of capital to our shareholders across cycles, and we are delivering on those priorities. We are returning meaningful increases in capital year-over-year to our investors. We opportunistically repurchased $168 million of common shares during the third quarter. Through 3 quarters, we have repurchased nearly $650 million of common shares at a weighted average price of $121.50, a substantial increase over $347 million of share repurchases for full year 2023. Our year-to-date repurchase activity means we are in a position to return 40% to 50% of our adjusted cash flow from operations to shareholders this year. This is an acceleration versus previous expectations, driven by the outperformance of the business and our strengthening outlook. We are pleased to announce this morning that we expect to recommend to our board an increase to the 2025 annual common dividend to $4 per share, a 33% increase over the 2024 dividend level. This provides our shareholders with a meaningful year-over-year increase while continuing to maintain our flexibility. Beyond 2025, we expect to be in a position to continue to provide meaningful annual increases to our common dividend per share. We believe that we offer a compelling value proposition for our shareholders and potential shareholders. Growing EBITDA, a growing common dividend per share, reducing share count and excellent short-, medium- and long-term outlooks. We also recently published our 2023 Sustainability Report. Our report reflects that we take our responsibilities of being an operator of critical natural gas and NGL infrastructure seriously and celebrates the continued hard work of our employees. We look forward to your feedback. I will now turn the call over to Will to discuss our third quarter financial results. Will?\nWill Byers: Thanks, Jen. Targa's reported adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter was a record $1.07 billion, a 9% increase over the second quarter. The sequential increase was attributable to higher Permian volumes, which resulted in higher system volumes across our integrated NGL business and to continued natural gas and NGL optimization opportunities in our marketing business. The adjusted operating margin for our Gathering and Processing segment set another quarterly record of $788 million as a result of the strength of volume growth supported by our fee and fee floor contracts. Our Logistics and Transportation segment also set another quarterly record with adjusted operating margin of $717 million, backed by record NGL transportation and fractionation throughput. As Matt mentioned, we now estimate full year 2024 adjusted EBITDA to be above the top end of our previously disclosed $3.95 billion to $4.05 billion range. We anticipate a strong finish to 2024 as our recently completed expansions and capacity additions across Permian G&P and NGL transportation and fractionation support continued volume growth. For the third quarter, our net maintenance capital spending was approximately $60 million. Our current year estimate for net maintenance capital spending remains $225 million. Our net growth capital spending was approximately $700 million for the quarter. Our net growth capital spending for 2024 will depend on our ability to order certain long lead time items before year-end. Among other factors, we currently expect spending to modestly exceed $2.7 billion. The acceleration of spending on infrastructure to handle additional volume growth is expected to increase our net growth capital spending for 2025 and contribute to higher adjusted EBITDA when the incremental plants we announced today are in service in 2026. We continue to expect a meaningful inflection in 2025 free cash flow generation relative to 2024, and we'll provide additional details on 2025 growth capital spending in February once we are fully through our planning process. In August, we extended the maturity of our $600 million accounts receivable securitization facility to August 2025. And we successfully completed a $1 billion note offering of 5.5% coupon senior notes due 2035. The notes offering allowed us to enhance our liquidity position by reducing borrowings under our commercial paper note program, a portion of which was incurred to repay the remaining $500 million outstanding under our prior $1.5 billion unsecured term loan facility which was terminated in May 2024. At the end of the third quarter, we had approximately $1.9 billion of available liquidity. And our net consolidated leverage ratio was approximately 3.6 times, well within our long-term leverage ratio target range of 3 times to 4 times. Moody's upgraded target to Baa2 in early October, reflective of the progress we have made to date and our outlook for the future. We have now achieved upgrades from all 3 agencies in 2024 and have mid BBB ratings and a stable outlook at each of the 3 rating agencies. Maintaining a strong investment-grade balance sheet remains a priority at Targa. Having been at Targa for a little over 3 months now, I am humbled every day by the dedication and tremendous work ethic of the employees of Targa. I'm grateful for the opportunity to be a part of this exceptional team. And with that, I will turn the call back over to Tristan.\nTristan Richardson : Thank you, Will. For the Q&A session, we ask that you limit yourself to 1 question and 1 follow-up and reenter the queue if you have additional questions. Michelle, please open the line for Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Theresa Chen with Barclays. Your line is now open.\nTheresa Chen: Congratulations on the fundamental growth and the accelerated pace of growth over the near term. I was curious, as we look to 2025 CapEx and general capital allocation plans, can you provide more color on how long do you expect this accelerated growth to endure? And B, how high could CapEx go to in 2025?\nMatt Meloy: Yes. No, we're excited about the results today. We're really excited just about the overall performance we've seen so far this year and it's just translating into higher EBITDA growth, higher volumes across our G&P footprint in the downstream. We think that really sets us up well as we look into 2025. In terms of capital spending, as we look to 2025, we've certainly seen an acceleration on the Gathering and Processing side of things. It's resulted in more field level capital for this year, and it's likely to continue into next year, additional pipelines, additional compression, but it's also resulted in acceleration of our plant timing. Earlier in this year, we had a estimate of when we're going to be putting plants on for the next 12, 24, 36 months, and that has accelerated just as our volumes have moved significantly higher. Third quarter was up $900 million a day versus third quarter of last year. We were expecting growth this year, but not that level of growth. So we think that really just puts us in a good position as we go forward. So accelerating Falcon 2 plant and East Driver plant, that's going to drive more capital in 2025. We don't have a number we're going to give you yet. We're still going through our planning process. We plan to give you more details of what our G&P spending is, cadence of any additional plants and our plant timing in February. And on the downstream side, what ultimately that means when those plants come on, generate more NGLs, what that's going to mean for our Downstream business. So that's kind of the planning we're going through now, and we plan to give you more color on that in February.\nTheresa Chen: And looking at the downstream throughput across your doc, clearly seeing an uptick following a partial downtime in third quarter and fourth quarter looks extremely robust. Can you just provide a forward outlook on how you expect this to trend? How much of it at this point do you think it's going to be seasonal versus just the relentless supply push of molecules across your docs through the integrated NGL value chain?\nScott Pryor: Theresa, this is Scott. First off, yes, we had a nice quarter during the third quarter. It was a nice rebound from what we had in the second quarter of this year. So a lot. Even though it was impacted, the second quarter was impacted by the vessel inspection that we had and that lingered into the month of July. So when we look at the back half of third quarter, we certainly had significant increase over the months. And we would see that continuing as we move into the fourth quarter now that we've got the full complement of all of our refrigeration capacity. So I would anticipate during the fourth quarter that the volumes would be very complementary, if not exceed what we saw in the third quarter. We continue to benefit from a variety of sources of demand, both of it on the propane side as well as on the butane side. And we're utilizing really not only our VLGC docs, but we're using some of our smaller docs that complement MGCs and LGCs and moving to markets that are closer than, say, the Far East. So a lot of that benefited as we looked across the third quarter then into the fourth quarter. Moving into 2025, I think it's going to be very much the same story. We benefited as an industry with a number of vessels that have come online, both in '24 and now in '25. We'll continue to see more vessels delivered to the marketplace on both the VLGC side as well as the MGC side. So I think it's just setting itself up to where right now, freight is relatively low, and it puts us in a position to where it's easy to fund supply from the U.S. into the markets across the world.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nJeremy Tonet: So out of the producer activity, I think the producers in the basin, I think we've heard some mixed messages with regards to, I think, the integrated versus large independents versus smaller. And just wondering if you could share a bit more on your conversations with producer customers here and particularly how your New Mexico position, I guess, differentiates you from others in the basin?\nMatt Meloy: Yes. Jeremy, this is Matt. I'll start, and then Pat, if you want to add on. The discussions we're having with producers, it is a mix. The small, mid, large cap, that's -- we have a portfolio of customers, and it's not all the same. But what we are seeing generally is more growth on the gas side relative to their expectations. So we haven't necessarily seen more activity, but we have just seen the wells be more productive. And whether that's lower declines, increasing GORs, higher IPs, we're just seeing more volumes. We continue to be surprised this year to the upside on gas volumes. And as we look out, we're sorting through our producer forecast right now, what that's going to mean for '25, '26 growth. We think there's going to be significant growth. Kind of where exactly that falls out is kind of what we're working through right now. But I think we remain bullish on the outlook for natural gas growth across our footprint. As you look to New Mexico, we've had a really good footprint in the Delaware for some time. But I would say when we acquired the Lucid assets in 2022, to us, they had the best Delaware footprint. And so that fit nicely into our systems that we had. We were able to integrate those systems. And I think when you look at just the rigs, where the activity is, we're kind of have a best-in-class system across the Delaware with a complement of Lucid. So I think we're in a good position to capture the strong activity in the New Mexico area.\nPatrick McDonie: No, I was going to say, the only thing I'd add is, Matt's right. With the Lucid acquisition, it was definitely a step-up for us in the Delaware. And the steps we've taken to integrate that system into our other Delaware systems and the sour gas infrastructure that we've built out have led to a lot of commercial success. The Delaware Basin is growing rapidly. There's a lot of gas over there, and we're positioned very well to take advantage of that.\nJeremy Tonet: And then kind of continuing here as it relates to the gas picture and gas egress from the basin. We have a couple of projects in motion at this point, you're part of 1 of them. How do you think about, I guess, the picture for future gas egress needs in the basin, when do you think that could materialize next? And what do you think Targa's involvement could be here?\nRobert Muraro: This is Bobby. I think we announced our partnership with Blackcomb a little bit ago, we're excited about that project moving forward and it's going well. I think we said before and we'll continue to say, we want to see as much egress out of the basin happen as possible. We know there are a lot of other pipes that are in the works right now. We were thinking about '28 when we were working on the '26 pipe with Blackcomb. So we continue to work on what is needed going forward. With what we're seeing in gas production coming out of the wells, we expect there to be on the margin faster cadence for the need on gas pipe. So if someone else gets another gas pipe done \"today,\" we think that's great for the basin, and we would be excited to see it happen.\nJeremy Tonet: And if I could just round that out a little bit more. In basin consumption growth, industrial demand growth or even maybe data centers down the road, do you see that, I guess, impacting the picture there?\nRobert Muraro: This is Bobby again. I think we know there are a lot of people talking about it right now. We are in conversations with customers that are in conversations with all of those consumption points. So what gets built, when it gets built, what actually gets permitted and put under construction, I think it's yet to be seen. But there is a lot of action and a lot of conversation going on right now across the basin around those topics.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Michael Blum with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nMichael Blum: I wanted to ask about the sort of the long-term trend here in growth CapEx. Obviously, you're trending higher here in the near term. I noticed you still have that same slide, which shows like a typical year at $1.7 billion. So is that still kind of normal year normalized run rate? Or is that number moving higher as producers, these numbers sort of exceed your expectations?\nJen Kneale: Michael, this is Jen. I think that when we put out that illustrative framework, we said that a good multiyear average for growth capital spending in a high single-digit Permian Basin growth environment would be about $1.7 billion. And we even caveated on the slide that if we were going to see growth substantially higher from there, we would expect CapEx to move higher as well. All very much core growth capital spending, the need for more gathering lines, more compression, potentially requiring the acceleration of major growth capital projects like plants and then downstream infrastructure. So the framework still holds for an environment where you're seeing high single-digit growth. As Matt said, so far, we've experienced 18% growth Permian this quarter relative to the third quarter of last year. For the 9 months of this year, we're up 14% relative to the 9 months of last year. So clearly, we are in a more robust environment, and that's resulting in us needing to accelerate some spending for that core infrastructure, additional gathering line compression, plant capital to make sure that we're in a position to handle the increasing growth for our producers. I think Pat also mentioned that we've enjoyed a lot of commercial success this year, and that's resulting in us needing to accelerate infrastructure spend on the G&P side for 2026, when we expect growth to continue to increase versus previous expectations when we provided that in February. So I think absolutely, it still holds together. It ultimately just depends what your view is of Permian growth. And, in particular, Permian growth on Targa's systems, where we are seeing more growth than others. And we very consistently have said that that's the case since we put out that framework in February.\nMichael Blum: Okay. Makes sense. I then wanted to just ask about buybacks. Would you say that you're now more of an almost ratable type of buyback approach? Or is it still very much opportunistic and price-sensitive? And if it's the latter, how do you think about the pace of buybacks as the stock price just continues to move higher?\nJen Kneale: I would say that we are very much continuing to be opportunistic around share repurchases. And that's how we expect to continue to think about it going forward. Our priorities around capital allocation are unchanged. I think that what we've seen this year is a very strong 2024 is resulting in a lot more momentum when we think about '25, '26, '27, '28 and beyond that. We have a lot of conviction in what we have going on here at Targa for the short, medium and long term. And what you're seeing is us opportunistically execute around repurchases based on that conviction. And so I think you should continue to expect repurchases going forward, but they will continue to be opportunistic. We consider a number of different factors in terms of what our daily and quarterly activity looks like. So you should certainly expect some continued variability moving forward, but we do believe it's a very important tool for us to be able to use to return more capital to our shareholders as we move forward through time.\nOperator: And the next question comes from Keith Stanley with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nKeith Stanley: It seems like a pretty meaningful change in your volume outlook, even versus 3 months ago. I mean, you just updated the 2024 and '25 EBITDA and CapEx. So with that in mind, I wanted to just check back in on plans for NGL pipeline spending. Do you envision that potentially now being accelerated into 2025 at this point?\nScott Pryor: Keith -- oh, sorry.\nTristan Richardson: No, sorry, I'll just say -- Scott, go ahead.\nScott Pryor: Okay. Keith, this is Scott. So certainly, when we look at our transportation legs, we looked at the third quarter, we averaged to 784,000 -- excuse me, 829,000 barrels a day of transportation. We got a partial benefit of Daytona coming online in the third quarter. Obviously, in the fourth quarter, we'll have the full complement of our West leg of Grand Prix and then Daytona, and then that marries up with our 30-inch pipe that moves into Belvieu that gets contributions from the North Texas area as well as Oklahoma. So we've got some operating leverage today, certainly on the West leg when you think about those 2 24-inch pipes, and then we've got some operating leverage on the 30-inch pipe. The other thing that we've done in order to really take care of what our growing capacities are relative to what's going on the upstream side is we've entered into some third-party agreements that allows us the opportunity to really push out some capital benefit from the timing of when we would need to basically loop our 30-inch line. So those agreements, along with the operating leverage we have today, really gives us the benefit of time to evaluate what the volume rents look like over time. Those agreements that we've done really are in cadence. They ramp up in volume capacities that match up very well with kind of our near-term plant growth. But obviously, as we continue to add plants on the upstream side, eventually, we'll be in a position where we'll have to loop that 30-inch pipe. We will continue to evaluate that as we move into '25 with our budget process, and we're looking at CapEx. So I think we've got the benefit of time on our side right now with those agreements and the current leverage that we have.\nKeith Stanley: The second question, the marketing was really strong in Q3. Would you attribute that more to spot LPG exports? Or is it optimization around weak Permian gas again? And on exports, it seems like you're constructive on pricing, but any sense of volumes you can share that might be able to take advantage of the strong ARPS?\nJen Kneale: Keith, this is Jen. I'll start. I'd say that it's been a strong year of marketing for us across all of NGL, natural gas and export marketing. We generally don't factor that into our guidance. So when you think about some of the factors that have contributed to our outperformance this year, certainly having a strong marketing year has been one of those variables. I think that as we think -- as we look forward, we expect that given the vastness of our footprint, we would be able to continue to identify strong marketing opportunities. But ultimately, it's really a combination of a lot of factors. And it's driven by the fact that we are moving so much volume across both our gas and NGL systems. That's really affording us some unique marketing opportunities as we move forward through time.\nScott Pryor: And Keith, this is Scott. Just as a follow-up to what we said earlier. The volumes in the third quarter were impacted a little bit due to our vessel inspection. But as we move into the fourth quarter, we would expect that to improve. Again, we benefited on the export side by being able to squeeze other cargoes in, again, the smaller size type vessels because we were playing a little bit of catch-up with the downtime that we had with the vessel inspection in the third quarter. So we'll see if the ARPS continue to be strong, and we'll look for opportunities to optimize around the system.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Jean Salisbury with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nJean Salisbury: I believe that you've said before that most of your producer base has gas egress and hasn't been backed up the last 2 quarters, which I think has really showed in your volume results today. Does that mean that as Matterhorn ramps through the end of the year, you wouldn't really expect an outsized quarter-on-quarter step-up in volumes kind of over the next quarter or 2 as gas gets unlocked from the basin?\nMatt Meloy: Yes, I'll start. We have not seen, I would say, across our producers, really Midland and Delaware, any negative volume impact from not having gas takeaway. We try and work with our customers to make sure that Targa's handling and moving those volumes on behalf of our producers. We have enough firm transport, intra and out of the basin to be able to move those volumes. And then producers on our system that have their own taking kind positions typically have enough transport to get those out. And so we work with them to make sure we can move those volumes. So I wouldn't say that will be a factor in kind of quarter-to-quarter growth. But as you look at just our volume growth across this year, in the last 2 quarters, we've been about 300 million a day, give or take, of volume growth in the second and third quarter. That's higher than normal. I don't know that I'd plug that in for -- plug in another 300 for Q4. I think we're going to have some growth, but it's likely not going to be in a straight line as you kind of move forward. I think we see strong growth going forward, but Q4 is likely to be a bit muted compared to the strength we saw in the second and third quarter.\nJen Kneale: Just to provide a little bit more visibility in the fourth quarter, we do also have a lower margin contract that's rolling over on the G&P side. So that will also reduce volumes quarter-over-quarter. So again, I think that speaks to us not being able to sustain the 300 million a day of growth that we've seen in the last couple of quarters, although we are still performing exceptionally well and are still seeing a lot of volumes come to us. That contractor all over will impact the fourth quarter.\nJean Salisbury: And then it seems like you should have the volume to fill your LPG expansion basically like immediately after it comes online next year. But there's obviously a lot of LPG export capacity coming online at the same time. Beyond that existing expansion, would you consider deploying the strategy that you've discussed of signing up for third-party LPG capacity kind of like what you do for pipelines to defer your own spend from here? Or do you see it as more strategic and value to have your own export capacity?\nMatt Meloy: Yes. I think what we're trying to do the easy debottlenecks, which are really economic for us to just handle kind of the incremental volume growth we see across our footprint. But as this next one we have coming on mid next year, we are right now looking at kind of a larger step up in our LPG exports and bringing on capacity. Others are adding some as well. We're just seeing a lot of NGL volume growth and so are others. So I think it's all going to be needed. So we're currently evaluating right now, the timing and the size of our next LPG export expansion. It's likely going to include pipeline and additional refrigeration. Yes, both of those together is probably around $350 million or so for those 2 pieces. And so that's part of our planning process. And as we think about capital for '25 and '26, when we're going to need that, some of that capital end up in the back half of '25? Or is that a '26, '27, '28 kind of spending? That's what we're sorting through right now. But I do think it's needed. I don't see us in any real meaningful or term way contracting with others to bridge for us. I think we'll handle our own export across our docs on our own volumes.\nScott Pryor: Yes. And just to complement that a little bit, Jean, this is Scott. I would say that the primary pieces that Matt talked about on the -- excuse me, on the refrigeration side and on the pipeline side, as you said, kind of in that $350 million range. We -- and then before that. And even after that, we'll look for ways to kind of debottleneck even around that system by just an improved piping, both at our Belvieu facility as well as at our Galena Park facility. We're an aggregator of supply in Belvieu. So as our volumes start ramping up at that is coming off of our system, puts us in a position to prioritize that volume as opposed to volumes that we could aggregate in and around the Belvieu marketplace. So future expansions, we would look to take care of our volumes, but we would also put ourselves in a position to where we might have some capacity that we could optimize around that as well.\nOperator: And our next question comes from John Mackay with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nJohn Mackay: You guys have had this sour gas footprint for a while now, but you spend a little more time talking about it on this call. So I'd just be curious to hear kind of how much of that pocket of the business could grow from here? What CapEx associated with that could look like? Because it's a little different than a typical kind of G&P build-out. And maybe just next milestones to watch there?\nMatt Meloy: Yes, sure. We have been operating sour gas infrastructure kind of through Targa's history and even going back to the Dynegy days. So we have decades of experience of handling sour gas out there. We've seen the Delaware side continue to get more and more sour. So years ago, we really ramped up our spending to be able to handle more sour volumes out there. And that's really both H2S and CO2. So we mentioned in the call today, we have an 800 million a day treater coming online at our Bull Moose complex. We have additional wells being drilled in the permitting phase to continue to hand more and more volumes as the Delaware gets more and more sour over time. So we think that really does give us an advantage as we look out for growth over the short, medium and longer term. It's a little bit more tricky to handle the sour volumes. It's a little more difficult than just having handling sweet volumes. And so when it's harder, it gives us just better opportunity to work with our producers to handle those volumes. So we see that trend continuing. And I think that leads to some of our optimism about our longer-term growth rate out in the Delaware.\nRobert Muraro: And this is Bobby. If you think about all the plants we've announced over the last several years on the eastern side of the Delaware Basin, even though we don't talk about it, all those plants are sour plans. So we don't talk about that. But if you think about Midway or if you think about Wildcat or if you think about [ Bolus ] or any of those plants, all those are sour plants. We just don't label in that way or we haven't historically as brightly as we do now just because that has obviously become front and center of one of the talking points in the industry.\nJohn Mackay: Maybe just actually a quick follow-up to that then. You talked about getting some 45Q credits in this quarter. We're getting close -- you guys are getting closer to kind of a broader cash tax payment requirement over the next couple of years. Could the 45Qs get to a meaningful size where we're talking about some real offsets there? Or is this kind of nice to have, but a little more on the margin in the grand scheme?\nRobert Muraro: This is Bobby. So I think when you talk about grand scheme, I think it's on the margin, but it is also a nice to have. So when you think about all of that -- all of those assets I just talked about on the eastern side of the Delaware Basin where we are putting in our infrastructure that gathers that sour gas, strips out the CO2 and H2S and injects it. We modified those systems a little bit and then we are able to get 45Q. So it is a very nice complement to that business and very efficient capital to spend in order to get that 45Q. So it turns into something that we don't have to do a whole lot more and be able to capture the 45Q. We continue to develop the CCUS business where it's not required to inject and that's in our forecast over time. But at the end of the day, when you talk about grand scheme of Targa, it is not huge relative to everything else we have going on.\nJen Kneale: And so just to finish that out, John, that means that from our perspective, it doesn't meaningfully change our outlook for cash taxes. As Bobby said, it's a nice to have, but there's really no change to our current expectation that will be subject to the ATM in 2026 and then a full cash taxpayer in 2027 when we've worked our way through our NOL. And that's all inclusive of our full business operations, including the opportunity set around CCUS.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Manav Gupta with UBS. Your line is open.\nManav Gupta: First of all, big congratulations to Tristan. Every time a sell-side analyst is able to do a jailbreak, it feels very nice for the rest of us. There is hope for us.\nTristan Richardson : Well, thank you for that.\nManav Gupta: My quick question, just one of them, is can you provide us more details around Falcon 2 or East Driver plants, why decision to move ahead with them? Anything you can give us on the economics or the build multiple?\nMatt Meloy: Sure. I'd say the economics and build multiple is really the same that we've articulated previously. We've kind of pointed to around 5.5 times as our organic build multiple. I don't see these being materially different from that. So I think it just puts us in position to continue to invest either for our producers and execute on our core business, gathering and processing, and then moving the NGLs through our downstream infrastructure. And the timing of those, as I mentioned earlier, we're just seeing more volumes across both the Delaware and the Midland side of the Permian. And so that's led us to announce those kind of sooner than we were expecting. If you kind of go back to the beginning of the year, we were not anticipating announcing these plants right now and starting this work as soon as we are. But the volume upside has allowed us to accelerate these plants. And then we evaluate the timing of the next plants.\nRobert Muraro: And this is Bobby. As Jen mentioned earlier in the call, Greenwood 2 coming up, highly utilized. At the end of the day, we keep trying to get a plant ahead. We keep trying to create space to be able to overhauls and maintenance and everything else. And this is a continued effort to try to get ahead so we can do all the things we need to do within our system and service our producers at the same time.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Neal Dingmann with Truist. Your line is open.\nNeal Dingmann: Another nice quarter. Welcome, Tristan. My first question is just on your Permian Basin activity outlook. Specifically, I see on Slide 8, you mentioned your associated gas forecast that looks very favorable. I'm just wondering, I'd love to hear sort of what type of rig activity do you are and maybe not the oil price you're assuming around that associated gas forecast?\nPatrick McDonie: Yes. This is Pat. When you look across the Permian right now, one out of every three rigs is running on Targa acreage. So activity level on our acreage footprint is very robust. And obviously, that acreage position that we have tied up is pretty significant. Matt alluded to it earlier on one of the other questions is -- it's producer-specific, right? We are seeing a lot of activity from different sized producers and new formations being explored and developed, some of those very gassy, which leads to gas growth across both Midland and Delaware sides of the basin. Unfortunately, we've had commercial success, additional new commercial success to tie up those plays. So it's the historical stuff we've always seen with the large acreage dedications and the activity and the commitment of very high-grade producers. And then some new stuff that's getting developed that we've been successful in. So when we look across the next 5 years, especially in the next 24 to 36 months, we see a lot of gas growth on our systems and a lot of activity on our systems.\nNeal Dingmann: Yes, that makes a little sense. And then my second question, just on your future capital spend. Specifically, just wondering, would you all suggest there's any possible or potential incredible assets out there that could delay your meaningful 2025 free cash inflection? Or does that novel upside or upcoming inflection appear to be relatively certain?\nMatt Meloy: I think when you just look at just our overall EBITDA growth we're going to have in '25 and with -- haven't given a firm number for capital yet for '25, but I think we're comfortable saying we're going to have a significant amount of free cash flow in 2025. Where exactly that shakes out is kind of what we're working through in our planning process, as we've talked about. Delaying or deferring that, I guess you're implying kind of M&A. We continue to look at assets, bolt-ons in and around our systems. We've continued to look really since the loose of acquisition at assets. But I think just for us, the bar continues to be very high for us. So we'll continue to evaluate. If there's something we can tuck in that looks really nice and has good value for Targa shareholders, we'll look at it. it's just the bar is going to be pretty high. We have a lot of growth on our G&P footprint and our downstream footprint. Our first priority is to make sure we execute on what we have organically in front of us. That's just going to continue to be our priority.\nNeal Dingmann: Yes. The growth is notable.\nOperator: And our next question comes from A.J. O'Donnell with TPH. Your line is open.\nA.J. O'Donnell: Just one for me, and I kind of just wanted to go on a clarifying question to something that Jean brought up. Looking at Q4 volumes and our potential for volume growth and now that Matterhorn is in line. I'm curious if you guys have seen a jump in production from your customers with the new pipe being online? Or if some of the flows that we're seeing online or with that pipe right now is just gas moving around the basin?\nMatt Meloy: Yes, sure. No, from our customers, we -- I would say I have heard of some customers that were not producing because they didn't have -- they either didn't like the Waha price or didn't have takeaway. But customers on our system, they were flowing and producing. So I think basin-wide, perhaps there is some of that. But for our customers, for -- I think the most part, they were producing and had takeaway.\nA.J. O'Donnell: Absolutely. Yes.\nMatt Meloy: So I think what's happening now is volumes kind of coming off, others moving on Matterhorn and it's just trying to find its way out of the basin. But with Matterhorn up and other pipelines online, there should be sufficient capacity at least for a while to handle those volumes. What you're seeing now is some maintenance on some pipes and some other disruptions on existing pipes, which is why our Waha has been kind of flat to negative here recently.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Sunil Sibal with Seaport Global. Your line is open.\nSunil Sibal: So I wanted to start off on the NGL pipeline segment. Seems like ethane prices have been weak lately. So I was curious what kind of ethane recovery trends you are seeing on your systems? And then the Daytona kind of contributing partly for the third quarter, how should we think about volumes on the Daytona system, especially any switchovers from third-party processing plants also?\nScott Pryor: This is Scott. First off, Daytona coming online gives us the ability to obviously flow on both our Grand Prix West system as well as Daytona. So it gives us some operating efficiency around just being able to split volumes between those 2 pipes and gives us a lot of operating leverage, as I said earlier, moving into our 30-inch pipe. When it comes to ethane, certainly, ethane prices sitting around $0.18. There may be some outlying areas that would be looking at rejection type economics. But when you look at the Waha area where gas prices are, I think pretty much most of the industry is in full recovery wherever they can, predominantly in the Permian Basin. And for us, we stay pretty much in recovery mode all the time just so that we can feed our system on all of our integrated platform. So again, I think some of the outlying areas outside of the Permian will probably be in rejection mode just based upon where prices are. But for us, it's pretty much full tilt for us.\nSunil Sibal: And then in the Badlands system, it seems like you had a pretty sizable uptick on the crude volumes. I was curious, is that something we can expect to continue or any onetime items there?\nPatrick McDonie: Yes. This is Pat. We had an uptick in our activity level. We had some producers that have been waiting on permits and another producer, frankly, that hasn't been real active over the past let's say, 3 or 4 years that, one, the activity level from that producer upticked. And secondly, the permits were granted and the wells were drilled. So we got a really nice uptick in our crude oil volumes. And our base level continues. So we expect good activity. I wouldn't say continued robust growth, but good activity level going forward on the system.\nOperator: I show no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back over to Tristan Richardson for closing remarks.\nTristan Richardson: Great. Thanks, Michelle. Thank you to everyone for joining the call this morning, and we appreciate your interest in Targa Resources.\nOperator: This does conclude today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

And the steps we've taken to integrate that system into our other Delaware systems and the sour gas infrastructure that we've built out have led to a lot of commercial success.

            "content": "Thanks, Jen. Targa's reported adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter was a record $1.07 billion, a 9% increase over the second quarter. The sequential increase was attributable to higher Permian volumes, which resulted in higher system volumes across our integrated NGL business and to continued natural gas and NGL optimization opportunities in our marketing business. The adjusted operating margin for our Gathering and Processing segment set another quarterly record of $788 million as a result of the strength of volume growth supported by our fee and fee floor contracts. Our Logistics and Transportation segment also set another quarterly record with adjusted operating margin of $717 million, backed by record NGL transportation and fractionation throughput. As Matt mentioned, we now estimate full year 2024 adjusted EBITDA to be above the top end of our previously disclosed $3.95 billion to $4.05 billion range. We anticipate a strong finish to 2024 as our recently completed expansions and capacity additions across Permian G&P and NGL transportation and fractionation support continued volume growth. For the third quarter, our net maintenance capital spending was approximately $60 million. Our current year estimate for net maintenance capital spending remains $225 million. Our net growth capital spending was approximately $700 million for the quarter. Our net growth capital spending for 2024 will depend on our ability to order certain long lead time items before year-end. Among other factors, we currently expect spending to modestly exceed $2.7 billion. The acceleration of spending on infrastructure to handle additional volume growth is expected to increase our net growth capital spending for 2025 and contribute to higher adjusted EBITDA when the incremental plants we announced today are in service in 2026. We continue to expect a meaningful inflection in 2025 free cash flow generation relative to 2024, and we'll provide additional details on 2025 growth capital spending in February once we are fully through our planning process. In August, we extended the maturity of our $600 million accounts receivable securitization facility to August 2025. And we successfully completed a $1 billion note offering of 5.5% coupon senior notes due 2035. The notes offering allowed us to enhance our liquidity position by reducing borrowings under our commercial paper note program, a portion of which was incurred to repay the remaining $500 million outstanding under our prior $1.5 billion unsecured term loan facility which was terminated in May 2024. At the end of the third quarter, we had approximately $1.9 billion of available liquidity. And our net consolidated leverage ratio was approximately 3.6 times, well within our long-term leverage ratio target range of 3 times to 4 times. Moody's upgraded target to Baa2 in early October, reflective of the progress we have made to date and our outlook for the future. We have now achieved upgrades from all 3 agencies in 2024 and have mid BBB ratings and a stable outlook at each of the 3 rating agencies. Maintaining a strong investment-grade balance sheet remains a priority at Targa. Having been at Targa for a little over 3 months now, I am humbled every day by the dedication and tremendous work ethic of the employees of Targa. I'm grateful for the opportunity to be a part of this exceptional team. And with that, I will turn the call back over to Tristan."

            "name": "Jen Kneale",
            "content": "Thanks, Matt. Good morning, everyone. Let's talk about the strength of our operational results in more detail. Starting in the Permian, our natural gas inlet volumes averaged a record 6 billion cubic feet per day during the third quarter, a 5% increase when compared to the second quarter. Versus last year, our Permian volumes were up 18%, over 900 million cubic feet per day or more than 3 full plants, driving record NGL transportation and fractionation volumes. Our G&P volume growth has led to an acceleration of timing of our processing plants, including the two that we announced today. In Permian Midland, our new Greenwood 2 plant commenced operations in early October, essentially full. Our next Midland plant, Pembrook 2 and East Pembrook, will be much needed and remain on track to begin operations in the fourth quarter of 2025 and second quarter of 2026. The new Midland plant that we announced this morning, East Driver, is expected to begin operations in the third quarter of 2026. In Permian Delaware, we are continuing to benefit from increasing volumes. Our next Delaware plant, Bonus and Bonus 2, will be much needed and remain on track to begin operations in the first quarter of 2025 and the first quarter of 2026. Our next new Delaware plant, Falcon 2, is expected to begin operations in the second quarter of 2026. Shifting to our Logistics and Transportation segment. Targa's NGL pipeline transportation volumes averaged a record 829,000 barrels per day, and fractionation volumes averaged a record 954,000 barrels per day during the third quarter. Our NGL transportation and fractionation volumes increased 6% sequentially as we benefited from increased supply from our Permian G&P systems. Given the anticipated growth in our Permian G&P business and corresponding plant additions, our outlook for NGL supply growth is robust, and our downstream system expansions are very much needed to handle growth from our systems. Our next fractionator in Mont Belvieu, Train 11, remains on track for the third quarter of 2026. In our LPG export business at Galena Park, our loadings averaged 12.4 million barrels per month during the third quarter despite our volumes being impacted by a required 10-year inspection that reduced our loading capability from mid-June through late July. We see continued strength in global demand for U.S.-sourced LPGs, and we remain on track to complete our next expansion, which will increase our loading capacity an incremental 650,000 barrels per month in the second half of 2025. Turning to capital allocation. Our priorities remain the same, which are to maintain a strong investment-grade balance sheet, to continue to invest in high-returning integrated projects and to return an increasing amount of capital to our shareholders across cycles, and we are delivering on those priorities. We are returning meaningful increases in capital year-over-year to our investors. We opportunistically repurchased $168 million of common shares during the third quarter. Through 3 quarters, we have repurchased nearly $650 million of common shares at a weighted average price of $121.50, a substantial increase over $347 million of share repurchases for full year 2023. Our year-to-date repurchase activity means we are in a position to return 40% to 50% of our adjusted cash flow from operations to shareholders this year. This is an acceleration versus previous expectations, driven by the outperformance of the business and our strengthening outlook. We are pleased to announce this morning that we expect to recommend to our board an increase to the 2025 annual common dividend to $4 per share, a 33% increase over the 2024 dividend level. This provides our shareholders with a meaningful year-over-year increase while continuing to maintain our flexibility. Beyond 2025, we expect to be in a position to continue to provide meaningful annual increases to our common dividend per share. We believe that we offer a compelling value proposition for our shareholders and potential shareholders. Growing EBITDA, a growing common dividend per share, reducing share count and excellent short-, medium- and long-term outlooks. We also recently published our 2023 Sustainability Report. Our report reflects that we take our responsibilities of being an operator of critical natural gas and NGL infrastructure seriously and celebrates the continued hard work of our employees. We look forward to your feedback. I will now turn the call over to Will to discuss our third quarter financial results. Will? Michael, this is Jen. I think that when we put out that illustrative framework, we said that a good multiyear average for growth capital spending in a high single-digit Permian Basin growth environment would be about $1.7 billion. And we even caveated on the slide that if we were going to see growth substantially higher from there, we would expect CapEx to move higher as well. All very much core growth capital spending, the need for more gathering lines, more compression, potentially requiring the acceleration of major growth capital projects like plants and then downstream infrastructure. So the framework still holds for an environment where you're seeing high single-digit growth. As Matt said, so far, we've experienced 18% growth Permian this quarter relative to the third quarter of last year. For the 9 months of this year, we're up 14% relative to the 9 months of last year. So clearly, we are in a more robust environment, and that's resulting in us needing to accelerate some spending for that core infrastructure, additional gathering line compression, plant capital to make sure that we're in a position to handle the increasing growth for our producers. I think Pat also mentioned that we've enjoyed a lot of commercial success this year, and that's resulting in us needing to accelerate infrastructure spend on the G&P side for 2026, when we expect growth to continue to increase versus previous expectations when we provided that in February. So I think absolutely, it still holds together. It ultimately just depends what your view is of Permian growth. And, in particular, Permian growth on Targa's systems, where we are seeing more growth than others. And we very consistently have said that that's the case since we put out that framework in February. I would say that we are very much continuing to be opportunistic around share repurchases. And that's how we expect to continue to think about it going forward. Our priorities around capital allocation are unchanged. I think that what we've seen this year is a very strong 2024 is resulting in a lot more momentum when we think about '25, '26, '27, '28 and beyond that. We have a lot of conviction in what we have going on here at Targa for the short, medium and long term. And what you're seeing is us opportunistically execute around repurchases based on that conviction. And so I think you should continue to expect repurchases going forward, but they will continue to be opportunistic. We consider a number of different factors in terms of what our daily and quarterly activity looks like. So you should certainly expect some continued variability moving forward, but we do believe it's a very important tool for us to be able to use to return more capital to our shareholders as we move forward through time. Keith, this is Jen. I'll start. I'd say that it's been a strong year of marketing for us across all of NGL, natural gas and export marketing. We generally don't factor that into our guidance. So when you think about some of the factors that have contributed to our outperformance this year, certainly having a strong marketing year has been one of those variables. I think that as we think -- as we look forward, we expect that given the vastness of our footprint, we would be able to continue to identify strong marketing opportunities. But ultimately, it's really a combination of a lot of factors. And it's driven by the fact that we are moving so much volume across both our gas and NGL systems. That's really affording us some unique marketing opportunities as we move forward through time. Just to provide a little bit more visibility in the fourth quarter, we do also have a lower margin contract that's rolling over on the G&P side. So that will also reduce volumes quarter-over-quarter. So again, I think that speaks to us not being able to sustain the 300 million a day of growth that we've seen in the last couple of quarters, although we are still performing exceptionally well and are still seeing a lot of volumes come to us. That contractor all over will impact the fourth quarter. And so just to finish that out, John, that means that from our perspective, it doesn't meaningfully change our outlook for cash taxes. As Bobby said, it's a nice to have, but there's really no change to our current expectation that will be subject to the ATM in 2026 and then a full cash taxpayer in 2027 when we've worked our way through our NOL. And that's all inclusive of our full business operations, including the opportunity set around CCUS."

            "name": "Robert Muraro",
            "content": "This is Bobby. I think we announced our partnership with Blackcomb a little bit ago, we're excited about that project moving forward and it's going well. I think we said before and we'll continue to say, we want to see as much egress out of the basin happen as possible. We know there are a lot of other pipes that are in the works right now. We were thinking about '28 when we were working on the '26 pipe with Blackcomb. So we continue to work on what is needed going forward. With what we're seeing in gas production coming out of the wells, we expect there to be on the margin faster cadence for the need on gas pipe. So if someone else gets another gas pipe done \"today,\" we think that's great for the basin, and we would be excited to see it happen. This is Bobby again. I think we know there are a lot of people talking about it right now. We are in conversations with customers that are in conversations with all of those consumption points. So what gets built, when it gets built, what actually gets permitted and put under construction, I think it's yet to be seen. But there is a lot of action and a lot of conversation going on right now across the basin around those topics. And this is Bobby. If you think about all the plants we've announced over the last several years on the eastern side of the Delaware Basin, even though we don't talk about it, all those plants are sour plans. So we don't talk about that. But if you think about Midway or if you think about Wildcat or if you think about [ Bolus ] or any of those plants, all those are sour plants. We just don't label in that way or we haven't historically as brightly as we do now just because that has obviously become front and center of one of the talking points in the industry. This is Bobby. So I think when you talk about grand scheme, I think it's on the margin, but it is also a nice to have. So when you think about all of that -- all of those assets I just talked about on the eastern side of the Delaware Basin where we are putting in our infrastructure that gathers that sour gas, strips out the CO2 and H2S and injects it. We modified those systems a little bit and then we are able to get 45Q. So it is a very nice complement to that business and very efficient capital to spend in order to get that 45Q. So it turns into something that we don't have to do a whole lot more and be able to capture the 45Q. We continue to develop the CCUS business where it's not required to inject and that's in our forecast over time. But at the end of the day, when you talk about grand scheme of Targa, it is not huge relative to everything else we have going on. And this is Bobby. As Jen mentioned earlier in the call, Greenwood 2 coming up, highly utilized. At the end of the day, we keep trying to get a plant ahead. We keep trying to create space to be able to overhauls and maintenance and everything else.

            "name": "Scott Pryor",
            "content": "Theresa, this is Scott. First off, yes, we had a nice quarter during the third quarter. It was a nice rebound from what we had in the second quarter of this year. So a lot. Even though it was impacted, the second quarter was impacted by the vessel inspection that we had and that lingered into the month of July. So when we look at the back half of third quarter, we certainly had significant increase over the months. And we would see that continuing as we move into the fourth quarter now that we've got the full complement of all of our refrigeration capacity. So I would anticipate during the fourth quarter that the volumes would be very complementary, if not exceed what we saw in the third quarter. We continue to benefit from a variety of sources of demand, both of it on the propane side as well as on the butane side. And we're utilizing really not only our VLGC docs, but we're using some of our smaller docs that complement MGCs and LGCs and moving to markets that are closer than, say, the Far East. So a lot of that benefited as we looked across the third quarter then into the fourth quarter. Moving into 2025, I think it's going to be very much the same story. We benefited as an industry with a number of vessels that have come online, both in '24 and now in '25. We'll continue to see more vessels delivered to the marketplace on both the VLGC side as well as the MGC side. So I think it's just setting itself up to where right now, freight is relatively low, and it puts us in a position to where it's easy to fund supply from the U.S. into the markets across the world. Keith -- oh, sorry. Okay. Keith, this is Scott. So certainly, when we look at our transportation legs, we looked at the third quarter, we averaged to 784,000 -- excuse me, 829,000 barrels a day of transportation. We got a partial benefit of Daytona coming online in the third quarter. Obviously, in the fourth quarter, we'll have the full complement of our West leg of Grand Prix and then Daytona, and then that marries up with our 30-inch pipe that moves into Belvieu that gets contributions from the North Texas area as well as Oklahoma. So we've got some operating leverage today, certainly on the West leg when you think about those 2 24-inch pipes, and then we've got some operating leverage on the 30-inch pipe. The other thing that we've done in order to really take care of what our growing capacities are relative to what's going on the upstream side is we've entered into some third-party agreements that allows us the opportunity to really push out some capital benefit from the timing of when we would need to basically loop our 30-inch line. So those agreements, along with the operating leverage we have today, really gives us the benefit of time to evaluate what the volume rents look like over time. Those agreements that we've done really are in cadence. They ramp up in volume capacities that match up very well with kind of our near-term plant growth. But obviously, as we continue to add plants on the upstream side, eventually, we'll be in a position where we'll have to loop that 30-inch pipe. We will continue to evaluate that as we move into '25 with our budget process, and we're looking at CapEx. So I think we've got the benefit of time on our side right now with those agreements and the current leverage that we have. And Keith, this is Scott. Just as a follow-up to what we said earlier. The volumes in the third quarter were impacted a little bit due to our vessel inspection. But as we move into the fourth quarter, we would expect that to improve. Again, we benefited on the export side by being able to squeeze other cargoes in, again, the smaller size type vessels because we were playing a little bit of catch-up with the downtime that we had with the vessel inspection in the third quarter. So we'll see if the ARPS continue to be strong, and we'll look for opportunities to optimize around the system. Yes. And just to complement that a little bit, Jean, this is Scott. I would say that the primary pieces that Matt talked about on the -- excuse me, on the refrigeration side and on the pipeline side, as you said, kind of in that $350 million range. We -- and then before that. And even after that, we'll look for ways to kind of debottleneck even around that system by just an improved piping, both at our Belvieu facility as well as at our Galena Park facility. We're an aggregator of supply in Belvieu. So as our volumes start ramping up at that is coming off of our system, puts us in a position to prioritize that volume as opposed to volumes that we could aggregate in and around the Belvieu marketplace. So future expansions, we would look to take care of our volumes, but we would also put ourselves in a position to where we might have some capacity that we could optimize around that as well. This is Scott. First off, Daytona coming online gives us the ability to obviously flow on both our Grand Prix West system as well as Daytona. So it gives us some operating efficiency around just being able to split volumes between those 2 pipes and gives us a lot of operating leverage, as I said earlier, moving into our 30-inch pipe. When it comes to ethane, certainly, ethane prices sitting around $0.18. There may be some outlying areas that would be looking at rejection type economics. But when you look at the Waha area where gas prices are, I think pretty much most of the industry is in full recovery wherever they can, predominantly in the Permian Basin. And for us, we stay pretty much in recovery mode all the time just so that we can feed our system on all of our integrated platform. So again, I think some of the outlying areas outside of the Permian will probably be in rejection mode just based upon where prices are. But for us, it's pretty much full tilt for us."

            "name": "Matt Meloy",
            "content": "Thanks, Tristan, and good morning to everyone. Before we get started, I want to welcome Tristan Richardson to Targa. Tristan will be leading our Investor Relations and Fundamentals functions after previously working in energy sell-side research for the last 13 years. With Tristan and Sanjay, we are in excellent position to continue to support our investors, analysts and potential investors with our best-in-class team. The third quarter was very strong on a number of fronts, record volumes, record adjusted EBITDA and continued execution across our footprint, which sets us up well for the balance of this year and provides a lot of momentum as we turn to 2025. Given our outperformance through the first 9 months of the year, we expect to beat the high end of our previously provided adjusted EBITDA range, which means more than $500 million of year-over-year growth, exceeding the midpoint of our initially provided guidance range for 2024 by more than $250 million. Over the past several years, we have deliberately taken steps to successfully position Targa across volatile markets, and we are benefiting from those steps. We have largely removed exposure to downside commodity prices, with 90% of our margin now fee-based or supported by fee floor contracts. We have continued to invest in growth capital and attractive opportunities with best-in-class customers with a focus on deals that allow us to move volumes all the way through our integrated system. We have significantly strengthened our balance sheet, and are now a strong investment-grade credit across all 3 agencies. We have returned an increasing amount of capital to our shareholders while maintaining financial flexibility. We believe that these important steps enhance our abilities to generate attractive returns for our shareholders across commodity price cycles. Our excitement around Targa's short-, medium- and long-term outlook begins with our Permian position, and there are a lot of good things going on there. Our new plants have continued to come online, essentially full and given our expectation that our plans in progress will do the same, today, we announced that we are moving forward with our next 2 new Permian plants in response to higher anticipated growth we are seeing and to ensure we keep pace with our producers. We are continuing to enhance our sour gas treating position in the Delaware Basin with additional investments in front-end treating and AGI infrastructure. Our new 800 million cubic feet per day sour gas treater and injection well comes online in early 2025 at our Bull Moose complex, which, along with our current 6 active acid gas injection wells, will increase our treating capacity to over 2.3 billion cubic feet per day in the Delaware. Additionally, we are utilizing and enhancing existing infrastructure to capture and sequester CO2 in the Permian, and we'll be accruing some 45Q tax credits in the fourth quarter of this year and increasing over time. Our Permian growth drives increasing volumes through our downstream assets. Daytona was much needed when it came online. Train 9 has been full since it came online. And Train 10 and GCF are much needed and will be highly utilized. Our premier Permian supply aggregation position, coupled with our integrated NGL system, positions us nicely to continue to generate strong returns on our invested capital and be able to continue to return increasing capital to our shareholders over time. Before I turn the call over to Jen to discuss operations and capital allocation in more detail, I would like to extend a thank you to the Targa team for their continued focus on safety and execution while continuing to provide best-in-class service and reliability to our customers. The growth we are experiencing requires a lot of coordination across our organization, and we are proud of our employees. Yes. No, we're excited about the results today. We're really excited just about the overall performance we've seen so far this year and it's just translating into higher EBITDA growth, higher volumes across our G&P footprint in the downstream. We think that really sets us up well as we look into 2025. In terms of capital spending, as we look to 2025, we've certainly seen an acceleration on the Gathering and Processing side of things. It's resulted in more field level capital for this year, and it's likely to continue into next year, additional pipelines, additional compression, but it's also resulted in acceleration of our plant timing. Earlier in this year, we had a estimate of when we're going to be putting plants on for the next 12, 24, 36 months, and that has accelerated just as our volumes have moved significantly higher. Third quarter was up $900 million a day versus third quarter of last year. We were expecting growth this year, but not that level of growth. So we think that really just puts us in a good position as we go forward. So accelerating Falcon 2 plant and East Driver plant, that's going to drive more capital in 2025. We don't have a number we're going to give you yet. We're still going through our planning process. We plan to give you more details of what our G&P spending is, cadence of any additional plants and our plant timing in February. And on the downstream side, what ultimately that means when those plants come on, generate more NGLs, what that's going to mean for our Downstream business. So that's kind of the planning we're going through now, and we plan to give you more color on that in February. Yes. Jeremy, this is Matt. I'll start, and then Pat, if you want to add on. The discussions we're having with producers, it is a mix. The small, mid, large cap, that's -- we have a portfolio of customers, and it's not all the same. But what we are seeing generally is more growth on the gas side relative to their expectations. So we haven't necessarily seen more activity, but we have just seen the wells be more productive. And whether that's lower declines, increasing GORs, higher IPs, we're just seeing more volumes. We continue to be surprised this year to the upside on gas volumes. And as we look out, we're sorting through our producer forecast right now, what that's going to mean for '25, '26 growth. We think there's going to be significant growth. Kind of where exactly that falls out is kind of what we're working through right now. But I think we remain bullish on the outlook for natural gas growth across our footprint. As you look to New Mexico, we've had a really good footprint in the Delaware for some time. But I would say when we acquired the Lucid assets in 2022, to us, they had the best Delaware footprint. And so that fit nicely into our systems that we had. We were able to integrate those systems. And I think when you look at just the rigs, where the activity is, we're kind of have a best-in-class system across the Delaware with a complement of Lucid. So I think we're in a good position to capture the strong activity in the New Mexico area. Yes, I'll start. We have not seen, I would say, across our producers, really Midland and Delaware, any negative volume impact from not having gas takeaway. We try and work with our customers to make sure that Targa's handling and moving those volumes on behalf of our producers. We have enough firm transport, intra and out of the basin to be able to move those volumes. And then producers on our system that have their own taking kind positions typically have enough transport to get those out. And so we work with them to make sure we can move those volumes. So I wouldn't say that will be a factor in kind of quarter-to-quarter growth. But as you look at just our volume growth across this year, in the last 2 quarters, we've been about 300 million a day, give or take, of volume growth in the second and third quarter. That's higher than normal. I don't know that I'd plug that in for -- plug in another 300 for Q4. I think we're going to have some growth, but it's likely not going to be in a straight line as you kind of move forward. I think we see strong growth going forward, but Q4 is likely to be a bit muted compared to the strength we saw in the second and third quarter. Yes. I think what we're trying to do the easy debottlenecks, which are really economic for us to just handle kind of the incremental volume growth we see across our footprint. But as this next one we have coming on mid next year, we are right now looking at kind of a larger step up in our LPG exports and bringing on capacity. Others are adding some as well. We're just seeing a lot of NGL volume growth and so are others. So I think it's all going to be needed. So we're currently evaluating right now, the timing and the size of our next LPG export expansion. It's likely going to include pipeline and additional refrigeration. Yes, both of those together is probably around $350 million or so for those 2 pieces. And so that's part of our planning process. And as we think about capital for '25 and '26, when we're going to need that, some of that capital end up in the back half of '25? Or is that a '26, '27, '28 kind of spending? That's what we're sorting through right now. But I do think it's needed. I don't see us in any real meaningful or term way contracting with others to bridge for us. I think we'll handle our own export across our docs on our own volumes. Yes, sure. We have been operating sour gas infrastructure kind of through Targa's history and even going back to the Dynegy days. So we have decades of experience of handling sour gas out there. We've seen the Delaware side continue to get more and more sour. So years ago, we really ramped up our spending to be able to handle more sour volumes out there. And that's really both H2S and CO2. So we mentioned in the call today, we have an 800 million a day treater coming online at our Bull Moose complex. We have additional wells being drilled in the permitting phase to continue to hand more and more volumes as the Delaware gets more and more sour over time. So we think that really does give us an advantage as we look out for growth over the short, medium and longer term. It's a little bit more tricky to handle the sour volumes. It's a little more difficult than just having handling sweet volumes. And so when it's harder, it gives us just better opportunity to work with our producers to handle those volumes. So we see that trend continuing. And I think that leads to some of our optimism about our longer-term growth rate out in the Delaware. Sure. I'd say the economics and build multiple is really the same that we've articulated previously. We've kind of pointed to around 5.5 times as our organic build multiple. I don't see these being materially different from that. So I think it just puts us in position to continue to invest either for our producers and execute on our core business, gathering and processing, and then moving the NGLs through our downstream infrastructure. And the timing of those, as I mentioned earlier, we're just seeing more volumes across both the Delaware and the Midland side of the Permian. And so that's led us to announce those kind of sooner than we were expecting. If you kind of go back to the beginning of the year, we were not anticipating announcing these plants right now and starting this work as soon as we are. But the volume upside has allowed us to accelerate these plants. And then we evaluate the timing of the next plants. I think when you just look at just our overall EBITDA growth we're going to have in '25 and with -- haven't given a firm number for capital yet for '25, but I think we're comfortable saying we're going to have a significant amount of free cash flow in 2025. Where exactly that shakes out is kind of what we're working through in our planning process, as we've talked about. Delaying or deferring that, I guess you're implying kind of M&A. We continue to look at assets, bolt-ons in and around our systems. We've continued to look really since the loose of acquisition at assets. But I think just for us, the bar continues to be very high for us. So we'll continue to evaluate. If there's something we can tuck in that looks really nice and has good value for Targa shareholders, we'll look at it. it's just the bar is going to be pretty high. We have a lot of growth on our G&P footprint and our downstream footprint. Our first priority is to make sure we execute on what we have organically in front of us. That's just going to continue to be our priority. Yes, sure. No, from our customers, we -- I would say I have heard of some customers that were not producing because they didn't have -- they either didn't like the Waha price or didn't have takeaway. But customers on our system, they were flowing and producing. So I think basin-wide, perhaps there is some of that. But for our customers, for -- I think the most part, they were producing and had takeaway. So I think what's happening now is volumes kind of coming off, others moving on Matterhorn and it's just trying to find its way out of the basin. But with Matterhorn up and other pipelines online, there should be sufficient capacity at least for a while to handle those volumes. What you're seeing now is some maintenance on some pipes and some other disruptions on existing pipes, which is why our Waha has been kind of flat to negative here recently."

After the speaker presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker, Sanjay Lad, Vice President, Finance and Investor Relations. The floor is yours, sir.\nSanjay Lad: Thanks, Shari. Good morning, and welcome to the second quarter 2024 earnings call for Targa Resources Corp. The second quarter earnings release, along with the second quarter earnings supplement presentation for Targa that accompanying our call are available on our website at targaresources.com in the Investors section. In addition, an updated investor presentation has also been posted to our website. Statements made during this call that might include Targa's or expectations or predictions should be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in forward-looking statements.

Additionally, the following senior management team members will be available for Q&A: Pat McDonie, President, Gathering and Processing; Scott Pryor, President, Logistics and Transportation; Bobby Muraro, Chief Commercial Officer; and Will Byers, Chief Financial Officer. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Matt.\nMatt Meloy: Thanks, Sanjay, and good morning to everyone. We had another record quarter across multiple fronts. But before we get into all the good things happening here at Targa, I would like to first recognize all our employees impacted by Hurricane Beryl. We prepared for the storm, weathered the storm and performed across a difficult period to safely keep volumes flowing, providing best-in-class service when many of our employees were also managing without power and had damage to their homes. The hard work and dedication demonstrated during the storm is really something to be proud of. So I'd like to say thank you to the Targa team for all the extra effort. The storms reduced our volumes for only a short period, so we expect the impact on the third quarter to be minimal as there was no material damage to any of our assets. I would also like to welcome Will Byers, Targa's new Chief Financial Officer to our call this morning. Will officially joined us on July 22, and we're excited to have him as part of the Targa team. We'll add a lot of depth to our organization, given his 20-plus years of midstream finance experience, including serving in CFO roles over the last 10 years. As part of Jen's continued development, she has now transitioned into the role of President, Finance and Administration and will continue to increase her role and responsibilities. Turning now to our second quarter results, it was another strong quarter of performance across our organization, which sets us up well for the balance of this year and beyond. Record volumes in the Permian drove record NGL transportation and fractionation volumes downstream and record quarterly adjusted EBITDA. We brought our Train 9 fractionator in Mont Belvieu and our Roadrunner II plant in Permian Delaware online, on time, on budget. And given increasing volumes across our systems, they were both very much needed. We also executed on a quarterly record $355 million of common share repurchases which is reflective of our performance and strong conviction and the outlook for our business going forward. We also just announced our participation in a joint venture supporting the next natural gas pipeline from the Permian Basin. We provided a meaningful volume commitment to support the project, and this provides for a 17.5% ownership interest in the Blackcomb pipeline. Blackcomb will be a 42-inch pipeline transporting gas from the Permian to South Texas. The pipeline is expected to be project financed, so Targa's capital investment should be less than $200 million. Now let's talk a little more about our Permian position and the good things happening there. Activity in the Permian remains very strong, supporting our view of continued long-term growth from the basin. Our Permian volumes during the second quarter increased about 275 million cubic feet per day over the first quarter, which is a full plant. And year-over-year, our volumes in the Permian are up more than 600 million cubic feet per day. And currently, our volumes in the Permian are up another 200 million cubic feet per day compared to the second quarter. We expected strong growth from our Permian assets, but the growth we have seen this year has exceeded our expectations. We now expect low double-digit percentage volume growth this year, which sets us up well for meaningful growth in 2025 and beyond. This higher growth rate is driving incremental EBITDA and requiring additional growth capital investment. These volumes are core to our business, and we benefit across the integrated NGL value chain, driving higher margins into our downstream business and generating strong ROIC. Given higher-than-anticipated Permian volumes and an outlook for continued strong activity across our Midland and Delaware footprint, we announced our next two plants in the Permian, one in the Midland Basin and another in the Delaware Basin. Some spending for these plans was included in the forecast we provided back in February, but the timing and cadence of spending has accelerated. To support our higher volume and higher EBITDA profile, we are updating our estimate for growth capital spending for 2024, so approximately $2.7 billion. This increase or the increase in growth capital spend from our previously provided range is attributable to the acceleration of timing of plants in the Permian, incremental field capital compression and gathering lines the acceleration of downstream infrastructure connections and other opportunities like spending on enhancing residue gas takeaway. Similarly, we expect stronger than previously estimated Permian volume growth next year and are updating our 2025 estimate for capital spending to $1.7 billion, driven by a similar acceleration of plant and field capital and our investment in Blackcomb. We included a bridge on Slide 5 in our Q2 earnings supplement presentation for our updated estimates for 2024 and 2025 growth capital. The strength of our first half 2024 performance and continued strong outlook going forward driven largely by higher Permian volumes and higher volumes through our integrated system means the updated midpoint estimate. For our full year 2024 adjusted EBITDA is $4 billion, which is a $200 million or 5% increase from our previous estimate. We now expect higher adjusted EBITDA in 2025 and a similar free cash flow estimate to when we compare our outlook -- to when we provided our outlook in February, with 2025 representing an important inflection for our company as our meaningful free cash flow generation positions us to continue to return an increasing amount of capital to our shareholders, while further strengthening our investment-grade balance sheet. We believe that we are uniquely positioned for the short, medium and long term as an already strong outlook for Permian Basin volume growth from best-in-class producers continues to get stronger, which benefits our entire integrated value chain. Our contract structures support us continuing to invest on behalf of our producers, benefiting from cash flow stability and lower commodity price environments and upside as prices rise. And we are delivering record financial performance despite a weak commodity price backdrop. Before I turn the call over to Jen to discuss our second quarter results in more detail, I'd like to extend a thank you to the Targa team for their continued focus on safety and execution, while continuing to provide best-in-class service and reliability to our customers.\nJen Kneale: Thanks, Matt. Good morning, everyone. Targa's reported quarterly adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter was a record $984 million, a 2% increase over the first quarter. For the second quarter, our natural gas inlet volumes in the Permian averaged a record 5.7 billion cubic feet per day. Our NGL pipeline transportation volumes averaged a record 784,000 barrels per day. Our fractionation volumes averaged a record 902,000 barrels per day at our Mont Belvieu complex, and our LPG export loadings averaged 12 million barrels per month. Let's talk about our operational results in more detail. Starting in the Permian, our reported second quarter inlet volumes increased 5% when compared to the first quarter. In Permian Midland, our system is running near capacity, and our new Greenwood II plant is expected to be highly utilized when it comes online in the fourth quarter of 2024. Our next Midland plant, Pembrook II, will be much needed and remains on track to begin operations in the fourth quarter of 2025. As Matt mentioned, today, we announced that we are moving forward with our latest Midland plant, East Pembrook which is expected to begin operations in the third quarter of 2026. In Permian Delaware, activity and volumes across our footprint are also strong. Our Roadrunner II plant commenced operations in late May and was fully utilized after startup. We are accelerating the timing of our next Delaware plant, [indiscernible], which is now expected to come online in the first quarter of 2025 and is also expected to come online highly utilized [ph]. Today, we announced that we are moving forward with our latest Delaware plant, Bull Moose II, which is expected to begin operations in the first quarter of 2026. Shifting to our Logistics and Transportation segment. Construction on our Daytona NGL pipeline expansion has been going well, and we believe that we may be able to bring the pipeline fully online earlier than estimated. Our Train 9 fractionator in Mont Belvieu came online full in May, and we are currently starting operations at our Gulf Coast fractionator joint venture, and we expect our portion of the capacity to be highly utilized at start-up. Construction on our Train 10 and Train 11 fractionators in Mont Belvieu continues, and our fracs are expected to be much needed when they come online, given our outlook for increasing Permian volume growth and resulting NGL volume growth to Mont Belvieu. Train 10 is now expected to begin operations late in the fourth quarter of this year and Train 11 is expected to begin operations in the third quarter of 2026. In our LPG export business at Galena Park, our second quarter volumes were impacted by a required 10-year inspection that reduced our loading capability in the second half of June through late July. We continue to benefit from nighttime transits and fully expect that to be a permanent benefit going forward. We remain on track to complete our expansion, which will increase our loading capacity and incremental 650,000 barrels per month in the second half of 2025. The strength of our performance in the second quarter with the backdrop of negative Waha gas prices and low NGL prices demonstrates that by investing in opportunities backed by fee-based and fee floor contracts, we are able to successfully invest across cycles to continue to support the infrastructure needs of our customers. We have largely removed exposure to downside commodity prices from our enterprise-wide risk profile, and given the strength of our outlook, also recently added hedges to further increase our cash flow stability. As described previously, 90% of our margin is fee-based or supported by fee floor contracts. The remaining 10% is exposed to commodity prices. Of that remaining 10% of exposure, we have now hedged approximately 90% of volumes across commodities through 2026. As commodity prices move higher, we will benefit from that upside through our fee floor contracts. Turning to the balance sheet. At quarter end, we had $1.6 billion of available liquidity, and our consolidated net leverage ratio was 3.6 times, well within our long-term leverage ratio target range of three to four times. During the second quarter, we repaid the $500 million balance on our term loan and the term loan is no longer outstanding. Shifting to capital allocation. Our priorities remain the same, which are to maintain a strong investment-grade balance sheet to continue to invest in high-returning integrated projects and to return an increasing amount of capital to our shareholders across cycles, and we are delivering on those priorities. Our outperformance is leading to deleveraging faster than we previously forecasted, creating incremental capacity to enhance our return of capital. Supported by the strength of our business outlook, we repurchased a record $355 million of common shares in the second quarter at a weighted average price of $118.91. This week, our Board of Directors also authorized a new $1 billion common share repurchase authorization, and we continue to expect to be in a position to return capital to our shareholders through opportunistic repurchases. We are continuing to model the ability over time to return 40% to 50% of adjusted cash flow from operations to equity holders and believe that is a useful framework for thinking about Targa's return of capital proposition. Our talented Targa team continues to execute on our strategic priorities across the organization and safely operate our assets to deliver the energy that enhances our everyday lives. And I would like to echo Matt, thank you to all of our employees. And with that, I will turn the call back over to Sanjay.\nSanjay Lad: Thanks, Jen. For the Q&A session, we kindly ask that you limit to one question and one follow-up and reenter the lineup if you have additional questions. Sheri, would you please open the line for Q&A?\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nJeremy Tonet: Hi. Good morning.\nMatt Meloy: Hey, good morning.\nPat McDonie: Good morning.\nJen Kneale: Good morning.\nJeremy Tonet: I just wanted to touch on the guidance raise here a little bit. Especially the free cash flow inflection and just wanted to understand that a little bit better, whether that is absolute dollars or rate of change or just any other, I guess, way you could bracket what that means?\nMatt Meloy: Yes. Hey, Jeremy. Yes, we raised our guidance for this year. It's really underpinned by the strength and the volume that we've seen, not only so far this year, but also just our expectations for the back half of the year and then leading into 2025. Producers just really continue to have high levels of activity across our system, and we received numerous, I think, kind of revisions to the short, medium-term outlook from our producers across our system. So, that let us feel really good about the EBITDA this year, and positioned us well going into 2025 and strong activity in 2025. So, when you look at our overall EBITDA growth that we expect, coupled with the CapEx moving from $1.4 billion to $1.7 billion, we see a similar -- really similar dollar amount of free cash flow to what we saw when we gave kind of the original outlook back in February of this year.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. That's helpful. Thank you for that. And then looking across, it seems like the implied GPM across the processing fleet stepped up quite nicely in 2Q. Just wondering how much of that was tied to better ethane extraction economics in the quarter? How sustainable is the volume uplift in downstream? Just trying to understand that better, particularly, I guess, with Daytona tracking well, it seems?\nMatt Meloy: Yes, I don't think we've seen anything really fundamentally different from the production side. We had higher recoveries in the second quarter relative to the first quarter. Is what drove the higher recovery GPM. I think the underlying volumes are similar. Pat?\nPat McDonie: No, they are. I mean we had some periods of ethane rejection in the first quarter. That, coupled with some weather issues at times, and we've been in full recovery during the second quarter.\nJenn Kneale: Very tight gas market in the Permian in the second quarter. And so that's another reason that you saw our recoveries improve.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. And just the last part with Daytona, if that's tracking early, any impact there, I guess?\nScott Pryor: Yes, Jeremy, this is Scott. The construction on Daytona has gone very well. When you enter into construction of a long-haul pipeline of this size and at this distance, you would anticipate once you get in the construction phase that you might have delays relative to weather or just in general construction delays. But for us, quarter in and quarter out, we've seen improvements. The Targa team has done an excellent job installing that pipe. And I would not be surprised if it actually comes online sometime during this quarter, the third quarter of this year. So, very pleased with the timeline.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. That's very helpful. I'll leave it there. thanks.\nMatt Meloy: Okay, thanks Jeremy.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question and that will come from the line of Spiro Dounis with Citi. Your line is open.\nSpiro Dounis: Thanks, operator. Good morning everybody. First part is just a two-part question on volume growth. I think as we headed into the year, the messaging for you all was that maybe Targa start to sort of reflect basin growth kind of more broadly, but it seems like you're sort of back in that mode or you're growing at an accelerated pace. Maybe one, can you just touch on the dynamics there? What's going on in your system that's driving that accelerated growth versus the base on average? How long does that last? And then as we think beyond the near term, maybe just thinking around cadence between the next frac and maybe even pipeline expansion in Europe, this keeps up?\nMatt Meloy: Yes, sure. I'll start, and then Pat, you can hop in. I mean, we've over the last several years, have really outperformed the basin. Our team has done a really good job at servicing our existing customers, but also having commercial success really across the Delaware and the Midland. We also have our assets, well, we have a wide -- kind of a wide area that we cover. We are in the best spots of the Midland, and we're in the best spots and most active spots in the Delaware as well. So, I think we benefit from that. We've seen this year continued strong activity from producers, but we've also seen revisions from our producers of the forecast they've given us. And the level of volumes that they're expecting to come across our system for 2024 and 2025. I'd say this year, we've seen more positive revisions than we have in other years. So, we've just benefited more from that. Maybe just goes to Targa's overall positioning and strong user activity. You have anything to add to that?\nPat McDonie: I think the key components there, Matt, are exactly what you said. Large footprint, fungible system underpinned by millions of acres of dedication on both the Delaware and Midland side of the basin, and that's with producers that are committed to growing the Permian Basin production outlook. So, when I look at the Midland system, it's pretty easy, right? We've been there for a long time. We've had that system. It is on the core, the core of the best rock in the basin. And then with the Lucid acquisition we did a couple of years ago now, that allowed us to get that same type of position in the Delaware Basin, where we are in the core of the core, covering the best rock, a great group of producers, again, underpinned by multimillion acre dedications with producers, again, that are committed to developing and growing their production in the Permian. And I think the one thing we left out in all of that is, we continue to have commercial success. We've had a lot of commercial success early in the Midland Basin and recently in the Delaware Basin that is additive to that footprint that we've already had in place for a good period of time.\nSpiro Dounis: Got it. And as you think about the cadence for that next frac pipeline expansion, is that still kind of far enough out? Or does that seem like that's accelerating too?\nScott Pryor: Spiro, this is Scott again. I'll first start on the pipeline side of things. Certainly, with Daytona coming online, likely during this quarter, that gives us a lot of operational leverage as it relates to the volumes coming out of the west from the Permian along those 2 lines. So we've got the Grand Prix line, the original West line, we've got Daytona and with a lot of operational leverage with that. Then that ties into our trunk line that feeds into Mont Belvieu, where we've got some operational leverage as well. So we feel really good about where we are positioned there. I will say that with the cadence of the plants that Pat and his team have been successful at executing on and we look at the volume growth that we have. We've actually done some third-party contracts out there given the number of announcements you've seen on Y-grade pipeline coming out of the Permian, we feel as though there's a little bit of overcapacity, and we're in a position to at reasonable prices to do a term contract with the volume growth that we see on that. The likelihood is, again, with additional capacity that's out there, we'll look for some additional contracts that we can do. Again, as long as the prices are reasonable, it will allow us to push out the next expansion that we might have to have on our pipeline system and defer capital further out. So that puts us in a good position. As we look at frac side, certainly, we benefited in the second quarter of this year with Train 9 coming online during the month of May. We had some strong volumes across our fractionation footprint. We saw a little bit of impact in the first quarter because of some maintenance that we had scheduled. But the second quarter ran very well. Train 9 came online, basically full from day 1. And then when we look out into the third quarter, we'll have GCF coming online. Our equity share of that will likely be full. And then later this year, Train 10 will come online. Not much benefit we expect at this point from Train 10, but it is nice to see that we have moved the time line of that in-service date from the first quarter of 2025 to the latter part of this year and we'll see that come online and give us benefit. When you think about the timing of the plants from our G&P footprint, all the announcement that we had previously made as well as the ones this morning. A mid 2026 time frame for Train 11 fits us very well in order to catch those volumes as well. So, great position on the transportation side, both leveraging our current capacity as well as overcapacity, if you will, from a midstream perspective, as well as how we set on the fractionation front.\nSpiro Dounis: Great. That's helpful color. One just quick follow-up on Blackcomb. So pretty small capital investment out of the gate. But I know in the past, you've never really looked at residue gas pipeline as kind of core to your portfolio. So curious, at some point, this become a monetization candidate or too early for now?\nMatt Meloy : Yes. We just announced it this morning. So, I think, we will always look to do what's in the best interest of the shareholders, whether it's holding a minority interest or monetizing it. But I'd just say we're really excited to partner with white water and the other partners on this. It's much needed for the industry, much needed for the basin. And so we were excited to put a commitment on there and push this past FID and get going on this.\nSpiro Dounis : Great. I\u2019ll leave it there. Thanks for the color everyone.\nMatt Meloy : Okay. Thank you.\nJen Kneale: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And that will come from the line of Theresa Chen with Barclays. Your line is open.\nTheresa Chen: Good morning. On the underlying growth across your system, Matt, to your comment about low double-digit net volume growth in 2024. Can you just give us some more color on your view quantitatively for 2025 in led? And what are some of the puts and takes that underlie that view based on your discussions with your producer customers?\nMatt Meloy : Yes. I'd say for 2024, we feel strong we talked about low double-digit growth. We haven't given an exact number where we see 2025. We continue to get updated producer forecast. We've had some commercial success here recently as well. So, as we go into the fall, we'll put all that together and say what does that look like for 2025. I think, what you're hearing from us today is it's trending higher. I think, we feel better about it being stronger than our -- what our 2025 expectations would have been earlier this year. And so I think we feel good we're going to have strong growth in 2025. What exactly that looks like we'll continue to develop that and we'll likely provide that outlook for you sometime in February.\nTheresa Chen: Understood. And was there anything in particular that drove lower quarter-over-quarter OpEx on a unit basis despite higher volumes in L&T?\nMatt Meloy : In L&T, I think what we saw was you saw a lot of volume increase through our frac and through Grand Prix. So we were waiting eagerly for Train 9 to come on. And so you saw a really large increase. We're up a kind of diverse comparative period is over 100,000 barrels a day. So we saw the volume number increase significantly, yes.\nJen Kneale : Theresa, so we also generally hire ahead of assets coming online. So you would have seen an increase in OpEx prior to Train 9 coming online, as we essentially got ready for it. So then when we get the volume associated with the asset essentially being full. When it does come online, that may be one of the reasons that the unit margins improved in the second quarter.\nScott Pryor : And I would also say, Theresa, that I alluded to the fact that we had some maintenance issues during the first quarter. Those are behind us now. Again, the second quarter ran very, very well. And to Matt's point, we had over 110,000 barrels a day of incremental frac runoff during the second quarter.\nTheresa Chen: Thank you.\nMatt Meloy : Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And that will come from the line of Michael Blum with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nMichael Blum : Thanks. Good morning everyone. Wondering if there are any details on Blackcomb, you could provide like percent contracted with the return profile might look like? And would you expect there to be some project level financing for the project?\nBobby Muraro : Yeah, Michael, this is Bobby. I think we disclosed what we're going to disclose in the press release last night and then our earnings this morning. But when we think about getting gas takeaway out of the basin, we're excited to get this done, and bring in Targa's volumes to the table, it got it across the line to go FID obviously, last night and get supply for takeaway in -- out of the Permian for 2026 done and launched. I think we'll defer to white water on how much they share overtime. But I think at FID returns and the returns it fills up, I think it's going to be a great deal for Targa and all the partners that are investing in it.\nMichael Blum: Okay. Understood. And then, I wanted to ask about capital spending really beyond 2025, so call it, 2026 and beyond. You have that slide in prior presentations that shows a typical run rate CapEx year at growth CapEx here at $1.7 billion. So I'm just wondering, given the acceleration here you've seen in volumes. Is that still the right way to look at the long-term cadence for growth CapEx?\nJen Kneale: We believe it is, Michael. The $1.7 billion multiyear outlook that we put out earlier this year is really predicated on a high single-digit Permian growth scenario. So as we said this morning, to the extent that we see an acceleration of volume growth beyond that in 2026 and beyond, that could change that growth profile. And then the other element that we've pointed to since we put that slide out is that, our downstream capital spending is lumpier generally than our discrete projects on the gathering and processing side to the extent that we need to add fractionation or in particular, transportation, that can change the complexion of how that outlook plays out for a given individual year. But I think over a multiyear horizon, it still very much holds again, largely dependent on what the assumption is for underlying Permian growth volumes.\nMichael Blum: Got it. Thank you.\nJen Kneale: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And that will come from the line of John Mackay with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nJohn Mackay: Hey. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for the time and congrats to Jen and Will. \u2026\nJen Kneale: Thank you.\nJohn Mackay: I wanted to go back to something we've asked about a couple of times here, but maybe just about a finer point on it. When we're seeing this Permian growth expectations continue to move up. I guess, I'd just be curious, if you could piece a little more out of that. Is it hey, these customers are actually expecting to bring in more rigs and crews back half of the year? Is it, hey, actually, productivity gains are a lot higher than we've expected? Is it all in the GOR side? Anything there you can kind of break out for us would be helpful.\nPat McDonie: Yeah. What I would say is no, we're not expecting an increase in rigs. What we're seeing is greater efficiencies. And with some of the recent combinations of companies that you've seen more efficient use of combined acreage position. So they are getting higher productivity. They are able to drill an equivalent number of wells with a lower rig count. GOR is certainly a factor, but in the big scheme of things, it's not as big a factor. Obviously, we've seen it increase and continue to increase, but the continuing increase is a lot lower than what it was over the past, say, three to five years. So it's really activity of the producer group that is on the Targa acreage, their commitment to drilling in the Permian, and they're achieved frankly, they're achieved efficiencies. And again, it goes back to our commercial success, adding to the footprint we already have.\nJohn Mackay: Yeah. That's really clear. I appreciate that. Maybe just shifting to return of capital, buyback number was great. I guess I'd just be curious to your guys' latest thoughts on the buyback versus the dividend, given the recent run in the stock?\nJen Kneale: I'd say that there's really no change to how we are thinking about capital allocation, John. Foundational to everything that we're doing is a strong balance sheet. And as we've articulated this morning, we see our balance sheet getting stronger through the end of this year and into next year, and that's creating a lot of flexibility for us. We were very active in the second quarter. We have an opportunistic share repurchase program. You'll continue to see us be opportunistic, which will create some variability quarter-to-quarter. But the underlying premise is that we believe that our outlook is only strengthening over the short, medium and long term. And we have a lot of conviction in where the company is today and where the company is headed. And part of how we will continue to return capital to shareholders is really through both a combination of likely meaningful increases in our annual dividend per share as well as continued opportunistic share repurchases.\nJohn Mackay: Thanks for the time.\nMatt Meloy: Okay, thanks. John.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And that will come from the line of Manav Gupta with UBS. Your line is open.\nManav Gupta: Hi, guys. A quick question. I think a few quarters back, you had indicated that some of the growth projects you have could deliver incremental EBITDA of $300 million or so. How has that guidance changed as some of the new projects are coming in? And how should we think about these incremental growth projects delivering EBITDA of over 2025 and 2026?\nMatt Meloy: Sure, yes. Yes, we indicated kind of our investment multiple going forward about 5.5 times, call it, five to six times EBITDA. And I think you've seen our track record over the last several years. EBITDA multiple has even been perhaps a little bit stronger than that. We're investing in the same kind of projects that have delivered return -- strong returns for us over the last several years. It's investing in our gathering and processing business and then expanding our downstream NGL infrastructure to accommodate those volumes. So we're really sticking to our core business. We expect the returns to be very good. That 5.5 is kind of what we indicated would be a pretty good base case, what we think we can do. I hope we can beat that. But if we do 5.5, it will be a really good return profile for us.\nManav Gupta: Thank you. I'll turn it over.\nMatt Meloy: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And that will come from the line of Keith Stanley with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nKeith Stanley: Hi, good morning. First, I wanted to start with a follow-up just on 2025 CapEx. Are you baking in any NGL pipeline spend in there or you're comfortable third-party contracts are giving you enough visibility that you don't need to invest in more pipeline capacity yet next year?\nMatt Meloy: Yes, hey, Keith, you are correct, yes. For 2025, with Daytona coming on, back half of this year, we should have sufficient transport through 2025 and some period beyond Daytona coupled with the third-party transportation that we've already executed, and we're working on more. So we're really talking about when and if we may need to do another NGF wide and how it impacts 2026, 2027, 2028 capital. But for 2025, our expectation is we don't have any meaningful transportation capital in that number.\nKeith Stanley: Great. Thanks. Second question, with volumes coming in a lot higher than expected, is it fair to think you're offloading a lot more to third parties this year than normal? And then we think about growth into 2025 and new assets coming online, should we expect some additional financial tailwinds just from bringing volumes back onto your system in '25 that maybe you're offloading this year?\nMatt Meloy: Yes. No, good question.\nPat McDonie: We'll looking around who's going to answer this.\nMatt Meloy: Everyone's raising your hand. So I'll start. And then when we think about offload, it really is dependent on the piece of the business. Is it gathering and processing, transportation, frac. I'd say as our volumes have really exceeded our expectations, there are periods of times where we do offload on the G&P side. But with the flexibility we have with our plants, mostly we handle that amongst ourselves, and we'll actually handle some offloads from third parties on the G&P side. As you look through the downstream, the transportation and frac of our NGL volumes have grown significantly, we have connectivity to basically every other pipe in the Permian going to Belvieu. So we have those existing connections from our plants, from legacy plants, from acquired plants. So we have a lot of flexibility to move volume. So look to optimize that for what's the cheapest cost transport while we're bringing Daytona. So there are some volumes that we're moving on other pipes that we'll be able to go on Daytona kind of day one as soon as that comes up. And then same on the fractionation side, we have Train 9, GCF and Train 10, all coming online this year. If you kind of look back at our volumes, the frac has not grown as much as some of our other volumes, and that's because we're managing third-party fractionation there as well. So you saw a big step up this quarter with Train 9 coming on that is kind of bringing some of those volumes back onto our system. I'd expect more of that to happen in the third quarter and the fourth quarter.\nKeith Stanley: Thank you.\nMatt Meloy: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And that will come from the line of Sunil Sibal with Seaport Global. Your line is open.\nSunil Sibal: Yeah. Hi. Good morning, everybody. And first of all, congratulations to Jen and Will for their new roles. So I wanted to start off -- so I wanted to start off on your CapEx program. So could you remind us what's the current best estimate on building a new 275 plant and filling it up?\nMatt Meloy: I would say, on average, our plants are around $200 million on the G&P side of things for a new 275 plan. Some have been a little bit cheaper, some have been a little bit more depending on what kind of inlet compression you're doing in, some of the other bells and whistles or sweet sour, but it's around 200 for the plants we have announced.\nSunil Sibal: And then similar amount to fill it up in terms of gathering systems, et cetera?\nMatt Meloy: How much field capital? Well, that's also one where it varies from year to year, how much pipeline compression you're going to need? Is it more high pressure, is it more low pressure. So you can see more variability on that. So there are times we're also ordering more compression. We're trying to build some inventory because we see strong growth in the next year. So that has moved around quite a bit, I don't know. Pat, add any other color we want to give?\nPat McDonie: No, I think you described it. I mean there's a lot of variability there. It depends on if producers drill behind existing batteries. Where they drill, how many new batteries we're connecting, high-pressure low-pressure all those things, sweet sours. There's just a ton of it, and you're right. With lead times on compression and plants, that capital kind of gets get kind of mothball together and it's -- there's not a real finite number that I'd be comfortable.\nMatt Meloy: And we haven't really seen, I'd say, a material change. It varies from year to year, but we haven't seen a trend of getting more expensive or less expensive. It's been operating within a band that we've seen year in, year out.\nSunil Sibal: Understood. And thanks for the bridge that you provided on the CapEx program. I just had one clarification on the other category. Seems like you're indicating carbon capture is also put in the other category. Could you indicate what kind of capital you spent so far on carbon capture and when can we expect to see returns on that?\nJen Kneale: We're not going to break it out separately, Sunil. What we have said is that we expect to be in a position to potentially benefit from 45Q credits later this year. We have a number of projects that we're commercializing in the Permian Basin that's very much core to what we do and what we are good at. So it's small enough that it doesn't make sense for us to break it out separately, but I'd say the returns are consoserate with what we're seeing across the rest of our investment opportunities across the portfolio.\nSunil Sibal: Okay. Thanks for that.\nMatt Meloy: Okay. Thank you.\nJen Kneale: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question, and that will come from the line of Tristan Richardson with Scotiabank. Your line is open.\nQ \u2013 Tristan Richardson: Hi, good morning, guys. Maybe just a quick one on Blackcomb. Is it wrong if equity stake has some correlation with the capacity you expect to have in the pipe? And then maybe just thinking about your capacity portfolio in general, with the growth you're seeing exiting 2024 and looking into 2025?\nBobby Muraro: This is Bobby. Yes, as we build our portfolio to transport, we obviously market a ton of gas for our producers across the Permian Basin. And as we look at the portfolio of takeaway, we've talked about it before in tight markets, we spend a lot of time to make sure that all the gas moves out of our plants. Some of that is long haul out of the basin, like our Blackcomb deal. And but I'd tell you, a majority of it is within basin and tailgate sales to people that have transport. So we manage that all together. And then as we think about making sure there is egress from the basin on pipes. That's when we step out on things like this Blackcomb deal to make sure that a pipe gets built, timely enough such that the basin doesn't have more material issues than it already has. So when I think about what we put on a pipe like Blackcomb, it is a very small subset of the amount of gas we market across the basin. So it's not a needle mover relative to the amount of gas we market but it is part of the science we go through every year thinking out one year, thinking out two years, thinking out three years and how we're going to make sure all the gas moves through our plant so that the NGLs get out and our producers can produce their oil.\nQ \u2013 Tristan Richardson: Helpful, Bobby. And then Jen, obviously, you said 2Q was a very tight gas market. I mean, curious where fee floors a factor in 2Q or even said another way, Targa able to put up a very strong 2Q irrespective of where basis sits today versus when we see relief on the horizon, hopefully, by fourth quarter.\nJen Kneale: In the second quarter supports why the fee floors are so important to us. When you think about the amount of capital that we spent in the quarter, now moving forward with two additional gas processing plants to support our producers with the backdrop of negative Waha prices and low NGL prices, yes, you can assume that the fares -- the fee floors were very much important to us in the second quarter. And really have been in play for a substantial number of months over the last, call it, 1.5 years or so. And that again is really what's allowed us to invest through what is a low commodity price cycle right now and what is allowing us to continue to invest looking forward as well.\nQ \u2013 Tristan Richardson: That\u2019s great. Thank you, guys very much. Appreciate it.\nJen Kneale: Thanks, Tristan.\nMatt Meloy: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Sanjay Lad for any closing remarks.\nSanjay Lad: Thanks to everyone that was on the call this morning, and we appreciate your interest in Targa Resources. The IR team will be available for any follow-up questions you may have. Have a great day.\nOperator: This concludes today's program. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Jen Kneale",
            "content": "Thanks, Matt. Good morning, everyone. Targa's reported quarterly adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter was a record $984 million, a 2% increase over the first quarter. For the second quarter, our natural gas inlet volumes in the Permian averaged a record 5.7 billion cubic feet per day. Our NGL pipeline transportation volumes averaged a record 784,000 barrels per day. Our fractionation volumes averaged a record 902,000 barrels per day at our Mont Belvieu complex, and our LPG export loadings averaged 12 million barrels per month. Let's talk about our operational results in more detail. Starting in the Permian, our reported second quarter inlet volumes increased 5% when compared to the first quarter. In Permian Midland, our system is running near capacity, and our new Greenwood II plant is expected to be highly utilized when it comes online in the fourth quarter of 2024. Our next Midland plant, Pembrook II, will be much needed and remains on track to begin operations in the fourth quarter of 2025. As Matt mentioned, today, we announced that we are moving forward with our latest Midland plant, East Pembrook which is expected to begin operations in the third quarter of 2026. In Permian Delaware, activity and volumes across our footprint are also strong. Our Roadrunner II plant commenced operations in late May and was fully utilized after startup. We are accelerating the timing of our next Delaware plant, [indiscernible], which is now expected to come online in the first quarter of 2025 and is also expected to come online highly utilized [ph]. Today, we announced that we are moving forward with our latest Delaware plant, Bull Moose II, which is expected to begin operations in the first quarter of 2026. Shifting to our Logistics and Transportation segment. Construction on our Daytona NGL pipeline expansion has been going well, and we believe that we may be able to bring the pipeline fully online earlier than estimated. Our Train 9 fractionator in Mont Belvieu came online full in May, and we are currently starting operations at our Gulf Coast fractionator joint venture, and we expect our portion of the capacity to be highly utilized at start-up. Construction on our Train 10 and Train 11 fractionators in Mont Belvieu continues, and our fracs are expected to be much needed when they come online, given our outlook for increasing Permian volume growth and resulting NGL volume growth to Mont Belvieu. Train 10 is now expected to begin operations late in the fourth quarter of this year and Train 11 is expected to begin operations in the third quarter of 2026. In our LPG export business at Galena Park, our second quarter volumes were impacted by a required 10-year inspection that reduced our loading capability in the second half of June through late July. We continue to benefit from nighttime transits and fully expect that to be a permanent benefit going forward. We remain on track to complete our expansion, which will increase our loading capacity and incremental 650,000 barrels per month in the second half of 2025. The strength of our performance in the second quarter with the backdrop of negative Waha gas prices and low NGL prices demonstrates that by investing in opportunities backed by fee-based and fee floor contracts, we are able to successfully invest across cycles to continue to support the infrastructure needs of our customers. We have largely removed exposure to downside commodity prices from our enterprise-wide risk profile, and given the strength of our outlook, also recently added hedges to further increase our cash flow stability. As described previously, 90% of our margin is fee-based or supported by fee floor contracts. The remaining 10% is exposed to commodity prices. Of that remaining 10% of exposure, we have now hedged approximately 90% of volumes across commodities through 2026. As commodity prices move higher, we will benefit from that upside through our fee floor contracts. Turning to the balance sheet. At quarter end, we had $1.6 billion of available liquidity, and our consolidated net leverage ratio was 3.6 times, well within our long-term leverage ratio target range of three to four times. During the second quarter, we repaid the $500 million balance on our term loan and the term loan is no longer outstanding. Shifting to capital allocation. Our priorities remain the same, which are to maintain a strong investment-grade balance sheet to continue to invest in high-returning integrated projects and to return an increasing amount of capital to our shareholders across cycles, and we are delivering on those priorities. Our outperformance is leading to deleveraging faster than we previously forecasted, creating incremental capacity to enhance our return of capital. Supported by the strength of our business outlook, we repurchased a record $355 million of common shares in the second quarter at a weighted average price of $118.91. This week, our Board of Directors also authorized a new $1 billion common share repurchase authorization, and we continue to expect to be in a position to return capital to our shareholders through opportunistic repurchases. We are continuing to model the ability over time to return 40% to 50% of adjusted cash flow from operations to equity holders and believe that is a useful framework for thinking about Targa's return of capital proposition. Our talented Targa team continues to execute on our strategic priorities across the organization and safely operate our assets to deliver the energy that enhances our everyday lives. And I would like to echo Matt, thank you to all of our employees. And with that, I will turn the call back over to Sanjay. Good morning. Thank you. Theresa, so we also generally hire ahead of assets coming online. So you would have seen an increase in OpEx prior to Train 9 coming online, as we essentially got ready for it. So then when we get the volume associated with the asset essentially being full. When it does come online, that may be one of the reasons that the unit margins improved in the second quarter. We believe it is, Michael. The $1.7 billion multiyear outlook that we put out earlier this year is really predicated on a high single-digit Permian growth scenario. So as we said this morning, to the extent that we see an acceleration of volume growth beyond that in 2026 and beyond, that could change that growth profile. And then the other element that we've pointed to since we put that slide out is that, our downstream capital spending is lumpier generally than our discrete projects on the gathering and processing side to the extent that we need to add fractionation or in particular, transportation, that can change the complexion of how that outlook plays out for a given individual year. But I think over a multiyear horizon, it still very much holds again, largely dependent on what the assumption is for underlying Permian growth volumes. Thank you. Thank you. I'd say that there's really no change to how we are thinking about capital allocation, John. Foundational to everything that we're doing is a strong balance sheet. And as we've articulated this morning, we see our balance sheet getting stronger through the end of this year and into next year, and that's creating a lot of flexibility for us. We were very active in the second quarter. We have an opportunistic share repurchase program. You'll continue to see us be opportunistic, which will create some variability quarter-to-quarter. But the underlying premise is that we believe that our outlook is only strengthening over the short, medium and long term. And we have a lot of conviction in where the company is today and where the company is headed. And part of how we will continue to return capital to shareholders is really through both a combination of likely meaningful increases in our annual dividend per share as well as continued opportunistic share repurchases. We're not going to break it out separately, Sunil. What we have said is that we expect to be in a position to potentially benefit from 45Q credits later this year. We have a number of projects that we're commercializing in the Permian Basin that's very much core to what we do and what we are good at. So it's small enough that it doesn't make sense for us to break it out separately, but I'd say the returns are consoserate with what we're seeing across the rest of our investment opportunities across the portfolio. Thank you. In the second quarter supports why the fee floors are so important to us. When you think about the amount of capital that we spent in the quarter, now moving forward with two additional gas processing plants to support our producers with the backdrop of negative Waha prices and low NGL prices, yes, you can assume that the fares -- the fee floors were very much important to us in the second quarter. And really have been in play for a substantial number of months over the last, call it, 1.5 years or so. And that again is really what's allowed us to invest through what is a low commodity price cycle right now and what is allowing us to continue to invest looking forward as well.\nQ \u2013 Tristan Richardson: That's great. Thank you, guys very much. Appreciate it. Thanks, Tristan."

            "name": "Bobby Muraro",
            "content": "Yeah, Michael, this is Bobby. I think we disclosed what we're going to disclose in the press release last night and then our earnings this morning. But when we think about getting gas takeaway out of the basin, we're excited to get this done, and bring in Targa's volumes to the table, it got it across the line to go FID obviously, last night and get supply for takeaway in -- out of the Permian for 2026 done and launched. I think we'll defer to white water on how much they share overtime. But I think at FID returns and the returns it fills up, I think it's going to be a great deal for Targa and all the partners that are investing in it. This is Bobby. Yes, as we build our portfolio to transport, we obviously market a ton of gas for our producers across the Permian Basin. And as we look at the portfolio of takeaway, we've talked about it before in tight markets, we spend a lot of time to make sure that all the gas moves out of our plants. Some of that is long haul out of the basin, like our Blackcomb deal. And but I'd tell you, a majority of it is within basin and tailgate sales to people that have transport. So we manage that all together. And then as we think about making sure there is egress from the basin on pipes. That's when we step out on things like this Blackcomb deal to make sure that a pipe gets built, timely enough such that the basin doesn't have more material issues than it already has. So when I think about what we put on a pipe like Blackcomb, it is a very small subset of the amount of gas we market across the basin. So it's not a needle mover relative to the amount of gas we market but it is part of the science we go through every year thinking out one year, thinking out two years, thinking out three years and how we're going to make sure all the gas moves through our plant so that the NGLs get out and our producers can produce their oil.\nQ \u2013 Tristan Richardson: Helpful, Bobby. And then Jen, obviously, you said 2Q was a very tight gas market. I mean, curious where fee floors a factor in 2Q or even said another way, Targa able to put up a very strong 2Q irrespective of where basis sits today versus when we see relief on the horizon, hopefully, by fourth quarter."

            "name": "Scott Pryor",
            "content": "Yes, Jeremy, this is Scott. The construction on Daytona has gone very well. When you enter into construction of a long-haul pipeline of this size and at this distance, you would anticipate once you get in the construction phase that you might have delays relative to weather or just in general construction delays. But for us, quarter in and quarter out, we've seen improvements. The Targa team has done an excellent job installing that pipe. And I would not be surprised if it actually comes online sometime during this quarter, the third quarter of this year. So, very pleased with the timeline. Spiro, this is Scott again. I'll first start on the pipeline side of things. Certainly, with Daytona coming online, likely during this quarter, that gives us a lot of operational leverage as it relates to the volumes coming out of the west from the Permian along those 2 lines. So we've got the Grand Prix line, the original West line, we've got Daytona and with a lot of operational leverage with that. Then that ties into our trunk line that feeds into Mont Belvieu, where we've got some operational leverage as well. So we feel really good about where we are positioned there. I will say that with the cadence of the plants that Pat and his team have been successful at executing on and we look at the volume growth that we have. We've actually done some third-party contracts out there given the number of announcements you've seen on Y-grade pipeline coming out of the Permian, we feel as though there's a little bit of overcapacity, and we're in a position to at reasonable prices to do a term contract with the volume growth that we see on that. The likelihood is, again, with additional capacity that's out there, we'll look for some additional contracts that we can do. Again, as long as the prices are reasonable, it will allow us to push out the next expansion that we might have to have on our pipeline system and defer capital further out. So that puts us in a good position. As we look at frac side, certainly, we benefited in the second quarter of this year with Train 9 coming online during the month of May. We had some strong volumes across our fractionation footprint. We saw a little bit of impact in the first quarter because of some maintenance that we had scheduled. But the second quarter ran very well. Train 9 came online, basically full from day 1. And then when we look out into the third quarter, we'll have GCF coming online. Our equity share of that will likely be full. And then later this year, Train 10 will come online. Not much benefit we expect at this point from Train 10, but it is nice to see that we have moved the time line of that in-service date from the first quarter of 2025 to the latter part of this year and we'll see that come online and give us benefit. When you think about the timing of the plants from our G&P footprint, all the announcement that we had previously made as well as the ones this morning. A mid 2026 time frame for Train 11 fits us very well in order to catch those volumes as well. So, great position on the transportation side, both leveraging our current capacity as well as overcapacity, if you will, from a midstream perspective, as well as how we set on the fractionation front. And I would also say, Theresa, that I alluded to the fact that we had some maintenance issues during the first quarter. Those are behind us now. Again, the second quarter ran very, very well. And to Matt's point, we had over 110,000 barrels a day of incremental frac runoff during the second quarter."

            "name": "Matt Meloy",
            "content": "Thanks, Sanjay, and good morning to everyone. We had another record quarter across multiple fronts. But before we get into all the good things happening here at Targa, I would like to first recognize all our employees impacted by Hurricane Beryl. We prepared for the storm, weathered the storm and performed across a difficult period to safely keep volumes flowing, providing best-in-class service when many of our employees were also managing without power and had damage to their homes. The hard work and dedication demonstrated during the storm is really something to be proud of. So I'd like to say thank you to the Targa team for all the extra effort. The storms reduced our volumes for only a short period, so we expect the impact on the third quarter to be minimal as there was no material damage to any of our assets. I would also like to welcome Will Byers, Targa's new Chief Financial Officer to our call this morning. Will officially joined us on July 22, and we're excited to have him as part of the Targa team. We'll add a lot of depth to our organization, given his 20-plus years of midstream finance experience, including serving in CFO roles over the last 10 years. As part of Jen's continued development, she has now transitioned into the role of President, Finance and Administration and will continue to increase her role and responsibilities. Turning now to our second quarter results, it was another strong quarter of performance across our organization, which sets us up well for the balance of this year and beyond. Record volumes in the Permian drove record NGL transportation and fractionation volumes downstream and record quarterly adjusted EBITDA. We brought our Train 9 fractionator in Mont Belvieu and our Roadrunner II plant in Permian Delaware online, on time, on budget. And given increasing volumes across our systems, they were both very much needed. We also executed on a quarterly record $355 million of common share repurchases which is reflective of our performance and strong conviction and the outlook for our business going forward. We also just announced our participation in a joint venture supporting the next natural gas pipeline from the Permian Basin. We provided a meaningful volume commitment to support the project, and this provides for a 17.5% ownership interest in the Blackcomb pipeline. Blackcomb will be a 42-inch pipeline transporting gas from the Permian to South Texas. The pipeline is expected to be project financed, so Targa's capital investment should be less than $200 million. Now let's talk a little more about our Permian position and the good things happening there. Activity in the Permian remains very strong, supporting our view of continued long-term growth from the basin. Our Permian volumes during the second quarter increased about 275 million cubic feet per day over the first quarter, which is a full plant. And year-over-year, our volumes in the Permian are up more than 600 million cubic feet per day. And currently, our volumes in the Permian are up another 200 million cubic feet per day compared to the second quarter. We expected strong growth from our Permian assets, but the growth we have seen this year has exceeded our expectations. We now expect low double-digit percentage volume growth this year, which sets us up well for meaningful growth in 2025 and beyond. This higher growth rate is driving incremental EBITDA and requiring additional growth capital investment. These volumes are core to our business, and we benefit across the integrated NGL value chain, driving higher margins into our downstream business and generating strong ROIC. Given higher-than-anticipated Permian volumes and an outlook for continued strong activity across our Midland and Delaware footprint, we announced our next two plants in the Permian, one in the Midland Basin and another in the Delaware Basin. Some spending for these plans was included in the forecast we provided back in February, but the timing and cadence of spending has accelerated. To support our higher volume and higher EBITDA profile, we are updating our estimate for growth capital spending for 2024, so approximately $2.7 billion. This increase or the increase in growth capital spend from our previously provided range is attributable to the acceleration of timing of plants in the Permian, incremental field capital compression and gathering lines the acceleration of downstream infrastructure connections and other opportunities like spending on enhancing residue gas takeaway. Similarly, we expect stronger than previously estimated Permian volume growth next year and are updating our 2025 estimate for capital spending to $1.7 billion, driven by a similar acceleration of plant and field capital and our investment in Blackcomb. We included a bridge on Slide 5 in our Q2 earnings supplement presentation for our updated estimates for 2024 and 2025 growth capital. The strength of our first half 2024 performance and continued strong outlook going forward driven largely by higher Permian volumes and higher volumes through our integrated system means the updated midpoint estimate. For our full year 2024 adjusted EBITDA is $4 billion, which is a $200 million or 5% increase from our previous estimate. We now expect higher adjusted EBITDA in 2025 and a similar free cash flow estimate to when we compare our outlook -- to when we provided our outlook in February, with 2025 representing an important inflection for our company as our meaningful free cash flow generation positions us to continue to return an increasing amount of capital to our shareholders, while further strengthening our investment-grade balance sheet. We believe that we are uniquely positioned for the short, medium and long term as an already strong outlook for Permian Basin volume growth from best-in-class producers continues to get stronger, which benefits our entire integrated value chain. Our contract structures support us continuing to invest on behalf of our producers, benefiting from cash flow stability and lower commodity price environments and upside as prices rise. And we are delivering record financial performance despite a weak commodity price backdrop. Before I turn the call over to Jen to discuss our second quarter results in more detail, I'd like to extend a thank you to the Targa team for their continued focus on safety and execution, while continuing to provide best-in-class service and reliability to our customers. Hey, good morning. Yes. Hey, Jeremy. Yes, we raised our guidance for this year. It's really underpinned by the strength and the volume that we've seen, not only so far this year, but also just our expectations for the back half of the year and then leading into 2025. Producers just really continue to have high levels of activity across our system, and we received numerous, I think, kind of revisions to the short, medium-term outlook from our producers across our system. So, that let us feel really good about the EBITDA this year, and positioned us well going into 2025 and strong activity in 2025. So, when you look at our overall EBITDA growth that we expect, coupled with the CapEx moving from $1.4 billion to $1.7 billion, we see a similar -- really similar dollar amount of free cash flow to what we saw when we gave kind of the original outlook back in February of this year. Yes, I don't think we've seen anything really fundamentally different from the production side. We had higher recoveries in the second quarter relative to the first quarter. Is what drove the higher recovery GPM. I think the underlying volumes are similar. Pat? Okay, thanks Jeremy. Yes, sure. I'll start, and then Pat, you can hop in. I mean, we've over the last several years, have really outperformed the basin. Our team has done a really good job at servicing our existing customers, but also having commercial success really across the Delaware and the Midland. We also have our assets, well, we have a wide -- kind of a wide area that we cover. We are in the best spots of the Midland, and we're in the best spots and most active spots in the Delaware as well. So, I think we benefit from that. We've seen this year continued strong activity from producers, but we've also seen revisions from our producers of the forecast they've given us. And the level of volumes that they're expecting to come across our system for 2024 and 2025. I'd say this year, we've seen more positive revisions than we have in other years. So, we've just benefited more from that. Maybe just goes to Targa's overall positioning and strong user activity. You have anything to add to that? Yes. We just announced it this morning. So, I think, we will always look to do what's in the best interest of the shareholders, whether it's holding a minority interest or monetizing it. But I'd just say we're really excited to partner with white water and the other partners on this. It's much needed for the industry, much needed for the basin. And so we were excited to put a commitment on there and push this past FID and get going on this. Okay. Thank you. Yes. I'd say for 2024, we feel strong we talked about low double-digit growth. We haven't given an exact number where we see 2025. We continue to get updated producer forecast. We've had some commercial success here recently as well. So, as we go into the fall, we'll put all that together and say what does that look like for 2025. I think, what you're hearing from us today is it's trending higher. I think, we feel better about it being stronger than our -- what our 2025 expectations would have been earlier this year. And so I think we feel good we're going to have strong growth in 2025. What exactly that looks like we'll continue to develop that and we'll likely provide that outlook for you sometime in February. In L&T, I think what we saw was you saw a lot of volume increase through our frac and through Grand Prix. So we were waiting eagerly for Train 9 to come on. And so you saw a really large increase. We're up a kind of diverse comparative period is over 100,000 barrels a day. So we saw the volume number increase significantly, yes. Okay. Thank you. Okay, thanks. John. Sure, yes. Yes, we indicated kind of our investment multiple going forward about 5.5 times, call it, five to six times EBITDA. And I think you've seen our track record over the last several years. EBITDA multiple has even been perhaps a little bit stronger than that. We're investing in the same kind of projects that have delivered return -- strong returns for us over the last several years. It's investing in our gathering and processing business and then expanding our downstream NGL infrastructure to accommodate those volumes. So we're really sticking to our core business. We expect the returns to be very good. That 5.5 is kind of what we indicated would be a pretty good base case, what we think we can do. I hope we can beat that. But if we do 5.5, it will be a really good return profile for us. Okay. Thank you. Yes, hey, Keith, you are correct, yes. For 2025, with Daytona coming on, back half of this year, we should have sufficient transport through 2025 and some period beyond Daytona coupled with the third-party transportation that we've already executed, and we're working on more. So we're really talking about when and if we may need to do another NGF wide and how it impacts 2026, 2027, 2028 capital. But for 2025, our expectation is we don't have any meaningful transportation capital in that number. Yes. No, good question. Everyone's raising your hand. So I'll start. And then when we think about offload, it really is dependent on the piece of the business. Is it gathering and processing, transportation, frac. I'd say as our volumes have really exceeded our expectations, there are periods of times where we do offload on the G&P side. But with the flexibility we have with our plants, mostly we handle that amongst ourselves, and we'll actually handle some offloads from third parties on the G&P side. As you look through the downstream, the transportation and frac of our NGL volumes have grown significantly, we have connectivity to basically every other pipe in the Permian going to Belvieu. So we have those existing connections from our plants, from legacy plants, from acquired plants. So we have a lot of flexibility to move volume. So look to optimize that for what's the cheapest cost transport while we're bringing Daytona. So there are some volumes that we're moving on other pipes that we'll be able to go on Daytona kind of day one as soon as that comes up. And then same on the fractionation side, we have Train 9, GCF and Train 10, all coming online this year. If you kind of look back at our volumes, the frac has not grown as much as some of our other volumes, and that's because we're managing third-party fractionation there as well. So you saw a big step up this quarter with Train 9 coming on that is kind of bringing some of those volumes back onto our system. I'd expect more of that to happen in the third quarter and the fourth quarter. Okay. Thank you. I would say, on average, our plants are around $200 million on the G&P side of things for a new 275 plan. Some have been a little bit cheaper, some have been a little bit more depending on what kind of inlet compression you're doing in, some of the other bells and whistles or sweet sour, but it's around 200 for the plants we have announced. How much field capital? Well, that's also one where it varies from year to year, how much pipeline compression you're going to need? Is it more high pressure, is it more low pressure. So you can see more variability on that. So there are times we're also ordering more compression. We're trying to build some inventory because we see strong growth in the next year. So that has moved around quite a bit, I don't know. Pat, add any other color we want to give? And we haven't really seen, I'd say, a material change. It varies from year to year, but we haven't seen a trend of getting more expensive or less expensive. It's been operating within a band that we've seen year in, year out. Okay. Thank you. Okay. Thank you."

In addition, an updated investor presentation has also been posted to our website.\n Statements made during this call that might include Targa's expectations or predictions should be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in forward-looking statements. For a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ, please refer to our latest SEC filings.\n Our speakers for the call today will be Matt Meloy, Chief Executive Officer; and Jen Kneale, Chief Financial Officer. Additionally, the following senior management team members will be available for Q&A: Pat McDonie, President, Gathering and Processing; Scott Pryor, President, Logistics and Transportation; and Bobby Muraro, Chief Commercial Officer.\n I will now turn the call over to Matt. \nMatt Meloy: Thanks, Sanjay, and good morning. We are proud of our first quarter results as we continue to execute across the organization to deliver another quarter of record adjusted EBITDA, Permian volumes and LPG export volumes, along with a 50% increase to our common dividend per share and $124 million of common share repurchases. For the quarter, we really benefited from strong back half of the quarter Permian volume growth. January was impacted by operational upsets associated with harsh weather. From there, volumes significantly increased throughout the quarter, which helped drive record results and sets us up well looking forward.\n We are adding a substantial amount of compression across the rest of the year and our expectation is for continued Permian volume growth, recognizing that prior to Matterhorn initiating service and adding incremental natural gas takeaway capacity, gas markets will remain tight. As we saw in March and April, there are upsets associated with pipeline maintenance that create further constraints, it may affect volumes and significantly impact Waha gas prices. Short-term constraints aside, given our outlook for increasing Permian volumes and resulting NGL supply growth, we announced this morning that we are moving forward with 2 major growth capital projects. Our next Permian Midland plant, Pembrook II and our next fractionator in Mont Belvieu, Train 11 to support the infrastructure needs of our customers.\n We mentioned in February that we are ordering long lead items for both projects and have since received Board approval to move forward with no change to our estimates for 2024 and 2025 net growth capital spend. I am pleased to announce that we are also moving forward with a small capital project at our Galena Park facility that will increase our LPG export capacity by approximately 650,000 barrels per month within the second half of 2025. This project is an excellent example of our organization balancing between capital efficient, while ensuring our ability to support increasing volumes through our systems and also does not change our estimates for growth capital spending.\n Despite the current weakness in Waha natural gas and NGL prices, we continue to estimate full year 2024 adjusted EBITDA between $3.7 billion and $3.9 billion, which we believe is reflective of the importance of our fees and fee floors in our G&P business, which are supporting our continued investment in infrastructure despite a lower commodity price environment. Looking ahead, our premier Permian supply aggregation position, coupled with our integrated NGL system, positions us nicely to continue to generate high return organic opportunities and be able to continue to return incremental capital to our shareholders.\n Let's now discuss our operations in more detail. Starting in the Permian, activity continues to remain strong across our dedicated acreage. In Permian Midland, construction continues on our new Greenwood II plant and remains on track to begin operations in the fourth quarter of this year. Greenwood II is expected to be highly utilized when it comes online which is necessitating moving forward with Pembrook II, which is expected to begin operations in the fourth quarter of 2025.\n As you may have seen publicly, we had a fire at our Greenwood I plant in Permian Midland on April 16. There were no injuries, and we appreciate the work by our Targa team and first responders who were able to extinguish the fire safely and quickly. With 19 plants and a broad footprint across the Permian Midland, we are leveraging our operational flexibility to move gas around to handle all existing volumes and planned production growth to continue to be able to provide reliable service to our producer customers while the plant is down. We expect the plant back online before the end of the second quarter and do not expect the plant downtime to significantly impact our Midland volumes for the second quarter. We estimate about $10 million of repairs related to the incident.\n In Permian Delaware, activity in volumes across our footprint are also running strong. Our Roadrunner II plant is expected to commence operations in June and is also expected to begin service highly utilized. Our next Delaware plant, Bull Moose remains on track to come online in the second quarter of 2025. We continue to expect increasing Permian volumes as we move through the rest of the year as we benefit from new compression and plants coming online.\n For the second quarter, Waha gas prices are averaging around negative $1.30 as residue gas pipeline downtime for maintenance and operational upsets have resulted in additional tightness in the Permian Basin. We have done a good job of managing our Permian gas takeaway position to ensure surety of flow from our producers as the market awaits some relief when the Matterhorn pipeline comes on later this year.\n Shifting to our Logistics and Transportation segment. Construction continues on our Daytona NGL pipeline expansion, and we remain on track to begin operations in the fourth quarter of this year. The outlook for NGL supply growth continuing means our Daytona expansion will be much needed to handle incremental barrels. We are currently starting up our new fractionator in Mont Belvieu, Train 9 and expect it to be highly utilized. We expect to restart our Gulf Coast fractionator joint venture during the second quarter, which we also expect [ our ] portion of the capacity to be highly utilized at start-up. Construction continues on our Train 10 fractionator, which is also expected to be much needed when it comes online.\n Given our outlook for increasing NGL production growth to Mont Belvieu supports us officially moving forward with Train 11, a new 150,000 barrel per day fractionator. Train 11 is expected to begin operations in the third quarter of 2026. And the capital associated with Train 11 was already included in our expectations for spending that we provided publicly for both 2024 and 2025. In our LPG export business at Galena Park, our loadings were a record 13.3 million barrels per month during the first quarter as we continue to benefit from strong market conditions and the Houston Ship Channel allowance of nighttime transits for larger vessels.\n Before I turn the call over to Jen to discuss our first quarter results in more detail, I would like to extend a thank you to the Targa team for their continued focus on safety and execution, while continuing to provide best-in-class service and reliability to our customers. Our employees continue to rise to the challenges of our business, and we are appreciative of their efforts. \nJennifer Kneale: Thanks, Matt. Good morning, everyone. Targa's reported quarterly adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter was a record $966 million, a 1% increase over the fourth quarter. For the first quarter, our natural gas inlet volumes in the Permian averaged a record 5.4 billion cubic feet per day, a 2% increase when compared to the fourth quarter. Large Permian volumes were stronger than estimated when we hosted our February earnings call and significantly higher than January, which translated into additional volumes downstream. \n For the full quarter, our NGL pipeline transportation volumes averaged 718,000 barrels per day. Our fractionation volumes averaged 797,000 barrels per day, including the impacts of scheduled maintenance at our Mont Belvieu complex. Our LPG export loadings were a record 13.3 million barrels per month, and we benefited from optimization opportunities in our marketing business. \n As we look across the rest of 2024, second quarter EBITDA may be weaker than Q1, given seasonality in our business, the impacts on the quarter of the fire at our Greenwood plant and the tight Permian residue gas market, with EBITDA increasing through the back half of the year. The combination of our fee and fee floor contracts in our Gathering and Processing segment and our hedges mean we are largely insulated from current commodity prices that are significantly lower than our guidance prices. As Matt said, we continue to estimate full year 2024 adjusted EBITDA between $3.7 billion and $3.9 billion and expect to exit 2024 with a lot of momentum heading into 2025, given our new infrastructure that comes online this year.\n This morning, we included a new performance metric in our disclosures, adjusted cash flow from operations, which is adjusted EBITDA, less interest expense and cash taxes. This is the metric that we first started discussing last November around our return of capital framework looking forward, and we thought it made sense for us to also include it in our disclosures. Including the new growth projects announced this morning, there is no change to our estimate for 2024 growth capital spending of between $2.3 billion and $2.5 billion. \n We also continue to estimate made approximately $1.4 billion of net growth capital expenditures in 2025, which will result in meaningful free cash flow generation. Our current year estimate for net maintenance capital spending remains $225 million. At quarter end, we had $2.6 billion of available liquidity, and our consolidated net leverage ratio was 3.6x, well within our long-term leverage ratio target range of 3 to 4x.\n Shifting to capital allocation. Our priorities remain the same, which are to maintain a strong investment-grade balance sheet to continue to invest in high-returning integrated projects and to return an increasing amount of capital to our shareholders across cycles, and we are delivering on those priorities. We are continuing to model the ability over time to return 40% to 50% of adjusted cash flow from operations to equity holders and believe that this is a useful framework for thinking about Targa's return of capital proposition over time. \n Consistent with previously announced expectations, our Board approved the declaration of a 50% increase to the 2024 annual common dividend to $3 per share and we expect to be able to grow the annual common dividend meaningfully thereafter. We also repurchased $124 million of common shares during the first quarter at a weighted average price of approximately $104 per share.\n We believe that we continue to offer a unique value proposition for our shareholders and potential shareholders; growing EBITDA, a growing common dividend per share, reducing share count and excellent short, medium and long-term outlooks. Our talented team continues to execute on our strategic priorities and safely operate our assets to deliver the energy that enhances our everyday lives. And we are so thankful for the efforts of all of our employees.\n And with that, I will turn the call back over to Sanjay. \nSanjay Lad: Thanks, Jen. For the Q&A session, we kindly ask that you limit to one question and one follow-up and reenter the lineup, if you have additional questions. Jonathan, would you please open the line for Q&A? \nOperator: And our first question comes from the line of Michael Blum from Wells Fargo. \nMichael Blum: I want to start with the LPG volumes, it seems like still had really strong volumes in the quarter. It seems like the Panama canal issues while the global shipping volatility is not really impacting U.S. cargoes or your cargoes. So I wonder if you could just speak to what you're seeing in the global markets and then how you see the rest of the year shaping up. \nD. Pryor: Michael, this is Scott. Yes, we continue to have great success across the dock, obviously, in the fourth quarter of last year, and that continued through the first quarter of this year. To your point around shipping. Shipping has certainly moderated. It does not seem to be an issue today. We were able to take advantage of that in the fourth quarter, and again, in the first quarter of this year, with vessels being available so that our spot opportunities really persisted throughout the quarter, both on propane as well as on butane.\n Panama Canal issues don't seem to be really impacting it at all. I will say that overall shipping has kind of resolved itself to really going around the cape of good hope. As opposed to transiting through the Panama Canal though, there are still some LPG vessels that are going through. But again, it's not near to the level that you have seen historically, probably 2 to 3 vessels per week are transiting the Panama Canal on an LPG-type basis.\n For us, certainly, the spot opportunities were there during the first quarter, but we really benefited from a continuation of our expansion project that we had last -- third quarter of last year as well as the nighttime transits, which we continue to benefit from, and we would really see that continuing. Again, hats off to the Houston Ship Channel, the Houston Pilots Association, they have operated that -- those nighttime transits very safely and accommodating the industry as a whole and I really believe that, that will just continue for years to come.\n So, for the balance of the year, we'll just have to see how things shake out. I think the demand is really strong in the East, with new PDH plants coming online in China, though that will somewhat marginalize some of the older plants. But again, in the domestic market, demands that are happening in the third world countries that are developing their marketplaces, it really just looks good for us throughout the balance of this year. \nMichael Blum: Great. Maybe just a follow-up on this topic. The nighttime transits, is there -- can you quantify how much of that add for the quarter? Or just in general, how much you think that adds on sort of effective capacity basis? And would you say this is kind of a new normal? \nD. Pryor: I think we alluded to the fact that last quarter that we saw it probably in the range of, call it, 7% or something like that. I would actually suggest to you that we've actually seen better percentage benefit to us. It really just allows us to operate our refrigeration units at a higher utilization rate with those nighttime transits. So we're getting significantly above, say, a 10% type improvement over -- in our overall operating rates. \nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Theresa Chen from Barclays. \nTheresa Chen: Maybe turning to the upstream side of things. Just given the strength of the inlet volumes in Q1, which arguably was higher than many expected, given the weather impact this year, and I appreciate the intra-quarter commentary, Matt. But how do you view the cadence growth for the remainder of 2024, taking into account the Waha egress issues? \nMatt Meloy: Yes, sure. I'll start. And then, Pat, if you want to add anything. Yes, we were, I'd say, pleasantly surprised with how volumes responded post the harsh weather in January. We're starting to see it in February, and then March was a very strong month. And that's really setting us up really well here in the second quarter. So I expect there to be continued growth in both Midland and Delaware, really from now throughout the end of the year, there's a lot of producer activity.\n So kind of barring any upsets, we have seen residue pipes go down from time to time, which can cause us to move gas around the system and can result in some lower volumes for a short period of time. It's hard to see -- it's hard to know exactly what impact that will have until Matterhorn comes on. I think we're still optimistic we're going to have continued growth from now through the end of the year, even despite those issues. \nPatrick McDonie: I would agree, Matt. Borrowing constraints on -- caused by residue issues, we have great line of sight with our producers, and the activity continues. We've got infrastructure going in place to handle it. So we're set up very well for that continued growth, and we expected throughout the year. \nTheresa Chen: Got it. And great to see the CapEx unchanged while taking into account the new projects as you previously telegraphed, with the backdrop of the free cash flow inflection next year as CapEx [ that's lowering ], returning more cash to shareholders, you hit a decent run rate. And I was wondering what is Targa's next area of strategic focus from here? \nMatt Meloy: Well, really, I think it's more of the same. I think it's -- our top priority, as Jen mentioned, is making sure, first, we have a strong balance sheet and good financial flexibility and then investing in our core business through organic growth. And I think we're going to continue to do that. We announced Train 11. We announced Pembrook II. We're looking at when we're going to need the next plan in the Delaware. We're already looking at when we'll need the next plan after Pembrook II. So it's really continued organic growth along, kind of, our -- along our core business, which is gathering and processing. And then moving those NGLs through our [ Grand Prix ], Daytona and our fractionation and export. So I think that's been our focus, and that's going to continue to be our focus. \nJennifer Kneale: And Theresa, this is Jen. I would just add that I think that's part of why we're so excited about the short, medium and long-term outlooks for Targa. When we think about the millions of acres that are already dedicated to us in the Permian, where we've got a great set of producers that have been so successful with their drilling activity. It feels like we just have an excellent runway in front of us over that short, medium and long term to just continue to do what I think we've put up a very credible track record around doing successfully, really for as far as the eye can see. \nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Jeremy Tonet from JPMorgan Securities. \nJeremy Tonet: Just wanted to see how you're thinking about taking stock of results so far, in the plant, seems like that's a minor issue there. Do you see yourselves within the guidance range that you reaffirmed? Do you see itself tracking towards the higher end or the lower end? Or how do you see, I guess, factors that could drive upside versus the downside at this point of the -- within the range? \nJennifer Kneale: Jeremy, this is Jen. I'd say that it's early. It's April. But so far, our employees have done a really excellent job of executing on a really strong first quarter and April that has had its challenges. So we're just really pleased of the efforts of all of our employees to date. And I think that's setting us up really well for the rest of the year as well. We've talked a little bit about the fact that we certainly are assuming that volumes are going to continue to ramp in both the Delaware and the Midland Basin, and that's not without some potential constraints. So ultimately, it's early, and we'd like to see how the rest of the year shapes up, but we're clearly feeling really good about our performance to date and the outlook we have going forward. \nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of John MacKay from Goldman Sachs. \nJohn Mackay: Maybe let's pick that last one up again, if you don't mind, and I understand the kind of initial commentary on 2Q EBITDA, but I was wondering if you could just tie that with the message that Permian volumes should still be growing quarter-over-quarter, is it the $10 million of kind of expense from the plant outage? Is it marketing rolling off, seasonality? Maybe just kind of bridge that and kind of balance that against, again, the quarter-over-quarter Permian growth. \nJennifer Kneale: John, this is Jen. I think you've got a lot of the pieces already, which is with the Greenwood fire, Matt quantified that we see about $10 million of additional expense. Some of that will be in capital in terms of the repairs that we need to make, but some of that will be in operating expenses as well. We'd also expect OpEx to rise Q2 relative to Q1 as we do have new assets coming into service. And we do have a lot of seasonality in our businesses that generally tend to result in weaker second quarters versus certainly the fourth or the first quarters of the year. So I think as we look at all of that, it's just playing some conservatism through our minds that we really just want to get through this quarter, continue to put up strong growth numbers in the Permian that will result in more volumes through the rest of our integrated system. We are very happy that Train 9 is starting up. That is very much needed at this point in time.\n Our capacity at GCF will be very much needed as well. So it also has to do with the fact that we've got some operational and really sort of facility constraints that have put a little bit of a limit on us that's coming off now here in the second quarter that again sets us up really well when we think about the third and fourth quarters and beyond. \nJohn Mackay: Appreciate that. And maybe if we just zoom out a little bit, taking into account the kind of some of these infrastructure issues we've seen in the first half and also the fact that most of the producers are talking about second half weighted activity levels for their Permian plans overall. Are we seeing any shifts in producer activity? Or does it feel like that second half ramp that we're expecting for the Permian more broadly, that's still in hand. \nPatrick McDonie: Well, I would say across our systems, we've seen pretty consistent growth. Frankly, the first half of this year is pretty robust. We put a lot of infrastructure in place today and have a lot more specifically compression. And obviously, Jen and Matt have talked about the plans we're bringing on compression to put in place. And that is solely focused on production that we know is getting drilled and being brought online. If I look at first half versus second half of the year, if across our system, sure, there's some incremental volume there, but it's really strong growth throughout the entire year for us. \nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Spiro Dounis from Citi. \nSpiro Dounis: First question, maybe just to go to some of the projects announced this morning. You've got another plant, another frac and a small export expansion. As we think about 2025 CapEx, do you still have room to announce even more projects before the need to amend guidance and just with everything you announced today, do you even see the need to announce anything else to facilitate that growth into next year? \nMatt Meloy: Yes, sure. Yes. So the Pembrook II and Train 11 were both contemplated and in our base case multiyear plan. As we look forward, we're always assessing when we're going to need additional plants in the Gathering and Processing, especially out in the Permian. So we had other plants in there. So I'd say we're kind of tracking towards what we had expected when we initially came with that guidance. And I'd say, yes, we have some room to handle some incremental growth in our business, kind of through '25 as planned. And I already mentioned, we're already evaluating when we're going to need another Delaware plant. So we're looking into that. I wouldn't think those are going to have a material impact on our outlook for capital for 2025. \nD. Pryor: And Spiro, this is Scott. As it relates to the small expansion project that Matt mentioned in his script, that is a small capital dollars for us to expand the export capacity. It basically gives us another VLGC a month starting in, call it, the third quarter of 2025. And really just a complement to our operations and our engineering teams for continuing to find ways to debottleneck our current assets and giving us a runway not only with last year's expansion, nighttime transits, as we mentioned earlier in the call, but along with this expansion, it gives us a good runway likely through Train 11. \nSpiro Dounis: Understood. [indiscernible] color there. Switching gears a bit, maybe just to go back to capital return. Some meaningful step up quarter-over-quarter in the buyback despite some of the really strong stock performance. So I suspect you still see a lot of value of your stock here. So curious -- maybe just comment on thinking through the rest of the year. Maybe one we could see you start to track closer to that 40% to 50% payout target. \nJennifer Kneale: Spiro, this is Jen. I think relative to repurchases, we clearly have very strong conviction in our outlook. Our flexible balance sheet is strong today, and it's only going to strengthen as we really move through 2024 and into 2025 and have a much lower growth capital spend next year. So I think that we're really looking at our repurchase program as continuing to be opportunistic and it's one of the tools that we will continue to use to be able to return an increasing amount of capital to our shareholders. \n You see some variability quarter-to-quarter and that's largely dependent on the opportunities that we're seeing in the market to repurchase shares as well as a whole lot of other things that are happening relative to when we're spending, what we're spending, what we have in terms of what's coming in on the margin side, there's just a lot that is factored into what we're doing every day related to our repurchase program.\n So I'm not going to give guidance on where we expecting to take this quarter-to-quarter, the rest of the year. But it is certainly a very important tool that we will continue to utilize to return capital to our shareholders. And I think we've been pretty open that when we laid out the framework of 40% to 50% of cash flow from operations and that really being what we are using internally as the guidepost for how we can return capital to shareholders over sort of a 5-year planning horizon. We said that 2024, we may not be in that ZIP code just because our growth capital lift this year is so big. But ultimately, we'll just have to see how the rest of the year shakes out. \nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Neil Dickman from Truth Securities. \nJacob Nivasch: This is Jake Nivasch on for Neil. Two for me, and I know we touched on this a good amount, but I just want to ask it a different way. In terms of the, I guess, the upstream growth that we're talking about here, are you seeing it across all of your producers? Is it -- are there a select few key producers that are -- that you think are going to drive this growth? Just curious, I guess, what the dynamic or split looks like there. \nPatrick McDonie: What I would say is that it's pretty consistent across all our producers, I mean, certainly, some have more rigs running and they're a little more of a greater percentage increase than others. But activity level across our entire producer base is pretty robust. It's across the Delaware, the Central and the Midland Basin. It's not area specific. It's not producer specific. It's really strong, steady activity across the producer base, across the entirety of the Midland Basin. So right now, we feel really good about the way our producers are performing. And frankly, we're getting, like I said earlier, infrastructure in place to be ready to handle it. \nRobert Muraro: And this is Bobby. As we think about our expectations at the end of the day, so much of our gas is coming from low-pressure gathering. This is a step that's coordinated out months and a year at a time. So we have really good visibility for what we think comes online, when and where. \nJacob Nivasch: Sure. And then just a follow-up here. With regards to capital spending, I guess, in 2025, I guess, how sticky is that growth CapEx number that you guys are looking at that $1.4 billion? And the reason I ask is, I guess, you're talking about investing more organically and see some additional opportunities out there. And I guess, how do you balance that between an inorganic growth, acquiring something? And is this all accounted for in that $1.4 billion, these organic projects? Or do you think there could be some more upside here? \nMatt Meloy: Yes, sure. No, good question. Look, when we think about $1.4 billion in 2025, what gives us some confidence in that number, it being a relatively sticky number is, a lot of the large-scale downstream projects are accounted for. Daytona is coming online later this year. We've already announced Train 11. That's in there. We've talked about an export project. So on the downstream side, we don't really see a whole lot being added to 2025. So it really just comes to Gathering and Processing. And so there, I think what could move it, plus and minus is just overall field activity.\n If volumes are a lot stronger, we need to put in even more compression or more pipelines. There could be some upward or downward just depending on overall volumes and then adding processing plants. We've already got, as we mentioned, the Pembrook II that added in there. We're ordering long lead times for the next Delaware plant. That was already contemplated. So it would need to be a pretty big delta, I'd say, in overall growth expectations or growth realizations for us in G&P to have a large scale move. So that's why we feel pretty good about the $1.4 billion. As we go through the year and we give guidance, we'll refine it. And could have moved down a little bit up a little bit. We'll see. But I think we feel pretty good about the $1.4 billion for next year. \nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Neel Mitra from Bank of America. \nIndraneel Mitra: I was looking at the year-over-year bridge on the G&P segment, and one of the tailwinds in the quarter was higher fees. I was just wondering if you could explain what that is? Is it moving to more fixed fee contracts, escalators or higher fee floors. Just trying to understand what that comment is and what the driver looks for the quarter? \nJennifer Kneale: Neel, this is Jen. We talked very openly on our February call, and you can even see it in our proxy and some of our disclosures that our commercial team was really successful continuing to put fee floors into some key contracts in the fourth quarter of 2023. And that's what's allowing us to announce a new processing plant, despite negative Waha prices today and very low NGL prices. So certainly appreciate the support and alignment of our producers related to that capital spend.\n So as you start to look at our quarter -- our year-over-year results, I think you'll continue to see that more and more, particularly in a commodity price environment that looks like today, that we are going to earn more and more fees in our gathering and processing business. So it's really the result of just more fee-based volume growth as well as fee floor growth in our Gathering and Processing business and our contracts. \nIndraneel Mitra: Okay. Perfect. And the second question on the L&T side. Fractionation volumes were down, looks scheduled downtime. Could you maybe provide how often you have scheduled downtime on the frac side? And then if you incur third-party frac costs this quarter that we publish and run through for the rest of the year. \nD. Pryor: Yes, Neel, this is Scott. When you look at the first quarter relative to fourth quarter of last year, yes, our frac volumes were down, but our fractionators were full in the fourth quarter, they were full in the first quarter, but just limited in terms of availability of space because of the downtime that we had that was scheduled as well as some of the impacts of the harsh winter weather that we had in January as well. .\n Looking forward for us into the second quarter, obviously, as Jim mentioned, we're really happy to see Train 9 in startup mode. And then we'll be really happy to see GCF start up sometime during this quarter as well. So when you look at our frac volumes, you're going to see a meaningful step-up in volumes into the second quarter for us when we come out of that quarter with Train 9 online and with GCF giving a partial contribution at the back end of the quarter as well. So I would anticipate that really to continue throughout third quarter and fourth quarter, again, with all the operating facilities. \n In terms of scheduled maintenance, those just come periodically. There's no really -- there's scheduled maintenance that we have on certain vessels that we have to inspect due to requirements. And we work those in and try to make those really not impact us in terms of being able to perform for our customers overall. \nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Keith Stanley from Wolfe Research. \nKeith Stanley: So I know the company is more fee-based than well-hedged this year, but I want to make sure with Waha prices being pretty extreme here that there's no meaningful impact from prices themselves on the company this year. And then related to that, just given Permian gas supply continues to beat expectations kind of over and over. At what point do you start to feel more pressure to move forward on a gas pipeline project like Apex? Is it -- do you need to see something happen by the summer, the fall or how you're thinking about that overall? \nMatt Meloy: Okay. Keith, yes, good question. I'll start with just talking a little bit about Waha and then Bobby and Pat can talk a little bit about that in the Permian supply. Yes. So there are pluses and minuses for us when we have really weak Waha prices. We have just -- still have some commodity sensitivity and some length for gas in our G&P business. A lot of that is protected by floors, and hybrids and fee-based contracts, we still have some length on natural gas. So when you see negative prices, that is a negative for us.\n We also move a lot of gas intra-basin and out of the basin, and we have large transport positions to make sure we can get the gas out of the basin. So when you have dislocations in Waha, we do have some gas marketing upticks relative to our transportation position. So that could be depending on where we're moving it and where we're able to get it to, there could be some positives there. So I'd say there's pluses and minuses. Overall, we would prefer higher Waha prices than lower. It's good for our customers, it's good for our business, but there are pluses and minuses to volatility in Waha and weaker Waha prices.\n And then on the Permian supply and gas lines, Bobby, you want to talk about that? \nRobert Muraro: Yes. So a couple of things relative to what Matt said, not use a phrase, it's [indiscernible] right? So every couple of years, we see Waha get crushed. We have those really defined forecasts relative to the wallet connection. So we're always planning, and Pat mentioned it earlier, with both our producers that market their own gas and taking kind and producers that we market for it. We are  ahead of this and planning to make sure we can move all the gas that comes out of our plants. So the immediate issue is ignoring issues on pipes that aren't expected. We're always set up to be ready for this because this happens every 2 years.\n Then relative to thinking about the next pipe, it's a similar refrain to what I've said before. Target is #1 priority, making sure gas moves out of the basin that our producers can flow their gas out of our plants and we can move the gas, if we move for producers out of our plants. And we are working on multiple fronts, multiple options, multiple pipes, all that have, I'll call, very good traction. I fully expect -- I've said this before, that pipe will go FID by the end of this year. If we make good progress on one of the options that the industry does, it could go earlier than year-end. I won't guess to what month, but I fully expect gas pipeline to go and go this year.\n When you think about Waha, where it is, things like that on the margin, motivate shippers and pipe owners even more to get things done. So I have as much confidence today. It's just 3 months closer than last call that something will go FID. \nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Tristan Richardson from Scotiabank. \nTristan Richardson: A lot has been asked and answered. But maybe just one for me on the CapEx side. I think last quarter, in [indiscernible] call, you offered that illustrative annual spending example [ one ]. And if we look at '25, it seems like with another Midland plant and another frac announced today, 2025 will look a lot like what you've laid out in that hypothetical, but the '25 guide is quite a bit below, 20% below. So just thinking about maybe where we're deviating from some of that illustrative example. And just maybe where you're seeing actuals in '25 looking better than some of that illustrative spend that you guys laid out last quarter? \nMatt Meloy: Yes, Tristan, I think probably the biggest delta versus the average is completing Daytona this year. We shouldn't have any NGL transport to speak of on a multiyear basis. That's one item. \nJennifer Kneale: And then the other one would be really low-cost export expansion we have, we've got in that illustrative multiyear guidance spending, for both transport and exports, that we wouldn't expect to need to do in a meaningful way in 2025. \nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Sunil Sibal from Seaport Global. \nSunil Sibal: So I wanted to start off on the infrastructure side in Permian. I think you've previously talked about how you'll kind of debottleneck the Permian portion of Grand Prix through pump capacity additions and all that. Could you talk about where does your kind of current capacity stands there? And obviously, Daytona comes online later this year. How should we think about volume trending on that and competition for third-party volumes per se? \nD. Pryor: Sunil, this is Scott. Yes, with the Daytona coming online in the fourth quarter of this year, just as a reminder, when we bring that online, we're anticipating the initial throughput or capacity to be around 400,000 barrels a day. And with the ability to add pump stations over time where it makes sense as we see the growth in our G&P business filtering in and through our pipelines. So those capacities, similar to what we did on the West leg of Grand Prix, that can put us over 600,000 barrels a day between that. So that gives us a lot of operating leverage on the West side of the portion of Grand Prix with Daytona coming online.\n When you look at our South leg, we've got a lot of operating capacity there. Again, the capacity is around 1 million barrels a day. We're bringing in just over 700,000 barrels a day currently. So that gives us also some operating leverage as it relates to that. And when you look at the numbers, we move today, there's a lot of volume that still comes into our facility that comes from third-party pipes. We participate in moving some volume on some of those third-party pipes as well as our customers do. And I would anticipate continuing to see that happening over a period of time.\n We'll have to evaluate relative to when we would have to do a South leg expansion, if you will. But I think we've got a lot of runway for right now, and then we can look to participate on third-party pipes where it makes sense, both physically as well as economically for us. \nRobert Muraro: And this is Bobby. Yes, about third-party competition. We've talked about this before. We are a wellhead-to-water company, right? So we build Grand Prix, we build Daytona, we build our NGL structure service our G&P footprint that goes out to the wellhead. A vast majority of the liquids that come out of our plants go down our NGL pipes, and we anticipate that being the same going forward. The third-party business exists within Targa, but that's not the driver of Targa's NGL business. It is our wellhead-to-water starting at the wellhead. \nSunil Sibal: Okay. And then as a follow-up, I think, on the strategic side of things, I was curious how do you think of your assets outside of Permian, seems like, if I remember correctly, the Badlands JV is past the 5-year mark. How should we think about your assets outside the Permian, you still kind of give them as free cash flow positive assets or are there any investment opportunities outside that? \nMatt Meloy: Yes. Most of the activity is obviously around our Permian and related NGL infrastructure. That's where the activity is. That's where the growth is happening. And the other assets, there's not a lot at -- especially with weaker gas prices. When gas prices moved up in '22, we started to see some activity, but you're seeing volumes move off, which is not unexpected. So to the extent there are some opportunities and there are some limited opportunities in the Central region to go get packages of gas and compete, we go do that, and we're looking to grow where it makes sense or get additional packages of gas where it makes sense in those businesses.\n I'd say, up in the Badlands we're actually through the remainder of this year and into next year, seeing some strong activity, we'd expect there actually to probably be some growth in our Badlands business over the rest of this year into next year. So we're seeing some good activity up there. And if it's economic and it makes sense for us, we'll go and continue to grow that business and other businesses. It's just there's less opportunities outside the Permian. \nOperator: And for our final question today comes from the line of Zach Van Everen from TPH & Company. \nZackery Van Everen: Just want to go back to the Permian egress solution. You mentioned FID by the end of this year potentially. Just curious how you think about markets in 2026. Consensus seems to be like '26 is when we'll need a new pipe. So curious on if you kind of agree with that. And is the 2-year time frame, what you guys are hearing to build another gas egress pipe. \nRobert Muraro: This is Bobby. Yes. No, I think we've reiterated that on multiple calls. We see '26 as the year for a need for another full pipe out of the basin, whether that's earlier in the year or later in the year, we'll be prepared for whatever that answer is, as we move forward in time. And I think, generally speaking, yes, the 24 months from FID is kind of the number that everybody talks about, sometimes you talk about '26, maybe it's '22, maybe it's '28, but '24 is the good guideline that I think the whole industry uses for the construction of that pipe. So -- and yes, I'm fully confident that if we'll go -- something will go FID before the end of the year that solves the '26 basin issue. \nZackery Van Everen: Got it. Perfect. And then flipping over to propane. I just want to get your views for the rest of the year. We've seen production come in pretty hot and storage is still over the 5 years. So I just want to get your views there. And then you could remind us of how much marketing you guys have on the docks that can capture that international spread. \nD. Pryor: Zach, this is Scott. We've certainly seen increased production really across the board as it relates to the additive of production coming out of the Permian as a whole from a U.S. production perspective. The draws of late have been relatively weak, if you will. So yes, we're kind of seeing year-on-year similar type inventories. And that's the reason why I think you're also seeing max levels, if you will, or high utilization levels of exports across the dock, whether it's us or even the competition in the marketplace. Some of that's going to get solved by some of the expansion projects that have already been announced.\n Of course, we have a small complementary one that we just announced this morning. So folks will be gearing up to push that -- push those across the dock. Basically, product will have to get price to move typically on to the water, and that will aid in developing other marketplaces really across the globe, whether you're feeding again, domestic use, petrochemical use or PDH use. And I fully anticipate that to continue. We continue to hear that the shipping industry also is adding ships to accommodate the need for those types of movements as well. So I think we will all see a benefit of that as we move forward in time. \nOperator: This does conclude the question-and-answer session of today's program. I'd like to hand the program back to Sanjay for any further remarks. \nSanjay Lad: Thanks to everyone that was on the call this morning, and we appreciate your interest in Targa Resources. The IR team will be available for any follow-up questions you have. Have a great day. \nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.",

            "content": "I would agree, Matt. Borrowing constraints on -- caused by residue issues, we have great line of sight with our producers, and the activity continues. We've got infrastructure going in place to handle it. So we're set up very well for that continued growth, and we expected throughout the year. Well, I would say across our systems, we've seen pretty consistent growth. Frankly, the first half of this year is pretty robust. We put a lot of infrastructure in place today and have a lot more specifically compression. And obviously, Jen and Matt have talked about the plans we're bringing on compression to put in place. And that is solely focused on production that we know is getting drilled and being brought online. If I look at first half versus second half of the year, if across our system, sure, there's some incremental volume there, but it's really strong growth throughout the entire year for us. What I would say is that it's pretty consistent across all our producers, I mean, certainly, some have more rigs running and they're a little more of a greater percentage increase than others. But activity level across our entire producer base is pretty robust. It's across the Delaware, the Central and the Midland Basin. It's not area specific. It's not producer specific. It's really strong, steady activity across the producer base, across the entirety of the Midland Basin. So right now, we feel really good about the way our producers are performing. And frankly, we're getting, like I said earlier, infrastructure in place to be ready to handle it."

            "content": "Michael, this is Scott. Yes, we continue to have great success across the dock, obviously, in the fourth quarter of last year, and that continued through the first quarter of this year. To your point around shipping. Shipping has certainly moderated. It does not seem to be an issue today. We were able to take advantage of that in the fourth quarter, and again, in the first quarter of this year, with vessels being available so that our spot opportunities really persisted throughout the quarter, both on propane as well as on butane.\n Panama Canal issues don't seem to be really impacting it at all. I will say that overall shipping has kind of resolved itself to really going around the cape of good hope. As opposed to transiting through the Panama Canal though, there are still some LPG vessels that are going through. But again, it's not near to the level that you have seen historically, probably 2 to 3 vessels per week are transiting the Panama Canal on an LPG-type basis.\n For us, certainly, the spot opportunities were there during the first quarter, but we really benefited from a continuation of our expansion project that we had last -- third quarter of last year as well as the nighttime transits, which we continue to benefit from, and we would really see that continuing. Again, hats off to the Houston Ship Channel, the Houston Pilots Association, they have operated that -- those nighttime transits very safely and accommodating the industry as a whole and I really believe that, that will just continue for years to come.\n So, for the balance of the year, we'll just have to see how things shake out. I think the demand is really strong in the East, with new PDH plants coming online in China, though that will somewhat marginalize some of the older plants. But again, in the domestic market, demands that are happening in the third world countries that are developing their marketplaces, it really just looks good for us throughout the balance of this year. I think we alluded to the fact that last quarter that we saw it probably in the range of, call it, 7% or something like that. I would actually suggest to you that we've actually seen better percentage benefit to us. It really just allows us to operate our refrigeration units at a higher utilization rate with those nighttime transits. So we're getting significantly above, say, a 10% type improvement over -- in our overall operating rates. And Spiro, this is Scott. As it relates to the small expansion project that Matt mentioned in his script, that is a small capital dollars for us to expand the export capacity. It basically gives us another VLGC a month starting in, call it, the third quarter of 2025. And really just a complement to our operations and our engineering teams for continuing to find ways to debottleneck our current assets and giving us a runway not only with last year's expansion, nighttime transits, as we mentioned earlier in the call, but along with this expansion, it gives us a good runway likely through Train 11. Yes, Neel, this is Scott. When you look at the first quarter relative to fourth quarter of last year, yes, our frac volumes were down, but our fractionators were full in the fourth quarter, they were full in the first quarter, but just limited in terms of availability of space because of the downtime that we had that was scheduled as well as some of the impacts of the harsh winter weather that we had in January as well. .\n Looking forward for us into the second quarter, obviously, as Jim mentioned, we're really happy to see Train 9 in startup mode. And then we'll be really happy to see GCF start up sometime during this quarter as well. So when you look at our frac volumes, you're going to see a meaningful step-up in volumes into the second quarter for us when we come out of that quarter with Train 9 online and with GCF giving a partial contribution at the back end of the quarter as well. So I would anticipate that really to continue throughout third quarter and fourth quarter, again, with all the operating facilities. \n In terms of scheduled maintenance, those just come periodically. There's no really -- there's scheduled maintenance that we have on certain vessels that we have to inspect due to requirements. And we work those in and try to make those really not impact us in terms of being able to perform for our customers overall. Sunil, this is Scott. Yes, with the Daytona coming online in the fourth quarter of this year, just as a reminder, when we bring that online, we're anticipating the initial throughput or capacity to be around 400,000 barrels a day. And with the ability to add pump stations over time where it makes sense as we see the growth in our G&P business filtering in and through our pipelines. So those capacities, similar to what we did on the West leg of Grand Prix, that can put us over 600,000 barrels a day between that. So that gives us a lot of operating leverage on the West side of the portion of Grand Prix with Daytona coming online.\n When you look at our South leg, we've got a lot of operating capacity there. Again, the capacity is around 1 million barrels a day. We're bringing in just over 700,000 barrels a day currently. So that gives us also some operating leverage as it relates to that. And when you look at the numbers, we move today, there's a lot of volume that still comes into our facility that comes from third-party pipes. We participate in moving some volume on some of those third-party pipes as well as our customers do. And I would anticipate continuing to see that happening over a period of time.\n We'll have to evaluate relative to when we would have to do a South leg expansion, if you will. But I think we've got a lot of runway for right now, and then we can look to participate on third-party pipes where it makes sense, both physically as well as economically for us. Zach, this is Scott. We've certainly seen increased production really across the board as it relates to the additive of production coming out of the Permian as a whole from a U.S. production perspective. The draws of late have been relatively weak, if you will. So yes, we're kind of seeing year-on-year similar type inventories. And that's the reason why I think you're also seeing max levels, if you will, or high utilization levels of exports across the dock, whether it's us or even the competition in the marketplace. Some of that's going to get solved by some of the expansion projects that have already been announced.\n Of course, we have a small complementary one that we just announced this morning. So folks will be gearing up to push that -- push those across the dock. Basically, product will have to get price to move typically on to the water, and that will aid in developing other marketplaces really across the globe, whether you're feeding again, domestic use, petrochemical use or PDH use. And I fully anticipate that to continue. We continue to hear that the shipping industry also is adding ships to accommodate the need for those types of movements as well. So I think we will all see a benefit of that as we move forward in time."

            "name": "Jennifer Kneale",
            "content": "Thanks, Matt. Good morning, everyone. Targa's reported quarterly adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter was a record $966 million, a 1% increase over the fourth quarter. For the first quarter, our natural gas inlet volumes in the Permian averaged a record 5.4 billion cubic feet per day, a 2% increase when compared to the fourth quarter. Large Permian volumes were stronger than estimated when we hosted our February earnings call and significantly higher than January, which translated into additional volumes downstream. \n For the full quarter, our NGL pipeline transportation volumes averaged 718,000 barrels per day. Our fractionation volumes averaged 797,000 barrels per day, including the impacts of scheduled maintenance at our Mont Belvieu complex. Our LPG export loadings were a record 13.3 million barrels per month, and we benefited from optimization opportunities in our marketing business. \n As we look across the rest of 2024, second quarter EBITDA may be weaker than Q1, given seasonality in our business, the impacts on the quarter of the fire at our Greenwood plant and the tight Permian residue gas market, with EBITDA increasing through the back half of the year. The combination of our fee and fee floor contracts in our Gathering and Processing segment and our hedges mean we are largely insulated from current commodity prices that are significantly lower than our guidance prices. As Matt said, we continue to estimate full year 2024 adjusted EBITDA between $3.7 billion and $3.9 billion and expect to exit 2024 with a lot of momentum heading into 2025, given our new infrastructure that comes online this year.\n This morning, we included a new performance metric in our disclosures, adjusted cash flow from operations, which is adjusted EBITDA, less interest expense and cash taxes. This is the metric that we first started discussing last November around our return of capital framework looking forward, and we thought it made sense for us to also include it in our disclosures. Including the new growth projects announced this morning, there is no change to our estimate for 2024 growth capital spending of between $2.3 billion and $2.5 billion. \n We also continue to estimate made approximately $1.4 billion of net growth capital expenditures in 2025, which will result in meaningful free cash flow generation. Our current year estimate for net maintenance capital spending remains $225 million. At quarter end, we had $2.6 billion of available liquidity, and our consolidated net leverage ratio was 3.6x, well within our long-term leverage ratio target range of 3 to 4x.\n Shifting to capital allocation. Our priorities remain the same, which are to maintain a strong investment-grade balance sheet to continue to invest in high-returning integrated projects and to return an increasing amount of capital to our shareholders across cycles, and we are delivering on those priorities. We are continuing to model the ability over time to return 40% to 50% of adjusted cash flow from operations to equity holders and believe that this is a useful framework for thinking about Targa's return of capital proposition over time. \n Consistent with previously announced expectations, our Board approved the declaration of a 50% increase to the 2024 annual common dividend to $3 per share and we expect to be able to grow the annual common dividend meaningfully thereafter. We also repurchased $124 million of common shares during the first quarter at a weighted average price of approximately $104 per share.\n We believe that we continue to offer a unique value proposition for our shareholders and potential shareholders; growing EBITDA, a growing common dividend per share, reducing share count and excellent short, medium and long-term outlooks. Our talented team continues to execute on our strategic priorities and safely operate our assets to deliver the energy that enhances our everyday lives. And we are so thankful for the efforts of all of our employees.\n And with that, I will turn the call back over to Sanjay. And Theresa, this is Jen. I would just add that I think that's part of why we're so excited about the short, medium and long-term outlooks for Targa. When we think about the millions of acres that are already dedicated to us in the Permian, where we've got a great set of producers that have been so successful with their drilling activity. It feels like we just have an excellent runway in front of us over that short, medium and long term to just continue to do what I think we've put up a very credible track record around doing successfully, really for as far as the eye can see. Jeremy, this is Jen. I'd say that it's early. It's April. But so far, our employees have done a really excellent job of executing on a really strong first quarter and April that has had its challenges. So we're just really pleased of the efforts of all of our employees to date. And I think that's setting us up really well for the rest of the year as well. We've talked a little bit about the fact that we certainly are assuming that volumes are going to continue to ramp in both the Delaware and the Midland Basin, and that's not without some potential constraints. So ultimately, it's early, and we'd like to see how the rest of the year shapes up, but we're clearly feeling really good about our performance to date and the outlook we have going forward. John, this is Jen. I think you've got a lot of the pieces already, which is with the Greenwood fire, Matt quantified that we see about $10 million of additional expense. Some of that will be in capital in terms of the repairs that we need to make, but some of that will be in operating expenses as well. We'd also expect OpEx to rise Q2 relative to Q1 as we do have new assets coming into service. And we do have a lot of seasonality in our businesses that generally tend to result in weaker second quarters versus certainly the fourth or the first quarters of the year. So I think as we look at all of that, it's just playing some conservatism through our minds that we really just want to get through this quarter, continue to put up strong growth numbers in the Permian that will result in more volumes through the rest of our integrated system. We are very happy that Train 9 is starting up. That is very much needed at this point in time.\n Our capacity at GCF will be very much needed as well. So it also has to do with the fact that we've got some operational and really sort of facility constraints that have put a little bit of a limit on us that's coming off now here in the second quarter that again sets us up really well when we think about the third and fourth quarters and beyond. Spiro, this is Jen. I think relative to repurchases, we clearly have very strong conviction in our outlook. Our flexible balance sheet is strong today, and it's only going to strengthen as we really move through 2024 and into 2025 and have a much lower growth capital spend next year. So I think that we're really looking at our repurchase program as continuing to be opportunistic and it's one of the tools that we will continue to use to be able to return an increasing amount of capital to our shareholders. \n You see some variability quarter-to-quarter and that's largely dependent on the opportunities that we're seeing in the market to repurchase shares as well as a whole lot of other things that are happening relative to when we're spending, what we're spending, what we have in terms of what's coming in on the margin side, there's just a lot that is factored into what we're doing every day related to our repurchase program.\n So I'm not going to give guidance on where we expecting to take this quarter-to-quarter, the rest of the year. But it is certainly a very important tool that we will continue to utilize to return capital to our shareholders. And I think we've been pretty open that when we laid out the framework of 40% to 50% of cash flow from operations and that really being what we are using internally as the guidepost for how we can return capital to shareholders over sort of a 5-year planning horizon. We said that 2024, we may not be in that ZIP code just because our growth capital lift this year is so big. But ultimately, we'll just have to see how the rest of the year shakes out. Neel, this is Jen. We talked very openly on our February call, and you can even see it in our proxy and some of our disclosures that our commercial team was really successful continuing to put fee floors into some key contracts in the fourth quarter of 2023. And that's what's allowing us to announce a new processing plant, despite negative Waha prices today and very low NGL prices. So certainly appreciate the support and alignment of our producers related to that capital spend.\n So as you start to look at our quarter -- our year-over-year results, I think you'll continue to see that more and more, particularly in a commodity price environment that looks like today, that we are going to earn more and more fees in our gathering and processing business. So it's really the result of just more fee-based volume growth as well as fee floor growth in our Gathering and Processing business and our contracts. And then the other one would be really low-cost export expansion we have, we've got in that illustrative multiyear guidance spending, for both transport and exports, that we wouldn't expect to need to do in a meaningful way in 2025."

            "name": "Robert Muraro",
            "content": "And this is Bobby. As we think about our expectations at the end of the day, so much of our gas is coming from low-pressure gathering. This is a step that's coordinated out months and a year at a time. So we have really good visibility for what we think comes online, when and where. Yes. So a couple of things relative to what Matt said, not use a phrase, it's [indiscernible] right? So every couple of years, we see Waha get crushed. We have those really defined forecasts relative to the wallet connection. So we're always planning, and Pat mentioned it earlier, with both our producers that market their own gas and taking kind and producers that we market for it. We are  ahead of this and planning to make sure we can move all the gas that comes out of our plants. So the immediate issue is ignoring issues on pipes that aren't expected. We're always set up to be ready for this because this happens every 2 years.\n Then relative to thinking about the next pipe, it's a similar refrain to what I've said before. Target is #1 priority, making sure gas moves out of the basin that our producers can flow their gas out of our plants and we can move the gas, if we move for producers out of our plants. And we are working on multiple fronts, multiple options, multiple pipes, all that have, I'll call, very good traction. I fully expect -- I've said this before, that pipe will go FID by the end of this year. If we make good progress on one of the options that the industry does, it could go earlier than year-end. I won't guess to what month, but I fully expect gas pipeline to go and go this year.\n When you think about Waha, where it is, things like that on the margin, motivate shippers and pipe owners even more to get things done. So I have as much confidence today. It's just 3 months closer than last call that something will go FID. And this is Bobby. Yes, about third-party competition. We've talked about this before. We are a wellhead-to-water company, right? So we build Grand Prix, we build Daytona, we build our NGL structure service our G&P footprint that goes out to the wellhead. A vast majority of the liquids that come out of our plants go down our NGL pipes, and we anticipate that being the same going forward. The third-party business exists within Targa, but that's not the driver of Targa's NGL business. It is our wellhead-to-water starting at the wellhead. This is Bobby. Yes. No, I think we've reiterated that on multiple calls. We see '26 as the year for a need for another full pipe out of the basin, whether that's earlier in the year or later in the year, we'll be prepared for whatever that answer is, as we move forward in time. And I think, generally speaking, yes, the 24 months from FID is kind of the number that everybody talks about, sometimes you talk about '26, maybe it's '22, maybe it's '28, but '24 is the good guideline that I think the whole industry uses for the construction of that pipe. So -- and yes, I'm fully confident that if we'll go -- something will go FID before the end of the year that solves the '26 basin issue."

            "name": "Matt Meloy",
            "content": "Thanks, Sanjay, and good morning. We are proud of our first quarter results as we continue to execute across the organization to deliver another quarter of record adjusted EBITDA, Permian volumes and LPG export volumes, along with a 50% increase to our common dividend per share and $124 million of common share repurchases. For the quarter, we really benefited from strong back half of the quarter Permian volume growth. January was impacted by operational upsets associated with harsh weather. From there, volumes significantly increased throughout the quarter, which helped drive record results and sets us up well looking forward.\n We are adding a substantial amount of compression across the rest of the year and our expectation is for continued Permian volume growth, recognizing that prior to Matterhorn initiating service and adding incremental natural gas takeaway capacity, gas markets will remain tight. As we saw in March and April, there are upsets associated with pipeline maintenance that create further constraints, it may affect volumes and significantly impact Waha gas prices. Short-term constraints aside, given our outlook for increasing Permian volumes and resulting NGL supply growth, we announced this morning that we are moving forward with 2 major growth capital projects. Our next Permian Midland plant, Pembrook II and our next fractionator in Mont Belvieu, Train 11 to support the infrastructure needs of our customers.\n We mentioned in February that we are ordering long lead items for both projects and have since received Board approval to move forward with no change to our estimates for 2024 and 2025 net growth capital spend. I am pleased to announce that we are also moving forward with a small capital project at our Galena Park facility that will increase our LPG export capacity by approximately 650,000 barrels per month within the second half of 2025. This project is an excellent example of our organization balancing between capital efficient, while ensuring our ability to support increasing volumes through our systems and also does not change our estimates for growth capital spending.\n Despite the current weakness in Waha natural gas and NGL prices, we continue to estimate full year 2024 adjusted EBITDA between $3.7 billion and $3.9 billion, which we believe is reflective of the importance of our fees and fee floors in our G&P business, which are supporting our continued investment in infrastructure despite a lower commodity price environment. Looking ahead, our premier Permian supply aggregation position, coupled with our integrated NGL system, positions us nicely to continue to generate high return organic opportunities and be able to continue to return incremental capital to our shareholders.\n Let's now discuss our operations in more detail. Starting in the Permian, activity continues to remain strong across our dedicated acreage. In Permian Midland, construction continues on our new Greenwood II plant and remains on track to begin operations in the fourth quarter of this year. Greenwood II is expected to be highly utilized when it comes online which is necessitating moving forward with Pembrook II, which is expected to begin operations in the fourth quarter of 2025.\n As you may have seen publicly, we had a fire at our Greenwood I plant in Permian Midland on April 16. There were no injuries, and we appreciate the work by our Targa team and first responders who were able to extinguish the fire safely and quickly. With 19 plants and a broad footprint across the Permian Midland, we are leveraging our operational flexibility to move gas around to handle all existing volumes and planned production growth to continue to be able to provide reliable service to our producer customers while the plant is down. We expect the plant back online before the end of the second quarter and do not expect the plant downtime to significantly impact our Midland volumes for the second quarter. We estimate about $10 million of repairs related to the incident.\n In Permian Delaware, activity in volumes across our footprint are also running strong. Our Roadrunner II plant is expected to commence operations in June and is also expected to begin service highly utilized. Our next Delaware plant, Bull Moose remains on track to come online in the second quarter of 2025. We continue to expect increasing Permian volumes as we move through the rest of the year as we benefit from new compression and plants coming online.\n For the second quarter, Waha gas prices are averaging around negative $1.30 as residue gas pipeline downtime for maintenance and operational upsets have resulted in additional tightness in the Permian Basin. We have done a good job of managing our Permian gas takeaway position to ensure surety of flow from our producers as the market awaits some relief when the Matterhorn pipeline comes on later this year.\n Shifting to our Logistics and Transportation segment. Construction continues on our Daytona NGL pipeline expansion, and we remain on track to begin operations in the fourth quarter of this year. The outlook for NGL supply growth continuing means our Daytona expansion will be much needed to handle incremental barrels. We are currently starting up our new fractionator in Mont Belvieu, Train 9 and expect it to be highly utilized. We expect to restart our Gulf Coast fractionator joint venture during the second quarter, which we also expect [ our ] portion of the capacity to be highly utilized at start-up. Construction continues on our Train 10 fractionator, which is also expected to be much needed when it comes online.\n Given our outlook for increasing NGL production growth to Mont Belvieu supports us officially moving forward with Train 11, a new 150,000 barrel per day fractionator. Train 11 is expected to begin operations in the third quarter of 2026. And the capital associated with Train 11 was already included in our expectations for spending that we provided publicly for both 2024 and 2025. In our LPG export business at Galena Park, our loadings were a record 13.3 million barrels per month during the first quarter as we continue to benefit from strong market conditions and the Houston Ship Channel allowance of nighttime transits for larger vessels.\n Before I turn the call over to Jen to discuss our first quarter results in more detail, I would like to extend a thank you to the Targa team for their continued focus on safety and execution, while continuing to provide best-in-class service and reliability to our customers. Our employees continue to rise to the challenges of our business, and we are appreciative of their efforts. Yes, sure. I'll start. And then, Pat, if you want to add anything. Yes, we were, I'd say, pleasantly surprised with how volumes responded post the harsh weather in January. We're starting to see it in February, and then March was a very strong month. And that's really setting us up really well here in the second quarter. So I expect there to be continued growth in both Midland and Delaware, really from now throughout the end of the year, there's a lot of producer activity.\n So kind of barring any upsets, we have seen residue pipes go down from time to time, which can cause us to move gas around the system and can result in some lower volumes for a short period of time. It's hard to see -- it's hard to know exactly what impact that will have until Matterhorn comes on. I think we're still optimistic we're going to have continued growth from now through the end of the year, even despite those issues. Well, really, I think it's more of the same. I think it's -- our top priority, as Jen mentioned, is making sure, first, we have a strong balance sheet and good financial flexibility and then investing in our core business through organic growth. And I think we're going to continue to do that. We announced Train 11. We announced Pembrook II. We're looking at when we're going to need the next plan in the Delaware. We're already looking at when we'll need the next plan after Pembrook II. So it's really continued organic growth along, kind of, our -- along our core business, which is gathering and processing. And then moving those NGLs through our [ Grand Prix ], Daytona and our fractionation and export. So I think that's been our focus, and that's going to continue to be our focus. Yes, sure. Yes. So the Pembrook II and Train 11 were both contemplated and in our base case multiyear plan. As we look forward, we're always assessing when we're going to need additional plants in the Gathering and Processing, especially out in the Permian. So we had other plants in there. So I'd say we're kind of tracking towards what we had expected when we initially came with that guidance. And I'd say, yes, we have some room to handle some incremental growth in our business, kind of through '25 as planned. And I already mentioned, we're already evaluating when we're going to need another Delaware plant. So we're looking into that. I wouldn't think those are going to have a material impact on our outlook for capital for 2025. Yes, sure. No, good question. Look, when we think about $1.4 billion in 2025, what gives us some confidence in that number, it being a relatively sticky number is, a lot of the large-scale downstream projects are accounted for. Daytona is coming online later this year. We've already announced Train 11. That's in there. We've talked about an export project. So on the downstream side, we don't really see a whole lot being added to 2025. So it really just comes to Gathering and Processing. And so there, I think what could move it, plus and minus is just overall field activity.\n If volumes are a lot stronger, we need to put in even more compression or more pipelines. There could be some upward or downward just depending on overall volumes and then adding processing plants. We've already got, as we mentioned, the Pembrook II that added in there. We're ordering long lead times for the next Delaware plant. That was already contemplated. So it would need to be a pretty big delta, I'd say, in overall growth expectations or growth realizations for us in G&P to have a large scale move. So that's why we feel pretty good about the $1.4 billion. As we go through the year and we give guidance, we'll refine it. And could have moved down a little bit up a little bit. We'll see. But I think we feel pretty good about the $1.4 billion for next year. Okay. Keith, yes, good question. I'll start with just talking a little bit about Waha and then Bobby and Pat can talk a little bit about that in the Permian supply. Yes. So there are pluses and minuses for us when we have really weak Waha prices. We have just -- still have some commodity sensitivity and some length for gas in our G&P business. A lot of that is protected by floors, and hybrids and fee-based contracts, we still have some length on natural gas. So when you see negative prices, that is a negative for us.\n We also move a lot of gas intra-basin and out of the basin, and we have large transport positions to make sure we can get the gas out of the basin. So when you have dislocations in Waha, we do have some gas marketing upticks relative to our transportation position. So that could be depending on where we're moving it and where we're able to get it to, there could be some positives there. So I'd say there's pluses and minuses. Overall, we would prefer higher Waha prices than lower. It's good for our customers, it's good for our business, but there are pluses and minuses to volatility in Waha and weaker Waha prices.\n And then on the Permian supply and gas lines, Bobby, you want to talk about that? Yes, Tristan, I think probably the biggest delta versus the average is completing Daytona this year. We shouldn't have any NGL transport to speak of on a multiyear basis. That's one item. Yes. Most of the activity is obviously around our Permian and related NGL infrastructure. That's where the activity is. That's where the growth is happening. And the other assets, there's not a lot at -- especially with weaker gas prices. When gas prices moved up in '22, we started to see some activity, but you're seeing volumes move off, which is not unexpected. So to the extent there are some opportunities and there are some limited opportunities in the Central region to go get packages of gas and compete, we go do that, and we're looking to grow where it makes sense or get additional packages of gas where it makes sense in those businesses.\n I'd say, up in the Badlands we're actually through the remainder of this year and into next year, seeing some strong activity, we'd expect there actually to probably be some growth in our Badlands business over the rest of this year into next year. So we're seeing some good activity up there. And if it's economic and it makes sense for us, we'll go and continue to grow that business and other businesses. It's just there's less opportunities outside the Permian."
