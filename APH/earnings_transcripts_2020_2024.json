Following today's presentation, there will be a formal question-and-answer session. Until then, all lines will remain in a listen-only mode. At the request of the company, today's conference is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to introduce today's conference host, Mr. Craig Lampo. Sir, you may begin.\nCraig Lampo: Good afternoon, everyone. This is Craig Lampo, Amphenol's CFO, and I'm here together with Adam Norwitt, Our CEO. We would like to welcome you to our fourth quarter 2020 conference call. Our fourth quarter and full year 2020 results were released this morning. I will provide some financial commentary and then Adam will give an overview of the business as well as current trends. Then we will take questions. As a reminder, during the call, we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures and may make certain forward-looking statements, so please refer to the relevant disclosures in our press release for further information. The Company closed the fourth quarter with record sales of $2.426 billion, and record GAAP and adjusted diluted EPS of $1.15 and $1.13, respectively. Sales were up 13% in U.S. dollars and up 11% in local currencies and organically compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. Sequentially, sales were up 4% in U.S. dollars and 3% in local currencies and organically. Breaking down sales into our two segments. The interconnect business, which comprised 96% of our sales, was up 14% in U.S. dollars and 11% in local currencies compared to the fourth quarter of last year. Our cable business, which comprised 4% of our sales, was down 4% in U.S. dollars and 2% in local currencies compared to the fourth quarter of last year. For the full year 2020, sales were $8.599 billion, which was up 5% in U.S. dollars, 4% in local currencies and 2% organically compared to 2019. Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes. From a segment standpoint, in the interconnect segment, margins were 22.5% in the fourth quarter of 2020, which increased from 22.0% in the fourth quarter of 2019 and 22.4% in the third quarter of 2020. In the cable segment, margins were 10.3%, which increased from 10% in the fourth quarter of 2019 and decreased from 10.7% in the third quarter of 2020. For the full year 2020, adjusted operating income was $1.650 billion, which was slightly up from 2019 and resulted in a full year 2020 adjusted operating margin of 19.2% compared to 20% in 2019. This 80 basis point decline reflects the challenges and results -- resulting impacts related to the COVID-19 pandemic, primarily in the first half of the year. Given the unprecedented challenges we saw this year, we are extremely proud of the Company's performance. Our team's ability to effectively manage through this crisis is a direct result of the strength and commitment of the Company's entrepreneurial management team, which continues to foster a high-performance, action-oriented culture, which has enabled us to capitalize on opportunities and maximize profitability in an uncertain market environment. The Company's GAAP effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 21.7%, which compared to 20.3% in the fourth quarter of 2019. On an adjusted basis, the effective tax rate was 24.5% for both the fourth quarter of 2020 and 2019. For the full year, the Company's GAAP effective tax rate for 2020 and 2019 was 20.5% and 20.2%, respectively. On an adjusted basis, the effective tax rate for both the full year 2020 and 2019 was 20.5% -- 24.5%. On a GAAP basis, diluted EPS increased by 12% to $1.15 in the fourth quarter compared to $1.03 in the prior year period. Adjusted diluted EPS increased by 15% to $1.13 in the fourth quarter of 2020 from $0.98 in the fourth quarter of 2019. For the full year, GAAP diluted EPS was $3.91, a 4% increase from 2019 GAAP diluted EPS of $2.75. Adjusted diluted EPS was $3.74 for 2020, which was unchanged compared to 2019. This was a strong performance considering the significant challenges and related incremental costs related -- resulting from the pandemic. Orders for the quarter were $2.512 billion, which was up 14% compared to the fourth quarter of 2019 and up 10% sequentially, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.04 to 1. The Company continues to be an excellent generator of cash. We are proud that operating and free cash flow for both the fourth quarter and full year 2020 were all records for the Company. Cash flow from operations was a strong $441 million in the fourth quarter, or 124% of net income. Net of capital spending, our free cash flow was $371 million, or 104% of net income. Cash flow from operations for the full year was $1.592 billion, or approximately 132% of net income. And net of capital spending, our free cash flow for 2020 was $1.328 billion, or 110% of net income. From a working capital standpoint, inventory days, days sales outstanding and payable days, were 79, 72 and 61 days, respectively, all within a normal range. During the quarter, the Company repurchased 1.5 million shares of common stock for approximately $182 million under the $2 billion open market stock repurchase plan, bringing total repurchases for the year to 6 million shares or $641 million. Total debt at December 31 was $3.9 billion and net debt at the end of the year was $2.1 billion. Total liquidity at the end of the quarter was $4.2 billion, which included total cash and short-term investments on hand of $1.7 billion plus the availability under our credit facilities. Fourth quarter and full year 2020 EBITDA was approximately $600 million and $2 billion, respectively. And at December 31, 2020, our net leverage ratio was 1.1 times. Lastly, the Company announced a 2-for-1 stock split, which will be effective as of March 4, 2021. I will now turn it back to Adam, who will provide some commentary and current trends.\nAdam Norwitt: Well, Craig, thank you very much. And I'd like to extend my welcome to everyone here on the phone today and I hope it's not too late to wish everybody a Happy New Year, as we're still here in the month of January. First, I just want to express my hope that all of you on the call here today that you, your family, your friends and colleagues are all staying safe and healthy throughout the pandemic. I'm going to highlight our achievements in the fourth quarter and the full year. As Craig mentioned, I'll discuss our trends and progress across our served markets. I'll then make some comments on our outlook for the first quarter and then, of course, we'll have time at the end for questions. Now, with respect to the fourth quarter and amidst what has, no doubt, been an unprecedented and volatile year, I'm truly proud that we finished 2020 with record sales and adjusted earnings per share in the fourth quarter, both of which were significantly above our guidance. Sales grew 13% in U.S. dollars and 11% organically, reaching a new record $2.426 billion. This organic growth, which was very strong, was driven by growth in mobile devices, industrial and automotive end markets in particular. The Company booked a record of $2.512 billion in orders in the fourth quarter and that's a strong book-to-bill of 1.04 to 1. Despite continuing to face some operational challenges related to the ongoing pandemic, adjusted operating margins were strong in the quarter, reaching 20.6%, a 10 basis point increase from third quarter levels and 60 basis points from prior year. Craig already highlighted the operating and free cash flow of the Company, very strong at $441 million and $371 million, respectively, in the fourth quarter. Both just excellent reflections of the quality of the Company's earnings. I just want to say, with this fourth quarter how proud I am of our team around the world. And our results this quarter once again reflect the discipline and agility of our entrepreneurial organization, as we continue to perform well amidst the environment that still has continued challenges. Our small acquisition team was also very busy in the fourth quarter and here in the last few weeks of January. As we announced on December 9, we're very pleased to have signed an agreement to acquire MTS Systems, a leading supplier of advanced test systems, motion simulators and precision sensors, for $58.50 a share. The MTS acquisition continues to be subject to MTS shareholder approval, certain regulatory approvals, as well as customary closing conditions. In addition, last week we announced that we had entered into an agreement with Illinois Tool Works, under which ITW will acquire MTS' Test & Simulation segment following the closing of our acquisition of MTS. The sale is also subject to certain regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. We continue to expect that both the acquisition of MTS, as well as the follow-on sale of the Test & Simulation business to ITW, will both occur approximately in the middle of 2021. I can just say that we've long been attracted by the outstanding technology and deep entrepreneurial culture of MTS Sensors and look forward to welcoming this wonderful team of people into the Amphenol family. This acquisition, which is highly complementary to our current sensor offering, represents a further broadening of our high technology sensor offering to customers across the automotive, industrial, military and commercial air industries. We expect the addition of MTS Sensors to add approximately $350 million in revenues and to generate approximately $0.10 per share of earnings accretion in the first year post closing. Now here in the last few weeks of January, we're also pleased to have closed two additional acquisitions of outstanding entrepreneurial companies, which we purchased for a combined price of $160 million. First, Positronic is a provider of high reliability harsh environment connectors for customers primarily in the military aerospace, IT datacom and industrial markets. Based in Springfield, Missouri and with also operations in France, India and Singapore, and with annual sales of approximately $80 million, Positronic represents a great addition to our harsh environment product offering. Next El-Cab, which is based in Poland, is a manufacturer of cable assemblies and related interconnect products, primarily serving the industrial market and with annual sales of approximately $55 million. What I'm very pleased by is that both Positronic and El-Cab are private, family-owned companies with rich histories, leading technologies and excellent positions with customers in their target markets. As we welcome the outstanding Positronic and El-Cab teams to the Amphenol family and as we look forward to eventually welcoming the talented MTS Sensors organization in the coming months, we remain confident that our acquisition program will continue to create great value for Amphenol. Our ability to identify and execute upon acquisitions and successfully bring these new companies into Amphenol remains a core competitive advantage for the Company. Now, if we just look back on 2020 and some of the highlights from the year, despite the many challenges we all faced in 2020, from both a personal and a professional standpoint, Amphenol's dedicated entrepreneurial team performed just incredibly well. And I just could not be more proud of our performance this year. Sales reached a record $8.6 billion, growing 5% in U.S. dollars and 2% organically, and actually surpassed our pre-pandemic outlook that we had given back a year ago. Our full year adjusted operating margins of 19.2%, did decline 80 basis points from prior year, but this decline was due to the significant cost challenges we experienced in the first half of 2020, after which our team was able to return to more typical profit levels in the second half. And that enabled us to achieve adjusted diluted EPS of $3.74, which was the same level as we achieved in 2019. No question, an impressive result given the circumstances. We generated record operating and free cash flow of $1.592 billion and $1.328 billion, respectively. Excellent confirmations of the Company's superior execution and disciplined working capital management, even in these most unprecedented of times. Our acquisition program remains strong, despite the challenges related to the pandemic, with two new companies added to the Amphenol family in 2020, EXA Thermometrics and Onanon, as well as Positronic and El-Cab here in January and the signing of MTS that we already discussed. These acquisitions expand our position across a broad array of technologies and markets, while bringing outstanding and talented individuals into the Amphenol organization. We're particularly excited that these acquisitions represent expanded platforms for the Company's future performance. In addition, in 2020, we bought back over 6 million shares under our buyback program and increased our quarterly dividend to 16%. And as Craig mentioned, we're announcing today, a 2-for-1 stock split of the Company's shares. So, while the overall market environment in 2020 was highly uncertain, our agile entrepreneurial management team is confident that we have built further strength from which we can now drive superior long-term performance. Now, turning to our -- the trends and our progress across our served markets, I would just comment that we remain very pleased that the Company's balanced and broad end-market diversification continues to create value for the Company, with no single end-market representing more than 22% of our sales in the year 2020. We believe that this diversification mitigates the impact of the volatility of individual end markets. That was particularly important here in 2020, but while also exposing us to leading technologies wherever they may arise across the electronics industry. The military market represented a 11% of our sales in the fourth quarter and 12% of our sales for the full year. Sales in the quarter grew modestly from prior year, increasing by approximately 1% in the fourth quarter, with growth in naval, space and avionics applications offset in part by moderations in ground vehicles, rotorcraft and airframe. Sequentially, our sales increased as we had expected coming into the quarter by 3%. For the full year 2020, our sales grew by 3% in U.S. dollars and 2% organically, reflecting our leading market position and strong execution across virtually all segments of the military market, offset in part by the impact of the pandemic-related production disruptions that we experienced in the first half of 2020. Looking ahead, we expect sales in the first quarter to decrease modestly from these fourth quarter levels. I just want to say that our organization working in the military market has worked long and hard for many years to strengthen our broad technology position, while increasing our capacity to serve customers across all segments of this important market. Our performance in 2020, especially given the many disruptions related to the pandemic, is a great reflection of the results of those efforts. Given the ongoing and favorable military spending environment, our team continues to solidify our leadership position by ensuring that we execute on the demands of our customers by supporting the many next generation technologies that are required for modern military hardware. The commercial air market represented 2% of our sales in the fourth quarter and 3% of our sales for the full year. Not surprisingly, fourth quarter sales were down significantly, reducing by approximately 50%, as the commercial air market continued to experience unprecedented declines in demand for new aircraft, due to the pandemic-related disruptions to the global travel industry. Sequentially, our sales were a little bit better than expected, declining 10% from the third quarter and for the full year 2020, sales declined by 34%, reflecting that significant impact of the pandemic on travel and aircraft production. Looking into the first quarter of 2021, we expect a sequential moderation in sales from these levels. Look, there is no doubt that these are difficult times for the entire travel industry, which is seriously impacting the market for commercial airplanes. Nevertheless, our team, who has just been so resilient over the course of this year, remains committed to leveraging the Company's strong technology position across a wide array of aircraft platforms, as well as next-generation systems that are integrated into those airplanes and we remain well positioned when this market ultimately returns to growth. The industrial market represented 22% of our sales in the quarter and in the full year of 2020. Our sales in this market significantly exceeded expectations that we had coming into the quarter, increased by a very strong 29% in U.S. dollars and 24% organically from prior year. This robust growth was driven, especially by the battery and electric vehicle, instrumentation, heavy equipment, factory automation and medical segments of the industrial market. On a sequential basis, sales increased by 4% from the third quarter. We're really pleased with our results in industrial for the full year, with sales growing 15% in U.S. dollars and 11% organically, as we saw strong demand in really those same markets, battery and EV, instrumentation, heavy equipment, also alternative energy and of course, medical, which was a very strong segment in the year. Looking into the first quarter, we expect a slight moderation from the strong fourth quarter sales levels. I'm truly proud of our team working in the industrial market, whether enabling the growth in volumes of a wide array of medical equipment or managing through significant increases in demand for semiconductor capital goods and next-generation batteries, our global organization has reacted quickly to ensure that our customers are fully supported regardless of the many operational challenges that have arisen during the pandemic. The automotive market represented 20% of our sales in the fourth quarter and 17% of our sales for the full year 2020. Sales in this market were also much stronger than we had expected coming into the quarter, with revenue growing by 24% in U.S. dollars and 19% organically in the fourth quarter, and that was really driven by broad-based growth across all geographies in the automotive market. Sequentially, our automotive sales increased by a very strong 22% as we continue to benefit from the broad recovery in the global automotive market. For the full year 2020, our sales declined by 6% in U.S. dollars and 8% organically. And that really reflected the significant challenges in factory shutdowns experienced by the auto industry in the first half of the year related to the pandemic, but was partially offset by our strong recovery that we drove in the second half. Looking into 2021, we do expect a sequential moderation from these high sales levels in the first quarter. Look, no doubt about it, the automotive industry faced one of the most difficult periods in recent memory, during the first half of 2020, in particular in the second quarter, and that was followed by an unexpectedly robust recovery here in the second half. I'm just so proud of our team working in this important market, who has clearly demonstrated their agility and resiliency through these most turbulent times and thereby, secured the Company's position with our customers across the automotive market. Regardless of this most dynamic of years, we have continued to expand our range of interconnect, sensor and antenna products, both organically and through acquisitions, to enable a wide array of onboard electronics across a diversified range of traditional fuel and electric-powered vehicles made by auto manufacturers around the world. This consistent strategy will continue to benefit us long into the future. The mobile devices market represented 18% of our sales in the fourth quarter and 15% of our sales for the full year. Our sales in the quarter to mobile device customers increased by a much stronger-than-expected 32% from prior year, with strength in all product types, but particularly in wearables and laptops. Sequentially, our sales increased by 15% and that was driven by higher sales to smartphones and wearable devices. For the full year 2020, sales in the mobile devices market increased by a very strong 16%, as we continued to benefit from our agility in reacting to changes in demand in this dynamic market. For the full year, we saw particularly strong sales growth in products incorporated into laptops, tablets, wearables and other accessories as well as production-related products, and that was offset in part by a slight moderation of sales of products incorporated into smartphones. Looking into the first quarter, we anticipate a typically significant seasonal sequential decline of approximately 40%. While mobile devices will always remain one of our most volatile of markets, our outstanding and agile team is poised as always, to capture any opportunities for incremental sales that may arise in 2021 and beyond. Our leading array of antennas, interconnect products and mechanisms continues to enable a broad range of next-generation mobile devices, all positioning us well for the long term. The mobile networks market represented 5% of our sales in the quarter and 6% of our sales for the full year of 2020. Sales in the quarter decreased from prior year by 8% in U.S. dollars and 9% organically, with declines in sales to both equipment manufacturers as well as operators. Sequentially, our sales did increase by a bit less than we had expected, 12%. For the full year 2020, sales declined by 16% from prior year, which reflected the impact of the U.S. government restrictions on certain Chinese customers that had been imposed in 2019, as well as other impacts related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Looking ahead, we expect sales in the first quarter to increase from this quarter's levels, as operators expand their investments in next-generation mobile networks. Regardless of the challenging demand environment in the mobile networks market in 2020, we're confident in the Company's long-term position in this important and exciting industry. Our team continues to work aggressively to expand our opportunity with next-generation equipment and networks. And as customers ramp up investment of these advanced systems, we look forward to benefiting from the increased potential that comes from our unique position with both equipment manufacturers and mobile service providers around the world. The information technology and data communications market represented 18% of our sales in the quarter and 21% of our sales for the full year of 2020. Sales in the quarter was stronger than expected, rising by 3% in U.S. dollars and 2% organically from prior year, as stronger sales of networking equipment and server-related products were offset by lower sales of storage-related products. Sequentially, our sales declined by 8% from our very robust third quarter. We're very pleased with our performance for the full year for IT datacom, with our sales growing a very strong 15% in U.S. dollars and 11% organically, as we capitalized on increased demand from our OEM and service provider customers, as they work to accelerate bandwidth capacity expansions, in particular to support home-based work, school and entertainment. Our team working in support of these customers has clearly distinguished themselves this year, reacting quickly to capitalize on unprecedented demand for our industry-leading high-speed and power products. At the same time, we've not slowed down our efforts to further develop that broad range of leading interconnect products in support of data communications networks around the world. Looking into the first quarter of 2021, we expect a typical seasonal moderation of sales here in the quarter. But nevertheless, we remain very encouraged by the Company's strong technology position in the global IT datacom market. Our customers around the world continue to drive their equipment to ever higher levels of performance, in order to manage the dramatic increases in bandwidth and processor power. In turn, our team remains singularly focused on enabling this continuing revolution in IT datacom. The broadband communications market represented 4% of our sales in the quarter and 4% for the full year. Sales increased by 3% in the fourth quarter from prior year, driven by stronger demand for home installation related equipment from our broadband operators. On a sequential basis, sales decreased as expected by 9% from the third quarter. For the full year of 2020, sales were flat and that's despite the significant disruptions to production and demand that we experienced in the first quarter, offset by the accelerated investments in support of bandwidth later in the year. Looking into the first quarter, we expect sales to moderate from these levels and we remain encouraged by the Company's position in the broadband market. With our expanded range of products, together with strong relationships with customers around the world, we look forward to benefiting as operators increase their network investments in the future. Now just to summarize, there is no question that 2020 was one of the most challenging years we've all experienced. But in the face of these challenges, I'm just so proud of the entire team of Amphenolians around the world, who have managed extraordinarily well throughout the pandemic and the related disruptions to the economy. Through our dual-pronged approach of growing both organically and through our acquisition program, the Company continues to expand our market position, while strengthening our financial performance. Amphenol's superior performance is a direct reflection of our distinct competitive advantages, our leading technology, our increasing position with customers across our diverse end markets, worldwide presence, a lean and flexible cost structure, a highly effective acquisition program and I can say, most importantly in this pandemic-impacted 2020, an agile and entrepreneurial management team. Now, turning to our outlook and regardless of our strong performance in the fourth quarter, there still remains significant economic uncertainties related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Accordingly, we will not be providing full year guidance at this time. Assuming no new material disruptions from the pandemic, as well as constant exchange rates, for the first quarter, we now expect sales in the range of $2.120 billion to $2.180 billion and adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $0.90 to $0.94. I would just note that on a post-split basis, this adjusted diluted EPS guidance would be $0.45 to $0.47. This guidance represents sales growth in the first quarter of 14% to 17% year-over-year and adjusted diluted EPS growth of 27% to 32%, again compared to the first quarter of 2020. I remain confident in the ability of our outstanding management team to adapt to the continued challenges in the marketplace and to capitalize on the many future opportunities to grow our position and expand our profitability. Our entire organization remains committed to delivering strong financial results, all while prioritizing the continued safety and health of each of our employees around the world. Most importantly, I'd like to take this opportunity to thank the entire Amphenol team for their truly heroic efforts here in the fourth quarter and throughout the entirety of 2020. And with that, operator, we'd be very happy to take any questions that there may be.\nOperator: Thank you. The question-and-answer session will now begin. Please be reminded that questioners are only allowed to ask one question. Our first question is from Mark Delaney of Goldman Sachs.\nMark Delaney: Thank you so much for taking my question. I was hoping to better understand the orders that the Company reported and the strong book-to-bill of 1.04, to what extent do you think those orders are to help sort of true end demand? And do you think any of the orders that the Company is receiving are potentially customers placing longer-dated backlog, because of some of the supply chain challenges that have really impacted semiconductors, but perhaps is impacting orders to electronics companies more broadly, potentially including Amphenol or any other factors that may be influencing the orders other than some of the more typical drivers like increasing content per unit? Thanks.\nAdam Norwitt: Thanks so much, Mark. Look, customers place orders to us and we can't always exactly pinpoint what the demand is, except we know that when they tell us they want the product. And I wouldn't tell you that we've seen any dramatic lengthening of lead times or longer-dated orders per se. You mentioned the widely reported discussions around semiconductor availability in a variety of markets. I think our customers are pretty smart. And while they may be chasing lots of semiconductors or trying to put orders on those kind of products, they know that our products are available for them. And we haven't disappointed them throughout this year, even with the disruptions early in the year, even with the significant increases in certain of our markets in the second half. So I wouldn't necessarily say that customers are lumping us into that kind of semiconductor category. I think that customers are looking to us, no question about it, on the basis of the fact that we were there for them when they needed us most. In particular, as many of our customers coming out of the pandemic, had certain -- some parts of their supply chain, which still had a lot of disruptions. And the excellent job that our team did in recovering from those disruptions, whether that was early on in the year, with bringing all of our factories in China back to full production, substantially earlier than many or continuing in through later part of the year with the recoveries that we saw, for example, in automotive and industrial and other markets. So, I think that our team is doing a good job of making sure that we get more than our fair share of our customers' bandwidth and orders, and we're going to keep driving for that.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Amit Daryanani of Evercore.\nAmit Daryanani: Thanks for taking my question. Wanted to follow up on what Mark was talking about and maybe more specifically item on the industrial and automotive kind of the non-tech markets, where growth rates have been extremely strong. I think the concern is starting to become that, are we starting to over-ship versus end-demand and suddenly 20%, 24% organic growth is much better than what the underlying end-demand is. Just on those two segments, I'd love to understand how does one get conviction, how do you get conviction that a strong first half may not result in a bigger correction to half of the year?\nAdam Norwitt: Yes. I mean, look, it's a fair question, Amit. I think we had just outstanding performance in the fourth quarter in both of those markets, as you know, 29% and 24% organic growth in industrial, 24% and 19%, respectively, in automotive. I think that we are outperforming by any measure, I would say the various markets. But does that mean that they are taking our product and putting it on the shelf? No. I mean, we don't see that whatsoever. But, at the same time, there is still uncertainty in the marketplace. We're not giving guidance for the full year. We have done an outstanding job of supporting our customers when they needed us in the ramp up after the various disruptions. And regardless of what happens in end demand, I believe that our position with customers is stronger than ever. Now, I should also mention that, whether it's in industrial or in automotive and obviously, industrial has a lot of different segments within it, we see continued content gains in both of those areas, which are greater than just the end unit demand. And that's the trend of adoption of electronics into all types of systems, all types of equipment, all types of products. And if anything, we've seen that adoption accelerate over the course of this year for a variety of reasons and much has been reported about the acceleration, for example, of electric drivetrains in cars, where we benefited greatly for that. But we've seen a lot of very similar dynamics across the multiple segments within the industrial market. So, look what does this mean for the second half of 2021, again, we're not giving guidance for the year. There is a lot of uncertainty related to the pandemic, but I think our position with our customers is stronger than ever before.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Joe Giordano from Cowen.\nJoe Giordano: Good afternoon. So, there's a lot of debate in auto like longer term about like what applications should be -- that need to be hard wired versus when wireless is most appropriate. I mean, I know your portfolios seems to be intentionally structured to benefit kind of no matter what the answer to that question is, or that trend is. But can you talk about how you think that plays out? What are your customers thinking like, is there like a limitation on what can be wireless?\nAdam Norwitt: Yes. I mean, without getting into too deep of a technical discussion here, I think you already kind of answered the question as I would answer, which is, we are agnostic. The fact is, we are a significant supplier of interconnect products, antennas and sensors into the automotive market. And to the extent that there is next-generation developments, new architectures in the car that create a kind of an open field to help enable that, that's always been a benefit for Amphenol in the long term. And so I would expect the same that to the extent that things become, how you say, more -- less wired or more wired, more wireless. The fact that we are a manufacturer of interconnect antennas and sensors positions us very well regardless of what that outcome is.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Craig Hettenbach from Morgan Stanley.\nCraig Hettenbach: Yes, thank you. Adam, can you just touch on or follow up on the MTS acquisition. I mean, pretty unique in terms of size of a business that you're acquiring here? And also maybe expand on just -- you talked about some of the complementary nature, kind of what it does your portfolio as you go out in time?\nAdam Norwitt: Thanks very much, Craig. I mean, look, I think the only thing that I would say is really unique about MTS is the fact that it's a public company. It's our first public company acquisition. But, in terms of scale of the acquisition, you'll recall that we made the acquisition of FCI, I think it's been, what Craig, six years or so since that acquisition and at the time when we were a substantially smaller company. FCI was about a $1.2 billion purchase price, and this is $1.7 billion less the proceeds from the Test & Sim business. So, I wouldn't say that the size is unique. But the process is a little bit more unique with the public company process. And then with the strategic review that we did, that ultimately resulted in an outstanding outcome of us negotiating together with Illinois Tool Works, or ITW, the disposition of the Test & Simulation segment to ITW. And ITW is just an outstanding company. MTS is an outstanding company. And you know how we feel about Amphenol. So, I think this is a three really outstanding companies ending up in a real win-win-win for all parties, whether that's the shareholders of MTS, whether that's Amphenol or whether that is, in fact, ITW. From our position, the MTS Sensors business, which is what ultimately attracted us to MTS, it is just extraordinarily complementary. I mean, I'd say virtually no overlap with our own sensor offering, extremely harsh environment products used in a variety of really high technology applications. These are sensors that are used in force and vibration, pressure, position, really at the highest level of reliability with also complex interconnect systems associated there with. And so, from a -- when we talk about the complementary aspect of the MTS Sensors business, it is really just that unique -- uniquely complementary set of products across the end-markets where we very excited by. And then you add to all of that, just a wonderful, wonderful management team across the business. By the way all of MTS, we've just been so impressed with the people at MTS. But particularly with the MTS Sensors team, we're just so excited by this entrepreneurial organization and it's a team that we've known for a long time. This was not a kind of last minute thing here, far from it. We've known this organization for a very long time and we're very excited, subject to the shareholder approvals, subject to the regulatory and other closing conditions, we're very excited one day to welcome them into the Amphenol family.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Samik Chatterjee from JPMorgan.\nSamik Chatterjee: Hi, thanks for taking my question. Adam, I wanted to use the last question here on MTS as an excuse to ask you about Cable Products. I mean you -- I think you didn't want to be in the Test business and that led to the decision of selling that MTS asset to ITW. I mean, on the same lines, how should I think about the longer-term reasons to be in Cable Products and Solutions, which you report as a separate segment. I can see kind of the margins are quite a bit below your other segments and we haven't seen like strong growth for a while here. So, what's the longer term opportunity you -- how does it fit in with the rest of the business or do you see it as a core part of your portfolio overall?\nAdam Norwitt: Yes, I mean, the simple answer to -- you said it at the end, do we see it as a core part of our portfolio? For sure. And it's very different than the situation with MTS. In the case of MTS, we were drawn to MTS because of the sensor business. We were impressed, by the way, very impressed with the team and with the business of Test & Simulation, but it's a different business for us, really categorically different and that was why we talked about having a strategic review. And in the end, I think a great outcome for all parties with the agreed sale to ITW. In the case of our Cable Products, Cable Products are an integral part of an interconnect system that is used in particular for getting high-speed bandwidth to customers and to companies. And what we've said all along is, yes, the Cable Products segment may underperform from an operating margin perspective for the moment, we don't want to be in the business of picking the winners and losers of how people and companies are going to get Internet connectivity to their homes, to their businesses, to the universities, to the governments. We want to be betting really on every possible way of doing that. And thus, our position with the cable operators, with the MSOs, is a very important strategic position for Amphenol. And that importance, by the way, carries over into our interconnect segment, where the strength that we have, the reputation that we have, our ability to service these service providers as opposed to OEMs, has been a fabulous value to the rest of the Company, in particular, as we've seen other markets move more towards the service provider market. And let me just give you an example of that. You take the IT datacom market, which traditionally we were selling products that go just directly to equipment manufacturers. Well, as I think everybody on the call knows, over the recent five or more years, maybe even a little bit more than half a decade, we've seen increasing strength and increasing demand from web service providers. How you work with a service provider is very, very different than how you work with an OEM, who ultimately is making a piece of equipment in a factory. And our experience in the Cable Products has been invaluable to our team in making sure that we can react to the demand and the volatility of the demand that is really endemic in any service provider business. When I look at our results this year, in particular in IT datacom, where we did see extremely strong demand from service providers, our ability to react on a moment's notice, the mindset of that is a mindset that we developed, that we incubated originally in our Cable business. And I think that that's just a great reflection of the broad value that we see in that business, beyond just the fact that it does have today a little bit lower margins, to much smaller piece of our business that it once was, but it's still an important part of Amphenol's strategy.\nOperator: Thank you. Up next for question is Nick Todorov from Longbow Research.\nNick Todorov: Yes, thanks. Hi, Adam. Hi team. I want to touch upon the outlook on the mobile devices. Adam, I think you mentioned seasonal about down 40%. Can you maybe give us a little bit more color, because as we are looking at the data points, smartphone sales are strong, PC sales remain strong, as well as all the consumer electronics. So, maybe you can talk, what are you seeing that the first quarter is going to be more seasonal than anything else? Thank you.\nAdam Norwitt: Yes. Well, thanks very much, Nick. I think this is not an abnormal guidance that we see. Look, we had very, very strong performance in mobile devices this year. We came into the year with an expectation of the market being flat. I will tell you, I mean, we didn't give guidance at the time, but had you asked me at the end of Q1, what would mobile devices be for the year? I probably would have thought it would be even down given the disruptions that we saw in the first quarter to our China facilities. And the vast majority, if not all, of our mobile device production is really in China and all of those factories were shut down, as you know, for the better part of three weeks, due to the early stage of the coronavirus. And then our team just did an unbelievable job of reacting to the strength in the market. And the strength this year, well, there was, on a sequential basis in the fourth quarter, strength in smartphones, where we really saw a lot of strength this year, was maybe not surprisingly in devices that are needed by people when they are working, when they're learning, when they're being entertained at home. So, things like laptops; things like tablets; we saw a lot of strength in wearables, I know, a lot of people got on health kicks and maybe these wearables can be very useful there; a lot of strength in things that go in your ears, hearable devices as we call them, and probably because you have a lot of people doing work and school from home and they might have other people in the same house and they want to have some privacy. Whatever the reason is, there was just a great amount of strength and our team was able to react to quite unexpected demand. And so, as you go into the first quarter, I think that we would expect normally some relaxation of that demand. I mean, look, anecdotally, I tried to buy Christmas presents for my wife and my daughter of a computer, because they both have really old computers and I totally failed as a father and a husband and they each got their present, one got it about a month late, and the other one still hasn't gotten hers. So, there was a real demand back in the fourth quarter, in particular for these devices. And I think we wouldn't expect such a continuation here in the first quarter.\nOperator: Thank you. Up next for questions would be Luke Junk from Baird.\nLuke Junk: Good afternoon, everyone. My question, I was wondering about the Company's ability to, I guess, you could say, cross-pollinate between the industrial as it relates to batteries and electric vehicles and your core auto business. I guess, I'm wondering, does that sort of the two-pronged approach open additional doors for Amphenol?\nAdam Norwitt: Yes, actually Luke, it's a great question. The simple answer is, yes. Our team work in industrial, our team work in automotive and there's a lot of crossover, by the way, in those teams. There is an enormous amount of interaction from a technology, from a customer perspective, to ensure that we're maximizing our position with customers, whether they are making an electric bus or an electric sports car. And so, that interaction, as you call it cross-pollination, we call it inside Amphenol collaboration, is something that we're doing all the time. And that's collaboration from a product development, making sure that we're bringing a full suite of products to customers, in each of those markets and really capitalizing on that trend of electrification that we're seeing, again not just in automotive, but we're seeing that trend very significantly in the industrial market as well. And I'd say that when you look at our performance in both of those end markets, which we talked about with one of the earlier questions, it's not totally coincident that we're seeing those strong content growth in both of those markets, some of which is being driven by this trend of electrification.\nOperator: Thank you. Next for our question is Wamsi Mohan from Bank of America.\nWamsi Mohan: Hi. Yes, thank you. Adam, if we step back a couple of years over here, the Company was operating north of 20% operating margins. You're slightly below that, embedded in your guidance over here, on slightly higher revenues versus 1Q '19. Clearly, these are unprecedented times. There's been a lot of cost inefficiencies that have crept in because of COVID. Can you maybe characterize if that is the reason why the margins are where they are? I mean, clearly, very strong in the face of what has actually transpired, but still below a couple of years ago. And I'm wondering if, a, you could help us think through what the reasons are, if it is truly COVID inefficiencies and if it is, how large are these and how long do you expect them to persist, after which we should start to see sort of back to historical levels of margin?\nAdam Norwitt: Wamsi, thanks for the question. Yes, I think if you look back the first quarter of 2019, we were certainly operating at very strong profitability at that point. Honestly and we finished the fourth quarter at very strong profitability levels. So I guess I wouldn't necessarily just kind of look back into '19 to kind of just to see a time where we are operating at strong profitability levels. If you look at the fourth quarter, we already reached 20.6% here in the quarter. We certainly still see some disruption related to the pandemic and that's certainly embedded in those numbers, maybe slightly offset by some other benefits we have and things like T&E. So I think I said last quarter that we kind of see a relatively neutral impact in the second half of the year. As we kind of go into the first quarter, our guidance really reflects, I would say, a sequential seasonal decline and we talked about approximately 10% kind of seasonal decline in sale. And that does, as you mentioned, kind of imply a conversion rate may be slightly higher than our normal 30% downside, which would maybe get to the profitability level in the 19% -- kind of a little above 19% range. So I think that's probably the basis of your question. I mean, I wouldn't say this conversion is isn't -- certainly isn't so significant, given the level of sequential decline we are seeing kind of going into the first quarter. In addition, combined with a continued challenging kind of cost environment, we are seeing still COVID-related inefficiencies. And I think that the Company has really done a great job thus far, as you saw in 2020, of dealing with those inefficiencies and really snapping back in a profitability level, but we are seeing a little bit of a decline going into the first quarter from a sales perspective, which is going to have some impact. And I think the team has done a great job dealing with that and we'll continue to deal with that. And so, I'm real proud of kind of where we ended up in 2020 and -- and I have no doubt that we'll get back to those levels. The other thing that's happening in the first quarter, certainly, is the acquisitions we just closed on here in January, are having some small effect on the conversion, if you look sequentially into the first quarter. And the ones we did in 2019 certainly wouldn't -- haven't made necessarily the progress that maybe we would have expected in 2020 for very understandable reasons, I think, we're dealing with the pandemic during 2020. So I think there's a few reasons. But, all in all, we're real happy with where we are at profitability, certainly in the second half year of 2020, and be quite honest, even in the first half given the challenges we had. And certainly, we are really confident that as we go into 2021, you'll see those levels snap back to normal levels once COVID is behind us.\nOperator: Thank you. Up next for questions would be David Williams from Loop Capital.\nDavid Williams: Hey, good afternoon, and thanks for letting me ask a question. But just wanted to touch a little bit on the automotive market may be and what your outlook is there? I know you're not providing full year guidance but if you're kind of thinking about the automotive market in terms of the total growth this year and then maybe the mix of EV versus the traditional vehicles, what are your thoughts around that perhaps?\nAdam Norwitt: Yes. I mean, you said it David, we're not giving an outlook for the year. And I couldn't actually quote for you exactly how much of our business is related to EV versus traditional. I don't have the numbers close at hand. But what I can tell you is that, we are seeing higher growth from EV applications over the last several years and so EVs definitely represent a higher proportion today than they did a year ago, two years ago and three years ago, and we would expect in the coming year or two for that trend to continue. EVs not only do they tend to have potentially a little more content, but the nature of the content can be more attractive and more interesting for a company because of the high reliability, the harsh environment, the high power aspects of those vehicles. So, look, we'll see how the year progresses. We're not giving again guidance, but we have seen good strength in EV, and we would expect to see that going forward.\nOperator: Thank you. Up next for question would be Chris Snyder from UBS.\nChris Snyder: Thank you. I have a follow-up on auto. Can you talk a bit about the EV verse ICE competitive environment? Are you seeing new entrants, just given the different product mix and high voltage focus? And conversely, does the shift carry any implications from maybe some of the smaller competitors, who could struggle to invest in EV solutions, at least in the early days? And I just asked, because of the Company's outperformance on the auto side has been very strong in the last couple of quarters. I just wanted to see if there are any share shifts going on?\nAdam Norwitt: Yes. I mean, look, I don't know specific share shifts. What I do know is we're outperforming the market. And so just I guess, by definition, we're taking some share. And part of the reason for that is EVs and part of the reason is other applications. Are there different competitors in an EV versus an internal combustion engine? There may be. I mean, there's different competitors for all different systems in the car. You have to remember in our industry, there is not a monolithic competitive landscape. There are obviously some companies that are publicly traded and well-known, which are excellent companies, but there is a whole diaspora of competition in the interconnect industry. And each application may have a different landscape of competitors than the application before it. So I guess, by definition, yes, you're going to have some different competitors. I think our strength in EV in part stretches back to the fact that we've been making high-power, high-voltage connectors for really the entire history of Amphenol. That is a legacy, you would call it even a birthright of Amphenol with our military, our industrial business and our ability to collaboratively share some of those underlying core technologies across our team, a little bit like we discussed just a few moments ago, has really positioned the Company well to be an enabler of those next-generation systems, which are really mission critical. So I think we're very happy to have a whole diaspora of competition across all our markets and that includes within automotive.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Steven Fox from Fox Advisors.\nSteven Fox: Thanks, good afternoon. Adam, I was wondering if you could just dig into the weeds on the two acquisitions you just closed in January. You've mentioned one was around harsh environments and we know you're already a leader in that area, and then the other one was tied to cable assemblies and we know you have a pretty broad offering there. So, can you just sort of get into what attracted you to the businesses from a product standpoint? Thank you.\nAdam Norwitt: Sure. Thanks so much, Steve. Look, these are both outstanding companies. We've known them both for a long time. I mean the family who founded and still until we just closed recently, Positronic, I've known that family for, I don't know, a decade and a half. I mean it's an outstanding company, Positronics. Just a real marquee brand in the interconnect industry, known for harsh environment, in particular, board level power connectors and some data connectors. These are IO connectors, these go on the board. They are used in a wide variety of systems in the military, as well as in datacom for power and industrial applications, and it's very complementary actually. A lot of the products that they have, Positronics, they have just a real proprietary position across their customer base, and sometimes, you look in admiration at the strength of a company's position, because of the uniqueness of their technology and that's something that we have done for many years with Positronics. El-Cab is a little bit of a different story. El-Cab, first of all, is our first company that's really fully based in Poland. Poland is an outstanding location for low-cost manufacturing with proximity to all of Europe and they have an excellent position in cable assemblies for industrial applications, and in particular, next-generation electric-powered industrial vehicles and whether that's buses, whether that's trucks, delivery vehicles, they're also involved in marine-related cable assemblies. But what really attracted us to them is their just leading position in this sort of EV revolution, industrial EV revolution, and that's something we've done a great job of in Asia, we've done a great job of it in North America and we've done a really -- a good job in Europe. But this accelerates our position in those -- in that electrification of industrial vehicles in Europe. And again, a fabulous team, family-owned company, great management, great products, great position, those are the factors that we always look for in acquisitions. And I think both Positronics and El-Cab deliver wholeheartedly in all those areas.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Joseph Spak from RBC Capital Markets.\nJoseph Spak: Thank you very much. Adam, you mentioned battery factories a couple of times and they are likely into be trillions of dollars of CapEx spent to build terawatts of capacity, not only for electric vehicles, but storage and other uses. So it's probably one of the faster growing market opportunities out there. Is there anything you could tell us about Amphenol's opportunity and positioning in the market? And are there some regional differences? Because I think a lot of the capacity right now is in Asia, but there probably needs to be factories built all over the globe?\nAdam Norwitt: Yes. I think, maybe, it might have contemplated a little bit, Joe. I think what I talked about was battery and EV and factory automation, but not necessarily together. But the fact is, you raised a very good point, which is for sure, whenever you have a massive build out of factories, be that for batteries where there is a lot of automation, next-generation vehicles, whatever and we've seen a lot of build-out of factories, by the way, semiconductor factories as well, you've seen the strength that we've had in instrumentation. Our position in factory automation and instrumentation, test equipment and otherwise, interconnect for all of those, puts us in a very strong position to benefit from the expansion of these facilities. But when we talk about our sales of industrial products into battery applications, it's really actual interconnect sensors that get integrated into these high-technology high-voltage battery systems, both to allow the signal of the battery, the power to come in and out of the battery, and also the control systems for these batteries, which is a wonderful opportunity where there is a lot of kind of interconnect and sensor applications where you're selling to customers just a complete solution to allow them to manage these batteries and thereby get more efficiency and safety out of them, once they're integrated into vehicles.\nOperator: Thank you. Up next for questions would be William Stein from Truist Securities.\nWilliam Stein: Great. Thanks for taking my question. There's always been quite a focus on the trend to EV. But when we think about U.S. federal energy policy, it looks like there is perhaps a shift in the works to favor more renewables versus carbon-based. And I wonder, Adam, if you can sensitize us to the potential impact of your business. Are renewables a good market for Amphenol relative to downhole, which I understand is very harsh and typically high margin, high ASP sorts of connectors? Thank you.\nAdam Norwitt: Yes. I mean look, we're agnostic Will, to whatever that may be, if it's traditional oil and gas versus renewables versus all that's related to renewables, the battery storage that Joe just asked about and otherwise, we're really agnostic. I mean, if you look as an example, last quarter, we had last quarter a strong growth in alternative energy. And that was offset by relatively strong decline in oil and gas. And I think that's a good indication of the value and the strength of the diversified position that we have really across all areas of whether that be power generation, power consumption, power storage, we've made sure to not place a bet on kind of one trend or another, but rather to be present supporting customers across the board and we are still supporting our oil and gas customers for sure. I mean, that's an important market and I don't think the world is totally detaching from fossil fuels. But if the trend is away from them, we're well positioned either way.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Jim Suva from Citigroup.\nJim Suva: Thank you very much. Adam and Craig, you've seen a lot of success with your Company in automotive. It used to be about 5% of the Company, now it's 20% of the Company. Is most of that success coming from like the infotainment in the cabin, the safety along the bumper or the batteries in it or the electronic motors? I'm just trying to see, because there are some big trends that are going on. I'm trying to see, where has been the most part of your strength in automotive?\nAdam Norwitt: Jim, thank you very much. I think you listed a lot of them. I mean the fact is, if I look over the long term and you've followed us for a very long time and so you have a great sense of the arc of the progress of our automotive business over these many years. We started out in automotive many, many years ago as the innovator of airbag connectors and that was kind of our first thing we did and we're talking a long time ago. I think the first airbag was like in 1990 or something like that. So, we're talking a 30-year time period. And over time, we developed into interconnect products for satellite radio and GPS and other infotainment. We built through acquisitions and other -- and organic means presence in emissions control and engine control, other electronics and essentially as the car adopted new electronic systems, we were positioning ourselves either organically or through acquisition, to participate in those next-generation systems. Our growth in automotive was never a question of, kind of, taking someone else's business, that was a legacy business. Rather, it was positioning ourselves, as these new systems were developed, to be there for customers for Tier 1s, for Tier 2s, whomever. And I think that's been very successful over all these years. We believe there is still a lot more potential left in our automotive business. The growth in content in the car is really outstanding and we're not the only one to talk about that. In many ways, to me, a car is becoming kind of a datacenter on wheels. It's becoming an electric powertrain on wheels. I mean, you name it. And each of those new systems, many of which you mentioned, are contributors to the growth of the Company. But I -- what I wouldn't say is, if any of them are disproportionate to our long-term success in that market. I think, it's been actually a relatively balanced contribution to that long-term success, that in particular we've seen over really the last decade.\nOperator: Thank you. And next question on queue would be from David Kelley from Jefferies.\nDavid Kelley: Good afternoon, Adam and Craig. Just wanted to ask about the industrial trajectory. You discussed and highlighted several secular opportunities. It feels like, from a broad cyclical standpoint, industrial equipment seems to be ramping back up. But we're also going to be coping against some difficult medical comps through the year. So, can you just talk about what you're seeing or what you do see as the biggest drivers for industrials in 2021?\nAdam Norwitt: Yes. I mean look, again, we're not giving guidance for 2021. But, when I look at the breadth of our performance here at the end of the year, as we closed out the year, and also throughout the course of the year, it's just there is no single story to the strength. I mean, yes, great performance in battery EV, great performance in instrumentation, great performance in medical. Again, I could give you a long list of the positive contributors to our industrial market. Will there be some areas where there will be a little bit of a tougher comparison? Obviously, the second quarter was a particularly acute quarter for medical, where our team, I mean I just cannot emphasize enough how proud we were to be a contributor to the fight against COVID through our reactivity to the demand for new medical equipment, whether that be respiratory therapy devices and the sensors interconnect products that are contained therein, whether that be hospital equipment to outfit ICUs and other patient care devices. I mean, that is something that we at Amphenol will forever be proud of, the contributions that our team made to the fight against COVID to protect lives and to enable countries around the world to have a fighting chance against this virus. And so, yes, will there be a little bit less maybe of some of those more acute care things? There could be, but who knows. There was also, as many have talked about, reductions in elective procedures, which actually reduced demand for certain medical equipment in some areas too, and so maybe that has the chance to come back. I think there is not the visibility today and thus, why we are not giving the guidance for the year. For me to say, which of those segments, as we go through the course of the year, are going to have the stronger or the weaker performance. But for sure, we have positioned ourselves with our customers by being there for them when they needed us most in their -- in really the most critical of time periods, such that, to the extent that they have business to give, I would expect that they will give at least, if not more than, our fair share to Amphenol.\nOperator: Thank you. As of this time, we don't have any further questions on queue. I'll turn the call back to Mr. Lampo for his closing remarks.\nAdam Norwitt: Well, this will be Mr. Norwitt for one last remark here. And listen, thank you all for all of your great interest in the Company. We really appreciate everybody's support through this 2020. We know this was not an easy year for all of you, working from home and cooked up and not being able to come visit us, for example. And we for sure, Craig and I, the two of us, no doubt about it, look forward to the day where we get to meet you in person again, host you here in our modest headquarters in Wallingford, Connecticut, where we are today. And we look forward to great success and wish you all good health as we continue into 2021. Thank you so much.\nCraig Lampo: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you for attending today's conference and have a nice day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Craig Lampo",
            "content": "Good afternoon, everyone. This is Craig Lampo, Amphenol's CFO, and I'm here together with Adam Norwitt, Our CEO. We would like to welcome you to our fourth quarter 2020 conference call. Our fourth quarter and full year 2020 results were released this morning. I will provide some financial commentary and then Adam will give an overview of the business as well as current trends. Then we will take questions. As a reminder, during the call, we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures and may make certain forward-looking statements, so please refer to the relevant disclosures in our press release for further information. The Company closed the fourth quarter with record sales of $2.426 billion, and record GAAP and adjusted diluted EPS of $1.15 and $1.13, respectively. Sales were up 13% in U.S. dollars and up 11% in local currencies and organically compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. Sequentially, sales were up 4% in U.S. dollars and 3% in local currencies and organically. Breaking down sales into our two segments. The interconnect business, which comprised 96% of our sales, was up 14% in U.S. dollars and 11% in local currencies compared to the fourth quarter of last year. Our cable business, which comprised 4% of our sales, was down 4% in U.S. dollars and 2% in local currencies compared to the fourth quarter of last year. For the full year 2020, sales were $8.599 billion, which was up 5% in U.S. dollars, 4% in local currencies and 2% organically compared to 2019. Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes. From a segment standpoint, in the interconnect segment, margins were 22.5% in the fourth quarter of 2020, which increased from 22.0% in the fourth quarter of 2019 and 22.4% in the third quarter of 2020. In the cable segment, margins were 10.3%, which increased from 10% in the fourth quarter of 2019 and decreased from 10.7% in the third quarter of 2020. For the full year 2020, adjusted operating income was $1.650 billion, which was slightly up from 2019 and resulted in a full year 2020 adjusted operating margin of 19.2% compared to 20% in 2019. This 80 basis point decline reflects the challenges and results -- resulting impacts related to the COVID-19 pandemic, primarily in the first half of the year. Given the unprecedented challenges we saw this year, we are extremely proud of the Company's performance. Our team's ability to effectively manage through this crisis is a direct result of the strength and commitment of the Company's entrepreneurial management team, which continues to foster a high-performance, action-oriented culture, which has enabled us to capitalize on opportunities and maximize profitability in an uncertain market environment. The Company's GAAP effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 21.7%, which compared to 20.3% in the fourth quarter of 2019. On an adjusted basis, the effective tax rate was 24.5% for both the fourth quarter of 2020 and 2019. For the full year, the Company's GAAP effective tax rate for 2020 and 2019 was 20.5% and 20.2%, respectively. On an adjusted basis, the effective tax rate for both the full year 2020 and 2019 was 20.5% -- 24.5%. On a GAAP basis, diluted EPS increased by 12% to $1.15 in the fourth quarter compared to $1.03 in the prior year period. Adjusted diluted EPS increased by 15% to $1.13 in the fourth quarter of 2020 from $0.98 in the fourth quarter of 2019. For the full year, GAAP diluted EPS was $3.91, a 4% increase from 2019 GAAP diluted EPS of $2.75. Adjusted diluted EPS was $3.74 for 2020, which was unchanged compared to 2019. This was a strong performance considering the significant challenges and related incremental costs related -- resulting from the pandemic. Orders for the quarter were $2.512 billion, which was up 14% compared to the fourth quarter of 2019 and up 10% sequentially, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.04 to 1. The Company continues to be an excellent generator of cash. We are proud that operating and free cash flow for both the fourth quarter and full year 2020 were all records for the Company. Cash flow from operations was a strong $441 million in the fourth quarter, or 124% of net income. Net of capital spending, our free cash flow was $371 million, or 104% of net income. Cash flow from operations for the full year was $1.592 billion, or approximately 132% of net income. And net of capital spending, our free cash flow for 2020 was $1.328 billion, or 110% of net income. From a working capital standpoint, inventory days, days sales outstanding and payable days, were 79, 72 and 61 days, respectively, all within a normal range. During the quarter, the Company repurchased 1.5 million shares of common stock for approximately $182 million under the $2 billion open market stock repurchase plan, bringing total repurchases for the year to 6 million shares or $641 million. Total debt at December 31 was $3.9 billion and net debt at the end of the year was $2.1 billion. Total liquidity at the end of the quarter was $4.2 billion, which included total cash and short-term investments on hand of $1.7 billion plus the availability under our credit facilities. Fourth quarter and full year 2020 EBITDA was approximately $600 million and $2 billion, respectively. And at December 31, 2020, our net leverage ratio was 1.1 times. Lastly, the Company announced a 2-for-1 stock split, which will be effective as of March 4, 2021. I will now turn it back to Adam, who will provide some commentary and current trends. Thank you."

            "content": "Well, Craig, thank you very much. And I'd like to extend my welcome to everyone here on the phone today and I hope it's not too late to wish everybody a Happy New Year, as we're still here in the month of January. First, I just want to express my hope that all of you on the call here today that you, your family, your friends and colleagues are all staying safe and healthy throughout the pandemic. I'm going to highlight our achievements in the fourth quarter and the full year. As Craig mentioned, I'll discuss our trends and progress across our served markets. I'll then make some comments on our outlook for the first quarter and then, of course, we'll have time at the end for questions. Now, with respect to the fourth quarter and amidst what has, no doubt, been an unprecedented and volatile year, I'm truly proud that we finished 2020 with record sales and adjusted earnings per share in the fourth quarter, both of which were significantly above our guidance. Sales grew 13% in U.S. dollars and 11% organically, reaching a new record $2.426 billion. This organic growth, which was very strong, was driven by growth in mobile devices, industrial and automotive end markets in particular. The Company booked a record of $2.512 billion in orders in the fourth quarter and that's a strong book-to-bill of 1.04 to 1. Despite continuing to face some operational challenges related to the ongoing pandemic, adjusted operating margins were strong in the quarter, reaching 20.6%, a 10 basis point increase from third quarter levels and 60 basis points from prior year. Craig already highlighted the operating and free cash flow of the Company, very strong at $441 million and $371 million, respectively, in the fourth quarter. Both just excellent reflections of the quality of the Company's earnings. I just want to say, with this fourth quarter how proud I am of our team around the world. And our results this quarter once again reflect the discipline and agility of our entrepreneurial organization, as we continue to perform well amidst the environment that still has continued challenges. Our small acquisition team was also very busy in the fourth quarter and here in the last few weeks of January. As we announced on December 9, we're very pleased to have signed an agreement to acquire MTS Systems, a leading supplier of advanced test systems, motion simulators and precision sensors, for $58.50 a share. The MTS acquisition continues to be subject to MTS shareholder approval, certain regulatory approvals, as well as customary closing conditions. In addition, last week we announced that we had entered into an agreement with Illinois Tool Works, under which ITW will acquire MTS' Test & Simulation segment following the closing of our acquisition of MTS. The sale is also subject to certain regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. We continue to expect that both the acquisition of MTS, as well as the follow-on sale of the Test & Simulation business to ITW, will both occur approximately in the middle of 2021. I can just say that we've long been attracted by the outstanding technology and deep entrepreneurial culture of MTS Sensors and look forward to welcoming this wonderful team of people into the Amphenol family. This acquisition, which is highly complementary to our current sensor offering, represents a further broadening of our high technology sensor offering to customers across the automotive, industrial, military and commercial air industries. We expect the addition of MTS Sensors to add approximately $350 million in revenues and to generate approximately $0.10 per share of earnings accretion in the first year post closing. Now here in the last few weeks of January, we're also pleased to have closed two additional acquisitions of outstanding entrepreneurial companies, which we purchased for a combined price of $160 million. First, Positronic is a provider of high reliability harsh environment connectors for customers primarily in the military aerospace, IT datacom and industrial markets. Based in Springfield, Missouri and with also operations in France, India and Singapore, and with annual sales of approximately $80 million, Positronic represents a great addition to our harsh environment product offering. Next El-Cab, which is based in Poland, is a manufacturer of cable assemblies and related interconnect products, primarily serving the industrial market and with annual sales of approximately $55 million. What I'm very pleased by is that both Positronic and El-Cab are private, family-owned companies with rich histories, leading technologies and excellent positions with customers in their target markets. As we welcome the outstanding Positronic and El-Cab teams to the Amphenol family and as we look forward to eventually welcoming the talented MTS Sensors organization in the coming months, we remain confident that our acquisition program will continue to create great value for Amphenol. Our ability to identify and execute upon acquisitions and successfully bring these new companies into Amphenol remains a core competitive advantage for the Company. Now, if we just look back on 2020 and some of the highlights from the year, despite the many challenges we all faced in 2020, from both a personal and a professional standpoint, Amphenol's dedicated entrepreneurial team performed just incredibly well. And I just could not be more proud of our performance this year. Sales reached a record $8.6 billion, growing 5% in U.S. dollars and 2% organically, and actually surpassed our pre-pandemic outlook that we had given back a year ago. Our full year adjusted operating margins of 19.2%, did decline 80 basis points from prior year, but this decline was due to the significant cost challenges we experienced in the first half of 2020, after which our team was able to return to more typical profit levels in the second half. And that enabled us to achieve adjusted diluted EPS of $3.74, which was the same level as we achieved in 2019. No question, an impressive result given the circumstances. We generated record operating and free cash flow of $1.592 billion and $1.328 billion, respectively. Excellent confirmations of the Company's superior execution and disciplined working capital management, even in these most unprecedented of times. Our acquisition program remains strong, despite the challenges related to the pandemic, with two new companies added to the Amphenol family in 2020, EXA Thermometrics and Onanon, as well as Positronic and El-Cab here in January and the signing of MTS that we already discussed. These acquisitions expand our position across a broad array of technologies and markets, while bringing outstanding and talented individuals into the Amphenol organization. We're particularly excited that these acquisitions represent expanded platforms for the Company's future performance. In addition, in 2020, we bought back over 6 million shares under our buyback program and increased our quarterly dividend to 16%. And as Craig mentioned, we're announcing today, a 2-for-1 stock split of the Company's shares. So, while the overall market environment in 2020 was highly uncertain, our agile entrepreneurial management team is confident that we have built further strength from which we can now drive superior long-term performance. Now, turning to our -- the trends and our progress across our served markets, I would just comment that we remain very pleased that the Company's balanced and broad end-market diversification continues to create value for the Company, with no single end-market representing more than 22% of our sales in the year 2020. We believe that this diversification mitigates the impact of the volatility of individual end markets. That was particularly important here in 2020, but while also exposing us to leading technologies wherever they may arise across the electronics industry. The military market represented a 11% of our sales in the fourth quarter and 12% of our sales for the full year. Sales in the quarter grew modestly from prior year, increasing by approximately 1% in the fourth quarter, with growth in naval, space and avionics applications offset in part by moderations in ground vehicles, rotorcraft and airframe. Sequentially, our sales increased as we had expected coming into the quarter by 3%. For the full year 2020, our sales grew by 3% in U.S. dollars and 2% organically, reflecting our leading market position and strong execution across virtually all segments of the military market, offset in part by the impact of the pandemic-related production disruptions that we experienced in the first half of 2020. Looking ahead, we expect sales in the first quarter to decrease modestly from these fourth quarter levels. I just want to say that our organization working in the military market has worked long and hard for many years to strengthen our broad technology position, while increasing our capacity to serve customers across all segments of this important market. Our performance in 2020, especially given the many disruptions related to the pandemic, is a great reflection of the results of those efforts. Given the ongoing and favorable military spending environment, our team continues to solidify our leadership position by ensuring that we execute on the demands of our customers by supporting the many next generation technologies that are required for modern military hardware. The commercial air market represented 2% of our sales in the fourth quarter and 3% of our sales for the full year. Not surprisingly, fourth quarter sales were down significantly, reducing by approximately 50%, as the commercial air market continued to experience unprecedented declines in demand for new aircraft, due to the pandemic-related disruptions to the global travel industry. Sequentially, our sales were a little bit better than expected, declining 10% from the third quarter and for the full year 2020, sales declined by 34%, reflecting that significant impact of the pandemic on travel and aircraft production. Looking into the first quarter of 2021, we expect a sequential moderation in sales from these levels. Look, there is no doubt that these are difficult times for the entire travel industry, which is seriously impacting the market for commercial airplanes. Nevertheless, our team, who has just been so resilient over the course of this year, remains committed to leveraging the Company's strong technology position across a wide array of aircraft platforms, as well as next-generation systems that are integrated into those airplanes and we remain well positioned when this market ultimately returns to growth. The industrial market represented 22% of our sales in the quarter and in the full year of 2020. Our sales in this market significantly exceeded expectations that we had coming into the quarter, increased by a very strong 29% in U.S. dollars and 24% organically from prior year. This robust growth was driven, especially by the battery and electric vehicle, instrumentation, heavy equipment, factory automation and medical segments of the industrial market. On a sequential basis, sales increased by 4% from the third quarter. We're really pleased with our results in industrial for the full year, with sales growing 15% in U.S. dollars and 11% organically, as we saw strong demand in really those same markets, battery and EV, instrumentation, heavy equipment, also alternative energy and of course, medical, which was a very strong segment in the year. Looking into the first quarter, we expect a slight moderation from the strong fourth quarter sales levels. I'm truly proud of our team working in the industrial market, whether enabling the growth in volumes of a wide array of medical equipment or managing through significant increases in demand for semiconductor capital goods and next-generation batteries, our global organization has reacted quickly to ensure that our customers are fully supported regardless of the many operational challenges that have arisen during the pandemic. The automotive market represented 20% of our sales in the fourth quarter and 17% of our sales for the full year 2020. Sales in this market were also much stronger than we had expected coming into the quarter, with revenue growing by 24% in U.S. dollars and 19% organically in the fourth quarter, and that was really driven by broad-based growth across all geographies in the automotive market. Sequentially, our automotive sales increased by a very strong 22% as we continue to benefit from the broad recovery in the global automotive market. For the full year 2020, our sales declined by 6% in U.S. dollars and 8% organically. And that really reflected the significant challenges in factory shutdowns experienced by the auto industry in the first half of the year related to the pandemic, but was partially offset by our strong recovery that we drove in the second half. Looking into 2021, we do expect a sequential moderation from these high sales levels in the first quarter. Look, no doubt about it, the automotive industry faced one of the most difficult periods in recent memory, during the first half of 2020, in particular in the second quarter, and that was followed by an unexpectedly robust recovery here in the second half. I'm just so proud of our team working in this important market, who has clearly demonstrated their agility and resiliency through these most turbulent times and thereby, secured the Company's position with our customers across the automotive market. Regardless of this most dynamic of years, we have continued to expand our range of interconnect, sensor and antenna products, both organically and through acquisitions, to enable a wide array of onboard electronics across a diversified range of traditional fuel and electric-powered vehicles made by auto manufacturers around the world. This consistent strategy will continue to benefit us long into the future. The mobile devices market represented 18% of our sales in the fourth quarter and 15% of our sales for the full year. Our sales in the quarter to mobile device customers increased by a much stronger-than-expected 32% from prior year, with strength in all product types, but particularly in wearables and laptops. Sequentially, our sales increased by 15% and that was driven by higher sales to smartphones and wearable devices. For the full year 2020, sales in the mobile devices market increased by a very strong 16%, as we continued to benefit from our agility in reacting to changes in demand in this dynamic market. For the full year, we saw particularly strong sales growth in products incorporated into laptops, tablets, wearables and other accessories as well as production-related products, and that was offset in part by a slight moderation of sales of products incorporated into smartphones. Looking into the first quarter, we anticipate a typically significant seasonal sequential decline of approximately 40%. While mobile devices will always remain one of our most volatile of markets, our outstanding and agile team is poised as always, to capture any opportunities for incremental sales that may arise in 2021 and beyond. Our leading array of antennas, interconnect products and mechanisms continues to enable a broad range of next-generation mobile devices, all positioning us well for the long term. The mobile networks market represented 5% of our sales in the quarter and 6% of our sales for the full year of 2020. Sales in the quarter decreased from prior year by 8% in U.S. dollars and 9% organically, with declines in sales to both equipment manufacturers as well as operators. Sequentially, our sales did increase by a bit less than we had expected, 12%. For the full year 2020, sales declined by 16% from prior year, which reflected the impact of the U.S. government restrictions on certain Chinese customers that had been imposed in 2019, as well as other impacts related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Looking ahead, we expect sales in the first quarter to increase from this quarter's levels, as operators expand their investments in next-generation mobile networks. Regardless of the challenging demand environment in the mobile networks market in 2020, we're confident in the Company's long-term position in this important and exciting industry. Our team continues to work aggressively to expand our opportunity with next-generation equipment and networks. And as customers ramp up investment of these advanced systems, we look forward to benefiting from the increased potential that comes from our unique position with both equipment manufacturers and mobile service providers around the world. The information technology and data communications market represented 18% of our sales in the quarter and 21% of our sales for the full year of 2020. Sales in the quarter was stronger than expected, rising by 3% in U.S. dollars and 2% organically from prior year, as stronger sales of networking equipment and server-related products were offset by lower sales of storage-related products. Sequentially, our sales declined by 8% from our very robust third quarter. We're very pleased with our performance for the full year for IT datacom, with our sales growing a very strong 15% in U.S. dollars and 11% organically, as we capitalized on increased demand from our OEM and service provider customers, as they work to accelerate bandwidth capacity expansions, in particular to support home-based work, school and entertainment. Our team working in support of these customers has clearly distinguished themselves this year, reacting quickly to capitalize on unprecedented demand for our industry-leading high-speed and power products. At the same time, we've not slowed down our efforts to further develop that broad range of leading interconnect products in support of data communications networks around the world. Looking into the first quarter of 2021, we expect a typical seasonal moderation of sales here in the quarter. But nevertheless, we remain very encouraged by the Company's strong technology position in the global IT datacom market. Our customers around the world continue to drive their equipment to ever higher levels of performance, in order to manage the dramatic increases in bandwidth and processor power. In turn, our team remains singularly focused on enabling this continuing revolution in IT datacom. The broadband communications market represented 4% of our sales in the quarter and 4% for the full year. Sales increased by 3% in the fourth quarter from prior year, driven by stronger demand for home installation related equipment from our broadband operators. On a sequential basis, sales decreased as expected by 9% from the third quarter. For the full year of 2020, sales were flat and that's despite the significant disruptions to production and demand that we experienced in the first quarter, offset by the accelerated investments in support of bandwidth later in the year. Looking into the first quarter, we expect sales to moderate from these levels and we remain encouraged by the Company's position in the broadband market. With our expanded range of products, together with strong relationships with customers around the world, we look forward to benefiting as operators increase their network investments in the future. Now just to summarize, there is no question that 2020 was one of the most challenging years we've all experienced. But in the face of these challenges, I'm just so proud of the entire team of Amphenolians around the world, who have managed extraordinarily well throughout the pandemic and the related disruptions to the economy. Through our dual-pronged approach of growing both organically and through our acquisition program, the Company continues to expand our market position, while strengthening our financial performance. Amphenol's superior performance is a direct reflection of our distinct competitive advantages, our leading technology, our increasing position with customers across our diverse end markets, worldwide presence, a lean and flexible cost structure, a highly effective acquisition program and I can say, most importantly in this pandemic-impacted 2020, an agile and entrepreneurial management team. Now, turning to our outlook and regardless of our strong performance in the fourth quarter, there still remains significant economic uncertainties related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Accordingly, we will not be providing full year guidance at this time. Assuming no new material disruptions from the pandemic, as well as constant exchange rates, for the first quarter, we now expect sales in the range of $2.120 billion to $2.180 billion and adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $0.90 to $0.94. I would just note that on a post-split basis, this adjusted diluted EPS guidance would be $0.45 to $0.47. This guidance represents sales growth in the first quarter of 14% to 17% year-over-year and adjusted diluted EPS growth of 27% to 32%, again compared to the first quarter of 2020. I remain confident in the ability of our outstanding management team to adapt to the continued challenges in the marketplace and to capitalize on the many future opportunities to grow our position and expand our profitability. Our entire organization remains committed to delivering strong financial results, all while prioritizing the continued safety and health of each of our employees around the world. Most importantly, I'd like to take this opportunity to thank the entire Amphenol team for their truly heroic efforts here in the fourth quarter and throughout the entirety of 2020. And with that, operator, we'd be very happy to take any questions that there may be. Thanks so much, Mark. Look, customers place orders to us and we can't always exactly pinpoint what the demand is, except we know that when they tell us they want the product. And I wouldn't tell you that we've seen any dramatic lengthening of lead times or longer-dated orders per se. You mentioned the widely reported discussions around semiconductor availability in a variety of markets. I think our customers are pretty smart. And while they may be chasing lots of semiconductors or trying to put orders on those kind of products, they know that our products are available for them. And we haven't disappointed them throughout this year, even with the disruptions early in the year, even with the significant increases in certain of our markets in the second half. So I wouldn't necessarily say that customers are lumping us into that kind of semiconductor category. I think that customers are looking to us, no question about it, on the basis of the fact that we were there for them when they needed us most. In particular, as many of our customers coming out of the pandemic, had certain -- some parts of their supply chain, which still had a lot of disruptions. And the excellent job that our team did in recovering from those disruptions, whether that was early on in the year, with bringing all of our factories in China back to full production, substantially earlier than many or continuing in through later part of the year with the recoveries that we saw, for example, in automotive and industrial and other markets. So, I think that our team is doing a good job of making sure that we get more than our fair share of our customers' bandwidth and orders, and we're going to keep driving for that. Yes. I mean, look, it's a fair question, Amit. I think we had just outstanding performance in the fourth quarter in both of those markets, as you know, 29% and 24% organic growth in industrial, 24% and 19%, respectively, in automotive. I think that we are outperforming by any measure, I would say the various markets. But does that mean that they are taking our product and putting it on the shelf? No. I mean, we don't see that whatsoever. But, at the same time, there is still uncertainty in the marketplace. We're not giving guidance for the full year. We have done an outstanding job of supporting our customers when they needed us in the ramp up after the various disruptions. And regardless of what happens in end demand, I believe that our position with customers is stronger than ever. Now, I should also mention that, whether it's in industrial or in automotive and obviously, industrial has a lot of different segments within it, we see continued content gains in both of those areas, which are greater than just the end unit demand. And that's the trend of adoption of electronics into all types of systems, all types of equipment, all types of products. And if anything, we've seen that adoption accelerate over the course of this year for a variety of reasons and much has been reported about the acceleration, for example, of electric drivetrains in cars, where we benefited greatly for that. But we've seen a lot of very similar dynamics across the multiple segments within the industrial market. So, look what does this mean for the second half of 2021, again, we're not giving guidance for the year. There is a lot of uncertainty related to the pandemic, but I think our position with our customers is stronger than ever before. Yes. I mean, without getting into too deep of a technical discussion here, I think you already kind of answered the question as I would answer, which is, we are agnostic. The fact is, we are a significant supplier of interconnect products, antennas and sensors into the automotive market. And to the extent that there is next-generation developments, new architectures in the car that create a kind of an open field to help enable that, that's always been a benefit for Amphenol in the long term. And so I would expect the same that to the extent that things become, how you say, more -- less wired or more wired, more wireless. The fact that we are a manufacturer of interconnect antennas and sensors positions us very well regardless of what that outcome is. Thanks very much, Craig. I mean, look, I think the only thing that I would say is really unique about MTS is the fact that it's a public company. It's our first public company acquisition. But, in terms of scale of the acquisition, you'll recall that we made the acquisition of FCI, I think it's been, what Craig, six years or so since that acquisition and at the time when we were a substantially smaller company. FCI was about a $1.2 billion purchase price, and this is $1.7 billion less the proceeds from the Test & Sim business. So, I wouldn't say that the size is unique. But the process is a little bit more unique with the public company process. And then with the strategic review that we did, that ultimately resulted in an outstanding outcome of us negotiating together with Illinois Tool Works, or ITW, the disposition of the Test & Simulation segment to ITW. And ITW is just an outstanding company. MTS is an outstanding company. And you know how we feel about Amphenol. So, I think this is a three really outstanding companies ending up in a real win-win-win for all parties, whether that's the shareholders of MTS, whether that's Amphenol or whether that is, in fact, ITW. From our position, the MTS Sensors business, which is what ultimately attracted us to MTS, it is just extraordinarily complementary. I mean, I'd say virtually no overlap with our own sensor offering, extremely harsh environment products used in a variety of really high technology applications. These are sensors that are used in force and vibration, pressure, position, really at the highest level of reliability with also complex interconnect systems associated there with. And so, from a -- when we talk about the complementary aspect of the MTS Sensors business, it is really just that unique -- uniquely complementary set of products across the end-markets where we very excited by. And then you add to all of that, just a wonderful, wonderful management team across the business. By the way all of MTS, we've just been so impressed with the people at MTS. But particularly with the MTS Sensors team, we're just so excited by this entrepreneurial organization and it's a team that we've known for a long time. This was not a kind of last minute thing here, far from it. We've known this organization for a very long time and we're very excited, subject to the shareholder approvals, subject to the regulatory and other closing conditions, we're very excited one day to welcome them into the Amphenol family. Yes, I mean, the simple answer to -- you said it at the end, do we see it as a core part of our portfolio? For sure. And it's very different than the situation with MTS. In the case of MTS, we were drawn to MTS because of the sensor business. We were impressed, by the way, very impressed with the team and with the business of Test & Simulation, but it's a different business for us, really categorically different and that was why we talked about having a strategic review. And in the end, I think a great outcome for all parties with the agreed sale to ITW. In the case of our Cable Products, Cable Products are an integral part of an interconnect system that is used in particular for getting high-speed bandwidth to customers and to companies. And what we've said all along is, yes, the Cable Products segment may underperform from an operating margin perspective for the moment, we don't want to be in the business of picking the winners and losers of how people and companies are going to get Internet connectivity to their homes, to their businesses, to the universities, to the governments. We want to be betting really on every possible way of doing that. And thus, our position with the cable operators, with the MSOs, is a very important strategic position for Amphenol. And that importance, by the way, carries over into our interconnect segment, where the strength that we have, the reputation that we have, our ability to service these service providers as opposed to OEMs, has been a fabulous value to the rest of the Company, in particular, as we've seen other markets move more towards the service provider market. And let me just give you an example of that. You take the IT datacom market, which traditionally we were selling products that go just directly to equipment manufacturers. Well, as I think everybody on the call knows, over the recent five or more years, maybe even a little bit more than half a decade, we've seen increasing strength and increasing demand from web service providers. How you work with a service provider is very, very different than how you work with an OEM, who ultimately is making a piece of equipment in a factory. And our experience in the Cable Products has been invaluable to our team in making sure that we can react to the demand and the volatility of the demand that is really endemic in any service provider business. When I look at our results this year, in particular in IT datacom, where we did see extremely strong demand from service providers, our ability to react on a moment's notice, the mindset of that is a mindset that we developed, that we incubated originally in our Cable business. And I think that that's just a great reflection of the broad value that we see in that business, beyond just the fact that it does have today a little bit lower margins, to much smaller piece of our business that it once was, but it's still an important part of Amphenol's strategy. Yes. Well, thanks very much, Nick. I think this is not an abnormal guidance that we see. Look, we had very, very strong performance in mobile devices this year. We came into the year with an expectation of the market being flat. I will tell you, I mean, we didn't give guidance at the time, but had you asked me at the end of Q1, what would mobile devices be for the year? I probably would have thought it would be even down given the disruptions that we saw in the first quarter to our China facilities. And the vast majority, if not all, of our mobile device production is really in China and all of those factories were shut down, as you know, for the better part of three weeks, due to the early stage of the coronavirus. And then our team just did an unbelievable job of reacting to the strength in the market. And the strength this year, well, there was, on a sequential basis in the fourth quarter, strength in smartphones, where we really saw a lot of strength this year, was maybe not surprisingly in devices that are needed by people when they are working, when they're learning, when they're being entertained at home. So, things like laptops; things like tablets; we saw a lot of strength in wearables, I know, a lot of people got on health kicks and maybe these wearables can be very useful there; a lot of strength in things that go in your ears, hearable devices as we call them, and probably because you have a lot of people doing work and school from home and they might have other people in the same house and they want to have some privacy. Whatever the reason is, there was just a great amount of strength and our team was able to react to quite unexpected demand. And so, as you go into the first quarter, I think that we would expect normally some relaxation of that demand. I mean, look, anecdotally, I tried to buy Christmas presents for my wife and my daughter of a computer, because they both have really old computers and I totally failed as a father and a husband and they each got their present, one got it about a month late, and the other one still hasn't gotten hers. So, there was a real demand back in the fourth quarter, in particular for these devices. And I think we wouldn't expect such a continuation here in the first quarter. Yes, actually Luke, it's a great question. The simple answer is, yes. Our team work in industrial, our team work in automotive and there's a lot of crossover, by the way, in those teams. There is an enormous amount of interaction from a technology, from a customer perspective, to ensure that we're maximizing our position with customers, whether they are making an electric bus or an electric sports car. And so, that interaction, as you call it cross-pollination, we call it inside Amphenol collaboration, is something that we're doing all the time. And that's collaboration from a product development, making sure that we're bringing a full suite of products to customers, in each of those markets and really capitalizing on that trend of electrification that we're seeing, again not just in automotive, but we're seeing that trend very significantly in the industrial market as well. And I'd say that when you look at our performance in both of those end markets, which we talked about with one of the earlier questions, it's not totally coincident that we're seeing those strong content growth in both of those markets, some of which is being driven by this trend of electrification. Wamsi, thanks for the question. Yes, I think if you look back the first quarter of 2019, we were certainly operating at very strong profitability at that point. Honestly and we finished the fourth quarter at very strong profitability levels. So I guess I wouldn't necessarily just kind of look back into '19 to kind of just to see a time where we are operating at strong profitability levels. If you look at the fourth quarter, we already reached 20.6% here in the quarter. We certainly still see some disruption related to the pandemic and that's certainly embedded in those numbers, maybe slightly offset by some other benefits we have and things like T&E. So I think I said last quarter that we kind of see a relatively neutral impact in the second half of the year. As we kind of go into the first quarter, our guidance really reflects, I would say, a sequential seasonal decline and we talked about approximately 10% kind of seasonal decline in sale. And that does, as you mentioned, kind of imply a conversion rate may be slightly higher than our normal 30% downside, which would maybe get to the profitability level in the 19% -- kind of a little above 19% range. So I think that's probably the basis of your question. I mean, I wouldn't say this conversion is isn't -- certainly isn't so significant, given the level of sequential decline we are seeing kind of going into the first quarter. In addition, combined with a continued challenging kind of cost environment, we are seeing still COVID-related inefficiencies. And I think that the Company has really done a great job thus far, as you saw in 2020, of dealing with those inefficiencies and really snapping back in a profitability level, but we are seeing a little bit of a decline going into the first quarter from a sales perspective, which is going to have some impact. And I think the team has done a great job dealing with that and we'll continue to deal with that. And so, I'm real proud of kind of where we ended up in 2020 and -- and I have no doubt that we'll get back to those levels. The other thing that's happening in the first quarter, certainly, is the acquisitions we just closed on here in January, are having some small effect on the conversion, if you look sequentially into the first quarter. And the ones we did in 2019 certainly wouldn't -- haven't made necessarily the progress that maybe we would have expected in 2020 for very understandable reasons, I think, we're dealing with the pandemic during 2020. So I think there's a few reasons. But, all in all, we're real happy with where we are at profitability, certainly in the second half year of 2020, and be quite honest, even in the first half given the challenges we had. And certainly, we are really confident that as we go into 2021, you'll see those levels snap back to normal levels once COVID is behind us. Yes. I mean, you said it David, we're not giving an outlook for the year. And I couldn't actually quote for you exactly how much of our business is related to EV versus traditional. I don't have the numbers close at hand. But what I can tell you is that, we are seeing higher growth from EV applications over the last several years and so EVs definitely represent a higher proportion today than they did a year ago, two years ago and three years ago, and we would expect in the coming year or two for that trend to continue. EVs not only do they tend to have potentially a little more content, but the nature of the content can be more attractive and more interesting for a company because of the high reliability, the harsh environment, the high power aspects of those vehicles. So, look, we'll see how the year progresses. We're not giving again guidance, but we have seen good strength in EV, and we would expect to see that going forward. Yes. I mean, look, I don't know specific share shifts. What I do know is we're outperforming the market. And so just I guess, by definition, we're taking some share. And part of the reason for that is EVs and part of the reason is other applications. Are there different competitors in an EV versus an internal combustion engine? There may be. I mean, there's different competitors for all different systems in the car. You have to remember in our industry, there is not a monolithic competitive landscape. There are obviously some companies that are publicly traded and well-known, which are excellent companies, but there is a whole diaspora of competition in the interconnect industry. And each application may have a different landscape of competitors than the application before it. So I guess, by definition, yes, you're going to have some different competitors. I think our strength in EV in part stretches back to the fact that we've been making high-power, high-voltage connectors for really the entire history of Amphenol. That is a legacy, you would call it even a birthright of Amphenol with our military, our industrial business and our ability to collaboratively share some of those underlying core technologies across our team, a little bit like we discussed just a few moments ago, has really positioned the Company well to be an enabler of those next-generation systems, which are really mission critical. So I think we're very happy to have a whole diaspora of competition across all our markets and that includes within automotive. Sure. Thanks so much, Steve. Look, these are both outstanding companies. We've known them both for a long time. I mean the family who founded and still until we just closed recently, Positronic, I've known that family for, I don't know, a decade and a half. I mean it's an outstanding company, Positronics. Just a real marquee brand in the interconnect industry, known for harsh environment, in particular, board level power connectors and some data connectors. These are IO connectors, these go on the board. They are used in a wide variety of systems in the military, as well as in datacom for power and industrial applications, and it's very complementary actually. A lot of the products that they have, Positronics, they have just a real proprietary position across their customer base, and sometimes, you look in admiration at the strength of a company's position, because of the uniqueness of their technology and that's something that we have done for many years with Positronics. El-Cab is a little bit of a different story. El-Cab, first of all, is our first company that's really fully based in Poland. Poland is an outstanding location for low-cost manufacturing with proximity to all of Europe and they have an excellent position in cable assemblies for industrial applications, and in particular, next-generation electric-powered industrial vehicles and whether that's buses, whether that's trucks, delivery vehicles, they're also involved in marine-related cable assemblies. But what really attracted us to them is their just leading position in this sort of EV revolution, industrial EV revolution, and that's something we've done a great job of in Asia, we've done a great job of it in North America and we've done a really -- a good job in Europe. But this accelerates our position in those -- in that electrification of industrial vehicles in Europe. And again, a fabulous team, family-owned company, great management, great products, great position, those are the factors that we always look for in acquisitions. And I think both Positronics and El-Cab deliver wholeheartedly in all those areas. Yes. I think, maybe, it might have contemplated a little bit, Joe. I think what I talked about was battery and EV and factory automation, but not necessarily together. But the fact is, you raised a very good point, which is for sure, whenever you have a massive build out of factories, be that for batteries where there is a lot of automation, next-generation vehicles, whatever and we've seen a lot of build-out of factories, by the way, semiconductor factories as well, you've seen the strength that we've had in instrumentation. Our position in factory automation and instrumentation, test equipment and otherwise, interconnect for all of those, puts us in a very strong position to benefit from the expansion of these facilities. But when we talk about our sales of industrial products into battery applications, it's really actual interconnect sensors that get integrated into these high-technology high-voltage battery systems, both to allow the signal of the battery, the power to come in and out of the battery, and also the control systems for these batteries, which is a wonderful opportunity where there is a lot of kind of interconnect and sensor applications where you're selling to customers just a complete solution to allow them to manage these batteries and thereby get more efficiency and safety out of them, once they're integrated into vehicles. Yes. I mean look, we're agnostic Will, to whatever that may be, if it's traditional oil and gas versus renewables versus all that's related to renewables, the battery storage that Joe just asked about and otherwise, we're really agnostic. I mean, if you look as an example, last quarter, we had last quarter a strong growth in alternative energy. And that was offset by relatively strong decline in oil and gas. And I think that's a good indication of the value and the strength of the diversified position that we have really across all areas of whether that be power generation, power consumption, power storage, we've made sure to not place a bet on kind of one trend or another, but rather to be present supporting customers across the board and we are still supporting our oil and gas customers for sure. I mean, that's an important market and I don't think the world is totally detaching from fossil fuels. But if the trend is away from them, we're well positioned either way. Jim, thank you very much. I think you listed a lot of them. I mean the fact is, if I look over the long term and you've followed us for a very long time and so you have a great sense of the arc of the progress of our automotive business over these many years. We started out in automotive many, many years ago as the innovator of airbag connectors and that was kind of our first thing we did and we're talking a long time ago. I think the first airbag was like in 1990 or something like that. So, we're talking a 30-year time period. And over time, we developed into interconnect products for satellite radio and GPS and other infotainment. We built through acquisitions and other -- and organic means presence in emissions control and engine control, other electronics and essentially as the car adopted new electronic systems, we were positioning ourselves either organically or through acquisition, to participate in those next-generation systems. Our growth in automotive was never a question of, kind of, taking someone else's business, that was a legacy business. Rather, it was positioning ourselves, as these new systems were developed, to be there for customers for Tier 1s, for Tier 2s, whomever. And I think that's been very successful over all these years. We believe there is still a lot more potential left in our automotive business. The growth in content in the car is really outstanding and we're not the only one to talk about that. In many ways, to me, a car is becoming kind of a datacenter on wheels. It's becoming an electric powertrain on wheels. I mean, you name it. And each of those new systems, many of which you mentioned, are contributors to the growth of the Company. But I -- what I wouldn't say is, if any of them are disproportionate to our long-term success in that market. I think, it's been actually a relatively balanced contribution to that long-term success, that in particular we've seen over really the last decade. Yes. I mean look, again, we're not giving guidance for 2021. But, when I look at the breadth of our performance here at the end of the year, as we closed out the year, and also throughout the course of the year, it's just there is no single story to the strength. I mean, yes, great performance in battery EV, great performance in instrumentation, great performance in medical. Again, I could give you a long list of the positive contributors to our industrial market. Will there be some areas where there will be a little bit of a tougher comparison? Obviously, the second quarter was a particularly acute quarter for medical, where our team, I mean I just cannot emphasize enough how proud we were to be a contributor to the fight against COVID through our reactivity to the demand for new medical equipment, whether that be respiratory therapy devices and the sensors interconnect products that are contained therein, whether that be hospital equipment to outfit ICUs and other patient care devices. I mean, that is something that we at Amphenol will forever be proud of, the contributions that our team made to the fight against COVID to protect lives and to enable countries around the world to have a fighting chance against this virus. And so, yes, will there be a little bit less maybe of some of those more acute care things? There could be, but who knows. There was also, as many have talked about, reductions in elective procedures, which actually reduced demand for certain medical equipment in some areas too, and so maybe that has the chance to come back. I think there is not the visibility today and thus, why we are not giving the guidance for the year. For me to say, which of those segments, as we go through the course of the year, are going to have the stronger or the weaker performance. But for sure, we have positioned ourselves with our customers by being there for them when they needed us most in their -- in really the most critical of time periods, such that, to the extent that they have business to give, I would expect that they will give at least, if not more than, our fair share to Amphenol. Well, this will be Mr. Norwitt for one last remark here. And listen, thank you all for all of your great interest in the Company. We really appreciate everybody's support through this 2020. We know this was not an easy year for all of you, working from home and cooked up and not being able to come visit us, for example. And we for sure, Craig and I, the two of us, no doubt about it, look forward to the day where we get to meet you in person again, host you here in our modest headquarters in Wallingford, Connecticut, where we are today. And we look forward to great success and wish you all good health as we continue into 2021. Thank you so much."

Following today's presentation, there will be a formal question-and-answer session. Until then, all lines will remain in a listen-only mode. At the request of the company, today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce today's conference host, Mr. Craig Lampo. Sir, you may begin.\nCraig Lampo: Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. This is Craig Lampo, Amphenol's CFO, and I'm here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO. We would like to welcome you to our third quarter 2020 conference call. As a reminder, during the call, we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures and may make certain forward-looking statements, so please refer to the relevant disclosures in our press release for further information. The company closed the third quarter with record sales of $2,323 million, and record GAAP and adjusted diluted EPS of $1.12 and $1.09 respectively. Sales were up 11% in U.S. dollars and up 10% in local currencies compared to the third quarter of 2019. Sales in the third quarter increased by 9% organically, and sequentially, sales were up 17% in U.S. dollars and 15% in local currencies inorganically. Breaking down sales into our two segments, the interconnect business which comprised 96% of our sales was up 11% in U.S. dollars and 10% in local currencies compared to the third quarter of last year. Our cable business which comprised 4% of our sales, was up 2% in U.S. dollars and 5% in local currencies compared to the third quarter of last year. Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes. Operating income was $476 million in the third quarter of 2020. Operating margins were 20.5%, which was up a very strong 250 basis points sequentially, and up 80 basis points compared to the third quarter of 2019. The strong sequential improvement in margins reflected a healthy conversion on the higher sales levels, as well as an expected significant reduction in the impact of COVID-related costs. The year-over-year improvement in operating margin reflected a strong conversion on the higher sales levels. From a segment standpoint, in the interconnect segment, margins were 22.4% in the third quarter of 2020, which increased from 21.7% in the third quarter of 2019, and 20% in the third quarter - in the second quarter of 2020. In the cable segment, margins were 10.7%, which increased from 10.2% in the third quarter of 2019, and 9.4% in the second quarter of 2020. Given the unprecedented challenges related to the COVID-19 pandemic, we are extremely proud of this quarter's performance. Our team's ability to manage through all the impacts of this crisis is a direct result of the strength and commitment of the company's entrepreneurial management team, which continues to foster a high performance action oriented culture and which has enabled us to capitalize on opportunities and maximize profitability in an uncertain market environment. Interest expense for the quarter was $28 million, which was down from $30 million in the third quarter of last year. The company's GAAP effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2020, including an excess tax benefit of $11 million associated with stock option exercises during the quarter was 22.1% compared to 24.5% in the third quarter of 2019. Excluding the excess tax benefit just mentioned, the company's adjusted effective tax rate was 24.5% for both the third quarter of 2020 and 2019. Adjusted net income of $336 million was 14% of sales in the third quarter of 2020, another confirmation of the strength of the company's financial performance. On a GAAP basis, diluted EPS increased by 22% at $1.12 in the third quarter of 2020 compared to $0.92 in the third quarter of 2019. Adjusted diluted EPS increased by 15% to $1.09 in the third quarter of 2020 from $0.95 in the third quarter of 2019. Orders for the quarter were $2,275 million, which was up 9% compared to the third quarter of 2019, and up 15% sequentially, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 0.98 to 1. The company continues to be an excellent generator of cash, cash flow from operations with a strong $398 million in the third quarter or 119% of adjusted net income. Our free cash flow was $330 million or 98% of adjusted net income. From a working capital standpoint, inventory and accounts receivable and accounts payable were $1.4 billion, $1.9 billion, and $1.1 billion, respectively at the end of September. And inventory days, days sales outstanding and payable days were 79, 72 and 61 days, respectively. All improved from the second quarter levels and all within our normal range. During the third quarter, our cash flow from operations of $398 million, along with proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $104 million were used primarily to repurchase 1.9 million shares of the company's stock for $202 million or an average price of $108, fund dividend payments of $75 million, fund net capital expenditures of $68 million, fund acquisitions of $50 million and fund net purchases of short-term investments of $9 million. As mentioned in today's earnings release, the company's Board of Directors has approved a 16% increase in the quarterly dividend on the company's common stock from $0.25 to $0.29 per share. This increase is effective for payments beginning in January of 2021. At September 30, cash and short-term investments were $1.5 billion, the majority of which is held outside of the U.S. Total debt at September 30 was $3.8 billion with no maturities before the third quarter of 2021 and net debt at September 30 was $2.4 billion. Total cash on hand, plus the remaining availability under our credit facilities was $4 billion at the end of the quarter. And third quarter EBITDA was $568 million and our pro forma net leverage ratio was 1.2 times. I will now turn it back to Adam who will provide some commentary on current trends.\nAdam Norwitt: Well, Craig, thank you very much, and I'd like to extend my welcome to everybody here today at the time of our third quarter earnings release. And first and foremost, I hope that all of you on the call here today, together with your family, your friends and your colleagues are staying safe and healthy throughout the pandemic. As Craig mentioned, I'm going to highlight some of our achievements in the third quarter, and most importantly, discuss the trends and progress across our served markets. I'll then make a few comments on our outlook for the fourth quarter as well as for the full year of 2020. With respect to the third quarter, and amidst what has been clearly an unprecedented and volatile year, I'm truly proud that we at Amphenol achieved record sales and adjusted earnings per share in the third quarter, realizing level significantly above our guidance that we issued just 90 days ago. Sales reached $2,323 million, an increase from prior year of 11% in U.S. dollars, 10% in local currencies, and 9% organically. The strong growth was driven by increases in mobile devices, IT datacom, industrial, military, broadband and the automotive markets, and was offset partially by declines in the commercial air and mobile networks markets. We are particularly proud to have achieved a very robust 17% sequential growth from the second quarter which was significantly higher than our original expectations. As Craig mentioned, the company booked $2,275 million in orders and that represented a book-to-bill of 0.98 to 1. Now despite experiencing some continued operational challenges related to the pandemic, we generated excellent operating margins of 20.5% in the third quarter, and this was a full 250 basis point increase from our second quarter levels. Just want to say that the company's financial position remains extremely strong, with our operating cash flow of $398 million, and that was particularly notable given the stronger than expected sequential growth from the second quarter. And we continue to leverage that financial strength to return capital to our shareholders, both through our repurchase last quarter of 1.9 million shares of the company's stock, as well as the Board of Directors' approval of a 16% increase in our quarterly dividend that we are announcing today. I'm extremely proud of the Amphenol team. No question in my mind that the record results this quarter clearly demonstrate the true value of the agility, the discipline, and the drive of our entrepreneurial organization. Now turning to the trends across our served markets, I would just comment that as we've seen this year so far, Amphenol's balanced and broad end market diversification is a uniquely valuable asset, especially in times of heightened economic uncertainty. As many of our markets began to recover in the third quarter, we were able to quickly capitalize on the growth opportunities in those markets, while still retaining our broad exposure to new opportunities and new technology developments across all areas of the electronics industry. The military market represented 12% of our sales in the third quarter. Sales in this market increased by 6% from prior year, driven in particular by growth in military vehicles, naval, space, communications and airframe applications. Sequentially, our sales increased by a strong 30% as we recovered from the impact of production restrictions that hit certain of our facilities related to government measures implemented in the second quarter to control the COVID-19 pandemic. Looking into the fourth quarter, we expect sales to increase slightly from these levels, and for the full year of 2020, we expect a low single-digit increase in sales from prior year. This full year performance reflects our leading market position and strong execution, offset in part by the impact of the pandemic related production restrictions we experienced in the first half of 2020. I'm very proud of our team working in the military market around the world. They have maintained a singular focus on ensuring that our defense industry customers have uninterrupted access to our leading high technology interconnect products which are - which are critical to our customers' equipment. We are encouraged both by the accelerating adoption of electronics in these systems together with the overall favorable defense spending environment. The investments that we've made over the last several years in both new technologies and the capabilities to produce them at volume have positioned us very strongly to be able to capitalize on these trends for many years to come. The commercial aerospace market represented 2% of our sales in the third quarter. Sales were down by 40%, a very significant level, as the commercial aircraft market once again experienced unprecedented declines in demand for new aircraft due to the pandemic related disruptions to the global travel industry. Sequentially, our sales were a bit better than expected, rising 4% from the second quarter. As we look ahead though, we expect the commercial air market to continue to be negatively impacted by the significant reduction in demand for air travel, which is occurring around the world. Accordingly, we expect an approximately 20% sequential reduction in our sales to this market in the fourth quarter. And for the full year 2020, we expect a roughly 35% decline from prior year due to the unprecedented demand disruptions that our customers are experiencing. No question that these are difficult times for the entire travel industry and that that's having a serious impact on the market for commercial airplanes in the near term. Nevertheless, our team remains committed to leveraging the company's strong technology position across a wide array of aircraft platforms and next generation systems integrated into those airplanes, and we remain well positioned when this market eventually does return to growth. The industrial market represented 22% of our sales in the quarter, and our sales to the industrial market exceeded our expectations, increasing by 21% in U.S. dollars and 18% organically, a very strong performance. This robust growth was driven especially by the instrumentation, medical, industrial battery, heavy equipment, alternative energy and rail mass transit segments, really a broad base of growth that we saw in the industrial market. Although we had expected sales to be modestly lower than the second quarter, we actually realized 11% sequential growth during the third quarter, a very strong performance. Looking into the fourth quarter, we expect a modest decline from these third quarter sales levels. Nevertheless, for the full year 2020, we expect a low double-digit increase in sales from 2019 levels, an outstanding performance given the overall market environment. I'm truly proud of our team working in the industrial market, whether enabling the growth in volumes of a wide array of medical equipment, managing through significant increases in demand for semiconductor capital equipment or executing on unprecedented demand for next generation batteries, our global organization has reacted quickly to ensure that our customers around the world are fully supported regardless of the many operational challenges that have arisen throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. As we look towards the long-term, I'm confident that our performance through this crisis has positioned us very strongly for the future. And importantly, we continue to drive our leading development of next generation interconnect sensor and antenna products in support of our customers in the industrial market, who in turn are accelerating their adoption of next generation technologies. The automotive market represented 17% of our sales in the third quarter. After a truly challenging second quarter during which the global automotive industry was deeply impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, we were very pleased to have seen a very strong recovery here in the third quarter, with results much better than we had originally anticipated coming into the quarter. Our team's outstanding execution led to an increase in sales from prior year by 4% in U.S. dollars and 1% organically, well ahead of our expectations. Sequentially, our sales increased by truly significant 78% from the second quarter, as our team was able to execute quickly on a recovery in demand from automotive customers in all regions. Looking now into the fourth quarter, we expect automotive sales to further increase in the mid-single digits from these levels. For the full year 2020, we expect a low double-digit reduction in sales, which does reflect the severe and sudden pandemic-related downturn and demand from automotive OEMs that we saw in the first half. I'm extremely proud of our team working in the automotive market, who has clearly demonstrated, both agility and resiliency in realizing the strong sequential growth levels. In fact, our performance through this crisis makes me even more confident in our long-term prospects in the automotive market. We've continued to expand our range of interconnect sensor and antenna products, both organically and through acquisitions, all with the goal of enabling a wide array of onboard electronics across a diversified range of vehicles made by auto manufacturers around the world. This consistent strategy will no doubt continue to benefit us as the automotive market recovers. The mobile devices market represented 16% of our sales in the quarter and our sales to mobile device customers increased by a stronger than expected 25% from prior year, driven in particular by increased sales of products incorporated into laptops, tablets and wearables, and this was offset in part by slightly lower year-over-year sales to smartphones. Sequentially, our sales increased by a much stronger than expected 37%, and this was driven by higher sales across all the products that we serve. Looking to the fourth quarter, we expect a slight increase from these already strong third quarter levels, and for the full year, we anticipate sales to grow in the low double digits from 2019. And I would just note that this is well above our original expectations as we came into the year before we were hit with the pandemic. While mobile devices will always remain one of our most volatile markets, our outstanding agile team is poised as always to capture any opportunities for incremental sales that may arise here in the fourth quarter or beyond. Our leading array of antennas, interconnect products and mechanisms continue to enable a broad range of next generation mobile devices, and this positions us well for the long-term. The mobile networks market represented 6% of our sales in the quarter, and sales decreased as we had expected from prior year by 19% in U.S. dollars and 21% organically, driven by lower sales to wireless operators, as well as some continued impact from the U.S. government restrictions on certain Chinese entities that we have previously discussed. On a sequential basis, our sales reduced by 9% on overall lower spending by both operators and OEMs. Looking into the fourth quarter, we expect a further seasonal sales reduction of approximately 25% related to both OEMs and service providers. And for the full year, we expect a high teens reduction in sales, which reflects the impact of the U.S. government restrictions, as well as the COVID-19 pandemic. Regardless of the near-term challenges in the mobile networks market, we're confident in the company's long-term position in this important and exciting industry. Our team continues to work aggressively to expand our opportunity with next generation equipment and networks. As customers ramp up investment of these advanced systems, we look forward to benefiting from the increased potential that comes from our unique position with both equipment manufacturers and mobile service providers around the world. The information technology and data communications market represented 21% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in the third quarter once again much better than we had anticipated, rising from prior year by a very strong 24% in U.S. dollars and 21% organically. And this growth was really driven from increased demand for data traffic that continue to prompt both our OEM and service provider customers to increase their demand across virtually all segments of the IT datacom market. Sequentially, sales were down by a less than expected 10% from our extremely strong second quarter. As we look towards the fourth quarter, we expect a mid-teens sequential decline from these very strong third quarter levels, and for the full year 2020, we expect sales to increase in the low teens, reflecting the significant upside in demand we experienced in both the second and third quarters, offset in part by the pandemic-related disruptions we saw in the first quarter. Our team working in support of the IT datacom market has clearly distinguished themselves this year, reacting quickly to capitalize on unprecedented demand for our industry-leading high-speed and power products. At the same time, we've not slowed down our efforts to further develop our broad range of industry-leading interconnect products in support of data communications networks around the world. Indeed, we remain very encouraged by the company's strong technology position in the global IT datacom market. Our customers continue to drive their equipment to ever higher levels of performance in order to manage the dramatic increases in demand for bandwidth and processor power. In turn, our team remains singularly focused on enabling this continuing revolution in IT datacom. The broadband market represented 4% of our sales in the quarter. Sales increased by 5% from prior year, driven by stronger demand for home installation related equipment from broadband operators. On a sequential basis, sales increased by a stronger than expected 13%, as our customers continue to upgrade their networks in support of the increased demand for high-speed data. We expect sales in the fourth quarter to moderate from these levels on typical end of the year seasonality. And for the full year 2020, we expect sales to be roughly flat with prior year, and this reflects the pandemic-related disruptions we experienced in certain geographies, offset by increased investments by our customers in support of higher bandwidth demand. Now turning to our outlook for the future. While our performance in the third quarter was very strong, there still remain significant uncertainties in the global market related to the COVID-19 pandemic, which does appear to be worsening in some regions of the world. Assuming no new material disruptions from the pandemic, as well as constant exchange rates, for the fourth quarter, we expect sales in the range of $2,160 million to $2,200 million, and adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $0.98 to $1. This represents both sales and adjusted diluted EPS growth versus prior year of flat to up 2%. Our fourth quarter guidance also represents an expectation for full year sales of $8,333 million to $8,373 million, and full year adjusted diluted EPS of $3.59 to $3.61. This outlook represents sales growth versus prior year of 1% to 2%, and an adjusted diluted EPS decline of 3% to 4%. The expected decline in our earnings relates directly to the significant cost and disruptions associated with the COVID-19 pandemic that the company faced particularly during the first half of 2020. Now let me just say that I'm extremely pleased by Amphenol's performance in the third quarter, especially our team's achievement of these new quarterly records in both sales and earnings. Most importantly, I remain very confident in the ability of our outstanding management team to adapt to the continued challenges in the marketplace, and to capitalize on the many future opportunities to grow our market position and expand our profitability. I just want to assure you that our entire organization remains committed to fighting hard to secure the company's financial performance, all while dedicating ourselves wholeheartedly to protecting the safety and health of each of our employees around the world. And as a final note, I would just like to take this opportunity here today to thank every one of our Amphenolians around the world for their outstanding efforts here in the third quarter. And with that, operator, we'd be very happy to take any questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Amit Daryanani from Evercore. Your line is open.\nAmit Daryanani: Thank you and congrats on the strong execution you guys. I guess, my question is really, when I look at the strength, we saw in September quarter, I think it was one of the largest B2C in out of you guys in a few years. I guess, Adam, could you just touch upon what surprised you and drove the upside versus 90 days ago? Was it just better end demand or did you see inventory build happy at customers or perhaps is more allocation shift that came your way since competition couldn't execute? It would be helpful to get some context on what drove this impressive 10% to 11% growth and sort of how would you characterize that, because the question I keep getting asked is, why aren't we seeing a follow - follow through of this growth in the December quarter guide?\nAdam Norwitt: Sure. Well, thank you very much, Amit. Look, I think you listed a few factors, and I think there is a little bit of each of them in the third quarter with maybe the exception that I can't tell you that we saw any inventory build of significance so that we had at least visibility to in the quarter. But no question, in several of our markets, demand was much stronger than we had anticipated. I think we outperformed maybe some of our peers in certain of those areas where we were able to capitalize on the demand in a faster fashion. So you take the example of mobile devices where we came into the quarter expecting a relatively modest sequential growth, and mobile devices is always the market that's very hard to anticipate, but our team drove 37% sequential growth in mobile devices and that came both from volume demands from our customers, but also from the fact that there were instances where our customers couldn't get everything they needed from other folks, and they could get it from us. And I think that's something that we've demonstrated in many years in the past. Our teams have the outstanding agility in reacting to unexpected levels of demand. We clearly did not anticipate coming into the quarter that we would have such significant sequential growth in automotive, and in fact, we have grown on a year-over-year basis in automotive after that just very, very challenging second quarter that we all saw was a real testament again to the agility of our team to satisfy what was unexpected levels of demand. But look - as you look at our guide for the fourth quarter, and I know you, as you mentioned Amit, why does that - what is going on with that guide, we do this as we always have done. We talk to our customers and this is a bottoms-up approach to how we forecast. There are certain markets where there were real surges in demand earlier in the year. IT datacom another example of that, where we've guided IT datacom to be down in kind of the mid-teens in the fourth quarter, it was down a lot less than we anticipated here in the third quarter. There was the real surge in demand for data bandwidth - for bandwidth upgrades and support of data traffic to support all of the work from home and study from home requirements around the world related to the pandemic. And that's normally not a market that would be down by so much in the fourth quarter, but it's also normally not a market that would have grown so much in the second and third quarters. So we've done our best here amidst this environment to take everything that our customers say. We add that up to the outlook that we've given you. And knowing full well that there - we are not out of the woods relative to the pandemic, there is still a pandemic going on. It is in fact worsening in certain areas. And I think our customers are sensitive to that, and our team is prepared if there is some further surprise, further operational challenges that will come, but we think this is actually a very, very strong outlook relative to the extraordinary strength that we saw here in the third quarter.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from Luke Junk from Baird. Your line is open.\nLuke Junk: My question is on the auto business, and I'm just curious in the wake of COVID, whether you're seeing a shift and focus in your auto customers, given your engineering labor relationships. Just wondering if anything has shifted in terms of focus related to electrification, autonomous driving or similar as far as you can see?\nAdam Norwitt: Well, thanks so much, Luke. Look, I think that that shift towards new drivetrains, towards autonomous, other new technologies that are going into the car, I mean, we have continued to see that for many years. I wouldn't necessarily say that we've seen an acute change in the trajectory of that evolution here in 2020 due to COVID. I think what we saw in the third quarter was customers really scrambling to get back into their production levels, and customers probably buying more cars than people anticipated. There seems to have developed some degree of pent-up demand for automotive production. I have heard anecdotes about inventory levels being low, that it's difficult to get a pick-up truck in Michigan and things like this. And I'm sure, Luke, you know you're closer to this market than we are, and you know very well, some of those dynamics. But there's no question that there is real demand from customers and they continue to drive new programs that have been in the pipeline. But is the pandemic itself responsible for a kind of distinct shift, I wouldn't say that is. Now, I would also just add that our team around the world has done a fabulous job in positioning ourselves in these new platforms, while we haven't forsaken the traditional drivetrains, the internal combustion engines, and otherwise, we continue to support our customers who are manufacturing these would still represent the vast majority of vehicles that are being produced around the world. But our team has done such a great job on developing new products, expanding our relationship with customers really in all geographies such that to the extent there is an acceleration of that shift, I think, Amphenol is well positioned to benefit from it.\nOperator: Next question is coming from Mark Delaney from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nMark Delaney: Yes, good afternoon, and thanks for taking the question, and congratulations on the very strong 3Q results. So I mean, to better understand the EBIT margins, I mean, there have been some constraints the company was facing, acquired companies that came in initially at lower margins, and some extra costs around COVID that have been weighing on margins earlier this year, but the company had very strong EBIT margins in the third quarter. So I'm going to better understand to what extent there are still headwinds that the company is trying to contend with? Clearly on an overall basis was able to overcome those, but are there still any challenges around integrating that new assets or COVID costs that are still a drag to EBIT margins? And perhaps if you could talk about it with some perspective on how to think about that going forward? And you mentioned there is still some increase in COVID cases. Is there anything we need to be thinking about around COVID weighing on margins either in 4Q or potentially into next year? Thank you.\nAdam Norwitt: Great. Thanks, Mark. Thanks for the question. No - I mean, no doubt, we are really proud of our ability to achieve these strong operating margins of 20.5% here in the third quarter and 250 basis point improvement over Q2 or 18% and certainly 80 basis points even over the last year when COVID really wasn't a thing. So we're certainly very proud of that. I mean, as I did mention in my prepared remarks, we did have strong conversion on our higher kind of sales levels that certainly had a benefit from a profitability perspective, but it also reflected sequentially our expected reduction in COVID related costs in the quarter. I mean, we certainly still are experiencing some turbulence in the business related to COVID and the cost that that creates, but certainly it is at a much lower level than it was in the first and second quarter. But there is no doubt, there still is some costs that we are experiencing. The team is doing an outstanding job of navigating that and minimizing that to the extent possible, but there are certainly also puts and takes within the P&L. And as an example, there is other costs such as T&E, as an example, that does have some offsetting impact at this lower level of COVID cost. So what I would say is, from a net impact in the third quarter, really that COVID related and kind of these puts and takes, some talking about really didn't have a meaningful impact kind of in the third quarter on our margin. So you mentioned acquisitions - any acquisition impact, I would say that, although we continue to spend time on that, this year, certainly due to the pandemic, we haven't been able to make certainly the progress that we would hope to have made in this year related to some of the acquisitions we acquired in '19. So I wouldn't say that really has had so much of impact in the third quarter either. If you kind of look at year-over-year, it's really more of that leverage on the sales increase. And going forward, I think that I would expect kind of our normal conversion on the upside and downside, you know that 25%, 30% on the downside, which I think I would expect. And that assumes certainly that we don't have this resurgence, you know that of significance in the pandemic. We - always certainly if we do have additional costs, we're going to work hard to continue to mitigate those, but I'm certainly real proud of what the team has done so far to do that and we'll keep an eye on that in the future. But again, real outstanding performance here in the quarter. The team has done a fantastic job of navigating all these things that are happening in the world.\nOperator: Next question comes from Wamsi Mohan of Bank of America. Your line is open.\nWamsi Mohan: If you step back to pre-COVID at the beginning of the year, your thought that you would do about $8.3 billion in revenue and $3.80 in EPS. Now you expect fairly similar revenue, EPS is about $0.40 lower for the year. Is all the differential, just incremental costs associated with COVID, and if so, should we expect that next year we should see faster EPS growth as your conversion margins now overcome the COVID headwinds as you did in the third quarter? And if I could, in the fourth quarter, mobile devices, Adam, you had mentioned in 3Q that you were slightly down on smartphones and laptops, tablets and wearables drove the growth. I was wondering if those similar comments also hold for the fourth quarter guidance? Thank you.\nAdam Norwitt: Yes, thanks Wamsi. Yes, I would say that, all that differential really is the COVID related costs that we incurred in the first half. And if you kind of look at the first half year-over-year from an EPS versus - perspective and kind of conversion on those sales differentials that really is all the COVID related cost, you know we talked about that in the last couple of quarters. So, yes, as we go into 2021, we're not giving guidance here, but certainly we would expect at least at this point based on the - guidance for Q4 that those costs would not be in there. But again, we talked about a minute ago about these potential resurgences throughout the world, so will give our guidance in January and certainly we'll talk about what we expect there. But it is all COVID related and we're really happy to be kind of at those pre-COVID profitability levels here in the third quarter, and again, proud of what the team has done thus far.\nCraig Lampo: Yes. And Wamsi just a short answer to your second question. I mean, it's hard enough to forecast mobile devices and learn to forecast it based on the individual components of it. I wouldn't think anything is categorically different in the fourth quarter than the third quarter, but it - we have - anyway it's a hard time to forecast it in general. So I wouldn't get too far out ahead of myself in saying which individual segments are going to be strong in the fourth quarter.\nOperator: Next question is from Samik Chatterjee from JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nSamik Chatterjee: Adam, I just wanted to kind of ask you on a more broad level, and I think you touched on this a couple of times passingly, like, how are customers responding to the risk of a second wave here on the pandemic and what are you baking in, in terms of your guidance for the fourth quarter related to that, because the reason I ask is, we've seen a bit more volatility in the order trends this year and what in hindsight looks like, you had a strong 1Q order trend moderating in 2Q. Should we expect something similar to repeat if we have a second wave in 3Q and 4Q of this year?\nAdam Norwitt: Yes, thanks. Thanks so much, Samik. Look, I don't know that anybody is handicapping in their production plan. What a second wave will be, what the magnitude of a second wave can be, and more importantly, what are the consumer reaction to that and what are the governmental reactions to whatever second wave will be. We certainly are not trying to guess across all of those variables what that can be. But as I pointed out in my prepared remarks, we're very sensitive to the fact that there may be further disruptions. And thus, it's not about preparing yourself by saying, well, I'm going to add inventory, subtract inventory or otherwise, it's making sure that your entire organization is on their toes. It is remaining nimble, agile, reactive and prepared physically, psychologically for whatever may come our way. And I think that's where the Amphenol team has really excelled this year. It's not that we guessed which way the trajectory of the pandemic was going to come and thus we were able to achieve these results. It's that we were ready regardless of how it came. And I think the third quarter is just a wonderful indication of that. We didn't come into the quarter anticipating, for example, that mobile devices would grow 37% sequentially or anticipating that automotive would grow 78% sequentially or that our military business would be up 30%. But we were ready in case it were to happen, because our team was able to flex. So what do our customers - how our customers integrating a second wave into their expectations, I actually don't know. Maybe some are, maybe some are not, but how we approach this is we take what our customers tell us, and then we're ready regardless. Are we going to be right at the numbers that we have guided here? Hard to say. That's the best that we can tell right now, but this - if this year has taught us anything, it's to expect the unexpected and to be ready regardless of what comes our way. And I think that's what the Amphenol team, where we sit today here in the third week of October, we're ready for whatever comes along. We continue to prioritize the health of our people. That's been number one by the way throughout this - that's what's enabled us to support our customers, that's what's allowed us to then drive the strong results. And we're going to continue to do that. And if more demand comes, we will satisfy, and if less demand comes, we will react to that as well.\nOperator: Next question is from Nick Todorov from Longbow Research. Your line is open.\nNick Todorov: Just wanted to go back to the mobile markets, and I just wanted to see a reference of comment. Adam, I think you made last quarter, as you guys are poised to capture any incremental opportunities in 2020? So what I'm hearing from you is that you're not necessarily seeing any contribution towards this year low double-digit growth from the mobile - from the smartphone space specifically. I just wonder if anything changed here as we go into the fourth quarter and we know that some of the builds have been delayed? Has anything changed in your position or your view in specifically the smartphone market and how you play in that role?\nAdam Norwitt: Yes, I mean, look, I think what I've always said and I said that last quarter, and I think I probably said it again here this quarter is, this is a hard market to forecast and to the extent that demand is higher than we anticipate, we're very much - our team is very much poised to capitalize upon that, and that's exactly what we did here in the third quarter. And while it's true that on a year-over-year basis, our growth came not from necessarily smartphones, but rather from things like laptops and tablets and wearables and otherwise. In the fourth quarter, it may very well be a different situation. We'll see as it comes. We did grow sequentially across all of those products, including strong double-digit sequential growth in our sales of products that go into smartphones. And so, our team is for sure capitalizing on whatever incremental demand there may be in smartphones. And when we talk about the incremental performance that we had in this quarter, again, growing 37% sequentially instead of just a modest growth, some of that upside was in fact coming also from smartphones even if that didn't represent growth on a year-over-year basis.\nOperator: Our next question is from Jim Suva from Citigroup Investment Research. Your line is open.\nJim Suva: Thank you, very much and good job, at really adjusting to a dynamic world.\nAdam Norwitt: Thank you, Jim.\nJim Suva: The question I had was a little unique question I haven't asked before, focused on it much, because it hasn't changed much and that was the book-to-bill. Normally, this quarter has been above 1. Normally, the company has seen above 1 book-to-bill. Obviously, you had - you crushed your expectations in a positive way for revenues and EPS this quarter, because some of that play into the book-to-bill or why would we see a book-to-bill given your results and also the outlook which were stronger than expected? And we trying to triangulate around that, like, if there - or is there inventory restocking going on that maybe you don't feel comfortable is going to continue or I'm trying to triangulate the book-to-bill versus your strong results and outlook and all the commentary?\nAdam Norwitt: Sure. Thanks, Jim. Look, one thing I would just say about the book-to-bill, I mean 0.98 to 1 is pretty close to 1. On a year-to-date basis, if you include our very strong book-to-bill that we had in the first quarter, our book-to-bill year-to-date is 1.04 to 1, which is very, very strong compared to maybe other years. But look, does that - what does that mean for the fourth quarter, I think, we've already talked about what the - how we've gone - coming up with our fourth quarter guidance. I think these are strong bookings. They far exceeded what we thought coming into the quarter. And the fact that the book-to-bill is little bit below one is I think just a reflection that some customers placed upon us much stronger orders early in the year and there are some markets where the lead times are a little bit longer, places like military, for example, where we have very substantial order books that were shipping out of, but I wouldn't read anything abnormal into that. I think last year in the third quarter, our book-to-bill was kind of 1 to 1. So considering that this is a year where very little is normal, actually I'd say, a 0.98 to 1 book-to-bill is pretty normal compared to last year when all is said and done. And again, we shipped so strongly in the quarter. And so, the fact that we were able to execute on the backlog that we had. Had we not executed on that, we'd be talking about a positive book-to-bill. And so, I think, these were very strong bookings, but those shipments were even stronger.\nOperator: Our next question is from Matt Sheerin from Stifel. Your line is open.\nMatt Sheerin: Yes, thanks. Hello, Adam and Craig. My question is on the defense and aerospace markets. On the military side, you talked about seeing a return to growth, but it sounds like there is still some COVID related constraints there. So would love some commentary there? And on the aerospace segment where you're guiding down again, are you getting a sense at all that we're at a bottom there or any signs of stabilization?\nAdam Norwitt: Thanks very much Matt. Look, I think, on the military side, we clearly had a lot of constraints in the second quarter and that was reflected in our performance in the second quarter. We have to go back a little bit and understand we've been dealing with a very, very robust military market. You'll recall, 2019 we grew 23% in military, which is really substantial in that market. And net 23% in military required us to step up quite significantly our capacity expansions in support of this very, very strong levels of demand. And so, as we came into COVID, there was still strong demand, but then we lost a lot of production in the second quarter because of the various shutdowns in places like the U.S., in places like Mexico, places like India, and otherwise in Europe as well. And getting that back so rapidly is not as easy in the military market, when we were already running at very high levels of capacity. Now I can tell you this, we are supporting our customers in an outstanding fashion. We have not disappointed. We have not let down customers. We're not creating any problems for our customers. But overall, we are running here again in the third quarter at a very high level of production relative to capacity, and there is still significant demand that is out there. So when does that return to growth? I think our outlook for the full year to be in the kind of low single digits is a reflection of strong performance where there is one quarter where we really lost a fair bit of production in that quarter. Now relative to commercial air, I don't - I can't be the one to call a \"bottom here\". We came into this quarter thinking that our sales would sequentially be down, in fact, they were not. We were up a little bit sequentially. But what we hear from our customers for the fourth quarter is clearly that it will be down, and that's why I talked about an outlook of being down about 20%. We'll see how the year comes. It's a very difficult time period. I would - where if you call it an unprecedented disruption in demand in that market, because this demand that is disrupted, not just because of production problems but the end customers are just not using the product right now. And you just look at any area of the travel industry, and you do not have demand. And how that ultimately filters through to the aircraft unit demand going forward, I think it's too early to tell. Regardless, our team will be ready. We continue to support our customers around the world. And ultimately, one day, there will be a recovery in this demand, and our team will be well positioned to take cover. Until such time, you can bet that everybody working in commercial air in Amphenol is doing what they have to do, to deal with lower volumes, cutting cost, reallocating resources, re-dedicating technologies to other markets, all the sort of standard playbook of an Amphenol Entrepreneurial General Manager, and they're doing that in spades right now.\nOperator: Our next question is from Joseph Spak from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nJoseph Spak: Wanted to dive a little bit deeper into high-voltage connectors for electric vehicles, because clearly, you've - you've mentioned that a tailwind for you and we're now seeing more programs coming to market and even more being quoted. So now that you have a little bit more experience here, can you break down what the source of that tailwind? And is it the number of connectors going up or is it - is it the same number of connectors but a higher dollar content or is it both or any additional color you can provide on that now that we're deeper into the electrification move would be helpful?\nAdam Norwitt: Sure. Well, thanks very much, Joe. Look, I think, we've talked about it, I know many others have talked about the fact that the interconnect architecture and electric vehicle is very, very different from that, which is in a typical internal combustion engine vehicle, and that starts with the reality that you're moving power around the car at very high voltage and that requires a degree of technology in the interconnect that is just very different than what one saw in traditional cars. And when you have a more complex technology, when you have a technology that carries with it more risk that it has to be a good connector. Of course, that's going to - that's going to have an implication that that product should have. All things being equal, more value to it. Now is every electric car design the same? No. Is every hybrid car design the same? No. Is every internal combustion engine car design the same? For sure, not. And so, you can't say a specific model is going to have X more content than another specific model, but all things being equal, the interconnect system inside an EV car can have more value. Is that because there is more connectors while there's certainly more high-voltage connectors and those high-voltage connectors, again in general, should have greater technology embedded in them than a typically low voltage connector or cable assembly that goes into a car. So I think that that's - it's a pretty straightforward actually dynamic. Now the real rubber meets the road, so to speak, in - are you working with the breadth of customers, do you have the right technology, do you have that proven track record in high voltage products, maybe not in cars, for example, in industrial, in military like we do, and do you have the relationships with customers where you can promote those products to those customers? I think there, our team has done a really good job of that, and they've done a good job really in all the regions to make sure that customers understand that great legacy that Amphenol has in high voltage products outside of the automotive industry, coupled with our ability to service the automotive industry which has its unique requirements in terms of fulfilling the demand of customers. So I think it's a very positive for the long-term for the company, and I think we've been taking good advantage of that also here in the relatively shorter term.\nOperator: Next question is from Chris Snyder from UBS. Your line is open.\nChris Snyder: Can you impact the auto segment a bit? You reported sales up nearly 80% sequentially, and while auto production is recovering quite sharply, it seems like you guys outperformed production by a pretty wide margin during the quarter. So was this outgrowth the reflection of maybe low OEM component inventories at the start of the quarter, share gains from Amphenol or maybe potential inventory building by the OEMs during the quarter as there could be concerns of another COVID supply chain disruption as we head into the winter?\nAdam Norwitt: Yes, Thanks so much. Look, I don't know about the inventory that you mentioned. It doesn't appear to me that there is a massive amount of inventory being built. Was there low dealer inventory coming into the quarter? For sure. And is that driving automakers to try to ramp up their production levels? I think that's very, very clear. Did our team to a great job to react to the demand that was put upon us by our customers? I think they did. But look, I think, it's all too early to say what the overall market is going to be here. I don't pay much heat to the various consultant reports that are put out there. I think we'll see it when we see it what the overall demand is. But this is an industry that really just shut down almost for a quarter, at least for a month or two in that quarter, and restarting into an environment where there seems to be some end demand for cars. People want to have cars and trucks and SUVs, and all of those things. And so, I think it's natural that there is a desire to quickly ramp back up and how much of our gain came because of end volumes, how much came because of share gains, how much came because of readjusting to more normalized inventory levels, it's hard for us to know what the various components of that would be.\nOperator: Our next question is from Craig Hettenbach from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nCraig Hettenbach: Yes, thank you. Adam, could you discuss just the M&A environment, I mean, certainly this year there's been a lot of external factors for Amphenol targets to navigate around as well as internally. So just how you're seeing things today, and as business does start to kind of stabilize a bit, does that change in terms of what could be actionable from an M&A perspective?\nAdam Norwitt: Yes, thanks very much, Craig. I think we've talked about this during the more acute phases of the pandemic. And what for us has been a real advantage is, we view M&A as a very long-term process of developing and incubating relationships, keeping in touch, developing a sense of mutual trust and awareness with companies that we would be interested one day in inviting into the Amphenol family. And because of that, we've been able to do that even with the social distancing and the inability to travel. And so, our pipeline remains very strong. The relationships with the companies that we've been developing for a long time remain very robust and current. But at the same time, I think, if you're an entrepreneur, and you are - you may think twice about selling in an environment like this, because there is still a lot of uncertainty. And so, the fact that we've completed this year just two acquisitions, they are both relatively small. Last year, you know, we completed nine acquisitions, it's not surprising given that we're in a kind of once in a lifetime pandemic right now. I fully believe that as the world normalizes, whatever normal shall be, that our acquisition program will remain a really strong value creator for the company. And the fact of our performance during the pandemic, the resilience of Amphenol, our ability to capitalize on opportunities to manage through this pandemic in a way that we have becomes only a great asset in those discussions that we continue to have with potential acquisition targets and makes Amphenol incrementally a more attractive home for these companies, for their organizations. And so long-term, I actually think this might turn to a positive in terms of the wherewithal that we have to ultimately complete these acquisitions. Now when are we going to close on the next acquisition? You know well, I'm woefully unable to predict that. There are so many factors that go into when somebody ultimately signs on the dotted line, but I'm confident that over the long-term, this will be a real great part of how Amphenol grows. Over the long-term, acquisitions have represented roughly a third of our growth and we see no reason to think that that should change going forward.\nOperator: Our next question is from Shawn Harrison from Loop Capital. Your line is open.\nShawn Harrison: Clarifications, if I may, and then just a question on kind of the bookings linearity. Does the guidance reflect any kind of incremental entity list headwinds for Amphenol? And then on the bookings linearity, if you could just kind of talk about the upside you saw, was it's something where it spiked mid quarter, end of quarter, then tailed off into October, just kind of how linear the quarter was after you guys initially guided during July?\nCraig Lampo: Yes, I mean, look relative to the end of the list, I think as we said a year ago, it's not that like on one day, May 19th, everything shut off. And so, there is a process of this that over time the impact can grow a little bit, and I think we continue to see that relative to the linearity of the quarter. Look, I think it shouldn't come as a terrible surprised that as we got farther from the acute phase of the pandemic which was really in the second quarter that there was some strengthening over the course of the quarter. And typically in the third quarter, September would be a really strong month, and I think this year was not different from other years in the respect that the quarter finished a bit stronger than it started.\nOperator: Our next question is from Deepa Raghavan from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nDeepa Raghavan: My question is on buyback. It looks like some of the deal potential - Adam, based on your comments, it looks like some of the deals potential is being pushed out, which then clearly leave some room for further buybacks to happen perhaps even above trend. Can you comment on that? Plus, Craig, you mentioned there is - the majority of this $1.5 billion in cash is held outside the U.S., can you help us understand how much is in the U.S. and how that can influence share buybacks - share buyback potential? And also if you don't mind, please comment on how much cash you need for operations? Thank you.\nCraig Lampo: Yes, thanks Deepa. I would - just to the point of that cash, I would say in the U.S. and how that impacts our buybacks, I would say, it really doesn't have any impact on what buybacks we do. We have plenty of liquidity in the U.S., outside of the U.S. So it really has no impact on our buyback rhythm. In terms of the amount of cash we have, and whether or not doing less M&A or more M&A has an impact on our buybacks, I mean, honestly, I would say that we have a pretty strong balance sheet, a very strong balance sheet. We've had a very strong balance sheet for a long time. I would say that regardless of the M&A that we've had over a period of time, we've been able to have a pretty balanced capital deployment rhythm in regards to share - return of capital to shareholders and our M&A. We always say that we prefer to do M&A, to the extent possible, but the reality is, is that we are able to typically do all of the three because of such a strong balance sheet, the amount of cash flow we generate. We generated almost $1 billion of free cash flow this year. So I wouldn't say that, you know, doing less M&A is necessarily going to have us accelerate our buyback. We've done 1.6 billion out of the 2 billion under our buyback program. So we're well on track to finish our buyback program in the allotted time, which certainly were on phase four. So I wouldn't necessarily say that we would per se accelerate that. M&A will continue to be a significant part of our strategy as Adam just mentioned. The timing is certainly unpredictable and - but there is no doubt that we have a great pipeline and we have certainly the capital to fund it.\nOperator: Next question is from Steven Fox from Fox Advisors. Your line is open.\nSteven Fox: Adam, I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about the industrial market guidance that you gave. I understand the conservatism, but the strength in Q3 was really good. I think it was better than you thought and it was so broad. Why the slight decline is in terms of expectations for Q4? Thanks.\nAdam Norwitt: Yes. Thanks so much Steve. I mean, look, no doubt about it. Third quarter for our industrial market was really strong and it came on the heels of a second quarter that also surpassed our expectations. And you'll remember in the second quarter, the real driver was the strength in medical. In this quarter, it was more broad, including medical, but not only including medical. And so, it was really quite a bit outperforming. We anticipate that we came into the third quarter anticipating that sales would actually be a little bit down on a sequential basis, and in fact, they grew by 11%. So it's a very, very strong outperformance. And as we look into the fourth quarter, in the fourth quarter traditionally, there can be some seasonal moderation in the industrial market in certain years, together with the fact that we had this very, very strong surge in demand, in particular, related to medical in the second and third quarters. I think it's very natural that there would be a slight easing of that into the fourth quarter. But all that being said, even with this outlook in the fourth quarter, on a year-over-year basis, we would expect to be growing in a pretty strong fashion in the fourth quarter and then our full year outlook still to grow in the low double digits, is a very, very strong outlook for a year where you had a global pandemic, which did have certain impacts on the overall industrial market. And it's a credit to our team to really quickly redeploy our resources on interconnect products, value add interconnect and sensors to those areas of the industrial market where there was indeed strength this year. It's interesting. I look into the third quarter, you know we service, I don't know, it's like a dozen or so different end segments of the industrial market. And I talked about the ones that were up, but we had also some that were down. I mean, you can imagine that a segment like an oil and gas was not very strong here in the third quarter. We had other areas that were also not very strong in the third quarter, but those were more than offset by the really excellent demand that we saw in the segments that I already discussed. So I think it's a very favorable outlook actually for the fourth quarter and for the full year, and we're just really pleased with how our team working in the industrial market has capitalized on the breadth of opportunities, some of which were really unexpected as we came into 2020.\nOperator: Our next question is from William Stein from Truist Securities. Your line is open.\nWilliam Stein: Thanks, and thanks for squeezing me in. Adam, I'm hoping, you know we can address the mobile networks and market. We normally think of Amphenol as a company that finds growth even when the end markets aren't exhibiting it. And this is an end market that's gone through some changes in the last couple of years with the roll out of 5G. Last year, there was a pretty big roll out. This year, there was as well, and yet we're seeing last year revenue was flat in this end market, this year we're looking at down double-digits. Is there something that's preventing the company from exhibiting it's sort of normal pattern of finding growth even if it's - even if end markets aren't cooperating either a change in who you can and can't sell to or the change in technology that works against you in some way? Thanks for any update in this area.\nAdam Norwitt: Thanks so much, Will. Look, I think the easiest explanation and the simplest thing here is, if you look at this year and last year, what has been the biggest change that has impacted and that's when we've talked about it are in fact that there are some customers who we traditionally sold to, who this year we are selling less to and even into the latter part of last year we were selling less to, and this is related to the Department of Commerce restrictions on the certain entities in China that we've talked about. I think that's the biggest story here. Now on an overall basis is capital spending with our operator customers, for example, going up or going down, yes, it remains to be seen for the year, but I think there is one thing which is that as we got into the pandemic, there was a rush to expand bandwidth. And I think in certain respects that rush to expand bandwidth came at the expense of the capacity and coverage that oftentimes is a bigger driver of just the end nodes of the mobile network investment which can drive our mobile networks business. And so, when you look at the growth that we've had in IT datacom, for example, some of that growth is coming ultimately from customers who also manage and build wireless networks in support of the bandwidth of their core networks, because people are working from home, they're studying from home, they're soaking up bandwidth that maybe was not expected, for sure, it was not expected. And so, I think that there is some of that dynamic. But the biggest and probably the most simple explanation to what you've described is, in fact, those Department of Commerce restrictions. And as we head into next year, I think that our team remains very confident in our position with customers around the world. We have strong position on next generation equipment, and we'll see how it goes, and we'll try to give a good assessment of this market as we come into - as we come into 2021. But no doubt, I mean, this has been a little bit more of a challenging market for us here in this year because of those - because of those factors that we've discussed.\nOperator: Our next question is from David Kelley from Jefferies. Your line is open.\nDavid Kelley: Maybe just stepping back from the end market specific discussions. I was curious if you could talk about just broadly what you're seeing as it relates to demand and order patterns in China? Are we fully back of, let's call it, pre-COVID levels across your exposures in the region today?\nAdam Norwitt: Yes, it's a great question. I would say that our performance in Asia, in general, in China being the largest factor for us in Asia, and for most in Asia, was really outstanding in the third quarter on a year-over-year basis. And so, I would say, back to pre-COVID and beyond in terms of the demand levels that we've seen. And I think that's true in the industrial market, I think that's true in the automotive market, I think that's true in the communications markets, all with the caveat related to the question that we will just ask relative to mobile networks and the restricted entities list. But beyond that, I would say that we've seen just great demand, and it is amazing. Craig and I, we have a lot of calls and now we do Zoom calls or Teams or Google Meetings or all of these different video calls with our customers - with our team, and you do that with people in China now and they're all sitting around the conference room together, nobody is wearing masks, because the virus is essentially not there. It is being kind of stopped at the border through a very rigorous approach to quarantining and testing. And so, I think that that has allowed, in particular China, to kind of get back to normal. People are going to movies, people are going to grocery stores, people are buying cars, people are riding on planes and trains, and all of this. And we see that on our computer screens, and I would be lying if I said I didn't have a little bit of jealousy to watch a group of 10 people sitting around the conference room table like we used to be here, but that will come here again. We will get there in other parts of the world as well, but it started earlier in China. We are actually two days from now we'll be exactly nine months since Wuhan was shutdown, how time does fly here in 2020. And we all know how tough that was in China in the first quarter, shutting everything down, every one of our 50 factories, every one of our than 35,000 people stuck at home for three weeks, the rigor with which the reopening happened, and we talked it back in the - at the end of the first quarter and the second quarter, how proud we were of the speed with which our team was able to implement measures to protect people and thereby secure a more rapid reopening of our operations. And I think now, here we are, nine months later, and things are relatively back to normal in China, and that includes the demand environment. And I'm very proud of our team working in China. All of them are local. And that's one thing I just want to emphasize once again. How we participate in every market where we work around the world is with local organizations, people who are from that country to whom we give full authority, we see to them the entrepreneurial authority to make appropriate decisions for their business on a day-to-day basis, that becomes even more critical in a year like this, where we cannot fly in and out of China, we can't go hold people's hands. We have to sort of talk to them on video calls, communicate with them as best that we can, but then have confidence that they are making the right decisions to capitalize on whatever opportunities are there in the market. And here's where the unique structure of Amphenol, I think, has shown its extraordinary agility and strength that in that place where the world has become more normal. We have an extraordinary team of dedicated individuals who can make decisions on the ground to capitalize on success and to deal with challenges. And that is in its essence, one of the key values. And the really the pillars of why Amphenol has been successful for many, many decades.\nOperator: Our next question - and our last question rather for today is from Joe Giordano from Cowen. Your line is open.\nJoe Giordano: Thanks for sneaking me in here. Most of what I want to ask is, I think, over here, but I'm curious, Adam, understanding the nature of your military business and why the shift towards tactical and why you guys are able to kind of grow so fast - so much faster than budgets, how does that though process change or does it not change and how do you think about the sizing of your business potentially out of couple of years in a different administration?\nAdam Norwitt: Yes, I mean, look, I think the - our strength in military and its root comes from two things. Number one, it comes from the fact that we have the deepest and broadest array of technologies in the industry, there is no doubt about it. I mean, we are the leader in this industry, we have been in this industry for 100 years, us or our predecessor companies, and that strength that we have across all product technologies is so critical. But the second piece of it is our ability to execute. And I talked about that earlier. The fact that last year we were able to execute on a really almost unprecedented increase in demand, 23% sales growth last year that we were able to continue to support our customers even with all of the disruptions that we saw in the second quarter. And as we look at the broader military market, the defense market, I think, you alluded to a shift to tactical. I would actually say a shift from tactical, because I've talked about this for quite a while now that the militaries of the world, and whether that's in our country or in the allies of the U.S. and other countries, there was, for many years, a focus on this kind of whack-a-mole of catching stateless actors. And that was a very tactical move, which didn't require necessarily significant investments in military technology that I think has changed quite significantly, and we've seen that change happening slowly and maybe one could even say that this year that change has even a little bit accelerated where the real concern for militaries, those that we work with has become a much more strategic concern. And at the end of the day, strategic military tension leads to the adoption of technology. You're not dealing with trying to hunt down a terrorist needle in a haystack, rather you're trying to create defense systems, aggressive systems, whatever those may be to do battle with very formidable and known adversaries. And I think in that case, the real asset that the military takes advantage of is technology. And so, look, I'm not going to prognosticate about what elections are going to matter and which countries and how that's going to ultimately directly or indirectly affect military budgets. But what is for sure is that the geopolitical world that we are in today, it's a different one than we were in five years ago and certainly 10 years ago. And it's one that I believe is more reliant disproportionately on the innovations of our military customers and thereby our ability to enable those innovations with next generation technologies. So regardless of what election results come, I actually feel good about the prospects for our business in the military market because of our unique position there. And we'll see, we are reactive, we are agile in that market, and we'll deal with whatever comes our way. But I think the geopolitics of the moment and which have been building actually create a more favorable environment. Very good. Well, Joe, thank you for your last question. And I would like to just take this opportunity to thank everybody for your time and your attention to Amphenol today. And most importantly, since we won't get a chance to talk to most of you until 2021, unbelievably, I do want to wish everybody that you should stay safe and continue to stay vigilant as we come into the fall. We need you all healthy, and I wish you, your family, your friends and your communities, all the best as we come into the fall and winter season. And we look forward to speaking to all of you again in the new year. Thanks so much to everybody.\nCraig Lampo: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you, speakers. And thank you all for attending today's conference. And have a nice day.",

            "name": "Craig Lampo",
            "content": "Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. This is Craig Lampo, Amphenol's CFO, and I'm here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO. We would like to welcome you to our third quarter 2020 conference call. As a reminder, during the call, we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures and may make certain forward-looking statements, so please refer to the relevant disclosures in our press release for further information. The company closed the third quarter with record sales of $2,323 million, and record GAAP and adjusted diluted EPS of $1.12 and $1.09 respectively. Sales were up 11% in U.S. dollars and up 10% in local currencies compared to the third quarter of 2019. Sales in the third quarter increased by 9% organically, and sequentially, sales were up 17% in U.S. dollars and 15% in local currencies inorganically. Breaking down sales into our two segments, the interconnect business which comprised 96% of our sales was up 11% in U.S. dollars and 10% in local currencies compared to the third quarter of last year. Our cable business which comprised 4% of our sales, was up 2% in U.S. dollars and 5% in local currencies compared to the third quarter of last year. Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes. Operating income was $476 million in the third quarter of 2020. Operating margins were 20.5%, which was up a very strong 250 basis points sequentially, and up 80 basis points compared to the third quarter of 2019. The strong sequential improvement in margins reflected a healthy conversion on the higher sales levels, as well as an expected significant reduction in the impact of COVID-related costs. The year-over-year improvement in operating margin reflected a strong conversion on the higher sales levels. From a segment standpoint, in the interconnect segment, margins were 22.4% in the third quarter of 2020, which increased from 21.7% in the third quarter of 2019, and 20% in the third quarter - in the second quarter of 2020. In the cable segment, margins were 10.7%, which increased from 10.2% in the third quarter of 2019, and 9.4% in the second quarter of 2020. Given the unprecedented challenges related to the COVID-19 pandemic, we are extremely proud of this quarter's performance. Our team's ability to manage through all the impacts of this crisis is a direct result of the strength and commitment of the company's entrepreneurial management team, which continues to foster a high performance action oriented culture and which has enabled us to capitalize on opportunities and maximize profitability in an uncertain market environment. Interest expense for the quarter was $28 million, which was down from $30 million in the third quarter of last year. The company's GAAP effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2020, including an excess tax benefit of $11 million associated with stock option exercises during the quarter was 22.1% compared to 24.5% in the third quarter of 2019. Excluding the excess tax benefit just mentioned, the company's adjusted effective tax rate was 24.5% for both the third quarter of 2020 and 2019. Adjusted net income of $336 million was 14% of sales in the third quarter of 2020, another confirmation of the strength of the company's financial performance. On a GAAP basis, diluted EPS increased by 22% at $1.12 in the third quarter of 2020 compared to $0.92 in the third quarter of 2019. Adjusted diluted EPS increased by 15% to $1.09 in the third quarter of 2020 from $0.95 in the third quarter of 2019. Orders for the quarter were $2,275 million, which was up 9% compared to the third quarter of 2019, and up 15% sequentially, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 0.98 to 1. The company continues to be an excellent generator of cash, cash flow from operations with a strong $398 million in the third quarter or 119% of adjusted net income. Our free cash flow was $330 million or 98% of adjusted net income. From a working capital standpoint, inventory and accounts receivable and accounts payable were $1.4 billion, $1.9 billion, and $1.1 billion, respectively at the end of September. And inventory days, days sales outstanding and payable days were 79, 72 and 61 days, respectively. All improved from the second quarter levels and all within our normal range. During the third quarter, our cash flow from operations of $398 million, along with proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $104 million were used primarily to repurchase 1.9 million shares of the company's stock for $202 million or an average price of $108, fund dividend payments of $75 million, fund net capital expenditures of $68 million, fund acquisitions of $50 million and fund net purchases of short-term investments of $9 million. As mentioned in today's earnings release, the company's Board of Directors has approved a 16% increase in the quarterly dividend on the company's common stock from $0.25 to $0.29 per share. This increase is effective for payments beginning in January of 2021. At September 30, cash and short-term investments were $1.5 billion, the majority of which is held outside of the U.S. Total debt at September 30 was $3.8 billion with no maturities before the third quarter of 2021 and net debt at September 30 was $2.4 billion. Total cash on hand, plus the remaining availability under our credit facilities was $4 billion at the end of the quarter. And third quarter EBITDA was $568 million and our pro forma net leverage ratio was 1.2 times. I will now turn it back to Adam who will provide some commentary on current trends. Yes. And Wamsi just a short answer to your second question. I mean, it's hard enough to forecast mobile devices and learn to forecast it based on the individual components of it. I wouldn't think anything is categorically different in the fourth quarter than the third quarter, but it - we have - anyway it's a hard time to forecast it in general. So I wouldn't get too far out ahead of myself in saying which individual segments are going to be strong in the fourth quarter. Yes, I mean, look relative to the end of the list, I think as we said a year ago, it's not that like on one day, May 19th, everything shut off. And so, there is a process of this that over time the impact can grow a little bit, and I think we continue to see that relative to the linearity of the quarter. Look, I think it shouldn't come as a terrible surprised that as we got farther from the acute phase of the pandemic which was really in the second quarter that there was some strengthening over the course of the quarter. And typically in the third quarter, September would be a really strong month, and I think this year was not different from other years in the respect that the quarter finished a bit stronger than it started. Yes, thanks Deepa. I would - just to the point of that cash, I would say in the U.S. and how that impacts our buybacks, I would say, it really doesn't have any impact on what buybacks we do. We have plenty of liquidity in the U.S., outside of the U.S. So it really has no impact on our buyback rhythm. In terms of the amount of cash we have, and whether or not doing less M&A or more M&A has an impact on our buybacks, I mean, honestly, I would say that we have a pretty strong balance sheet, a very strong balance sheet. We've had a very strong balance sheet for a long time. I would say that regardless of the M&A that we've had over a period of time, we've been able to have a pretty balanced capital deployment rhythm in regards to share - return of capital to shareholders and our M&A. We always say that we prefer to do M&A, to the extent possible, but the reality is, is that we are able to typically do all of the three because of such a strong balance sheet, the amount of cash flow we generate. We generated almost $1 billion of free cash flow this year. So I wouldn't say that, you know, doing less M&A is necessarily going to have us accelerate our buyback. We've done 1.6 billion out of the 2 billion under our buyback program. So we're well on track to finish our buyback program in the allotted time, which certainly were on phase four. So I wouldn't necessarily say that we would per se accelerate that. M&A will continue to be a significant part of our strategy as Adam just mentioned. The timing is certainly unpredictable and - but there is no doubt that we have a great pipeline and we have certainly the capital to fund it. Thank you."

            "name": "Adam Norwitt",
            "content": "Well, Craig, thank you very much, and I'd like to extend my welcome to everybody here today at the time of our third quarter earnings release. And first and foremost, I hope that all of you on the call here today, together with your family, your friends and your colleagues are staying safe and healthy throughout the pandemic. As Craig mentioned, I'm going to highlight some of our achievements in the third quarter, and most importantly, discuss the trends and progress across our served markets. I'll then make a few comments on our outlook for the fourth quarter as well as for the full year of 2020. With respect to the third quarter, and amidst what has been clearly an unprecedented and volatile year, I'm truly proud that we at Amphenol achieved record sales and adjusted earnings per share in the third quarter, realizing level significantly above our guidance that we issued just 90 days ago. Sales reached $2,323 million, an increase from prior year of 11% in U.S. dollars, 10% in local currencies, and 9% organically. The strong growth was driven by increases in mobile devices, IT datacom, industrial, military, broadband and the automotive markets, and was offset partially by declines in the commercial air and mobile networks markets. We are particularly proud to have achieved a very robust 17% sequential growth from the second quarter which was significantly higher than our original expectations. As Craig mentioned, the company booked $2,275 million in orders and that represented a book-to-bill of 0.98 to 1. Now despite experiencing some continued operational challenges related to the pandemic, we generated excellent operating margins of 20.5% in the third quarter, and this was a full 250 basis point increase from our second quarter levels. Just want to say that the company's financial position remains extremely strong, with our operating cash flow of $398 million, and that was particularly notable given the stronger than expected sequential growth from the second quarter. And we continue to leverage that financial strength to return capital to our shareholders, both through our repurchase last quarter of 1.9 million shares of the company's stock, as well as the Board of Directors' approval of a 16% increase in our quarterly dividend that we are announcing today. I'm extremely proud of the Amphenol team. No question in my mind that the record results this quarter clearly demonstrate the true value of the agility, the discipline, and the drive of our entrepreneurial organization. Now turning to the trends across our served markets, I would just comment that as we've seen this year so far, Amphenol's balanced and broad end market diversification is a uniquely valuable asset, especially in times of heightened economic uncertainty. As many of our markets began to recover in the third quarter, we were able to quickly capitalize on the growth opportunities in those markets, while still retaining our broad exposure to new opportunities and new technology developments across all areas of the electronics industry. The military market represented 12% of our sales in the third quarter. Sales in this market increased by 6% from prior year, driven in particular by growth in military vehicles, naval, space, communications and airframe applications. Sequentially, our sales increased by a strong 30% as we recovered from the impact of production restrictions that hit certain of our facilities related to government measures implemented in the second quarter to control the COVID-19 pandemic. Looking into the fourth quarter, we expect sales to increase slightly from these levels, and for the full year of 2020, we expect a low single-digit increase in sales from prior year. This full year performance reflects our leading market position and strong execution, offset in part by the impact of the pandemic related production restrictions we experienced in the first half of 2020. I'm very proud of our team working in the military market around the world. They have maintained a singular focus on ensuring that our defense industry customers have uninterrupted access to our leading high technology interconnect products which are - which are critical to our customers' equipment. We are encouraged both by the accelerating adoption of electronics in these systems together with the overall favorable defense spending environment. The investments that we've made over the last several years in both new technologies and the capabilities to produce them at volume have positioned us very strongly to be able to capitalize on these trends for many years to come. The commercial aerospace market represented 2% of our sales in the third quarter. Sales were down by 40%, a very significant level, as the commercial aircraft market once again experienced unprecedented declines in demand for new aircraft due to the pandemic related disruptions to the global travel industry. Sequentially, our sales were a bit better than expected, rising 4% from the second quarter. As we look ahead though, we expect the commercial air market to continue to be negatively impacted by the significant reduction in demand for air travel, which is occurring around the world. Accordingly, we expect an approximately 20% sequential reduction in our sales to this market in the fourth quarter. And for the full year 2020, we expect a roughly 35% decline from prior year due to the unprecedented demand disruptions that our customers are experiencing. No question that these are difficult times for the entire travel industry and that that's having a serious impact on the market for commercial airplanes in the near term. Nevertheless, our team remains committed to leveraging the company's strong technology position across a wide array of aircraft platforms and next generation systems integrated into those airplanes, and we remain well positioned when this market eventually does return to growth. The industrial market represented 22% of our sales in the quarter, and our sales to the industrial market exceeded our expectations, increasing by 21% in U.S. dollars and 18% organically, a very strong performance. This robust growth was driven especially by the instrumentation, medical, industrial battery, heavy equipment, alternative energy and rail mass transit segments, really a broad base of growth that we saw in the industrial market. Although we had expected sales to be modestly lower than the second quarter, we actually realized 11% sequential growth during the third quarter, a very strong performance. Looking into the fourth quarter, we expect a modest decline from these third quarter sales levels. Nevertheless, for the full year 2020, we expect a low double-digit increase in sales from 2019 levels, an outstanding performance given the overall market environment. I'm truly proud of our team working in the industrial market, whether enabling the growth in volumes of a wide array of medical equipment, managing through significant increases in demand for semiconductor capital equipment or executing on unprecedented demand for next generation batteries, our global organization has reacted quickly to ensure that our customers around the world are fully supported regardless of the many operational challenges that have arisen throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. As we look towards the long-term, I'm confident that our performance through this crisis has positioned us very strongly for the future. And importantly, we continue to drive our leading development of next generation interconnect sensor and antenna products in support of our customers in the industrial market, who in turn are accelerating their adoption of next generation technologies. The automotive market represented 17% of our sales in the third quarter. After a truly challenging second quarter during which the global automotive industry was deeply impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, we were very pleased to have seen a very strong recovery here in the third quarter, with results much better than we had originally anticipated coming into the quarter. Our team's outstanding execution led to an increase in sales from prior year by 4% in U.S. dollars and 1% organically, well ahead of our expectations. Sequentially, our sales increased by truly significant 78% from the second quarter, as our team was able to execute quickly on a recovery in demand from automotive customers in all regions. Looking now into the fourth quarter, we expect automotive sales to further increase in the mid-single digits from these levels. For the full year 2020, we expect a low double-digit reduction in sales, which does reflect the severe and sudden pandemic-related downturn and demand from automotive OEMs that we saw in the first half. I'm extremely proud of our team working in the automotive market, who has clearly demonstrated, both agility and resiliency in realizing the strong sequential growth levels. In fact, our performance through this crisis makes me even more confident in our long-term prospects in the automotive market. We've continued to expand our range of interconnect sensor and antenna products, both organically and through acquisitions, all with the goal of enabling a wide array of onboard electronics across a diversified range of vehicles made by auto manufacturers around the world. This consistent strategy will no doubt continue to benefit us as the automotive market recovers. The mobile devices market represented 16% of our sales in the quarter and our sales to mobile device customers increased by a stronger than expected 25% from prior year, driven in particular by increased sales of products incorporated into laptops, tablets and wearables, and this was offset in part by slightly lower year-over-year sales to smartphones. Sequentially, our sales increased by a much stronger than expected 37%, and this was driven by higher sales across all the products that we serve. Looking to the fourth quarter, we expect a slight increase from these already strong third quarter levels, and for the full year, we anticipate sales to grow in the low double digits from 2019. And I would just note that this is well above our original expectations as we came into the year before we were hit with the pandemic. While mobile devices will always remain one of our most volatile markets, our outstanding agile team is poised as always to capture any opportunities for incremental sales that may arise here in the fourth quarter or beyond. Our leading array of antennas, interconnect products and mechanisms continue to enable a broad range of next generation mobile devices, and this positions us well for the long-term. The mobile networks market represented 6% of our sales in the quarter, and sales decreased as we had expected from prior year by 19% in U.S. dollars and 21% organically, driven by lower sales to wireless operators, as well as some continued impact from the U.S. government restrictions on certain Chinese entities that we have previously discussed. On a sequential basis, our sales reduced by 9% on overall lower spending by both operators and OEMs. Looking into the fourth quarter, we expect a further seasonal sales reduction of approximately 25% related to both OEMs and service providers. And for the full year, we expect a high teens reduction in sales, which reflects the impact of the U.S. government restrictions, as well as the COVID-19 pandemic. Regardless of the near-term challenges in the mobile networks market, we're confident in the company's long-term position in this important and exciting industry. Our team continues to work aggressively to expand our opportunity with next generation equipment and networks. As customers ramp up investment of these advanced systems, we look forward to benefiting from the increased potential that comes from our unique position with both equipment manufacturers and mobile service providers around the world. The information technology and data communications market represented 21% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in the third quarter once again much better than we had anticipated, rising from prior year by a very strong 24% in U.S. dollars and 21% organically. And this growth was really driven from increased demand for data traffic that continue to prompt both our OEM and service provider customers to increase their demand across virtually all segments of the IT datacom market. Sequentially, sales were down by a less than expected 10% from our extremely strong second quarter. As we look towards the fourth quarter, we expect a mid-teens sequential decline from these very strong third quarter levels, and for the full year 2020, we expect sales to increase in the low teens, reflecting the significant upside in demand we experienced in both the second and third quarters, offset in part by the pandemic-related disruptions we saw in the first quarter. Our team working in support of the IT datacom market has clearly distinguished themselves this year, reacting quickly to capitalize on unprecedented demand for our industry-leading high-speed and power products. At the same time, we've not slowed down our efforts to further develop our broad range of industry-leading interconnect products in support of data communications networks around the world. Indeed, we remain very encouraged by the company's strong technology position in the global IT datacom market. Our customers continue to drive their equipment to ever higher levels of performance in order to manage the dramatic increases in demand for bandwidth and processor power. In turn, our team remains singularly focused on enabling this continuing revolution in IT datacom. The broadband market represented 4% of our sales in the quarter. Sales increased by 5% from prior year, driven by stronger demand for home installation related equipment from broadband operators. On a sequential basis, sales increased by a stronger than expected 13%, as our customers continue to upgrade their networks in support of the increased demand for high-speed data. We expect sales in the fourth quarter to moderate from these levels on typical end of the year seasonality. And for the full year 2020, we expect sales to be roughly flat with prior year, and this reflects the pandemic-related disruptions we experienced in certain geographies, offset by increased investments by our customers in support of higher bandwidth demand. Now turning to our outlook for the future. While our performance in the third quarter was very strong, there still remain significant uncertainties in the global market related to the COVID-19 pandemic, which does appear to be worsening in some regions of the world. Assuming no new material disruptions from the pandemic, as well as constant exchange rates, for the fourth quarter, we expect sales in the range of $2,160 million to $2,200 million, and adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $0.98 to $1. This represents both sales and adjusted diluted EPS growth versus prior year of flat to up 2%. Our fourth quarter guidance also represents an expectation for full year sales of $8,333 million to $8,373 million, and full year adjusted diluted EPS of $3.59 to $3.61. This outlook represents sales growth versus prior year of 1% to 2%, and an adjusted diluted EPS decline of 3% to 4%. The expected decline in our earnings relates directly to the significant cost and disruptions associated with the COVID-19 pandemic that the company faced particularly during the first half of 2020. Now let me just say that I'm extremely pleased by Amphenol's performance in the third quarter, especially our team's achievement of these new quarterly records in both sales and earnings. Most importantly, I remain very confident in the ability of our outstanding management team to adapt to the continued challenges in the marketplace, and to capitalize on the many future opportunities to grow our market position and expand our profitability. I just want to assure you that our entire organization remains committed to fighting hard to secure the company's financial performance, all while dedicating ourselves wholeheartedly to protecting the safety and health of each of our employees around the world. And as a final note, I would just like to take this opportunity here today to thank every one of our Amphenolians around the world for their outstanding efforts here in the third quarter. And with that, operator, we'd be very happy to take any questions. Sure. Well, thank you very much, Amit. Look, I think you listed a few factors, and I think there is a little bit of each of them in the third quarter with maybe the exception that I can't tell you that we saw any inventory build of significance so that we had at least visibility to in the quarter. But no question, in several of our markets, demand was much stronger than we had anticipated. I think we outperformed maybe some of our peers in certain of those areas where we were able to capitalize on the demand in a faster fashion. So you take the example of mobile devices where we came into the quarter expecting a relatively modest sequential growth, and mobile devices is always the market that's very hard to anticipate, but our team drove 37% sequential growth in mobile devices and that came both from volume demands from our customers, but also from the fact that there were instances where our customers couldn't get everything they needed from other folks, and they could get it from us. And I think that's something that we've demonstrated in many years in the past. Our teams have the outstanding agility in reacting to unexpected levels of demand. We clearly did not anticipate coming into the quarter that we would have such significant sequential growth in automotive, and in fact, we have grown on a year-over-year basis in automotive after that just very, very challenging second quarter that we all saw was a real testament again to the agility of our team to satisfy what was unexpected levels of demand. But look - as you look at our guide for the fourth quarter, and I know you, as you mentioned Amit, why does that - what is going on with that guide, we do this as we always have done. We talk to our customers and this is a bottoms-up approach to how we forecast. There are certain markets where there were real surges in demand earlier in the year. IT datacom another example of that, where we've guided IT datacom to be down in kind of the mid-teens in the fourth quarter, it was down a lot less than we anticipated here in the third quarter. There was the real surge in demand for data bandwidth - for bandwidth upgrades and support of data traffic to support all of the work from home and study from home requirements around the world related to the pandemic. And that's normally not a market that would be down by so much in the fourth quarter, but it's also normally not a market that would have grown so much in the second and third quarters. So we've done our best here amidst this environment to take everything that our customers say. We add that up to the outlook that we've given you. And knowing full well that there - we are not out of the woods relative to the pandemic, there is still a pandemic going on. It is in fact worsening in certain areas. And I think our customers are sensitive to that, and our team is prepared if there is some further surprise, further operational challenges that will come, but we think this is actually a very, very strong outlook relative to the extraordinary strength that we saw here in the third quarter. Well, thanks so much, Luke. Look, I think that that shift towards new drivetrains, towards autonomous, other new technologies that are going into the car, I mean, we have continued to see that for many years. I wouldn't necessarily say that we've seen an acute change in the trajectory of that evolution here in 2020 due to COVID. I think what we saw in the third quarter was customers really scrambling to get back into their production levels, and customers probably buying more cars than people anticipated. There seems to have developed some degree of pent-up demand for automotive production. I have heard anecdotes about inventory levels being low, that it's difficult to get a pick-up truck in Michigan and things like this. And I'm sure, Luke, you know you're closer to this market than we are, and you know very well, some of those dynamics. But there's no question that there is real demand from customers and they continue to drive new programs that have been in the pipeline. But is the pandemic itself responsible for a kind of distinct shift, I wouldn't say that is. Now, I would also just add that our team around the world has done a fabulous job in positioning ourselves in these new platforms, while we haven't forsaken the traditional drivetrains, the internal combustion engines, and otherwise, we continue to support our customers who are manufacturing these would still represent the vast majority of vehicles that are being produced around the world. But our team has done such a great job on developing new products, expanding our relationship with customers really in all geographies such that to the extent there is an acceleration of that shift, I think, Amphenol is well positioned to benefit from it. Great. Thanks, Mark. Thanks for the question. No - I mean, no doubt, we are really proud of our ability to achieve these strong operating margins of 20.5% here in the third quarter and 250 basis point improvement over Q2 or 18% and certainly 80 basis points even over the last year when COVID really wasn't a thing. So we're certainly very proud of that. I mean, as I did mention in my prepared remarks, we did have strong conversion on our higher kind of sales levels that certainly had a benefit from a profitability perspective, but it also reflected sequentially our expected reduction in COVID related costs in the quarter. I mean, we certainly still are experiencing some turbulence in the business related to COVID and the cost that that creates, but certainly it is at a much lower level than it was in the first and second quarter. But there is no doubt, there still is some costs that we are experiencing. The team is doing an outstanding job of navigating that and minimizing that to the extent possible, but there are certainly also puts and takes within the P&L. And as an example, there is other costs such as T&E, as an example, that does have some offsetting impact at this lower level of COVID cost. So what I would say is, from a net impact in the third quarter, really that COVID related and kind of these puts and takes, some talking about really didn't have a meaningful impact kind of in the third quarter on our margin. So you mentioned acquisitions - any acquisition impact, I would say that, although we continue to spend time on that, this year, certainly due to the pandemic, we haven't been able to make certainly the progress that we would hope to have made in this year related to some of the acquisitions we acquired in '19. So I wouldn't say that really has had so much of impact in the third quarter either. If you kind of look at year-over-year, it's really more of that leverage on the sales increase. And going forward, I think that I would expect kind of our normal conversion on the upside and downside, you know that 25%, 30% on the downside, which I think I would expect. And that assumes certainly that we don't have this resurgence, you know that of significance in the pandemic. We - always certainly if we do have additional costs, we're going to work hard to continue to mitigate those, but I'm certainly real proud of what the team has done so far to do that and we'll keep an eye on that in the future. But again, real outstanding performance here in the quarter. The team has done a fantastic job of navigating all these things that are happening in the world. Yes, thanks Wamsi. Yes, I would say that, all that differential really is the COVID related costs that we incurred in the first half. And if you kind of look at the first half year-over-year from an EPS versus - perspective and kind of conversion on those sales differentials that really is all the COVID related cost, you know we talked about that in the last couple of quarters. So, yes, as we go into 2021, we're not giving guidance here, but certainly we would expect at least at this point based on the - guidance for Q4 that those costs would not be in there. But again, we talked about a minute ago about these potential resurgences throughout the world, so will give our guidance in January and certainly we'll talk about what we expect there. But it is all COVID related and we're really happy to be kind of at those pre-COVID profitability levels here in the third quarter, and again, proud of what the team has done thus far. Yes, thanks. Thanks so much, Samik. Look, I don't know that anybody is handicapping in their production plan. What a second wave will be, what the magnitude of a second wave can be, and more importantly, what are the consumer reaction to that and what are the governmental reactions to whatever second wave will be. We certainly are not trying to guess across all of those variables what that can be. But as I pointed out in my prepared remarks, we're very sensitive to the fact that there may be further disruptions. And thus, it's not about preparing yourself by saying, well, I'm going to add inventory, subtract inventory or otherwise, it's making sure that your entire organization is on their toes. It is remaining nimble, agile, reactive and prepared physically, psychologically for whatever may come our way. And I think that's where the Amphenol team has really excelled this year. It's not that we guessed which way the trajectory of the pandemic was going to come and thus we were able to achieve these results. It's that we were ready regardless of how it came. And I think the third quarter is just a wonderful indication of that. We didn't come into the quarter anticipating, for example, that mobile devices would grow 37% sequentially or anticipating that automotive would grow 78% sequentially or that our military business would be up 30%. But we were ready in case it were to happen, because our team was able to flex. So what do our customers - how our customers integrating a second wave into their expectations, I actually don't know. Maybe some are, maybe some are not, but how we approach this is we take what our customers tell us, and then we're ready regardless. Are we going to be right at the numbers that we have guided here? Hard to say. That's the best that we can tell right now, but this - if this year has taught us anything, it's to expect the unexpected and to be ready regardless of what comes our way. And I think that's what the Amphenol team, where we sit today here in the third week of October, we're ready for whatever comes along. We continue to prioritize the health of our people. That's been number one by the way throughout this - that's what's enabled us to support our customers, that's what's allowed us to then drive the strong results. And we're going to continue to do that. And if more demand comes, we will satisfy, and if less demand comes, we will react to that as well. Yes, I mean, look, I think what I've always said and I said that last quarter, and I think I probably said it again here this quarter is, this is a hard market to forecast and to the extent that demand is higher than we anticipate, we're very much - our team is very much poised to capitalize upon that, and that's exactly what we did here in the third quarter. And while it's true that on a year-over-year basis, our growth came not from necessarily smartphones, but rather from things like laptops and tablets and wearables and otherwise. In the fourth quarter, it may very well be a different situation. We'll see as it comes. We did grow sequentially across all of those products, including strong double-digit sequential growth in our sales of products that go into smartphones. And so, our team is for sure capitalizing on whatever incremental demand there may be in smartphones. And when we talk about the incremental performance that we had in this quarter, again, growing 37% sequentially instead of just a modest growth, some of that upside was in fact coming also from smartphones even if that didn't represent growth on a year-over-year basis. Thank you, Jim. Sure. Thanks, Jim. Look, one thing I would just say about the book-to-bill, I mean 0.98 to 1 is pretty close to 1. On a year-to-date basis, if you include our very strong book-to-bill that we had in the first quarter, our book-to-bill year-to-date is 1.04 to 1, which is very, very strong compared to maybe other years. But look, does that - what does that mean for the fourth quarter, I think, we've already talked about what the - how we've gone - coming up with our fourth quarter guidance. I think these are strong bookings. They far exceeded what we thought coming into the quarter. And the fact that the book-to-bill is little bit below one is I think just a reflection that some customers placed upon us much stronger orders early in the year and there are some markets where the lead times are a little bit longer, places like military, for example, where we have very substantial order books that were shipping out of, but I wouldn't read anything abnormal into that. I think last year in the third quarter, our book-to-bill was kind of 1 to 1. So considering that this is a year where very little is normal, actually I'd say, a 0.98 to 1 book-to-bill is pretty normal compared to last year when all is said and done. And again, we shipped so strongly in the quarter. And so, the fact that we were able to execute on the backlog that we had. Had we not executed on that, we'd be talking about a positive book-to-bill. And so, I think, these were very strong bookings, but those shipments were even stronger. Thanks very much Matt. Look, I think, on the military side, we clearly had a lot of constraints in the second quarter and that was reflected in our performance in the second quarter. We have to go back a little bit and understand we've been dealing with a very, very robust military market. You'll recall, 2019 we grew 23% in military, which is really substantial in that market. And net 23% in military required us to step up quite significantly our capacity expansions in support of this very, very strong levels of demand. And so, as we came into COVID, there was still strong demand, but then we lost a lot of production in the second quarter because of the various shutdowns in places like the U.S., in places like Mexico, places like India, and otherwise in Europe as well. And getting that back so rapidly is not as easy in the military market, when we were already running at very high levels of capacity. Now I can tell you this, we are supporting our customers in an outstanding fashion. We have not disappointed. We have not let down customers. We're not creating any problems for our customers. But overall, we are running here again in the third quarter at a very high level of production relative to capacity, and there is still significant demand that is out there. So when does that return to growth? I think our outlook for the full year to be in the kind of low single digits is a reflection of strong performance where there is one quarter where we really lost a fair bit of production in that quarter. Now relative to commercial air, I don't - I can't be the one to call a \"bottom here\". We came into this quarter thinking that our sales would sequentially be down, in fact, they were not. We were up a little bit sequentially. But what we hear from our customers for the fourth quarter is clearly that it will be down, and that's why I talked about an outlook of being down about 20%. We'll see how the year comes. It's a very difficult time period. I would - where if you call it an unprecedented disruption in demand in that market, because this demand that is disrupted, not just because of production problems but the end customers are just not using the product right now. And you just look at any area of the travel industry, and you do not have demand. And how that ultimately filters through to the aircraft unit demand going forward, I think it's too early to tell. Regardless, our team will be ready. We continue to support our customers around the world. And ultimately, one day, there will be a recovery in this demand, and our team will be well positioned to take cover. Until such time, you can bet that everybody working in commercial air in Amphenol is doing what they have to do, to deal with lower volumes, cutting cost, reallocating resources, re-dedicating technologies to other markets, all the sort of standard playbook of an Amphenol Entrepreneurial General Manager, and they're doing that in spades right now. Sure. Well, thanks very much, Joe. Look, I think, we've talked about it, I know many others have talked about the fact that the interconnect architecture and electric vehicle is very, very different from that, which is in a typical internal combustion engine vehicle, and that starts with the reality that you're moving power around the car at very high voltage and that requires a degree of technology in the interconnect that is just very different than what one saw in traditional cars. And when you have a more complex technology, when you have a technology that carries with it more risk that it has to be a good connector. Of course, that's going to - that's going to have an implication that that product should have. All things being equal, more value to it. Now is every electric car design the same? No. Is every hybrid car design the same? No. Is every internal combustion engine car design the same? For sure, not. And so, you can't say a specific model is going to have X more content than another specific model, but all things being equal, the interconnect system inside an EV car can have more value. Is that because there is more connectors while there's certainly more high-voltage connectors and those high-voltage connectors, again in general, should have greater technology embedded in them than a typically low voltage connector or cable assembly that goes into a car. So I think that that's - it's a pretty straightforward actually dynamic. Now the real rubber meets the road, so to speak, in - are you working with the breadth of customers, do you have the right technology, do you have that proven track record in high voltage products, maybe not in cars, for example, in industrial, in military like we do, and do you have the relationships with customers where you can promote those products to those customers? I think there, our team has done a really good job of that, and they've done a good job really in all the regions to make sure that customers understand that great legacy that Amphenol has in high voltage products outside of the automotive industry, coupled with our ability to service the automotive industry which has its unique requirements in terms of fulfilling the demand of customers. So I think it's a very positive for the long-term for the company, and I think we've been taking good advantage of that also here in the relatively shorter term. Yes, Thanks so much. Look, I don't know about the inventory that you mentioned. It doesn't appear to me that there is a massive amount of inventory being built. Was there low dealer inventory coming into the quarter? For sure. And is that driving automakers to try to ramp up their production levels? I think that's very, very clear. Did our team to a great job to react to the demand that was put upon us by our customers? I think they did. But look, I think, it's all too early to say what the overall market is going to be here. I don't pay much heat to the various consultant reports that are put out there. I think we'll see it when we see it what the overall demand is. But this is an industry that really just shut down almost for a quarter, at least for a month or two in that quarter, and restarting into an environment where there seems to be some end demand for cars. People want to have cars and trucks and SUVs, and all of those things. And so, I think it's natural that there is a desire to quickly ramp back up and how much of our gain came because of end volumes, how much came because of share gains, how much came because of readjusting to more normalized inventory levels, it's hard for us to know what the various components of that would be. Yes, thanks very much, Craig. I think we've talked about this during the more acute phases of the pandemic. And what for us has been a real advantage is, we view M&A as a very long-term process of developing and incubating relationships, keeping in touch, developing a sense of mutual trust and awareness with companies that we would be interested one day in inviting into the Amphenol family. And because of that, we've been able to do that even with the social distancing and the inability to travel. And so, our pipeline remains very strong. The relationships with the companies that we've been developing for a long time remain very robust and current. But at the same time, I think, if you're an entrepreneur, and you are - you may think twice about selling in an environment like this, because there is still a lot of uncertainty. And so, the fact that we've completed this year just two acquisitions, they are both relatively small. Last year, you know, we completed nine acquisitions, it's not surprising given that we're in a kind of once in a lifetime pandemic right now. I fully believe that as the world normalizes, whatever normal shall be, that our acquisition program will remain a really strong value creator for the company. And the fact of our performance during the pandemic, the resilience of Amphenol, our ability to capitalize on opportunities to manage through this pandemic in a way that we have becomes only a great asset in those discussions that we continue to have with potential acquisition targets and makes Amphenol incrementally a more attractive home for these companies, for their organizations. And so long-term, I actually think this might turn to a positive in terms of the wherewithal that we have to ultimately complete these acquisitions. Now when are we going to close on the next acquisition? You know well, I'm woefully unable to predict that. There are so many factors that go into when somebody ultimately signs on the dotted line, but I'm confident that over the long-term, this will be a real great part of how Amphenol grows. Over the long-term, acquisitions have represented roughly a third of our growth and we see no reason to think that that should change going forward. Yes. Thanks so much Steve. I mean, look, no doubt about it. Third quarter for our industrial market was really strong and it came on the heels of a second quarter that also surpassed our expectations. And you'll remember in the second quarter, the real driver was the strength in medical. In this quarter, it was more broad, including medical, but not only including medical. And so, it was really quite a bit outperforming. We anticipate that we came into the third quarter anticipating that sales would actually be a little bit down on a sequential basis, and in fact, they grew by 11%. So it's a very, very strong outperformance. And as we look into the fourth quarter, in the fourth quarter traditionally, there can be some seasonal moderation in the industrial market in certain years, together with the fact that we had this very, very strong surge in demand, in particular, related to medical in the second and third quarters. I think it's very natural that there would be a slight easing of that into the fourth quarter. But all that being said, even with this outlook in the fourth quarter, on a year-over-year basis, we would expect to be growing in a pretty strong fashion in the fourth quarter and then our full year outlook still to grow in the low double digits, is a very, very strong outlook for a year where you had a global pandemic, which did have certain impacts on the overall industrial market. And it's a credit to our team to really quickly redeploy our resources on interconnect products, value add interconnect and sensors to those areas of the industrial market where there was indeed strength this year. It's interesting. I look into the third quarter, you know we service, I don't know, it's like a dozen or so different end segments of the industrial market. And I talked about the ones that were up, but we had also some that were down. I mean, you can imagine that a segment like an oil and gas was not very strong here in the third quarter. We had other areas that were also not very strong in the third quarter, but those were more than offset by the really excellent demand that we saw in the segments that I already discussed. So I think it's a very favorable outlook actually for the fourth quarter and for the full year, and we're just really pleased with how our team working in the industrial market has capitalized on the breadth of opportunities, some of which were really unexpected as we came into 2020. Thanks so much, Will. Look, I think the easiest explanation and the simplest thing here is, if you look at this year and last year, what has been the biggest change that has impacted and that's when we've talked about it are in fact that there are some customers who we traditionally sold to, who this year we are selling less to and even into the latter part of last year we were selling less to, and this is related to the Department of Commerce restrictions on the certain entities in China that we've talked about. I think that's the biggest story here. Now on an overall basis is capital spending with our operator customers, for example, going up or going down, yes, it remains to be seen for the year, but I think there is one thing which is that as we got into the pandemic, there was a rush to expand bandwidth. And I think in certain respects that rush to expand bandwidth came at the expense of the capacity and coverage that oftentimes is a bigger driver of just the end nodes of the mobile network investment which can drive our mobile networks business. And so, when you look at the growth that we've had in IT datacom, for example, some of that growth is coming ultimately from customers who also manage and build wireless networks in support of the bandwidth of their core networks, because people are working from home, they're studying from home, they're soaking up bandwidth that maybe was not expected, for sure, it was not expected. And so, I think that there is some of that dynamic. But the biggest and probably the most simple explanation to what you've described is, in fact, those Department of Commerce restrictions. And as we head into next year, I think that our team remains very confident in our position with customers around the world. We have strong position on next generation equipment, and we'll see how it goes, and we'll try to give a good assessment of this market as we come into - as we come into 2021. But no doubt, I mean, this has been a little bit more of a challenging market for us here in this year because of those - because of those factors that we've discussed. Yes, it's a great question. I would say that our performance in Asia, in general, in China being the largest factor for us in Asia, and for most in Asia, was really outstanding in the third quarter on a year-over-year basis. And so, I would say, back to pre-COVID and beyond in terms of the demand levels that we've seen. And I think that's true in the industrial market, I think that's true in the automotive market, I think that's true in the communications markets, all with the caveat related to the question that we will just ask relative to mobile networks and the restricted entities list. But beyond that, I would say that we've seen just great demand, and it is amazing. Craig and I, we have a lot of calls and now we do Zoom calls or Teams or Google Meetings or all of these different video calls with our customers - with our team, and you do that with people in China now and they're all sitting around the conference room together, nobody is wearing masks, because the virus is essentially not there. It is being kind of stopped at the border through a very rigorous approach to quarantining and testing. And so, I think that that has allowed, in particular China, to kind of get back to normal. People are going to movies, people are going to grocery stores, people are buying cars, people are riding on planes and trains, and all of this. And we see that on our computer screens, and I would be lying if I said I didn't have a little bit of jealousy to watch a group of 10 people sitting around the conference room table like we used to be here, but that will come here again. We will get there in other parts of the world as well, but it started earlier in China. We are actually two days from now we'll be exactly nine months since Wuhan was shutdown, how time does fly here in 2020. And we all know how tough that was in China in the first quarter, shutting everything down, every one of our 50 factories, every one of our than 35,000 people stuck at home for three weeks, the rigor with which the reopening happened, and we talked it back in the - at the end of the first quarter and the second quarter, how proud we were of the speed with which our team was able to implement measures to protect people and thereby secure a more rapid reopening of our operations. And I think now, here we are, nine months later, and things are relatively back to normal in China, and that includes the demand environment. And I'm very proud of our team working in China. All of them are local. And that's one thing I just want to emphasize once again. How we participate in every market where we work around the world is with local organizations, people who are from that country to whom we give full authority, we see to them the entrepreneurial authority to make appropriate decisions for their business on a day-to-day basis, that becomes even more critical in a year like this, where we cannot fly in and out of China, we can't go hold people's hands. We have to sort of talk to them on video calls, communicate with them as best that we can, but then have confidence that they are making the right decisions to capitalize on whatever opportunities are there in the market. And here's where the unique structure of Amphenol, I think, has shown its extraordinary agility and strength that in that place where the world has become more normal. We have an extraordinary team of dedicated individuals who can make decisions on the ground to capitalize on success and to deal with challenges. And that is in its essence, one of the key values. And the really the pillars of why Amphenol has been successful for many, many decades. Yes, I mean, look, I think the - our strength in military and its root comes from two things. Number one, it comes from the fact that we have the deepest and broadest array of technologies in the industry, there is no doubt about it. I mean, we are the leader in this industry, we have been in this industry for 100 years, us or our predecessor companies, and that strength that we have across all product technologies is so critical. But the second piece of it is our ability to execute. And I talked about that earlier. The fact that last year we were able to execute on a really almost unprecedented increase in demand, 23% sales growth last year that we were able to continue to support our customers even with all of the disruptions that we saw in the second quarter. And as we look at the broader military market, the defense market, I think, you alluded to a shift to tactical. I would actually say a shift from tactical, because I've talked about this for quite a while now that the militaries of the world, and whether that's in our country or in the allies of the U.S. and other countries, there was, for many years, a focus on this kind of whack-a-mole of catching stateless actors. And that was a very tactical move, which didn't require necessarily significant investments in military technology that I think has changed quite significantly, and we've seen that change happening slowly and maybe one could even say that this year that change has even a little bit accelerated where the real concern for militaries, those that we work with has become a much more strategic concern. And at the end of the day, strategic military tension leads to the adoption of technology. You're not dealing with trying to hunt down a terrorist needle in a haystack, rather you're trying to create defense systems, aggressive systems, whatever those may be to do battle with very formidable and known adversaries. And I think in that case, the real asset that the military takes advantage of is technology. And so, look, I'm not going to prognosticate about what elections are going to matter and which countries and how that's going to ultimately directly or indirectly affect military budgets. But what is for sure is that the geopolitical world that we are in today, it's a different one than we were in five years ago and certainly 10 years ago. And it's one that I believe is more reliant disproportionately on the innovations of our military customers and thereby our ability to enable those innovations with next generation technologies. So regardless of what election results come, I actually feel good about the prospects for our business in the military market because of our unique position there. And we'll see, we are reactive, we are agile in that market, and we'll deal with whatever comes our way. But I think the geopolitics of the moment and which have been building actually create a more favorable environment. Very good. Well, Joe, thank you for your last question. And I would like to just take this opportunity to thank everybody for your time and your attention to Amphenol today. And most importantly, since we won't get a chance to talk to most of you until 2021, unbelievably, I do want to wish everybody that you should stay safe and continue to stay vigilant as we come into the fall. We need you all healthy, and I wish you, your family, your friends and your communities, all the best as we come into the fall and winter season. And we look forward to speaking to all of you again in the new year. Thanks so much to everybody."

        "content": "Operator: Hello, and welcome to the Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call for Amphenol Corporation. Following today\u2019s presentation, there will be a formal question-and-answer session. Until then, all lines will remain in a listen-only mode. At the request of the company, today\u2019s conference is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to introduce today\u2019s conference host, Mr. Craig Lampo. Sir, you may begin.\nCraig Lampo: Thank you very much. Good afternoon, everyone. This is Craig Lampo, Amphenol's CFO, and I'm here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO. We would like to welcome you to our second quarter 2020 conference call. As a reminder, during the call, we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures and may make certain forward-looking statements. So please refer to the relevant disclosures in our press release for further information. The company closed the second quarter with sales of $1.987 billion and with GAAP and adjusted diluted EPS of $0.85 and $0.81, respectively. Sales were down 1% in U.S. dollars and were flat in local currencies, compared to the second quarter of 2019. From an organic standpoint, excluding both acquisitions and currency impacts, sales in the second quarter decreased 3%. Sequentially, sales were up 7% in U.S. dollars in local currencies inorganically. Breaking down sales into our two segments. The interconnect business, which comprised 96% of our sales, was down 1% in U.S. dollars and was flat in local currencies compared to last year. Our cable business, which comprised 4% of our sales, was down 1% in U.S. dollars and up 3% in local currencies compared to the second quarter of last year. Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes. Operating income was $357 million in the second quarter of 2020 and operating margins were 18%, which was down 230 basis points, compared to the second quarter of 2019. Similar to last quarter, the year-over-year reduction in operating margin reflected a higher negative conversion rate than our typical 30% downside conversion, due to the continued negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on production and productivity, particularly due to various government restrictions that have limited our ability to adjust costs in certain geographies. Compared to the first quarter of 2020, operating margin increased 100 basis points and reflected a strong sequential conversion margin on the higher sales levels. From a segment standpoint, in the interconnect segment, margins were 20% in the second quarter of 2020, which was down compared to 22.2% in the second quarter of 2019, but up from 19.1% in the first quarter of 2020. In the cable segment, margins were 9.4%, which is down compared to 9.7% in the second quarter of 2019, but up from 7.6% for the first quarter of 2020. Given the continued unprecedented challenges created by the COVID-19 pandemic, we are proud of this quarter's performance. Our team's ongoing ability to minimize the negative margin impact resulting from the crisis is a direct result of the strength and commitment of the company's entrepreneurial management team, which continues to foster a high-performance, action-oriented culture and thereby allows us to capitalize on opportunities and maximize profitability in an uncertain market environment. Interest expense for the quarter was $30 million, which was unchanged compared to the second quarter of last year. The company's adjusted effective tax rate was 24.5% for both the second quarter of 2020 and 2019. The adjusted effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2020 excludes an excess tax benefit of $12 million, associated with the stock option exercises during the quarter. And the adjusted effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2019 excludes the impact of an excess tax benefit associated with stock option exercises during the quarter, partially offset by the tax impact of acquisition-related costs. The company's GAAP effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2020, including the items just mentioned, was 20.7% compared to 21.3% in the second quarter of 2019. Adjusted net income was 12% of sales in the second quarter of 2020, another confirmation of the strength of the company's financial performance. On a GAAP basis, diluted EPS declined by 9% in the second quarter to $0.85 compared to $0.93 in the second quarter of 2019. Adjusted diluted EPS declined 12% to $0.81 in the second quarter of 2020 from $0.92 in the second quarter of 2019. Orders for the quarter were $1.971 billion, which was down 2% compared to the second quarter of 2019 and resulted in a book-to-bill ratio of just under 1:1. Despite the unprecedented challenges in the current environment, the company continues to be an excellent generator of cash. Cash flow from operations was $368 million in the second quarter or 150% of adjusted net income. And net of capital spending of $67 million, our free cash flow was $301 million or 123% of adjusted net income. From a working capital standpoint, inventory, accounts receivable and accounts payable were $1.4 billion, $1.7 billion and $928 million, respectively at the end of June. In inventory days, days sales outstanding and payable days were 89, 74 and 60 days, respectively. While DSO and DPO were both went on a normal range, DSI was slightly elevated. Due to the current crisis we expect inventory days to remain somewhat elevated, but to come back down to more normal levels as business returns to a more typical pattern. During the second quarter, our cash flow from operations of $368 million, along with proceeds from our recently completed bond offering of $543 million, proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $123 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments on hand of $1.1 billion net of translation were used primarily to fund repayments under our various credit facilities of $1.35 billion. Fund repayments of senior notes of $400 million, fund net repayments under our commercial paper programs of $135 million, fund payment of contingent acquisition-related obligations of $75 million, fund dividend payments of $74 million, fund net capital expenditures of $67 million and fund new debt financing cost of $5 million.  As communicated in our April earnings release, due to the significant economic uncertainty and volatility in the credit and capital markets created by the COVID-19 pandemic. In March, the company had proactively borrowed $1.25 billion under our revolving credit facility and reduced our reliance on commercial paper markets. As the credit and capital markets stabilized during the second quarter, we repaid the amounts borrowed under our revolving credit facility with cash on hand, as well as the proceeds from the $500 million and \u20ac500 million bond offering completed in May. As such, as of June 30, 2020, there are no balances outstanding under either our revolving credit facility or our commercial paper programs. As a result, at June 30, cash and short-term investments were $1.3 billion, the majority of which is held outside of the U.S. and total debt at June 30 was $3.8 billion with no maturities before the third quarter of 2021. Net debt at June 30 was $2.5 billion, which decreased from $2.7 billion as of March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019. Total cash on hand, as well as the remaining availability under our credit facilities was $3.8 billion at the end of the quarter, which leaves the company in a very strong liquidity position. The second quarter of 2020 EBITDA was $444 million, and our pro forma net leverage ratio was 1.3 times. In summary, although this continues to be a challenging environment, we finished the quarter in a position of continued financial strength with a very strong balance sheet and liquidity position. We believe this financial strength, coupled with the company's broad market and geographic diversity, positions us well for the currently volatile environment, which is characterized by continued uncertainty across global markets. I will now turn it back over to Adam, who will provide some commentary on current market trends.\nAdam Norwitt: Well, thank you very much, Craig, and allow me to extend my welcome to everybody here on the phone today. And first, I just want to also offer my hope and wishes that for all of you on the call here, that you, your family, your friends, as well as your colleagues have remained safe and healthy over the course of the last quarter. As Craig mentioned, I'm going to highlight some of our achievements in the second quarter. I'm also going to discuss the trends and progress across our sales markets. And then finally, I'll make some comments on our outlook for the third quarter. With respect to the second quarter, as Craig just detailed, our sales reached $1.987 billion, which was a reduction from prior year prior year of just 1% in U.S. dollars, it was actually flat in local currencies and down just 3% organically. And this was driven by reductions in the automotive, commercial air, mobile networks and military markets, which were essentially offset by growth that we saw in the IT datacom, mobile devices and industrial markets. The declines that we saw in the quarter were largely related to the weakness in demand, disruptions and government mandated factory shutdowns that resulted all from the COVID-19 pandemic. We're, in particular, very pleased to have realized 7% sequential growth from the first quarter, which is substantially higher than our original expectations. The company booked $1.971 billion in orders, representing a book-to-bill of just under one to one. And very importantly, despite the significant disruptions to our operations in the quarter related to the pandemic, operating margins reached 18%, a very strong performance given this environment. As Craig just mentioned, Amphenol's financial position remains extremely strong, and that is reflected very well in our operating cash flow of $368 million in the quarter. I just want to say that I'm extremely proud of our team around the world. And our performance this quarter, once again, is a great reflection of the discipline and agility of Amphenol's entrepreneurial organization who has continued to perform well amidst the unprecedented challenges that have arisen throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. We're very pleased in the quarter to announce that we, just last week, closed the acquisition of Onanon, Inc. Onanon is based in California and has annual sales of approximately $20 million, and the company designs and manufactures a wide array of high-technology connectors and cable assemblies for customers in the industrial market and with a particular focus on medical related applications. As we welcome this outstanding new team to Amphenol, I remain very confident that our acquisition program will continue to create great value for the company. In fact, it is our ability to identify and execute upon acquisitions and successfully bring these new companies into Amphenol that remains a core competitive advantage for the company. Now, turning to our progress across our served markets, I just want to comment first that the value of the company's balanced and broad end market diversification has become even more evident during the COVID-19 pandemic. While several of our end markets were negatively impacted by the pandemic in the second quarter, that impact was essentially offset by growth that we achieved in other markets. Our diversification continues to mitigate the impact of volatility that can be seen in individual end markets and geographies, while at the same time exposing us to new opportunities as well as important new technology developments wherever they may arise across the electronics industry. In a dynamic and unpredictable environment like we're experiencing today, this diversification is a truly great asset for the company. Now, first, the military market represented 10% of our sales in the quarter. Sales were down by 12% compared to quarter. Sales were down by 12% compared to prior year as certain of our facilities faced production restrictions from government measures put in place to control the COVID-19 pandemic. Sequentially, our sales decreased as we had expected by about 20%. Looking into the third quarter, we expect sales to increase back to our first quarter levels as we look to recover to full production at most of our facilities that work in support of military customers. Our team focused on the military market has worked hard for many years to strengthen Amphenol's broad technology position while increasing our capacity to serve customers across all segments of this important market. Given the ongoing and continuing favorable military spending environment, the Amphenol team continues to solidify our leadership position by ensuring that we can execute on this increased demand, even amidst the disruptions that we experienced here in the second quarter. This enables us to continue to support the many next-generation technologies that are required for modern military hardware. The commercial air market represented 3% of our sales in the quarter. Second quarter sales declined by 41% from prior year, as the commercial aircraft market saw unprecedented declines in demand for new aircraft due to the disruptions to the global travel industry related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Sequentially, our sales decreased also by 41% from the first quarter. As we look ahead, we expect the commercial air market to continue to be negatively impacted by the significant reduction in demand for air travel that we are seeing across the world. Accordingly, we expect a further approximately 20% sequential reduction in our sales in this market in the third quarter. Regardless of the difficult environment in the commercial air market, our team remains committed to leveraging the company's strong technology position across a wide array of aircraft platforms and next-generation systems that are integrated into those aircraft and we remain well-positioned when this market ultimately returns to growth. In fact, it is in challenging times like this that our steadfast and reactive support for customers can create the most long-term value and thereby position us for long-term success. The industrial market represented 23% of our sales in the quarter and our performance in the second quarter was stronger than we had expected, with sales increasing by 12% in U.S. dollars and 8% organically. This growth was driven in particular by strength in the medical, instrumentation and heavy equipment segments, together with some contributions from our acquisitions that we completed last year. On a sequential basis, sales increased by a very strong 17% from the first quarter. I'd like to emphasize how proud I am of our team, in particular, working in support of medical applications within the industrial market. That team continues to work tirelessly to ramp up our production of sensors, connectors and interconnect assemblies to meet demand from a broad array of customers producing equipment that's used in support of medical treatment for COVID-19 patients. We're just very proud of them. This month's acquisition of Onanon further strengthens our broad high-technology offering for the medical equipment market. As we look into the third quarter, we expect a modest decline from these higher levels of sales. Nevertheless, we remain very pleased with the company's strong position in the worldwide industrial market. Through both our acquisition program as well as our organic innovations, we've developed a broad range of products across a diversified array of exciting industrial segments. We're proud of this success and look forward to realizing the benefits from our efforts in the industrial market for many years to come. The automotive market represented 11% of our sales in the quarter. Sales declined by a very significant 42% in U.S. dollars and 41% in local currency, as stay-at-home orders around the world reduced customer demand for new cars, and at the same time, as government restrictions across many countries resulted in factory shutdowns by automakers and their suppliers. Sequentially, our automotive sales decreased by 35%. As we look towards the third quarter, we now expect sales to the automotive market to substantially improve compared to the second quarter, as the industry begins to recover and as factories ramp up their production levels. However, we do not yet expect sales to reach last year's levels, as the global automotive industry continues to experience somewhat lower demand in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. Regardless of this very challenging time period for the automotive market, we remain confident in Amphenol's long-term position. We've expanded our range of interconnect, sensor and antenna products both organically and through acquisitions to enable a wide array of onboard electronics across a diversified range of vehicles made by auto manufacturers around the world. This consistent strategy will continue to benefit us as the automotive market recovers. The mobile devices market represented 14% of our sales in the quarter. Our sales to mobile device customers increased by 20% from prior year, as demand recovered after the three-week shutdown and subsequent month-long ramp-up of production that we saw in China during the first quarter. Sequentially, our sales in mobile devices increased by a very strong 47%, which was substantially better than our expectations had been coming into the quarter and which did reflect some catch-up of production after the first quarter shutdowns in China. Looking to the third quarter, we now expect a modest increase from these elevated second quarter levels. While 2020 has thus far seen substantial impacts on the mobile devices market from the pandemic, our long-term position in this market remains very robust. Amphenol's leading array of antennas, interconnect products and mechanisms continues to enable a broad range of next-generation mobile devices. And while there's no doubt that this market will always remain one of our most volatile, our outstanding and agile team is poised as always to capture any opportunities for incremental sales that may arise in 2020 and beyond. The mobile networks market represented 7% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in this market decreased by 20% from prior year and 23% organically, as we were impacted by reduced demand from wireless OEMs and particularly related to the U.S. government restrictions on certain Chinese entities that we discussed extensively in previous quarters. On a sequential basis, our sales increased by a stronger-than-expected 9% from the first quarter, driven essentially by higher sales to equipment manufacturers. For the third quarter, we expect sales in the mobile networks market to moderate from these levels on lower demand from both OEMs and service providers. Regardless of any near-term challenges in the mobile networks market, we're confident in the company's long-term position in this important and exciting industry. Our team continues to work aggressively to expand our opportunity with next-generation equipment and networks. As customers ramp up their investments for these advanced systems, we look forward to benefiting from the increased potential that comes from our unique position, with both equipment manufacturers and mobile service providers around the world. The information technology and data communications market represented 27% of our sales in the quarter, and sales in the second quarter for this market were much better than expected, rising from prior year by a very strong 37% in U.S. dollars and 32% organically, as increased data traffic drove both our OEM and service provider customers to significantly increase their demand across virtually all segments of the IT datacomm market. Sequentially, our sales increased by a very strong 43% from the first quarter. I just can't tell you enough how proud I am of our team working in the IT datacom market, who, despite facing production restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic in certain geographies, we\u2019re still able to react quickly to satisfy the significant increase in demand from our customers. As we look towards the third quarter, we now expect a roughly mid-teens sequential decline from the second quarter's very high levels. Our team's continued efforts at developing industry-leading products across a wide array of technologies, including, in particular, high-speed and power products, has positioned us to benefit from the continued demand for increased bandwidth that is likely to persist as individuals, companies, students and governments adjust interacting remotely. We remain encouraged by the company's strong technology position in the global IT datacom market and especially, given this increased demand for bandwidth, our customers around the world are driving their equipment to ever higher levels of performance, in order to manage these dramatic increases in demand. In turn, our team remains singularly focused on enabling this continuing revolution in IT datacom, through their ongoing development of a wide range of next-generation products. The broadband market represented 5% of our sales in the quarter. Sales increased by 3% in U.S. dollars and 5% organically from prior year, driven by stronger demand for home installation related equipment from broadband operators. On a sequential basis, sales increased by 12% from the first quarter. We expect sales in the third quarter to remain roughly at these levels as our operator customers continue to upgrade capacity in their networks to support the significant increase in demand for bandwidth, driven by online video and other remote school and work tools. We remain encouraged by the company's continually expanding range of products for the broadband market, together with our strong positions with customers around the world. And we continue to position ourselves as the most flexible supplier, thereby ensuring that the company can benefit as operators increase their network investments. Now turning for a moment to our outlook, the continued and significant economic and public health uncertainties created by the COVID-19 pandemic make it difficult to accurately forecast our performance in the second half of 2020. Accordingly, we will once again not be providing full year guidance. However, considering the current demand environment and assuming no new material disruptions from the pandemic as well as constant exchange rates. For the third quarter, we now expect sales in the range of $1.960 billion to $2 billion, and we expect adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $0.84 to $0.86. This guidance represents a sales decline versus prior year of 5% to 7% in U.S. dollars and a decrease versus prior year adjusted diluted EPS of 9% to 12%. Now let me just say, I'm extremely pleased by Amphenol's performance here in the second quarter, particularly in light of the many challenges our team has faced related to the COVID-19 pandemic. I remain very confident in the ability of our outstanding management team. To meet these challenges and to navigate these challenges, while capitalizing on the many current and future opportunities to grow our market position and expand our profitability. The Amphenol team around the world remains committed to fighting hard to secure the company's financial performance, all while dedicating ourselves to protecting the safety and health of all of our employees during this pandemic. And I would just like to finish by taking this opportunity to thank each and every one of the Amphenolians around the world for their dedication and their outstanding efforts here in the second quarter. And with that, operator, we'd be very happy to take any questions that there may be.\nOperator: Absolutely [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Amit Daryanani from Evercore. Your line is open.\nAmit Daryanani: Thanks for taking my question. I have a question and a follow-up. First one here, if I think about the implied operating margins you guys are guiding for September quarter it's around 19%, slightly less than that I think, on about 2 billion of sales. I would love to understand because if I go back to the first half of \u201819 when revenues are in this $1.95 billion to $2 billion range, you guys are doing well over 20% operating margins. What's this 100 basis points delta attributed to? Is this just a cost to COVID as we go forward and more structural, or do you think it's transient as you go forward?\nAdam Norwitt: Sure. Thanks, Amit. Yes. First, I think we're really happy with the operating margins. We certainly had in 2006 second quarter reaching 18% with the significant cost that we had due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the government mandates and the restrictions that impacted certainly our production and productivity. As we look into the third quarter, we still expect to have some of those costs impacting us. I mean, certainly, to a lesser extent, we had some improvements. We saw some improvements as we came through the second quarter. But we still have some of those headwinds as we're moving into the third quarter, just to a lesser degree. But -- and you can see that by the sequentially from second quarter to the third quarter improvement that we're, kind of, implying. I think your math is not so far off in terms of our implied margins as we look into the third quarter. If you look to your question, in terms of the impact from the first quarter of 2019 or even if you look at the fourth quarter of 2019, there's a couple of things that are impacting our margins in the third quarter. One would be certainly the COVID costs that we're still going to be incurring in the third quarter, albeit to a lesser degree. And then the other thing, if you're comparing to earlier in 2019, we still do have a little bit of headwind on margin related to certainly some of the acquisitions we did, we did nine acquisitions in 2019, all of which were -- or many of which were below our average margin. And that we're still continuing the journey to bringing up to the company average. As you can imagine, as we're going through a pandemic and all the things that they have to deal with to ensure that their businesses are maximizing their profitability, and given the -- in many cases, the revenue reductions, some of these actions aren't necessarily easy to implement in the current time. But we certainly have full expectations in the longer term that we still should be able to get them back up to the company average. So that really would be the bridge if you, kind of, were comparing earlier 2019 quarters to essentially the third quarter of 2020. But I have to say still, I'm extremely proud of the team, achieving 80% in the second quarter and then taking the actions that are needed to really sequentially get up to these higher levels that we do expect in the third quarter. We're really happy with those results.\nOperator: Thank you speakers. And just a reminder for the parties that queued up for the Q&A to limit asking to only one question. Thank you. We'll proceed to Mark Delaney from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nMark Delaney: Yes, good afternoon. Thanks very much for taking the question, and congratulations on the good results. I was hoping to better understand what the company has seen in the mobile devices end markets, and to what extent are there opportunities for the company to participate in more sophisticated designs, especially around 5G in the second half of this year in some of the past years when the company's had good participation on new program launches. You've seen a pretty big sequential increase in the third quarter. I realize there's a base effect of where you're coming in off of the 2Q levels. But trying to understand to what extent you're able to participate in some of those opportunities in 3Q? Is there anything around just timing and maybe it's more 4Q this year, or what's the opportunity set that's maybe playing into the guidance there? Thank you.\nAdam Norwitt: Well, thanks very much, Mark. Look, I talked already in my prepared remarks about the fact that in the second quarter, there was some degree of catch-up from the first quarter. And I just want to credit our team for what a fabulous job they did in recovering from the shutdown. As you know, well, our mobile devices business, virtually all of that is manufactured in China. And so when that was really having that comprehensive shutdown in the first quarter, that had a disproportionate impact on our mobile devices team and also on the manufacturing of our customers, in fact, at the same time. So, our team did a fabulous job of recovering, getting all the workforce back in place by really the beginning of March and then was able to really catch up with that demand here in the second quarter. And normally, we would not see a 47% increase in the second quarter. In fact, the second quarter -- sequentially. The second quarter tends to be a little bit more of a lull in the mobile device market, as you know, having followed the company for quite some time. So, I think if you take that out, that sort of anomaly here in the first half, we still have in the second half, great participation in many new programs. And whether those are 5G-related or otherwise, just the devices continue to get more complex; our team devices continue to do a great job in helping to enable those devices from a wide array of customers and ultimately puts us in a very strong position. I would say with the pandemic that there does appear to be a little bit of slippage in some programs that maybe would have normally launched a little bit earlier that may be combined with that disproportionate second quarter that we saw. I think if you factor all that out, you probably get to a little bit -- a little bit more normal-looking sequential outlook for mobile devices. But we continue to have a very strong position. We're excited about these next-generation programs that are coming, the new functionalities that are being put into the phones. And while we're never going to win everything, every new program is kind of a new jump ball for us. Our team has just done a fabulous job of supporting customers in good times and bad. And we're normally -- we have come to bat for our customers when they have a new launch and when others maybe can't support as well. The ramp-ups -- here we came to bat for our customers during a pandemic when everything was very chaotic in the first half and our team just kept their head down, kept focused, made sure that we had the right resources in place, the right capabilities to meet what our customers needed. And I think that puts us in a strong position to the extent that there are opportunities for incremental volumes or incremental programs in the near and the long-term, I think we'll be well-positioned to take advantage of those.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Craig Hettenbach from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nCraig Hettenbach: Yes, thank you. Adam, I guess good to see kind of a thaw in the M&A environment after the first half of the year. So, just curious to get your take on that small tuck-in and just how you see things set up in terms of opportunity set and ability to execute on M&A as those opportunities arise?\nAdam Norwitt: Yes. Well, thanks so much, Craig. I mean, we're really excited. It's not a big company on and on, but it's a great company. And I think it is a wonderful reflection of our approach to acquisitions. We have taken for a long, long time that very patient approach of incubating relationships with a wide array of companies around the industry and around the world, developing relationships, developing real mutual trust between us and the owners of these entrepreneurial companies, such that when it is appropriate and when they have -- they have sort of crossed the kind of canyon, if you will, of deciding that they want to sell their company, we don't have to build that trust from scratch. We've already established those wonderful relationships. Because the fact is in a pandemic, when we're all socially distancing, creating new relationships from scratch is harder, its much harder to do. And so this was not in the case of Onanon. A book that showed up from a banker, and we said, well, who are these people? Well, you can't meet them. None of that happened. We had long-standing interactions with the entrepreneurs who founded this company and who, by the way, stay on as now the general manager of that company going forward. And so we're very excited about that. The second thing is this is a company that has just a really unique technology proposition, unique products that go into exciting areas of the industrial market, in particular, into medical technology. And we \u2013 I talked earlier about the strength of our medical business in the quarter, it's not that we saw that strength and thereby said, oh, let's go buy Onanon because it's a medical company, that\u2019s more coincidental. But I think the fact is is they are a company that is present in next-generation electronics, used in a wide array of applications that are exciting and that are important. And we are very proud to bring them into the Amphenol family. The overall M&A environment in a pandemic, it's different. As you can imagine, you're going to be more careful. You're going to make sure you know the people. You're going to make sure that the business has resilience to it in a time like this. But all that being said, we continue to have a strong pipeline and, you know, Craig, Craig mentioned before, we acquired nine companies last year, I don't know that we're going to do that this year with the pandemic so far in the first half but we're very pleased that we were able to make this one and bring them into the Amphenol family, and we're very hopeful that there will be more to come in the future.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Sheerin from Stifel. Your line is open.\nMatt Sheerin: Yes, thank you. Good afternoon. Question, Adam, regarding the industrial sector. You had very strong results there. You talked about some of the end markets, particularly medical. Did you see any signs of maybe some pull-in inventory building at customers. We're hearing that from some semiconductor company and other component companies. So I'm wondering, if you're seeing any of that. And then within the medical markets, are you beginning yet to see a shift from COVID-related demand and products versus elective surgeries? Thanks.\nAdam Norwitt: Thanks so much, Matt. Great question. Look, I don't know that I would all the demand a pull-in. But I would call the demand that we saw for COVID related medical equipment, in particular, things like ventilator, respiratory therapy devices, patient monitoring for new hospital construction, things like that, that was very, very significant demand. There's no doubt about it. Is that a pull in? I mean, it didn't exist before, this demand. So it was all new demand, the world never built as many ventilators as the world is now building. And I don't know that pull in would be necessarily the right term for that, but there was definitely a rush to build. And from our perspective, what our team just did such a great job of is massively increasing their capacity to support that demand when oftentimes, our competitors could not do so. And I can't tell you the number of calls I've had with customers, letters of gratitude from customers, dozens, if not hundreds of programs in support of COVID, where our team just pulled out all the stops and made it happen. And we worked with companies who never built medical equipment before. We've worked with long-term medical companies. We've worked directly with governments around the world, who are building strategically their medical infrastructure. And these are all things that were not just, sort of, a one-time situation, but rather is an ongoing recognition that the world just didn't have enough of a certain type of medical equipment to deal with the respiratory borne pathogen. And I'm guessing that, that is not a situation that people around the world want to face again. Now, are we seeing a shift from more COVID-focused medical equipment to the more elective surgical? I mean, there's no question that early in the quarter, we did see a little bit softer demand for products that are used in purely elective fashion. I wouldn't say that, that was material. And obviously, despite that, our medical business within industrial did really, really well. I mean this is outstanding performance. Is that balancing a little bit more here coming into the third quarter? Yeah, I guess that would probably be a fair way to put it. I mean, we expect, as I said earlier, in the third quarter, we expect our sales to be at or a little bit below the levels that they were in the second quarter. These are very, very high levels of consumption. And our team continues to work hard to make sure that we can satisfy that demand. And if there's a little bit of a more broad demand for some of those things that were earlier push back, that may be the case. But look, we're just really proud of what the team has done here in medical.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Samik Chatterjee from JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nSamik Chatterjee: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to see, given the order number that you had, which looks like for the first time in a while is below the $2 billion number. If you can give us a bit more kind of visibility into what the cadence was through the quarter, particularly kind of exiting the quarter? What was the cadence like? And curious if you're seeing any big differences in terms of order activity between regions given that the different regions seem to be in different places relative to containment of COVID? Thank you.\nAdam Norwitt: Yeah. Thanks so much, Samik. Look, I think that we came into the quarter, as you will recall, on the heels of very, very significant orders that we had in Q1. We had the highest book-to-bill in the history of the company and the third highest orders, absolute order volume in the history of the company. I think it was $2.150 billion. And so it's not surprising to me. It was not surprising to us that our orders would more level at or around our sales levels here in the second quarter. In fact, I would have told you that, after such a big order number, it wouldn't have surprised me if the orders were actually a little bit lower than the sales levels. And that was probably our expectation coming into the quarter that orders would have been a little bit lower. So I'd say that the fact that we outperformed on sales and met \u2013 nearly met those sales levels with orders, is a good reflection of the demand from our customers. In terms of the cadence throughout the quarter, I wouldn't say that there's anything so notable. The middle of the quarter is probably a little lighter than the beginning and the end of the quarter. That's maybe the only thing I would say. And regional, I don't think there was anything abnormal or anomalous from a regional perspective relative to orders.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Wamsi Mohan from Bank of America. Your line is open.\nWamsi Mohan: Yes. Thank you. Your Q3 guide is clearly about consensus and quite strong. But when you adjust for the $5 million in M&A and the incremental FX benefit, the guide is also somewhat subseasonal. Can you talk about what sort of dynamics are causing that? Did you see -- I know you addressed this on industrial, but more broadly, did you see any pull forward, if so, in any of the end markets and how large that might have been?\nAdam Norwitt: Yes. Thanks so much, Wamsi. Well, I'll point to a couple of markets to describe this and maybe with a little bit more specificity. I talked already about mobile devices. Where I would say that, the demand that we saw in the second quarter did reflect some catch-up from the disruption that we experienced in China in the first quarter, so that maybe one piece of the puzzle. I think the second is, I would talk about IT datacom and I mentioned that we expect IT datacom, expect that market to be down in the kind of mid-teens quarter-to-quarter, and that is just a reflection of the extraordinary level of demand that we had here in the second quarter. I mean these are still very, very high levels of IT datacom demand in the third quarter. Traditionally, you would see IT datacom strengthening into the second half. And the fact that there was this very significant and I would say, incremental demand, not pull ahead per se. Again, this is that nuance of a pull-in, the bandwidth requirements that emerged in the second quarter and even late in the first quarter was not customers around the world saying, 'Oh, we had originally planned to put this bandwidth in, in the second half, let's put it in the first half. This is a new demand for bandwidth because all of us are on video calls all the time because all of us are working from home, schools are teaching remotely and governments are working remotely. Hospitals are communicating remotely. I mean just an intense demand for bandwidth that nobody knew was going to exist as of January 22, which was the day before Wuhan was locked down for the pandemic. And so that's -- I wouldn't call that a pull-in, I would call that incremental demand that was very significant in the second quarter that we uniquely were able to satisfy from our customers and that moderates somewhat in the third quarter, but moderates still to a very high level of demand. And I think those are probably the biggest areas where -- which impacts the sequential guidance into the third quarter. Without that, otherwise, you would probably be looking at a much more typical and even little bit of recovery coming into the second quarter because I also talked about the fact that we see a very strong recovery in military in the second quarter. We see a very strong recovery in automotive, those two markets, which were more dramatically impacted. Where we don't see that recovery is in commercial air, luckily for us that's a much smaller percent of our sales and has much less impact. But if you think about the markets that were deeply impacted by the pandemic in the quarter, we see very strong recoveries from both military and from automotive, but not from com air. So I think you take all that together, kind of put it into the calculator and you end up with a guide that we have, which I think is a very strong guide, but does reflect essentially at similar levels, roughly similar levels to what we achieved here in the second quarter. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Nikolay Todorov from Longbow. Your line is open.\nNikolay Todorov: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Just to -- can you guys speak a little bit about your assessment of customer inventories? And I know we're going back to just questions of pull forward and not so. But I'm particularly interested in the IT datacom, mobile devices and industrial end markets. If I look at the mobile devices and combined kind of the guide through the third quarter, essentially implies that your sales are going to be a roughly flattish where production is down about 15%. And I understand part of this is content growth. But similarly, on the industrial side, if we assume that some of that medical demand is going to subside or at least flatten into the second half. What are you seeing in your nonmedical industrial customers in terms of inventory situation at their docs?\nAdam Norwitt: Yeah. Well, thanks so much, Nikolay. I mean, as I've said before, we don't have perfect visibility into our customers' warehouses and to how much inventory they have. We get a little bit of visibility from our distributors, but distributors represent just a bit over 15% of our sales. And I would tell you, vis-\u00e0-vis our distributors, the inventory levels are very healthy. There's nothing abnormal about them. I wouldn't say that they ticked up or ticked down in any meaningful way here in the second quarter. I mean as it relates to IT datacom, again, I don't know the numbers, but I can tell you, I would be pretty surprised if our customers in IT datacom put anything that we ship to them on the shelf of a warehouse. I mean, this was a dramatic need for product to be put in the field so that people like you and I would not see a spinning circle when we turn to Netflix on in the evening. And if it's sitting in -- if our product is sitting in a warehouse, it's not helping someone get bandwidth. And so I would be very surprised if any of that stuff ended up building inventory. Mobile devices is really -- there's very little inventory in the whole channel. So I don't think that that's one that I would note. And relative to industrial, I think industrial is the one market for us, especially when you take out medical, where we have a little bit of a higher proportion of distribution. And so there, I guess, I could be have a little bit more visibility than normal, and I would tell you that the inventory levels seemed healthy and reasonable and no abnormal changes as we came into, or out of the quarter, at least relative to the distribution side of our industrial business.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Deepa Raghavan from Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.\nDeepa Raghavan: Hi, good afternoon, everyone.\nAdam Norwitt: Hello, Deepa.\nDeepa Raghavan: Hey. Are you able to speak specifically to Chinese -- to China's trends versus overall? And my question is more geared towards gauging how much of the forward momentum in China is predicated on U.S. and Europe recovery supporting that? And I guess the second part of the question is, are there any verticals -- are there some verticals that are more at-risk if these developed nations remain pressured? I mean just -- it doesn't feel like China is enough there to decouple from Europe or U.S.? Thank you.\nAdam Norwitt: Thank you very much, Deepa. Well, look, it should not surprise anybody that after the first quarter where because of the pandemic, our China operations were shutdown for three weeks and then ramping up over the course of the following month that there was significant sequential increase in our sales in Asia and in general and specifically in China. I mean, that is normal. And mobile devices is the best example of that, which is essentially all fulfilled in China, and that grew 47% sequentially. You talked about, is that momentum tied to the U.S. and Europe, or just broadly around the world, all -- most of the mobile devices in the world are made in China, the vast majority. And so to the extent that people in U.S. or Europe buy more or less phones, that's going to impact demand there. So I guess in that market, I would say that's the case. The IT datacom market is another one where there is more -- there's a certain degree of production in China that shift around the world. And so again, I think that would be one where it's not just a Chinese domestic market. Now, I know you've alluded to kind of decoupling and -- which is a little bit of a different topic than just the kind of recovery in the second quarter. And I'll just say one thing about that. We read the papers like everybody. We're very close to all of the geopolitics of the moment. And I've said before and I will just say it again here today. The way that we organize our company has always been. We are a global company, but we rely on local management around the world to execute. That is we give authority to our more than 120 general managers around the world to make all the decisions that they need to make in order to adapt to their local markets. And we don't have expats. We have local people in every geography. We have Indians in India; Germans in Germany; French people in France; and Chinese people in China; Americans in the U.S. And that approach has always been a very, very successful approach in a globalizing world, but it is equally successful and equally powerful in a world which is decoupling, so to speak, or fragmenting or becoming more nationalistic or whatever -- however, you would like to term that. And our people in every country that they operate are viewed very much as a local supporter of those customers. Even if behind them, the customers know that they have the strength, the breadth, the financial stability, the resources of a global company, and that puts us in really a best of both world's position. And so to the extent the relations between one country and another start to deteriorate -- whatever that is, we at Amphenol remain very agnostic to that. I mean yes, do I want -- do I think the world personally is better if everybody gets along? Sure. That I would be lying if I said the opposite. But can Amphenol succeed regardless? There is no doubt about it. That's how we've turned this company. That's how we've built the culture of this company. That's how our organization is equipped. And I think in the current world, it really creates actually an opportunity for our company long-term. We're not going to shy away from the fact that we're an American headquartered company that we're traded on the New York Stock Exchange. But we are always going to make sure that our customers in every geography get from us the superior presence of a local team and all what that entails. And so I think to the extent that this decoupling happens, it is what it is. It's well above my pay grade, I can tell you. But we're going to make sure that our team can manage either way to find great success.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Fox from Fox Advisors. Your line is open.\nSteven Fox: Thanks. Good afternoon.\nAdam Norwitt: Hi Steve.\nSteven Fox: Hi. I was just wondering, you touched on some of the dynamics going on with IT datacom. I was wondering if you could do the same thing for the outdoor markets with wireless infrastructure and broadband. How would you sort of compare and contrast the need for bandwidth there and your content gains going forward for the rest of the year? Thank you.\nAdam Norwitt: Thanks so much, Steve. Look I would say that if you compare broadband and mobile networks in kind of the acute situation of the last, let's call it, four months, five, four and a half or so months where everybody has been working from home, I think the pressure has been more on the core Internet, the pressure has been more on the broadband service providers than it has been necessarily on the mobile service providers. And I say that because the fact is the real bandwidth constraints have come from people at home, where the vast majority of the people still today at home are not using wireless broadband as a means to deliver high-speed Internet to their house. Now that can change. And I think maybe this whole situation is going to be a catalyst for that long-term to change, because I can tell you, myself, and I won't name my cable operator. They are all wonderful but it was not always easy over the last four months. When I had two or three kids in the house, all on Zoom calls, when I was on Zoom Call, my wife was on Zoom Call, I mean \u2013 or Teams or Google or whatever, I mean, we're all on video calls and that was not always perfect. And then my son decides to play a video game and all of a sudden, the whole thing just freezes up. And so the fact is there is a real rush to help that at-home capacity over the last quarter. And I think that was reflected more in what we saw with broadband growing 12% quarter-to-quarter as opposed to mobile networks. Because in mobile networks, what we saw was really a growth from our OEM customers, and we grew 9% sequentially, which was very strong, given that. Some of that a little bit coming out of China, where some of the equipment providers in China were, of course, shut down. But in terms of our work directly with service providers, the strength really came in broadband and in IT datacom in the second quarter. Now what does that mean long term? I do believe that long term, the fact of this pandemic coming at the same time as 5G is really beginning to be constructed, it is probably a good thing. It's going to mean ultimately that we're going to have a variety of means to get broadband data to our homes. And that is not just confined to cable systems, to telco operators, to mobile operators. But there's also satellite Internet being put up in a relatively big way by certain pretty famous operators. I mean, there's a lot going on here to make sure that our \u2013 that homes can have much better bandwidth capacity than they may have in the past. And regardless of where it is, you know this well, you've covered us for a long, long time, Steve. I mean, our approach has never been to bet on one of those ways of getting high speed. It's been \u2013 our approach has always been, let's make sure we're present everywhere. Let's make sure we're present with the broadband operators. Let's make sure we're present with the mobile network operators. Let's make sure we're present with the web service providers. Let's make sure we're present with satellite-based Internet. Whatever it may be, and I think as long as we maintain that high-technology partnership with customers across each of those areas, we're going to be well positioned as the world continues to build the infrastructure for bandwidth to homes, to offices, to governments, to hospitals and everywhere around the world.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from William Stein from SunTrust. Your line is open.\nWilliam Stein: Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I'm wondering if you can elaborate, Adam, on capacity. I think you mentioned that this was still somewhat of a constraint in the quarter. Did I miss here? I thought that as of the end of last quarter, that these issues have been resolved at least internally, maybe it's more a matter of your customers' capacity. Any sort of clarification would be great? Thank you.\nAdam Norwitt: Well, thanks, Will. No, I mean, I would tell you that as we came out of last quarter, I mean, you'll recall, the first quarter was really a story of China and the very significant kind of one-off of the factories there. It was without equal. There was no essential business. There was nothing. It was just \u2013 they were shut down for three weeks. And then you had to reopen through a very complex and cumbersome process, actually, to prove that you were protecting your people, and we did just a great job of that, and thereby, we're able to open maybe a little bit faster than some others. But as the virus spread around the world to the nearly 40 countries in which we operate, there was a whole range of restrictions that ultimately did impact our capacity, our productivity in a whole variety of countries and not just the nearly 40 countries, but even here in the U.S., we operate in dozens of states in the U.S. and every state had a slightly different approach. I remember very well the day that the very first restrictions were taken, and that was not even a state level restriction. It was a county. Where Contra Costa, and I think it was Alameda counties in California adopted the very first real significant business restrictions to enable better social distancing and to stop the spread of the virus. And so, our teams around the world in our more than 200 facilities, it's hard to find one where we didn\u2019t, at one point, face something during the quarter where the team had to somehow navigate a government restriction or actually just us taking measures to protect the people that were important and appropriate measures to protect our people. And so, no doubt about it, in the quarter, there were significant expenses that we incurred. Craig talked about those. And there was also impact on our capacity in a variety of ways. And I talked about that in a few of our markets, but the one in particular that I mentioned was in military, where our sales were down 20%, and that had nothing to do with demand. That was all to do with navigating the variety of restrictions that were put in place in a variety of countries and our team just did a fabulous job of doing so. Now as we came out of the quarter, I would say that it's a much better situation. It's not totally done. There we still have a number or, let's say, several places around the world that are still facing some restrictions. And who knows? To the extent that the later part of the year or the latter part of the year, brings a further acceleration of the virus. Ultimately, we all know that the only way to control this virus is for people to wear masks and to have social distancing. And that ultimately may require governments to implement, again, restrictive measures that can have an impact on our customers and can have an impact on us. And that's one of the levels of uncertainty that, to be honest, makes it difficult for us to give a full year guidance. So who knows what will come? I cross my fingers and my toes that that it doesn't get worse, but I'm realistic enough to know that this is a virus that doesn't just kind of stop magically. It stops through social distancing. It stops through mask wearing. That's what our people are doing. And to the extent that governments around the world have problems that they face, where the virus gets out of control, they won't surprise me, if ultimately, there is an impact on the production of products, on businesses being able to operate. And we're not necessarily immune to that. But regardless, there's no doubt about it that in this kind of very unique world, a world where we've never had to deal with governments telling you, you can or cannot open your factories. Our team just did an amazing job of navigating those very tricky shoals here in the quarter. And if something else were to come, I'm sure they'll do the same great job.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Joseph Spak from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nJoseph Spak: Thank you. Good afternoon everyone.\nAdam Norwitt: Good afternoon.\nJoseph Spak: I wanted to maybe just zoom out a little bit for a second because over the past couple of months, we've seen the market really dive-in and pay a lot of attention, increasing attention, I'd say to alternative powertrains for transportation, be it for the lighter commercial vehicle markets, but also things like hydrogen for industrial uses, particularly with the news out of Europe. So these are clearly long-term trends, but maybe sometimes market enthusiasm can get out over its skis on the opportunity. So can you speak to what you're seeing from your customer on these sort of things and whether something like hydrogen is even an opportunity for Amphenol?\nAdam Norwitt: Well look, these are all exciting things. And I remember years ago, when we were working on the first electric cars that we worked on as it -- I wonder if there's ever going to be an electric car that people will actually own and drive. And now I look out in our parking lot here because I have a beautiful view of our parking lot out of my office window, and I see a few of these electric cars, more than I ever did before. So you talked about something like hydrogen or fuel cells, you talked about alternative energy sources of whatever for cars. I think long term, there will be new drivetrains. I think there will be new technologies. And I think regardless of what it is, the great thing about these revolutionary new technologies is that they always require a new type of interconnect. They require a more ruggedized, they require a higher technology solutions. And so they create opportunities for our company. They create opportunities for our whole industry. And I think that's a really good thing. Now I thought you're going to ask Joe, that given the pandemic and social distancing, is that going to have an impact on these things? I think there's a chance. Look, I'm not the one to tell you which way the auto market is going to go and which way drivetrains are going to go. But these last 6 months here, and it is really 6 months ago from tomorrow that Wuhan was shutdown. These have been really unbelievable, an unbelievable time period of change. It's causing people to reassess everything. I compare it at home to it like someone throws a bag of flower in the air and you just don't know where the flower is going to land, but it will eventually land somewhere. And I do believe that people are totally reassessing aspects of their life. And some of those may ultimately result in driving these trends accelerate a bit more. And what I mean by that? Well, take public transport. I'm a huge fan of public transport, anybody should be. But the fact is, once you know that an invisible thing like a virus can be spread through a dense public transport. On the margin, it's going to probably cause people to use public transport a little bit less and that's not great for the environment. But at the same time, people are waking up to these kind of existential threats, having a pandemic really makes you very quickly get clarity on things that can affect your life. And the environment is clearly one of those things. And I believe that it will be a missed opportunity for people not to, sort of, wake up a little bit about the environment. So you take that combination of maybe people wanting to be a little bit more in the privacy and the sanctity of their own vehicles, together with a little bit of a wake-up call about existential threats to humanity would make one think a little bit more about a hydrogen fuel cell, for example, or electric vehicle or something like that. Now I don't want to go totally off the reservation on this discussion. But the fact is, is this time period can be a catalyst for change, and a lot of that change can be very exciting change. And regardless of what it's going to be our company, I believe, is very well-positioned to take part in that, to capitalize upon it and help to enable it.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Shawn Harrison from Loop Capital. Your line is open.\nShawn Harrison: Hi everybody. Adam, I wanted to dig in just on your comments on the wireless networks business. And you said, it would weaken both at the OEM as well as the service provider level in the back half. How much of the weakness is just a tough sequential comparison versus maybe some pauses you're seeing in deployments? And if you are seeing any pauses, is that just through the end of the calendar year and then 2021 looks better for that business? Any kind of commentary would be appreciated?\nAdam Norwitt: Yeah. I mean, look, I guess there's a little bit of each, Shawn. I would say that if you're a big company who is dealing with massive increases, a bandwidth demand, and you're facing constrained capital. You may be allocating some of that capital towards that bandwidth as opposed to expansion of a next-generation mobile network. And I think there's a little bit of that on the margin. There's been a lot of corporate goings and comings. I think a lot of those things have been settled now. But I think it's a little bit of each as we come here into the third quarter. Look, I think long-term, our outlook for this market remains to be a very positive one. We have a strong position, both with OEMs and operators. And in particular, a strong position, on next-generation systems. We've had that difficult comparison for a couple of quarters now because of the restrictions that were put in place in China, and that will continue here for really through this year. But by and large, I would tell you that we still have a very positive outlook for the market long-term. And there's a couple of dynamics that you described are probably a pretty good way to capture what's happening here in the third quarter.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question comes from Jim Suva from Citigroup Investment Research. Your line is open.\nJim Suva: Thank you. Adam, in the past, sometimes there have been times where, like in mobility, there have been like integration of connectors and integration of antennas and integration of sockets. And then there's times when there's cyclically like expansion of those sockets, whether it be technologies like 4G or 3G or integration of, say, Wi-Fi and all these different things. As you look forward, say, in the mobility segment, at times where you've mentioned there's been some integration that has kind of been pressured. I wonder with 5G, can you give us any color about -- does that give you a chance for like more socket wins and more content per item versus in the past or how can we think about that? Thank you.\nAdam Norwitt: Thanks so much, Jim. Well, look, 5G, and I think I've talked about this in the past, the good news about 5G is 5G is not a replacement to prior modes of devices communicating with networks; it's a supplement because you cannot just have a device which only communicates using 5G. It would be useless outside of just a couple of areas. And you have this kind of chicken and egg that you can't -- the network is not useful without the devices, but the devices are also not useful without the network. And thus, the devices have to be backwards compatible all the way through all the generations. You drive from Manhattan to San Francisco and in between there, you're going to go through a lot of areas that may not even have 4G, LTE, may not even have 3G. And maybe it will still be 2G kind of a communication and so -- but your phone still have to work. You still have to be able to call 911 and you still have to be able to look on Google Maps and these kind of things. And so the fact is, is adding a 5G functionality increases the complexity of the device. Now, that's a generality. Obviously, each device itself, each customer, each program is going to have a different architecture, a different approach to designing that. And whether that's going to cause more connectors or cable assemblies, or less, more antennas or less, more mechanisms or less, you cannot draw just a very perfect generalization about that. You can say that in its totality, you would expect 5G to add to the complexity and would expect that that would create further opportunities. But you can't assure yourself that on each program, that's going to be the case. So, I think 5G net-net is a great positive, and it's a great positive for us, not just in the devices, but it's also a positive because we work in the networks. And it's also a positive because we work in the core -- at the core Internet where we have such a strong position as well. And so we think 5G has the potential to impact virtually all of the segments of our business. You talk about Internet in factories, and you talk about adopting high-speed data into new medical devices, you talk about how it works even in the military, what the military is going to do when you have 5G functionality, all of these things are creating new applications, new functionalities, which ultimately are going to need new interconnect solutions that Amphenol can provide. So the long-term prospects, I think, from 5G are very pervasive and very positive. Ultimately, is a given phone or a given tablet going to have more or less of the things that we sell? It's impossible to say in the short-term.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from David Kelley from Jefferies. Your line is open.\nDavid Kelley: Hey good afternoon. A question on automotive. And Adam, you talked about visibility to substantial sales improvement in Q3, do you foresee any supply chain risk to meeting that ramp? And then realizing there's unlikely to impact the near-term, but given the magnitude and timing of this rebound, is this an opportunity for Amphenol to take market share from competitors that might still be feeling, let's call it, deeper effects from the Q2 disruption? Thank you.\nAdam Norwitt: Thanks so much, David. Look, I think from our perspective, I don't see a risk to our team ramping up. Our team is just so nimble. They're flexing their capabilities. We saw that even during the course of the second quarter, if you think about the trajectory of the auto market, just within the second quarter. I can tell you, April was not the most fun month to be an automotive interconnect supplier. That's for sure. But by the time we came into June, we were already starting to see some recovery of momentum, and our team is able to flip a switch and really be running to satisfy that demand. Now your question about market share, I will tell you, and I'm going to broaden this to be beyond automotive. This is an existential crisis for many. I talked during my prepared remarks and we've talked so many times about the strength of the diversity of Amphenol. And you couple that with the financial fortitude that Craig has just done such an amazing job of ensuring inside this company and that has created ultimately a resilience to Amphenol that is, I believe, second to none. There are many in our industry and in other industries, but in our industry, who are more focused. And those focused companies, to the extent that they're on the wrong side of the market volatility that can create a more existential threat, and it can create in the eyes of customers, a perception of an existential threat. And that ultimately may, over time, create a kind of a draw to those customers to work with a company that demonstrates resilience in the time of true crisis. And I think in that respect, Amphenol comes out really passing that test with flying colors. And so I wouldn't just confine that to automotive, I would say, across all of our markets, our customers have seen in Amphenol, a company that can deal with the crisis like no other, and they want to have that. There's been so much talked about supply chain resiliency and as opposed to sort of efficiency versus longevity kind of that debate that people have had. And I think we've always strived to give our customers both, tried to give them a great offering of the best products at competitive prices, but also from a company that's going to be around regardless of what crisis hits us. And I think that can be a positive long-term and in particular, in a crisis that was \u2013 where the catalyst for that crisis is a public health emergency. It almost brings more focus to that dynamic than ever before. And so I think long term, that can create an opportunity for our company across all the markets, including automotive.\nOperator: Thank you. And our last question for today comes from Joe Giordano from Cowen. Your line is open.\nJoe Giordano: Hey, guys. Just wanted to dig in on the industrial. We've touched on it a little bit, but can you maybe put a finer point on what the non-medical piece did or what that would have looked like without the benefit from medical or maybe on a size the scale, the size of medical for us in some fashion?\nAdam Norwitt: Yes. Thanks so much, Joe. I mean, look, we don't break out every detail of all of our industrial market. It would be \u2013 it would make this phone call to go for hours. But I will tell you that we had strong performance in a number of our important industrial segments beyond medical. I mentioned, specifically instrumentation, heavy equipment. We had great performance also in our sort of battery related applications for heavy vehicles. And conversely, we had other parts of the industrial market that were more impacted, things like oil and gas, as I referred to before. But medical was not the only story in industrial. And I think we would have still had a good performance in industrial, even without that medical, especially if you think about on a sequential basis, growing 17% sequentially in that market. I mean, that that could not have come from just one piece of that industrial puzzle, which was medical. So I think we still have strong positions across industrial. And what has really been the basis of our industrial market is the diversification within that very, very broad market, and what ties industrial all together, remains, these are just harsh environment applications, where you're taking high technology interconnect and sensor products, antenna products, and you're putting them into very inhospitable environments. Everything from down in oil wells, to a very clean ICU in a hospital and everything in between, and we have great performance in many segments of that market. And the diversity within that market I think helps us to have that strong performance.\nOperator: Thank you, speakers. As at this time we don't have any further questions on queue, I'll hand the call over to you for closing remarks.\nAdam Norwitt: Well, thank you very much and thanks to everybody for your attention to Amphenol today and just like to take this opportunity to wish you all a good summer. I hope you get some well deserved vacation time this summer. You'll need it to come back fully recharged for the second half and Craig and I look forward to speaking to you all 90 days from now. Thanks again.\nCraig Lampo: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you for attending today's conference and have a nice day.",

            "content": "Thank you very much. Good afternoon, everyone. This is Craig Lampo, Amphenol's CFO, and I'm here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO. We would like to welcome you to our second quarter 2020 conference call. As a reminder, during the call, we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures and may make certain forward-looking statements. So please refer to the relevant disclosures in our press release for further information. The company closed the second quarter with sales of $1.987 billion and with GAAP and adjusted diluted EPS of $0.85 and $0.81, respectively. Sales were down 1% in U.S. dollars and were flat in local currencies, compared to the second quarter of 2019. From an organic standpoint, excluding both acquisitions and currency impacts, sales in the second quarter decreased 3%. Sequentially, sales were up 7% in U.S. dollars in local currencies inorganically. Breaking down sales into our two segments. The interconnect business, which comprised 96% of our sales, was down 1% in U.S. dollars and was flat in local currencies compared to last year. Our cable business, which comprised 4% of our sales, was down 1% in U.S. dollars and up 3% in local currencies compared to the second quarter of last year. Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes. Operating income was $357 million in the second quarter of 2020 and operating margins were 18%, which was down 230 basis points, compared to the second quarter of 2019. Similar to last quarter, the year-over-year reduction in operating margin reflected a higher negative conversion rate than our typical 30% downside conversion, due to the continued negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on production and productivity, particularly due to various government restrictions that have limited our ability to adjust costs in certain geographies. Compared to the first quarter of 2020, operating margin increased 100 basis points and reflected a strong sequential conversion margin on the higher sales levels. From a segment standpoint, in the interconnect segment, margins were 20% in the second quarter of 2020, which was down compared to 22.2% in the second quarter of 2019, but up from 19.1% in the first quarter of 2020. In the cable segment, margins were 9.4%, which is down compared to 9.7% in the second quarter of 2019, but up from 7.6% for the first quarter of 2020. Given the continued unprecedented challenges created by the COVID-19 pandemic, we are proud of this quarter's performance. Our team's ongoing ability to minimize the negative margin impact resulting from the crisis is a direct result of the strength and commitment of the company's entrepreneurial management team, which continues to foster a high-performance, action-oriented culture and thereby allows us to capitalize on opportunities and maximize profitability in an uncertain market environment. Interest expense for the quarter was $30 million, which was unchanged compared to the second quarter of last year. The company's adjusted effective tax rate was 24.5% for both the second quarter of 2020 and 2019. The adjusted effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2020 excludes an excess tax benefit of $12 million, associated with the stock option exercises during the quarter. And the adjusted effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2019 excludes the impact of an excess tax benefit associated with stock option exercises during the quarter, partially offset by the tax impact of acquisition-related costs. The company's GAAP effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2020, including the items just mentioned, was 20.7% compared to 21.3% in the second quarter of 2019. Adjusted net income was 12% of sales in the second quarter of 2020, another confirmation of the strength of the company's financial performance. On a GAAP basis, diluted EPS declined by 9% in the second quarter to $0.85 compared to $0.93 in the second quarter of 2019. Adjusted diluted EPS declined 12% to $0.81 in the second quarter of 2020 from $0.92 in the second quarter of 2019. Orders for the quarter were $1.971 billion, which was down 2% compared to the second quarter of 2019 and resulted in a book-to-bill ratio of just under 1:1. Despite the unprecedented challenges in the current environment, the company continues to be an excellent generator of cash. Cash flow from operations was $368 million in the second quarter or 150% of adjusted net income. And net of capital spending of $67 million, our free cash flow was $301 million or 123% of adjusted net income. From a working capital standpoint, inventory, accounts receivable and accounts payable were $1.4 billion, $1.7 billion and $928 million, respectively at the end of June. In inventory days, days sales outstanding and payable days were 89, 74 and 60 days, respectively. While DSO and DPO were both went on a normal range, DSI was slightly elevated. Due to the current crisis we expect inventory days to remain somewhat elevated, but to come back down to more normal levels as business returns to a more typical pattern. During the second quarter, our cash flow from operations of $368 million, along with proceeds from our recently completed bond offering of $543 million, proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $123 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments on hand of $1.1 billion net of translation were used primarily to fund repayments under our various credit facilities of $1.35 billion. Fund repayments of senior notes of $400 million, fund net repayments under our commercial paper programs of $135 million, fund payment of contingent acquisition-related obligations of $75 million, fund dividend payments of $74 million, fund net capital expenditures of $67 million and fund new debt financing cost of $5 million.  As communicated in our April earnings release, due to the significant economic uncertainty and volatility in the credit and capital markets created by the COVID-19 pandemic. In March, the company had proactively borrowed $1.25 billion under our revolving credit facility and reduced our reliance on commercial paper markets. As the credit and capital markets stabilized during the second quarter, we repaid the amounts borrowed under our revolving credit facility with cash on hand, as well as the proceeds from the $500 million and \u20ac500 million bond offering completed in May. As such, as of June 30, 2020, there are no balances outstanding under either our revolving credit facility or our commercial paper programs. As a result, at June 30, cash and short-term investments were $1.3 billion, the majority of which is held outside of the U.S. and total debt at June 30 was $3.8 billion with no maturities before the third quarter of 2021. Net debt at June 30 was $2.5 billion, which decreased from $2.7 billion as of March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019. Total cash on hand, as well as the remaining availability under our credit facilities was $3.8 billion at the end of the quarter, which leaves the company in a very strong liquidity position. The second quarter of 2020 EBITDA was $444 million, and our pro forma net leverage ratio was 1.3 times. In summary, although this continues to be a challenging environment, we finished the quarter in a position of continued financial strength with a very strong balance sheet and liquidity position. We believe this financial strength, coupled with the company's broad market and geographic diversity, positions us well for the currently volatile environment, which is characterized by continued uncertainty across global markets. I will now turn it back over to Adam, who will provide some commentary on current market trends. Thank you."

            "name": "Adam Norwitt",
            "content": "Well, thank you very much, Craig, and allow me to extend my welcome to everybody here on the phone today. And first, I just want to also offer my hope and wishes that for all of you on the call here, that you, your family, your friends, as well as your colleagues have remained safe and healthy over the course of the last quarter. As Craig mentioned, I'm going to highlight some of our achievements in the second quarter. I'm also going to discuss the trends and progress across our sales markets. And then finally, I'll make some comments on our outlook for the third quarter. With respect to the second quarter, as Craig just detailed, our sales reached $1.987 billion, which was a reduction from prior year prior year of just 1% in U.S. dollars, it was actually flat in local currencies and down just 3% organically. And this was driven by reductions in the automotive, commercial air, mobile networks and military markets, which were essentially offset by growth that we saw in the IT datacom, mobile devices and industrial markets. The declines that we saw in the quarter were largely related to the weakness in demand, disruptions and government mandated factory shutdowns that resulted all from the COVID-19 pandemic. We're, in particular, very pleased to have realized 7% sequential growth from the first quarter, which is substantially higher than our original expectations. The company booked $1.971 billion in orders, representing a book-to-bill of just under one to one. And very importantly, despite the significant disruptions to our operations in the quarter related to the pandemic, operating margins reached 18%, a very strong performance given this environment. As Craig just mentioned, Amphenol's financial position remains extremely strong, and that is reflected very well in our operating cash flow of $368 million in the quarter. I just want to say that I'm extremely proud of our team around the world. And our performance this quarter, once again, is a great reflection of the discipline and agility of Amphenol's entrepreneurial organization who has continued to perform well amidst the unprecedented challenges that have arisen throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. We're very pleased in the quarter to announce that we, just last week, closed the acquisition of Onanon, Inc. Onanon is based in California and has annual sales of approximately $20 million, and the company designs and manufactures a wide array of high-technology connectors and cable assemblies for customers in the industrial market and with a particular focus on medical related applications. As we welcome this outstanding new team to Amphenol, I remain very confident that our acquisition program will continue to create great value for the company. In fact, it is our ability to identify and execute upon acquisitions and successfully bring these new companies into Amphenol that remains a core competitive advantage for the company. Now, turning to our progress across our served markets, I just want to comment first that the value of the company's balanced and broad end market diversification has become even more evident during the COVID-19 pandemic. While several of our end markets were negatively impacted by the pandemic in the second quarter, that impact was essentially offset by growth that we achieved in other markets. Our diversification continues to mitigate the impact of volatility that can be seen in individual end markets and geographies, while at the same time exposing us to new opportunities as well as important new technology developments wherever they may arise across the electronics industry. In a dynamic and unpredictable environment like we're experiencing today, this diversification is a truly great asset for the company. Now, first, the military market represented 10% of our sales in the quarter. Sales were down by 12% compared to quarter. Sales were down by 12% compared to prior year as certain of our facilities faced production restrictions from government measures put in place to control the COVID-19 pandemic. Sequentially, our sales decreased as we had expected by about 20%. Looking into the third quarter, we expect sales to increase back to our first quarter levels as we look to recover to full production at most of our facilities that work in support of military customers. Our team focused on the military market has worked hard for many years to strengthen Amphenol's broad technology position while increasing our capacity to serve customers across all segments of this important market. Given the ongoing and continuing favorable military spending environment, the Amphenol team continues to solidify our leadership position by ensuring that we can execute on this increased demand, even amidst the disruptions that we experienced here in the second quarter. This enables us to continue to support the many next-generation technologies that are required for modern military hardware. The commercial air market represented 3% of our sales in the quarter. Second quarter sales declined by 41% from prior year, as the commercial aircraft market saw unprecedented declines in demand for new aircraft due to the disruptions to the global travel industry related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Sequentially, our sales decreased also by 41% from the first quarter. As we look ahead, we expect the commercial air market to continue to be negatively impacted by the significant reduction in demand for air travel that we are seeing across the world. Accordingly, we expect a further approximately 20% sequential reduction in our sales in this market in the third quarter. Regardless of the difficult environment in the commercial air market, our team remains committed to leveraging the company's strong technology position across a wide array of aircraft platforms and next-generation systems that are integrated into those aircraft and we remain well-positioned when this market ultimately returns to growth. In fact, it is in challenging times like this that our steadfast and reactive support for customers can create the most long-term value and thereby position us for long-term success. The industrial market represented 23% of our sales in the quarter and our performance in the second quarter was stronger than we had expected, with sales increasing by 12% in U.S. dollars and 8% organically. This growth was driven in particular by strength in the medical, instrumentation and heavy equipment segments, together with some contributions from our acquisitions that we completed last year. On a sequential basis, sales increased by a very strong 17% from the first quarter. I'd like to emphasize how proud I am of our team, in particular, working in support of medical applications within the industrial market. That team continues to work tirelessly to ramp up our production of sensors, connectors and interconnect assemblies to meet demand from a broad array of customers producing equipment that's used in support of medical treatment for COVID-19 patients. We're just very proud of them. This month's acquisition of Onanon further strengthens our broad high-technology offering for the medical equipment market. As we look into the third quarter, we expect a modest decline from these higher levels of sales. Nevertheless, we remain very pleased with the company's strong position in the worldwide industrial market. Through both our acquisition program as well as our organic innovations, we've developed a broad range of products across a diversified array of exciting industrial segments. We're proud of this success and look forward to realizing the benefits from our efforts in the industrial market for many years to come. The automotive market represented 11% of our sales in the quarter. Sales declined by a very significant 42% in U.S. dollars and 41% in local currency, as stay-at-home orders around the world reduced customer demand for new cars, and at the same time, as government restrictions across many countries resulted in factory shutdowns by automakers and their suppliers. Sequentially, our automotive sales decreased by 35%. As we look towards the third quarter, we now expect sales to the automotive market to substantially improve compared to the second quarter, as the industry begins to recover and as factories ramp up their production levels. However, we do not yet expect sales to reach last year's levels, as the global automotive industry continues to experience somewhat lower demand in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. Regardless of this very challenging time period for the automotive market, we remain confident in Amphenol's long-term position. We've expanded our range of interconnect, sensor and antenna products both organically and through acquisitions to enable a wide array of onboard electronics across a diversified range of vehicles made by auto manufacturers around the world. This consistent strategy will continue to benefit us as the automotive market recovers. The mobile devices market represented 14% of our sales in the quarter. Our sales to mobile device customers increased by 20% from prior year, as demand recovered after the three-week shutdown and subsequent month-long ramp-up of production that we saw in China during the first quarter. Sequentially, our sales in mobile devices increased by a very strong 47%, which was substantially better than our expectations had been coming into the quarter and which did reflect some catch-up of production after the first quarter shutdowns in China. Looking to the third quarter, we now expect a modest increase from these elevated second quarter levels. While 2020 has thus far seen substantial impacts on the mobile devices market from the pandemic, our long-term position in this market remains very robust. Amphenol's leading array of antennas, interconnect products and mechanisms continues to enable a broad range of next-generation mobile devices. And while there's no doubt that this market will always remain one of our most volatile, our outstanding and agile team is poised as always to capture any opportunities for incremental sales that may arise in 2020 and beyond. The mobile networks market represented 7% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in this market decreased by 20% from prior year and 23% organically, as we were impacted by reduced demand from wireless OEMs and particularly related to the U.S. government restrictions on certain Chinese entities that we discussed extensively in previous quarters. On a sequential basis, our sales increased by a stronger-than-expected 9% from the first quarter, driven essentially by higher sales to equipment manufacturers. For the third quarter, we expect sales in the mobile networks market to moderate from these levels on lower demand from both OEMs and service providers. Regardless of any near-term challenges in the mobile networks market, we're confident in the company's long-term position in this important and exciting industry. Our team continues to work aggressively to expand our opportunity with next-generation equipment and networks. As customers ramp up their investments for these advanced systems, we look forward to benefiting from the increased potential that comes from our unique position, with both equipment manufacturers and mobile service providers around the world. The information technology and data communications market represented 27% of our sales in the quarter, and sales in the second quarter for this market were much better than expected, rising from prior year by a very strong 37% in U.S. dollars and 32% organically, as increased data traffic drove both our OEM and service provider customers to significantly increase their demand across virtually all segments of the IT datacomm market. Sequentially, our sales increased by a very strong 43% from the first quarter. I just can't tell you enough how proud I am of our team working in the IT datacom market, who, despite facing production restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic in certain geographies, we\u2019re still able to react quickly to satisfy the significant increase in demand from our customers. As we look towards the third quarter, we now expect a roughly mid-teens sequential decline from the second quarter's very high levels. Our team's continued efforts at developing industry-leading products across a wide array of technologies, including, in particular, high-speed and power products, has positioned us to benefit from the continued demand for increased bandwidth that is likely to persist as individuals, companies, students and governments adjust interacting remotely. We remain encouraged by the company's strong technology position in the global IT datacom market and especially, given this increased demand for bandwidth, our customers around the world are driving their equipment to ever higher levels of performance, in order to manage these dramatic increases in demand. In turn, our team remains singularly focused on enabling this continuing revolution in IT datacom, through their ongoing development of a wide range of next-generation products. The broadband market represented 5% of our sales in the quarter. Sales increased by 3% in U.S. dollars and 5% organically from prior year, driven by stronger demand for home installation related equipment from broadband operators. On a sequential basis, sales increased by 12% from the first quarter. We expect sales in the third quarter to remain roughly at these levels as our operator customers continue to upgrade capacity in their networks to support the significant increase in demand for bandwidth, driven by online video and other remote school and work tools. We remain encouraged by the company's continually expanding range of products for the broadband market, together with our strong positions with customers around the world. And we continue to position ourselves as the most flexible supplier, thereby ensuring that the company can benefit as operators increase their network investments. Now turning for a moment to our outlook, the continued and significant economic and public health uncertainties created by the COVID-19 pandemic make it difficult to accurately forecast our performance in the second half of 2020. Accordingly, we will once again not be providing full year guidance. However, considering the current demand environment and assuming no new material disruptions from the pandemic as well as constant exchange rates. For the third quarter, we now expect sales in the range of $1.960 billion to $2 billion, and we expect adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $0.84 to $0.86. This guidance represents a sales decline versus prior year of 5% to 7% in U.S. dollars and a decrease versus prior year adjusted diluted EPS of 9% to 12%. Now let me just say, I'm extremely pleased by Amphenol's performance here in the second quarter, particularly in light of the many challenges our team has faced related to the COVID-19 pandemic. I remain very confident in the ability of our outstanding management team. To meet these challenges and to navigate these challenges, while capitalizing on the many current and future opportunities to grow our market position and expand our profitability. The Amphenol team around the world remains committed to fighting hard to secure the company's financial performance, all while dedicating ourselves to protecting the safety and health of all of our employees during this pandemic. And I would just like to finish by taking this opportunity to thank each and every one of the Amphenolians around the world for their dedication and their outstanding efforts here in the second quarter. And with that, operator, we'd be very happy to take any questions that there may be. Sure. Thanks, Amit. Yes. First, I think we're really happy with the operating margins. We certainly had in 2006 second quarter reaching 18% with the significant cost that we had due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the government mandates and the restrictions that impacted certainly our production and productivity. As we look into the third quarter, we still expect to have some of those costs impacting us. I mean, certainly, to a lesser extent, we had some improvements. We saw some improvements as we came through the second quarter. But we still have some of those headwinds as we're moving into the third quarter, just to a lesser degree. But -- and you can see that by the sequentially from second quarter to the third quarter improvement that we're, kind of, implying. I think your math is not so far off in terms of our implied margins as we look into the third quarter. If you look to your question, in terms of the impact from the first quarter of 2019 or even if you look at the fourth quarter of 2019, there's a couple of things that are impacting our margins in the third quarter. One would be certainly the COVID costs that we're still going to be incurring in the third quarter, albeit to a lesser degree. And then the other thing, if you're comparing to earlier in 2019, we still do have a little bit of headwind on margin related to certainly some of the acquisitions we did, we did nine acquisitions in 2019, all of which were -- or many of which were below our average margin. And that we're still continuing the journey to bringing up to the company average. As you can imagine, as we're going through a pandemic and all the things that they have to deal with to ensure that their businesses are maximizing their profitability, and given the -- in many cases, the revenue reductions, some of these actions aren't necessarily easy to implement in the current time. But we certainly have full expectations in the longer term that we still should be able to get them back up to the company average. So that really would be the bridge if you, kind of, were comparing earlier 2019 quarters to essentially the third quarter of 2020. But I have to say still, I'm extremely proud of the team, achieving 80% in the second quarter and then taking the actions that are needed to really sequentially get up to these higher levels that we do expect in the third quarter. We're really happy with those results. Well, thanks very much, Mark. Look, I talked already in my prepared remarks about the fact that in the second quarter, there was some degree of catch-up from the first quarter. And I just want to credit our team for what a fabulous job they did in recovering from the shutdown. As you know, well, our mobile devices business, virtually all of that is manufactured in China. And so when that was really having that comprehensive shutdown in the first quarter, that had a disproportionate impact on our mobile devices team and also on the manufacturing of our customers, in fact, at the same time. So, our team did a fabulous job of recovering, getting all the workforce back in place by really the beginning of March and then was able to really catch up with that demand here in the second quarter. And normally, we would not see a 47% increase in the second quarter. In fact, the second quarter -- sequentially. The second quarter tends to be a little bit more of a lull in the mobile device market, as you know, having followed the company for quite some time. So, I think if you take that out, that sort of anomaly here in the first half, we still have in the second half, great participation in many new programs. And whether those are 5G-related or otherwise, just the devices continue to get more complex; our team devices continue to do a great job in helping to enable those devices from a wide array of customers and ultimately puts us in a very strong position. I would say with the pandemic that there does appear to be a little bit of slippage in some programs that maybe would have normally launched a little bit earlier that may be combined with that disproportionate second quarter that we saw. I think if you factor all that out, you probably get to a little bit -- a little bit more normal-looking sequential outlook for mobile devices. But we continue to have a very strong position. We're excited about these next-generation programs that are coming, the new functionalities that are being put into the phones. And while we're never going to win everything, every new program is kind of a new jump ball for us. Our team has just done a fabulous job of supporting customers in good times and bad. And we're normally -- we have come to bat for our customers when they have a new launch and when others maybe can't support as well. The ramp-ups -- here we came to bat for our customers during a pandemic when everything was very chaotic in the first half and our team just kept their head down, kept focused, made sure that we had the right resources in place, the right capabilities to meet what our customers needed. And I think that puts us in a strong position to the extent that there are opportunities for incremental volumes or incremental programs in the near and the long-term, I think we'll be well-positioned to take advantage of those. Yes. Well, thanks so much, Craig. I mean, we're really excited. It's not a big company on and on, but it's a great company. And I think it is a wonderful reflection of our approach to acquisitions. We have taken for a long, long time that very patient approach of incubating relationships with a wide array of companies around the industry and around the world, developing relationships, developing real mutual trust between us and the owners of these entrepreneurial companies, such that when it is appropriate and when they have -- they have sort of crossed the kind of canyon, if you will, of deciding that they want to sell their company, we don't have to build that trust from scratch. We've already established those wonderful relationships. Because the fact is in a pandemic, when we're all socially distancing, creating new relationships from scratch is harder, its much harder to do. And so this was not in the case of Onanon. A book that showed up from a banker, and we said, well, who are these people? Well, you can't meet them. None of that happened. We had long-standing interactions with the entrepreneurs who founded this company and who, by the way, stay on as now the general manager of that company going forward. And so we're very excited about that. The second thing is this is a company that has just a really unique technology proposition, unique products that go into exciting areas of the industrial market, in particular, into medical technology. And we \u2013 I talked earlier about the strength of our medical business in the quarter, it's not that we saw that strength and thereby said, oh, let's go buy Onanon because it's a medical company, that\u2019s more coincidental. But I think the fact is is they are a company that is present in next-generation electronics, used in a wide array of applications that are exciting and that are important. And we are very proud to bring them into the Amphenol family. The overall M&A environment in a pandemic, it's different. As you can imagine, you're going to be more careful. You're going to make sure you know the people. You're going to make sure that the business has resilience to it in a time like this. But all that being said, we continue to have a strong pipeline and, you know, Craig, Craig mentioned before, we acquired nine companies last year, I don't know that we're going to do that this year with the pandemic so far in the first half but we're very pleased that we were able to make this one and bring them into the Amphenol family, and we're very hopeful that there will be more to come in the future. Thanks so much, Matt. Great question. Look, I don't know that I would all the demand a pull-in. But I would call the demand that we saw for COVID related medical equipment, in particular, things like ventilator, respiratory therapy devices, patient monitoring for new hospital construction, things like that, that was very, very significant demand. There's no doubt about it. Is that a pull in? I mean, it didn't exist before, this demand. So it was all new demand, the world never built as many ventilators as the world is now building. And I don't know that pull in would be necessarily the right term for that, but there was definitely a rush to build. And from our perspective, what our team just did such a great job of is massively increasing their capacity to support that demand when oftentimes, our competitors could not do so. And I can't tell you the number of calls I've had with customers, letters of gratitude from customers, dozens, if not hundreds of programs in support of COVID, where our team just pulled out all the stops and made it happen. And we worked with companies who never built medical equipment before. We've worked with long-term medical companies. We've worked directly with governments around the world, who are building strategically their medical infrastructure. And these are all things that were not just, sort of, a one-time situation, but rather is an ongoing recognition that the world just didn't have enough of a certain type of medical equipment to deal with the respiratory borne pathogen. And I'm guessing that, that is not a situation that people around the world want to face again. Now, are we seeing a shift from more COVID-focused medical equipment to the more elective surgical? I mean, there's no question that early in the quarter, we did see a little bit softer demand for products that are used in purely elective fashion. I wouldn't say that, that was material. And obviously, despite that, our medical business within industrial did really, really well. I mean this is outstanding performance. Is that balancing a little bit more here coming into the third quarter? Yeah, I guess that would probably be a fair way to put it. I mean, we expect, as I said earlier, in the third quarter, we expect our sales to be at or a little bit below the levels that they were in the second quarter. These are very, very high levels of consumption. And our team continues to work hard to make sure that we can satisfy that demand. And if there's a little bit of a more broad demand for some of those things that were earlier push back, that may be the case. But look, we're just really proud of what the team has done here in medical. Yeah. Thanks so much, Samik. Look, I think that we came into the quarter, as you will recall, on the heels of very, very significant orders that we had in Q1. We had the highest book-to-bill in the history of the company and the third highest orders, absolute order volume in the history of the company. I think it was $2.150 billion. And so it's not surprising to me. It was not surprising to us that our orders would more level at or around our sales levels here in the second quarter. In fact, I would have told you that, after such a big order number, it wouldn't have surprised me if the orders were actually a little bit lower than the sales levels. And that was probably our expectation coming into the quarter that orders would have been a little bit lower. So I'd say that the fact that we outperformed on sales and met \u2013 nearly met those sales levels with orders, is a good reflection of the demand from our customers. In terms of the cadence throughout the quarter, I wouldn't say that there's anything so notable. The middle of the quarter is probably a little lighter than the beginning and the end of the quarter. That's maybe the only thing I would say. And regional, I don't think there was anything abnormal or anomalous from a regional perspective relative to orders. Yes. Thanks so much, Wamsi. Well, I'll point to a couple of markets to describe this and maybe with a little bit more specificity. I talked already about mobile devices. Where I would say that, the demand that we saw in the second quarter did reflect some catch-up from the disruption that we experienced in China in the first quarter, so that maybe one piece of the puzzle. I think the second is, I would talk about IT datacom and I mentioned that we expect IT datacom, expect that market to be down in the kind of mid-teens quarter-to-quarter, and that is just a reflection of the extraordinary level of demand that we had here in the second quarter. I mean these are still very, very high levels of IT datacom demand in the third quarter. Traditionally, you would see IT datacom strengthening into the second half. And the fact that there was this very significant and I would say, incremental demand, not pull ahead per se. Again, this is that nuance of a pull-in, the bandwidth requirements that emerged in the second quarter and even late in the first quarter was not customers around the world saying, 'Oh, we had originally planned to put this bandwidth in, in the second half, let's put it in the first half. This is a new demand for bandwidth because all of us are on video calls all the time because all of us are working from home, schools are teaching remotely and governments are working remotely. Hospitals are communicating remotely. I mean just an intense demand for bandwidth that nobody knew was going to exist as of January 22, which was the day before Wuhan was locked down for the pandemic. And so that's -- I wouldn't call that a pull-in, I would call that incremental demand that was very significant in the second quarter that we uniquely were able to satisfy from our customers and that moderates somewhat in the third quarter, but moderates still to a very high level of demand. And I think those are probably the biggest areas where -- which impacts the sequential guidance into the third quarter. Without that, otherwise, you would probably be looking at a much more typical and even little bit of recovery coming into the second quarter because I also talked about the fact that we see a very strong recovery in military in the second quarter. We see a very strong recovery in automotive, those two markets, which were more dramatically impacted. Where we don't see that recovery is in commercial air, luckily for us that's a much smaller percent of our sales and has much less impact. But if you think about the markets that were deeply impacted by the pandemic in the quarter, we see very strong recoveries from both military and from automotive, but not from com air. So I think you take all that together, kind of put it into the calculator and you end up with a guide that we have, which I think is a very strong guide, but does reflect essentially at similar levels, roughly similar levels to what we achieved here in the second quarter. Yeah. Well, thanks so much, Nikolay. I mean, as I've said before, we don't have perfect visibility into our customers' warehouses and to how much inventory they have. We get a little bit of visibility from our distributors, but distributors represent just a bit over 15% of our sales. And I would tell you, vis-\u00e0-vis our distributors, the inventory levels are very healthy. There's nothing abnormal about them. I wouldn't say that they ticked up or ticked down in any meaningful way here in the second quarter. I mean as it relates to IT datacom, again, I don't know the numbers, but I can tell you, I would be pretty surprised if our customers in IT datacom put anything that we ship to them on the shelf of a warehouse. I mean, this was a dramatic need for product to be put in the field so that people like you and I would not see a spinning circle when we turn to Netflix on in the evening. And if it's sitting in -- if our product is sitting in a warehouse, it's not helping someone get bandwidth. And so I would be very surprised if any of that stuff ended up building inventory. Mobile devices is really -- there's very little inventory in the whole channel. So I don't think that that's one that I would note. And relative to industrial, I think industrial is the one market for us, especially when you take out medical, where we have a little bit of a higher proportion of distribution. And so there, I guess, I could be have a little bit more visibility than normal, and I would tell you that the inventory levels seemed healthy and reasonable and no abnormal changes as we came into, or out of the quarter, at least relative to the distribution side of our industrial business. Hello, Deepa. Thank you very much, Deepa. Well, look, it should not surprise anybody that after the first quarter where because of the pandemic, our China operations were shutdown for three weeks and then ramping up over the course of the following month that there was significant sequential increase in our sales in Asia and in general and specifically in China. I mean, that is normal. And mobile devices is the best example of that, which is essentially all fulfilled in China, and that grew 47% sequentially. You talked about, is that momentum tied to the U.S. and Europe, or just broadly around the world, all -- most of the mobile devices in the world are made in China, the vast majority. And so to the extent that people in U.S. or Europe buy more or less phones, that's going to impact demand there. So I guess in that market, I would say that's the case. The IT datacom market is another one where there is more -- there's a certain degree of production in China that shift around the world. And so again, I think that would be one where it's not just a Chinese domestic market. Now, I know you've alluded to kind of decoupling and -- which is a little bit of a different topic than just the kind of recovery in the second quarter. And I'll just say one thing about that. We read the papers like everybody. We're very close to all of the geopolitics of the moment. And I've said before and I will just say it again here today. The way that we organize our company has always been. We are a global company, but we rely on local management around the world to execute. That is we give authority to our more than 120 general managers around the world to make all the decisions that they need to make in order to adapt to their local markets. And we don't have expats. We have local people in every geography. We have Indians in India; Germans in Germany; French people in France; and Chinese people in China; Americans in the U.S. And that approach has always been a very, very successful approach in a globalizing world, but it is equally successful and equally powerful in a world which is decoupling, so to speak, or fragmenting or becoming more nationalistic or whatever -- however, you would like to term that. And our people in every country that they operate are viewed very much as a local supporter of those customers. Even if behind them, the customers know that they have the strength, the breadth, the financial stability, the resources of a global company, and that puts us in really a best of both world's position. And so to the extent the relations between one country and another start to deteriorate -- whatever that is, we at Amphenol remain very agnostic to that. I mean yes, do I want -- do I think the world personally is better if everybody gets along? Sure. That I would be lying if I said the opposite. But can Amphenol succeed regardless? There is no doubt about it. That's how we've turned this company. That's how we've built the culture of this company. That's how our organization is equipped. And I think in the current world, it really creates actually an opportunity for our company long-term. We're not going to shy away from the fact that we're an American headquartered company that we're traded on the New York Stock Exchange. But we are always going to make sure that our customers in every geography get from us the superior presence of a local team and all what that entails. And so I think to the extent that this decoupling happens, it is what it is. It's well above my pay grade, I can tell you. But we're going to make sure that our team can manage either way to find great success. Hi Steve. Thanks so much, Steve. Look I would say that if you compare broadband and mobile networks in kind of the acute situation of the last, let's call it, four months, five, four and a half or so months where everybody has been working from home, I think the pressure has been more on the core Internet, the pressure has been more on the broadband service providers than it has been necessarily on the mobile service providers. And I say that because the fact is the real bandwidth constraints have come from people at home, where the vast majority of the people still today at home are not using wireless broadband as a means to deliver high-speed Internet to their house. Now that can change. And I think maybe this whole situation is going to be a catalyst for that long-term to change, because I can tell you, myself, and I won't name my cable operator. They are all wonderful but it was not always easy over the last four months. When I had two or three kids in the house, all on Zoom calls, when I was on Zoom Call, my wife was on Zoom Call, I mean \u2013 or Teams or Google or whatever, I mean, we're all on video calls and that was not always perfect. And then my son decides to play a video game and all of a sudden, the whole thing just freezes up. And so the fact is there is a real rush to help that at-home capacity over the last quarter. And I think that was reflected more in what we saw with broadband growing 12% quarter-to-quarter as opposed to mobile networks. Because in mobile networks, what we saw was really a growth from our OEM customers, and we grew 9% sequentially, which was very strong, given that. Some of that a little bit coming out of China, where some of the equipment providers in China were, of course, shut down. But in terms of our work directly with service providers, the strength really came in broadband and in IT datacom in the second quarter. Now what does that mean long term? I do believe that long term, the fact of this pandemic coming at the same time as 5G is really beginning to be constructed, it is probably a good thing. It's going to mean ultimately that we're going to have a variety of means to get broadband data to our homes. And that is not just confined to cable systems, to telco operators, to mobile operators. But there's also satellite Internet being put up in a relatively big way by certain pretty famous operators. I mean, there's a lot going on here to make sure that our \u2013 that homes can have much better bandwidth capacity than they may have in the past. And regardless of where it is, you know this well, you've covered us for a long, long time, Steve. I mean, our approach has never been to bet on one of those ways of getting high speed. It's been \u2013 our approach has always been, let's make sure we're present everywhere. Let's make sure we're present with the broadband operators. Let's make sure we're present with the mobile network operators. Let's make sure we're present with the web service providers. Let's make sure we're present with satellite-based Internet. Whatever it may be, and I think as long as we maintain that high-technology partnership with customers across each of those areas, we're going to be well positioned as the world continues to build the infrastructure for bandwidth to homes, to offices, to governments, to hospitals and everywhere around the world. Well, thanks, Will. No, I mean, I would tell you that as we came out of last quarter, I mean, you'll recall, the first quarter was really a story of China and the very significant kind of one-off of the factories there. It was without equal. There was no essential business. There was nothing. It was just \u2013 they were shut down for three weeks. And then you had to reopen through a very complex and cumbersome process, actually, to prove that you were protecting your people, and we did just a great job of that, and thereby, we're able to open maybe a little bit faster than some others. But as the virus spread around the world to the nearly 40 countries in which we operate, there was a whole range of restrictions that ultimately did impact our capacity, our productivity in a whole variety of countries and not just the nearly 40 countries, but even here in the U.S., we operate in dozens of states in the U.S. and every state had a slightly different approach. I remember very well the day that the very first restrictions were taken, and that was not even a state level restriction. It was a county. Where Contra Costa, and I think it was Alameda counties in California adopted the very first real significant business restrictions to enable better social distancing and to stop the spread of the virus. And so, our teams around the world in our more than 200 facilities, it's hard to find one where we didn\u2019t, at one point, face something during the quarter where the team had to somehow navigate a government restriction or actually just us taking measures to protect the people that were important and appropriate measures to protect our people. And so, no doubt about it, in the quarter, there were significant expenses that we incurred. Craig talked about those. And there was also impact on our capacity in a variety of ways. And I talked about that in a few of our markets, but the one in particular that I mentioned was in military, where our sales were down 20%, and that had nothing to do with demand. That was all to do with navigating the variety of restrictions that were put in place in a variety of countries and our team just did a fabulous job of doing so. Now as we came out of the quarter, I would say that it's a much better situation. It's not totally done. There we still have a number or, let's say, several places around the world that are still facing some restrictions. And who knows? To the extent that the later part of the year or the latter part of the year, brings a further acceleration of the virus. Ultimately, we all know that the only way to control this virus is for people to wear masks and to have social distancing. And that ultimately may require governments to implement, again, restrictive measures that can have an impact on our customers and can have an impact on us. And that's one of the levels of uncertainty that, to be honest, makes it difficult for us to give a full year guidance. So who knows what will come? I cross my fingers and my toes that that it doesn't get worse, but I'm realistic enough to know that this is a virus that doesn't just kind of stop magically. It stops through social distancing. It stops through mask wearing. That's what our people are doing. And to the extent that governments around the world have problems that they face, where the virus gets out of control, they won't surprise me, if ultimately, there is an impact on the production of products, on businesses being able to operate. And we're not necessarily immune to that. But regardless, there's no doubt about it that in this kind of very unique world, a world where we've never had to deal with governments telling you, you can or cannot open your factories. Our team just did an amazing job of navigating those very tricky shoals here in the quarter. And if something else were to come, I'm sure they'll do the same great job. Good afternoon. Well look, these are all exciting things. And I remember years ago, when we were working on the first electric cars that we worked on as it -- I wonder if there's ever going to be an electric car that people will actually own and drive. And now I look out in our parking lot here because I have a beautiful view of our parking lot out of my office window, and I see a few of these electric cars, more than I ever did before. So you talked about something like hydrogen or fuel cells, you talked about alternative energy sources of whatever for cars. I think long term, there will be new drivetrains. I think there will be new technologies. And I think regardless of what it is, the great thing about these revolutionary new technologies is that they always require a new type of interconnect. They require a more ruggedized, they require a higher technology solutions. And so they create opportunities for our company. They create opportunities for our whole industry. And I think that's a really good thing. Now I thought you're going to ask Joe, that given the pandemic and social distancing, is that going to have an impact on these things? I think there's a chance. Look, I'm not the one to tell you which way the auto market is going to go and which way drivetrains are going to go. But these last 6 months here, and it is really 6 months ago from tomorrow that Wuhan was shutdown. These have been really unbelievable, an unbelievable time period of change. It's causing people to reassess everything. I compare it at home to it like someone throws a bag of flower in the air and you just don't know where the flower is going to land, but it will eventually land somewhere. And I do believe that people are totally reassessing aspects of their life. And some of those may ultimately result in driving these trends accelerate a bit more. And what I mean by that? Well, take public transport. I'm a huge fan of public transport, anybody should be. But the fact is, once you know that an invisible thing like a virus can be spread through a dense public transport. On the margin, it's going to probably cause people to use public transport a little bit less and that's not great for the environment. But at the same time, people are waking up to these kind of existential threats, having a pandemic really makes you very quickly get clarity on things that can affect your life. And the environment is clearly one of those things. And I believe that it will be a missed opportunity for people not to, sort of, wake up a little bit about the environment. So you take that combination of maybe people wanting to be a little bit more in the privacy and the sanctity of their own vehicles, together with a little bit of a wake-up call about existential threats to humanity would make one think a little bit more about a hydrogen fuel cell, for example, or electric vehicle or something like that. Now I don't want to go totally off the reservation on this discussion. But the fact is, is this time period can be a catalyst for change, and a lot of that change can be very exciting change. And regardless of what it's going to be our company, I believe, is very well-positioned to take part in that, to capitalize upon it and help to enable it. Yeah. I mean, look, I guess there's a little bit of each, Shawn. I would say that if you're a big company who is dealing with massive increases, a bandwidth demand, and you're facing constrained capital. You may be allocating some of that capital towards that bandwidth as opposed to expansion of a next-generation mobile network. And I think there's a little bit of that on the margin. There's been a lot of corporate goings and comings. I think a lot of those things have been settled now. But I think it's a little bit of each as we come here into the third quarter. Look, I think long-term, our outlook for this market remains to be a very positive one. We have a strong position, both with OEMs and operators. And in particular, a strong position, on next-generation systems. We've had that difficult comparison for a couple of quarters now because of the restrictions that were put in place in China, and that will continue here for really through this year. But by and large, I would tell you that we still have a very positive outlook for the market long-term. And there's a couple of dynamics that you described are probably a pretty good way to capture what's happening here in the third quarter. Thanks so much, Jim. Well, look, 5G, and I think I've talked about this in the past, the good news about 5G is 5G is not a replacement to prior modes of devices communicating with networks; it's a supplement because you cannot just have a device which only communicates using 5G. It would be useless outside of just a couple of areas. And you have this kind of chicken and egg that you can't -- the network is not useful without the devices, but the devices are also not useful without the network. And thus, the devices have to be backwards compatible all the way through all the generations. You drive from Manhattan to San Francisco and in between there, you're going to go through a lot of areas that may not even have 4G, LTE, may not even have 3G. And maybe it will still be 2G kind of a communication and so -- but your phone still have to work. You still have to be able to call 911 and you still have to be able to look on Google Maps and these kind of things. And so the fact is, is adding a 5G functionality increases the complexity of the device. Now, that's a generality. Obviously, each device itself, each customer, each program is going to have a different architecture, a different approach to designing that. And whether that's going to cause more connectors or cable assemblies, or less, more antennas or less, more mechanisms or less, you cannot draw just a very perfect generalization about that. You can say that in its totality, you would expect 5G to add to the complexity and would expect that that would create further opportunities. But you can't assure yourself that on each program, that's going to be the case. So, I think 5G net-net is a great positive, and it's a great positive for us, not just in the devices, but it's also a positive because we work in the networks. And it's also a positive because we work in the core -- at the core Internet where we have such a strong position as well. And so we think 5G has the potential to impact virtually all of the segments of our business. You talk about Internet in factories, and you talk about adopting high-speed data into new medical devices, you talk about how it works even in the military, what the military is going to do when you have 5G functionality, all of these things are creating new applications, new functionalities, which ultimately are going to need new interconnect solutions that Amphenol can provide. So the long-term prospects, I think, from 5G are very pervasive and very positive. Ultimately, is a given phone or a given tablet going to have more or less of the things that we sell? It's impossible to say in the short-term. Thanks so much, David. Look, I think from our perspective, I don't see a risk to our team ramping up. Our team is just so nimble. They're flexing their capabilities. We saw that even during the course of the second quarter, if you think about the trajectory of the auto market, just within the second quarter. I can tell you, April was not the most fun month to be an automotive interconnect supplier. That's for sure. But by the time we came into June, we were already starting to see some recovery of momentum, and our team is able to flip a switch and really be running to satisfy that demand. Now your question about market share, I will tell you, and I'm going to broaden this to be beyond automotive. This is an existential crisis for many. I talked during my prepared remarks and we've talked so many times about the strength of the diversity of Amphenol. And you couple that with the financial fortitude that Craig has just done such an amazing job of ensuring inside this company and that has created ultimately a resilience to Amphenol that is, I believe, second to none. There are many in our industry and in other industries, but in our industry, who are more focused. And those focused companies, to the extent that they're on the wrong side of the market volatility that can create a more existential threat, and it can create in the eyes of customers, a perception of an existential threat. And that ultimately may, over time, create a kind of a draw to those customers to work with a company that demonstrates resilience in the time of true crisis. And I think in that respect, Amphenol comes out really passing that test with flying colors. And so I wouldn't just confine that to automotive, I would say, across all of our markets, our customers have seen in Amphenol, a company that can deal with the crisis like no other, and they want to have that. There's been so much talked about supply chain resiliency and as opposed to sort of efficiency versus longevity kind of that debate that people have had. And I think we've always strived to give our customers both, tried to give them a great offering of the best products at competitive prices, but also from a company that's going to be around regardless of what crisis hits us. And I think that can be a positive long-term and in particular, in a crisis that was \u2013 where the catalyst for that crisis is a public health emergency. It almost brings more focus to that dynamic than ever before. And so I think long term, that can create an opportunity for our company across all the markets, including automotive. Yes. Thanks so much, Joe. I mean, look, we don't break out every detail of all of our industrial market. It would be \u2013 it would make this phone call to go for hours. But I will tell you that we had strong performance in a number of our important industrial segments beyond medical. I mentioned, specifically instrumentation, heavy equipment. We had great performance also in our sort of battery related applications for heavy vehicles. And conversely, we had other parts of the industrial market that were more impacted, things like oil and gas, as I referred to before. But medical was not the only story in industrial. And I think we would have still had a good performance in industrial, even without that medical, especially if you think about on a sequential basis, growing 17% sequentially in that market. I mean, that that could not have come from just one piece of that industrial puzzle, which was medical. So I think we still have strong positions across industrial. And what has really been the basis of our industrial market is the diversification within that very, very broad market, and what ties industrial all together, remains, these are just harsh environment applications, where you're taking high technology interconnect and sensor products, antenna products, and you're putting them into very inhospitable environments. Everything from down in oil wells, to a very clean ICU in a hospital and everything in between, and we have great performance in many segments of that market. And the diversity within that market I think helps us to have that strong performance. Well, thank you very much and thanks to everybody for your attention to Amphenol today and just like to take this opportunity to wish you all a good summer. I hope you get some well deserved vacation time this summer. You'll need it to come back fully recharged for the second half and Craig and I look forward to speaking to you all 90 days from now. Thanks again."

Following today\u2019s presentation, there will be a formal question-and-answer session. Until then, all lines will remain in a listen-only mode. At the request of the company, today\u2019s conference is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to introduce today's conference host, Mr. Craig Lampo. Sir, you may begin.\nCraig Lampo: Thank you very much. Good afternoon, everyone. This is Craig Lampo, Amphenol's CFO and I'm here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO. We would like to welcome you to our first quarter 2020 conference call. As a reminder, during the call, we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures and may make certain forward-looking statements. So please refer to the relevant disclosures in our press release for further information. But before I review the financial performance for the quarter, Adam would like to say a few words.\nAdam Norwitt: Well, thank you very much Craig. And first and foremost, I wanted to express my hope to everybody that's here on the phone today that you and your family, your friends and your colleagues are all staying safe and healthy amidst the current COVID-19 crisis. As Craig just mentioned, I'm going to comment on the current environment. I'll discuss also some of our highlights from the first quarter. I'll then turn it over to Craig to provide further detail on our financial performance. And then finally, I'll come back to me to discuss the trends and progress across our served markets, and I'll make a few comments about the future.  No question that we're living in truly unprecedented times as the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted all of us around the world in really extraordinary ways. Here at Amphenol, our first priority from the earliest day has been to ensure the safety and wellbeing of our employers, our suppliers, our customers and the many communities in which we operate around the world. And I'm sure that this pandemic has also personally impacted many of you on the phone here today just like it has really everyone around the world. Our company began to see the impacts from the outbreak at the time of the government restrictions that were imposed by China starting with the shutdown of Wuhan on January 23rd. While we don't have any facilities in Wuhan, our team successfully navigated an unprecedented three weeks shutdown of our 50 manufacturing operations in China. And I just wanted to mention here how truly proud I am of our entire China team, who were able to return to full production level by the beginning of March, substantially earlier than we had originally expected. As the COVID-19 virus has continued to spread around the world, Amphenol\u2019s entire global team has been focused on executing amidst very challenging market conditions and quickly evolving government measures to control the pandemic, all whilst clearly prioritizing the safety and health of our more than 75,000 employees around the world.  To that end, we early on proactively instituted significant measures to protect our employees, which has ultimately enabled us as a company to continue to operate throughout this pandemic. I'm truly proud of the Amphenol organization who despite these unprecedented conditions have continued to execute as Amphenolians always do, including by supporting our communities around the world when they need us the most. We've donated hundreds of thousands of masks to local hospitals, reconditioned machines to produce our own face mask, dedicated 3D printers to help make face shield, significantly expanded our production of components used in ventilators and other critical equipment and ramped up the capacity of our high speed and power product to support the expanded bandwidth needs around the world. And these are just a few of the many, many initiatives that have been taken by our more than 120 operations around the world. And I just wanted to take this opportunity to thank each and every one of our Amphenol employees around the world for their dedication, resolve, agility and focus amidst this most challenging and uncertain times.  Now turning to the first quarter, as I'm sure you all well know, due to the widespread disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, on February 24th, we withdrew our first quarter guidance that had been issued at the time of our January earnings release. Despite this, I'm very proud of the results that the company has ultimately achieved in this uniquely challenging quarter. Our sales reached $1.862 billion, a reduction of 5% in U.S. dollars versus prior year and 9% organically. And that was driven by lower sales in the mobile devices, mobile networks, IT datacom, automotive and industrial markets. These declines largely related to the COVID-19 disruptions in China, including, in particular, the approximately three weeks shutdown of all of our manufacturing operations in that country. I'm very pleased that the company booked $2.150 billion in orders in the first quarter, and that represented a book-to-bill of 1.15 to 1, the highest level in the modern history of the Corporation. And despite the significant disruptions to our operations in the quarter, adjusted operating margins held up very well, reaching 17%. Amphenol financial position is extremely strong, with operating cash flow of $384 million in the first quarter, supporting the company's excellent liquidity which includes a substanti $2.4 billion in cash and cash equivalents at quarter-end. Craig will give more details on this in a few moments.  Just like to close by saying I'm extremely proud of our team and that our performance this quarter once again reflects the discipline and agility of our entrepreneurial organization as we continue to perform well amidst the truly unprecedented challenges related to the COVID-19 crisis.  And with that, I'll turn it over to Craig to review our financial performance and then come back in a few moments to talk about our end markets. Craig, please. \nCraig Lampo : Thanks a lot, Adam. So as Adam just reviewed the company closed the first quarter with sales of $1.862 billion and with GAAP and adjusted diluted EPS of $0.79 and $0.71 respectively. Sales were down 5% in U.S. dollars and 4% in local currencies compared to first quarter of 2019. And from an organic standpoint excluding both acquisitions and currency impacts, sales in the first quarter decreased 9%.  Sequentially sales were down 13% in U.S. dollars and local currency and organically. Breaking down sales into our two segments. The interconnect business, which comprise 96% of our sales was down 5% in U.S. dollars and 4% in local currencies compared to last year. Our cable business, which comprise 4% of our sales, was down 13% in U.S. dollars and 11% in local currencies compared to the first quarter of last year. Adam will comment further on strength by market in few minutes.  Operating income was $317 million for the first quarter of 2020 and operating margin was 17% which was down 310 basis points compared to the first quarter of 2019. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2019, operating margin decreased 300 basis points. The reduction in operating margins reflected a negative conversion rate higher than our typical 30% downside conversion. This elevated conversion was primarily driven by the impact on the first quarter of the COVID-19 pandemic on production and productivity, particularly due to the various government restrictions that limit our ability to adjust payroll costs.  From a segment standpoint, in the Interconnect segment, margins were 19.1% in the first quarter of 2020 which was down compared to 22% for both the first and fourth quarters of 2019. In the Cable segment, margins were 7.6% which is down compared to 11% in the first quarter of 2019 and 10% in the fourth quarter of 2019.  Despite the year-over-year and sequential operating margin decline, we are proud of this quarter's performance given the unprecedented challenges created by the COVID-19 pandemic. Our team's ability to minimize the negative margin impact from this crisis is a direct result of the strength and commitment of the company's enterpreneurial management team, which continues to foster a high performance action-oriented culture and thereby maximize both growth and profitability in an uncertain market environment.  Interest expense for the quarter was $29 million which compares to $30 million in the first quarter last year. And the company's adjusted effective tax rate was 24.5% for both the first quarter of 2020 and 2019 respectively. The adjusted effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2020 excluded a discrete tax benefit of $20 million due to refunds in certain non-U.S. tax jurisdictions and the resulting adjustments to deferred taxes, as well as an excess tax benefit of $5 million associated with stock option exercises during the quarter.  The adjusted effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2019 excludes the impact of acquisition related costs partially offset by the impact of the excess tax benefit associated with stock option exercises during the quarter. The company's GAAP effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2020 including the items just mentioned was 15.9% compared to 22.8% in first quarter of 2019. Adjusted net income was a strong 12% of sales in the first quarter of 2020, another confirmation of the strength of the company's financial performance.  On a GAAP basis diluted EPS declined by 9% in the first quarter to $0.79, compared to $0.87 in the first quarter of 2019. Adjusted diluted EPS declined 20% to $0.71 in the first quarter of 2020 from $0.89 in the first quarter of 2019.  As Adam mentioned, orders for the quarter were $2.150 billion, which was up 7% compared to the first quarter of 2019, resulting in a record book-to-bill ratio of 1.15 to 1. Despite the extremely challenging environment, the company continues to be an excellent generator of cash. Cash flow from operations was $384 million in the first quarter or 177% of adjusted net income and net of capital spending of $61 million, our free cash flow was $323 million or 149% of adjusted net income. From a working capital standpoint, inventory, accounts receivable and accounts payable were $1.3 billion, $1.5 billion and $817 million respectively at the end of March. And inventory days, days sales outstanding and payable days were 92, 75 and 57 days respectively. While DSO and DPO were both in the normal range, DSI was slightly elevated due to the lower sales levels in the first quarter, which were driven primarily by the extended shutdown of production in China as well as the production challenges in other parts of the world. Due to the current crisis, we do expect inventory days to remain somewhat elevated, while sales levels are depressed, but to come back down to normal levels as business returns to a more typical pattern. The COVID-19 pandemic created significant uncertainty -- significant economic uncertainty and volatility in the credit and capital markets during the first quarter of 2020. As a result and as mentioned in our earnings release, as an abundance of caution, in late March, the company proactively bought $1.25 billion under our $2.5 billion revolving credit facility. In addition, due to the significant volatility in the commercial paper markets, the company decided to reduce its reliance on the public commercial paper markets, and as such, approximately half of the proceeds from the revolving credit facility is allocated to repay amounts due under our commercial paper programs. During the first quarter our cash flow from operations of $384 million along with net proceeds from our various credit facilities of $1.36 billion, proceeds from our recently completed bond offering of $400 million and proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $30 million were used primarily to repurchase $257 million of the company's stock at an average price approximately $96, fund repayments under our commercial paper programs of $250 million, fund dividend payments of $74 million, fund net capital expenditure of $60 million, fund acquisitions of $16 million and fund distributions to and purchases of non-controlling interests of $8 million. At March 31st cash and short-term investments were $2.4 billion, of which $1.4 billion was held in the U.S. This elevated level of cash was driven by $400 million on hand from proceeds of the February bond offering, which was subsequently used to fund the $400 million bond maturity at due on April 1st. And the previously noted drawdown of our credit facilities in excess of our current or expected cash needs in order to fund the decision to reduce our reliance on the commercial paper market and to provide a cash buffer during this period of extreme market volatility.  At March 31st there was $1.36 billion outstanding under our credit facilities as well as $138 million of outstanding commercial paper remaining that will come due in April and be repaid with cash on hand. As a result, total debt at March 31st was $5.1 billion and net debt at March 31 was $2.7 billion which was unchanged from the net debt level as of December 31, 2019.  Total cash on hand as well as the remaining availability under our credit facilities was $3.6 billion at the end of the quarter which leaves the company in a very strong liquidity position. The first quarter 2020 EBITDA was $403 million and the pro forma net leverage ratio was 1.4 times.  In summary, although this was certainly a much more challenging quarter than we had anticipated coming into the year, we finished the quarter in a position of real financial strength and with a very strong balance sheet and liquidity position. We believe this financial strength coupled with company's broad market and geographic diversity positions us well for the current more volatile environment which is characterized by moderating demand and continued uncertainty across global markets.  And with that, I will now turn it over to Adam who will provide some commentary on current market trends. \nAdam Norwitt: Thank you very much Craig. Craig just mentioned the value that we see in the company's balanced and broad end-market diversification. And I can just tell you that, that value is even more clearer in the times like we're living in today. In the quarter, no single end market represented more than 21% of our sales. This diversification continues to mitigate the impact of the volatility of individual end markets and geographies, while also exposing us to leading technologies where ever they may arise across the electronics industry. And this is just a great asset in a dynamic and unpredictable environment like we are experiencing today.  Now turning to our end market, the military market represented 14% of our sales in the quarter. Sales again few very strongly from prior year increasing by a bit less than expected 18% in the first quarter. And this was driven by growth across virtually all segments of the military market including, in particular, helicopters, space, military vehicles and avionics applications. Sequentially, our sales decreased by 5% from the fourth quarter.  Looking now into the second quarter, we expect sales to decrease from the first quarter level. A certain of our facilities that support military customers are operating with reduced staffing as a result of governmental restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Nevertheless, our team focused on the military market has worked hard for many years to strengthen our position across the market while increasing our capacity to serve customers really in all segments of the military market. The company's continued strong performance is a great reflection of the results of those efforts.  Given the ongoing favourable military spending environment, our team continues to solidify our leadership position by ensuring that we execute on the demand that we see in support of the many next generation technologies that are required for modern military hardware.  The commercial aerospace market represented 5% of our sales in the quarter, and our sales were down slightly as production volumes declined, and as overall demand from commercial aircraft manufacturers began to experience the negative impact of the COVID-19 crisis late in the quarter. Sequentially, our sales decreased by 10% from the fourth quarter, which was a bit more than we had expected coming into the first quarter.  There's no doubt that the commercial air market has been significantly impacted by the rapid and unprecedented reduction in air travel around the world. Accordingly, we do expect a further reduction in sales as customers shutdowns and reduced demand for air travel impacts overall aircraft production volumes. Regardless of the difficult environment that we're seeing in the commercial air market today, our team working in this market remains committed to leveraging the company's strong technology position across a wide array of aircraft platforms and next generation systems integrated into those airplanes, and that positions very well for the long-term. The industrial market represented 21% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in the industrial market declined by approximately 3% as growth in medical instrumentation, alternative energy and battery related applications, together with contributions from our acquisitions completed last year were offset by declining sales related to heavy equipment, rail mass transit, oil and gas as well as other segments. On a sequential basis sales in the industrial market were down more than we expected by about 4% from the fourth quarter and it's reflected in particular the China COVID-19 related shutdown. I'd like to take this opportunity to highlight just how proud we are of our team working in the medical segment of our industrial market, who is ramping up our production of sensors, connectors and a wide variety of interconnect assemblies in support of countless applications that are providing medical treatments for COVID-19 patients.  Looking into the second quarter, we expect industrial markets to remain relatively stable, as increases in production in China are offset by lower sales in other geographies related to some of the restrictions on production that we're now seeing. We remain very pleased with the company's broad position in the worldwide industrial market. and through both our acquisitions program as well as our organic innovation, we have developed a very broad array of products across a diversified range of exciting segments within this market. We're proud of the company's long-term success in the industrial market and we look forward to realizing the benefits from our efforts for many years to come.  The automotive markets represented 19% of our sales in the quarter. Sales were weaker than we had expected coming into the quarter due to both the China shutdown in February, as well as COVID-19 related shutdowns by automotive customers in other parts of the world later in the quarter. Sales declined by 8% in U.S. dollars and 6% in local currency and sequentially our automotive sales decreased by 13%. As we look towards the second quarter, we do expect sales to further reduce as customers shut down continue to impact demand, and as the number of our automotive plants are restricted from full operations in certain countries. At this time, it's very difficult to predict the exact timing and nature of the automotive market recovery. Nevertheless, and regardless of this extremely challenging period for the automotive market, we're very confident in our long-term position. When this crisis is behind us, we look forward to once again benefiting from our long-term and consistent strategy of expanding our range of interconnect sensor and antenna products, both organically and through acquisitions, which enable a wide array of on-board electronics across a diversified range of vehicles made by auto manufacturers across the world. The mobile devices market represented 10% of our sales in the quarter. Our sales to mobile device customers were significantly impacted by the three weeks shutdown and subsequent month long ramp up of production in China. Sales in the mobile devices market declined by 20% from prior year and by a greater than expected 43% from the fourth quarter of 2019. Although the first quarter was very difficult for our team working in the mobile devices market, I'm just so proud that they were able to fully recover our production levels by early March. And as we look towards the second quarter, we do expect our sales to mobile device customers increase from these first quarter levels. Regardless of the COVID-19 related disruption in the first quarter, our long-term position in the mobile devices market remain very robust. Our leading array of antennas, interconnect and product and mechanisms continues to enable a broad range of next generation mobile devices. And while there's no doubt that this market will always be one of our most volatile, our outstanding and agile team is poised as always to capture any opportunity from our customers that arises in 2020 and into the future. The mobile networks market represented 7% of our sales in the quarter. Sales decreased as expected from prior year by 14% in U.S. dollars and 31% organically, as we were impacted by reduced demand from wireless OEMs. As we discussed extensively last year, the U.S. government restrictions on sales to certain Chinese entities ultimately resulted in many operator and OEM customers reassessing both their build out plans and inventory levels, leading to lower demand for our products. In addition, the China shutdown related to the COVID-19 crisis also impacted our sales in the first quarter in the mobile networks market. On a sequential basis, our sales actually increased 6% from the fourth quarter, and that was driven by higher sales to mobile network service providers. Given the continued disruptions related to the COVID-19 crisis, as well as the ongoing U.S. government restrictions that I just discussed, we anticipate sales in the second quarter to be similar to those levels that we realized in the first quarter. Regardless of the continued challenges in the mobile networks market, we are confident in the company's long-term position in this important and exciting industry. Our team continues to work aggressively to expand our opportunities with next generation equipment and networks. And as customers plan for these advanced systems, we look forward to benefiting from the increased potential that comes from our unique position with both equipment manufacturers and mobile service providers around the world. I'd just mention in addition that as we all know global communication systems are being stretched by the radical shift in work and education practices due to the COVID-19 crisis. These factors create a significant long-term expansion potential for the company. The information technology and data communications market represented 20% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in the first quarter were weaker than expected due to the impact of the China shutdown and the subsequent ramp back up to full production. Sales declined by 4% in U.S. dollars and 10% organically from prior year, as the contributions from the Charles Industries and XGiga acquisitions completed last year, together with stronger sales of server related products were offset by the impact of the production shutdowns in particular in China. Sequentially, our sales declined by 12% from the fourth quarter. I would mention that we did see a significant uptick in orders in the first quarter from a wide array of customers in the IT datacom market. We believe that surge in activity is related to our customers' efforts and our customers' customers' efforts to increase bandwidth in support of new demands related to the COVID-19 crisis and this includes the increase in online video communication, streaming services and gaming among others. We're well positioned to support these initiatives due to our team's continued efforts at developing industry-leading products across a wide array of technologies including in particular high-speed and power products. And while we do expect sales to increase in the second quarter due to these strong orders, I would mention that we continue to face production challenges in many geographies due to COVID-19 related government restrictions. Nevertheless, we remain very encouraged by the company's strong technology position in the global IT datacom market. Our customers around the world continue to drive their equipment to ever higher levels of performance in order to manage the dramatic increases in demand for bandwidth and processor power. In turn, our team remains singularly focused on enabling this continuing revolution in IT datacom through their ongoing development of a wide range of next generation technologies.  The broadband market represented 4% of our sales in the quarter. Sales decreased by 10% from prior year as spending levels from broadband operators continued to moderate. On a sequential basis, sales decreased by a greater-than-expected 11% from the fourth quarter. We expect sales in the second quarter to increase as customers seek to quickly upgrade capacity in their networks to support the significant increase in demand for bandwidth that I discussed earlier. Our team is working very hard amidst the number of operational challenges to support these upgrades in capacity. Now turning to our outlook. Given the significant uncertainty related to the COVID-19 crisis, we believe it's prudent to withdraw our full year sales and EPS guidance at this time and we will not be providing a specific sales and EPS outlook for the coming quarter. With that said, we do expect sales and EPS in the second quarter to be lower than our first quarter level. This expectation is related to weaker demand in certain markets due to the overall economic environment as well as certain operational restrictions that we're experiencing in several countries related to the government measures that have been implemented to reduce the spread of COVID-19. In some cases, these restrictions have limited our ability to adjust our resources in line with the volume declines we are experiencing, resulting in elevated costs in several of our businesses as we take actions to comply with government mandates, while also ensuring the safety and health of our employees. Nevertheless, despite all these challenges, you can rest assure that the team of Amphenolians around the world is fighting hard to secure the company's overall performance, all while dedicating ourselves to protect the safety and health of our more than 75,000 employees around the world.  So now to summarize, while the first quarter of 2020 has been uniquely challenging, I come away extremely proud of our team's performance. Amidst an unprecedented global pandemic, the Amphenol organization continue to execute extraordinarily well. In fact it is in times of crisis like we are all facing today that the Amphenolian culture demonstrates its true value. The company's strong performance is a direct reflection of our distinct and consistent competitive advantages, our leading technology, our increasing position with customers in diverse markets, a worldwide presence, lean and flexible cost structure, our highly effective acquisition program and our agile entrepreneurial management team.  And I would just like to take this final opportunity to recognize and thank the entire Amphenol organization around the world for their focus on protecting our people and their communities, their dedication to supporting our customers and their agility in the face of uncertainty, all of which helps to create value for all of our stakeholders.  And at this time, operator, we will be very happy to take any questions if there are maybe. \nOperator: Thank you speakers. The question-and-answer period will now begin. Our first question comes from Amit Daryanani from Evercore. You may ask your question. \nAmit Daryanani: I will just stick to one question. Adam, do you think structurally anything is different today versus pre-COVID for Amphenol that would prevent the company from getting back to this 20% operating margin or the incremental margin you guys have talked about once things eventually normalize? And I guess when I just think about the cost optimization and things you've talked about, does that actually in your view lower the revenue run rate in the -- to get to that 20% operating margin target?\nAdam Norwitt: Yes. Amit, look, structurally, we are not different than we have been either in good times or bad. And you know it well, this is an organization in many respects that's purpose-built for crisis like we see today. The agility and the flexibility of our organization in times of change have always been nearly the hallmark of Amphenol's performance. And so for sure, the crisis is in many ways different from the prior crisis whether that was the tech collapse of 2001, the financial crisis of 2009. Because this is also a crisis where health of people is an issue. And so, Craig mentioned I think very acutely that our conversion margins going into -- in the first quarter were higher negative conversion margins, because you're dealing with the fact that government shutting down certain production or limiting production. You also have employees where we're taking steps to ensure the safety of our people and some of those steps have at least for the timebeing not the greatest effect on productivity or on efficiency, and all of those things that you have grown to expect about. But no doubt about it. the structural capability of this company, organizational, the cultural capability of this company to achieve the margins that we achieved just 90 days ago in the fourth quarter that hasn't changed whatsoever.  Now is something happens during this crisis that ultimately allows us to do even better, well let's let time tell. But I will say that we are always driving the strong conversion margins on the upside and moderating those conversion margins on the downside even in an environment like today where there are very, very different dynamics.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Wamsi Mohan of Bank of America. You may ask your question.\nWamsi Mohan : Adam, can you maybe comment on the pace and cadence of new design activity. You mentioned significant headwinds in mobile devices that you witnessed in the quarter, given that a lot of it is China centric. But given this disruption in travel and continued disruption, are you seeing or anticipating resulting push outs of product launches in mobile devices? Thank you. \nAdam Norwitt: Thanks very much, Wamsi. Look, I think without commenting on any specific program, I would tell you that, that our customers in all of our markets and that includes mobile devices, I think there's an adjustment period to this new way of working. We are all working, and I'm sure all of you on the phone here today are working in a way that is very different than you had worked in the past, sitting in your offices, meeting in conference rooms and now we are all experts on video calls and working remotely and somehow trying to replicate the collaboration and the interaction that you can't really do in person, but that you can seek to replicate through all these different tools that we're all using.  And as it relates to develop a new product, launching new product, no doubt about it that customers have to sort of adjust to this. But I will tell you, our teams who are working on new programs with customers -- and again not just in mobile devices, but overall, the level of interaction with customers now that everybody has kind of figured out the technology and figured out how to work in this way. I think that level of interaction continues really unabated. And in many ways I will tell you this personally, my ability to interact with customers, when I'm not flying $500 a year, it's amazing. I can visit so many customers from just the comfort of my desk here with the TV screen and a camera and that is -- and I know that technology existed before. But we all like to touch and feel and meet people in person and shake hands and I think we've had to adapt very rapidly to this new environment. And I believe this new environment actually creates wonderful opportunity and we'll learn a lot from it.  And again specific to individual launches, I think there were some sort of early adjustment periods that customers had. But by and large, what we see is to the extent that our customers have access to their manufacturing facilities that they can produce in full volumes that we still see an enormous amount of activity with customers around the world.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from Craig Hettenbach from Morgan Stanley. You may ask your question. \nCraig Hettenbach: Adam, just a question on the book-to-bill which is very strong, I know there's particular end markets like comm and medical that are helping, but also kind of customers as they look to mitigate supply chain concerns. And so just curious to get a little bit more context on how you feel like kind of the shape of those bookings are and relative to kind of what the demand you're seeing is? \nAdam Norwitt: Well. Thanks you very much, Craig. I mean let's go back a little bit. When we think about these bookings, and they were very strong, I mean the strongest book-to-bill in our history, and one of the strongest order quarters we've had as Craig mentioned is up 7% year-over-year. Our original guidance for the quarter would have had a -- I think, at the high-end of $2 billion and we booked orders of $2.150 billion. So that would have been about 7%, 8%, which would have been a strong book-to-bill no doubt about it. So I think some element of the strong book-to-bill is just the production restrictions that we had in the quarter. And there's another element of that book-to-bill, which is really increased demand in certain areas, and pretty sudden increase in demand, whether it's in the wide range of medical products that our team is working on, whether that\u2019s in anything related to bandwidth and communication. And I talked about that in my prepared remarks as well that we see actually sequential increase in sales in a number of those areas. Now, the third category that you alluded to is our customers placing orders to secure position and prevent against supply chain risk or kind of otherwise get in line. There may be some of that, but I would put that kind of in the distant third position of those three factors that I have just reviewed. We haven't seen really things like double ordering or frantic kind of ordering just to kind of get a place in line. That's not what we're thinking. I think we have seen orders that we can't satisfy because of production requirements. Obviously, when you book $2 billion more than -- or $2.150 billion and you ship $1.860 billion, there are some orders that you book that you couldn't get out because of some of the restrictions. But I don't think that the customers really are having that kind of panic buy because of shortages. I think the orders are just a great reflection of the breadth of the importance that we play in the technologies of our customers and the importance in turn of our customers in the things that matter right now today. And I will just say one thing, I mean we have work in the IT datacom market and mobile devices market for so long, as you know very well Craig, and we have always done a phenomenal job of reacting to our customers, reacting to their needs. Those devices, they were supporting so many different applications, from video over the Internet, helping social media, all the various things that were driving demand for things like mobile devices, things like IT datacom. I will tell you, our team today works with a different purpose, because those systems that used to be for gaming and for video are now for educating kids. And without those systems, my kids would not be going to school today, we would not be able to function as a corporation, hospital would not be able to communicate with the families of the patients who they cannot visit physically, because of all of the restrictions. You hear wonderful stories about the use of tablet computers to allow families to tragically meet their loved ones sometimes for the last time and there's very, very critical stories. And I'd just say that our teams around the world feels a sense of purpose around this, and making sure that we can satisfy the requirements that our customers have, and we're fighting really hard to do that. And so, look the strong orders, I think, they\u2019re more a reflection of the urgency of the purpose. And our team is going to find a way no matter what to really support those customers.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Sheerin of Stifel. You may ask question.\nMatt Sheerin: Yes. Thank you, and good afternoon, Adam and Craig. Adam, relative to the operational restrictions you're facing outside of China, can you give us an idea of what your utilization or production levels are now, where you're seeing the biggest issues? And relative to that, are you expecting similar cost headwinds as you saw last quarter or is it too early to tell given the fluid situation?\nAdam Norwitt : Yes. Thanks so much, Matt. I mean, look, the first quarter was largely about the sort of unprecedented, very clear shutdown in China. Chinese New Year came and it was on then February 10th when essentially you were allowed to reopen, and by the way, reopened with a lot of challenges because the government put forth a very, very detailed, very detailed requirements for you to reopen your factory, including things like, you had to have enough face masks for every employee to change their mask three times a day and you had to have 14 days of stock and they would come and audit, do you have enough face masks? And do you have enough disinfectant solution, temperature checking devices, all these things, a very rigorous process to reopen. I will say the rest of the world has not been necessarily as clear as what we saw in China, which is not surprising. I mean, every country does things their own way and that is what it is and it's not for us to judge that, but rather to react to it. And so, we operate as you know in 40 countries around the world, and every country has a little bit of a different approach, and even here in the United States where we operate in a number of locations, we have very significant workforce in the U.S. every state has a little bit of a different nuance to that. What are exempted businesses? What are essential businesses and how is that all defined? And so, our team around the world has been reacting to those restrictions, making sure that when we are essential that we're able to operate, making sure that our employees are kept safe, and fortunately we learned a lot in China, a lot and our Chinese team has been so helpful in to all of our other operations in making sure that we can stay open as much as the governments will allow us, as much as they possibly will allow us by putting in place the appropriate protective measures for our employees, and that's been a real critical aspect of staying open, where we have been able to do so, which is by the way, the vast majority of places, is making sure that, we can protect our employees and demonstrate to our people first that it's a safe workplace. And second, demonstrate that to the local governments who in most cases come and audit and inspect that. If your people don't believe they're coming to a safe workplace, they're not going to come. This is a but scary, scary virus and there's no doubt about it that you need to make sure that, the place of work is almost safer than the homes of our people. That's actually our mantra inside of Amphenol, make the workplace safer than the home and then the people will be comfortable and justifiably comfortable in coming in. Now, ultimately, what does that mean? What is our utilization? I'm sorry to tell you, I can't tell you that. We don't have a central computer system and I just don't know exactly what the utilization is. I can tell you that, we have a number of facilities, but not an enormous number for who are operating at lower than their capabilities. The number of facilities that are really not producing is relatively small in other countries, where these restrictions have been a little more rigorous. I would maybe point to a place like in India or Mexico, and even in those countries we are operating, we're not totally shutdown in those countries. We're operating as an essential business where it's appropriate for us to do so. In terms of the second quarter, I think Craig talked about the fact that, we had these extra costs. In the first quarter, we would expect to continue to have extra costs in the second quarter. And what the extent of those will be is really hard to predict, and that's part of the uncertainty that is underlying our reluctance to give a specific outlook here in the second quarter. And I don't know if Craig, you would like to add to that.\nCraig Lampo: Yes, I would just add one quick thing to that Adam, and I agree with actually everything you just said. I think as we're coming into the second quarter, though, I mean, the first quarter, we had the shutdown in China, which was that three week period and then obviously the ramp up from that. And then, really, what from impacted us in other countries, really the most meaningful part of that was probably in the second half of March. So, we're really in the second quarter, that's really an April in the second quarter, really seeing more of an impact from all the other countries and time will tell really how that resolves itself. So, it's a little bit of a difference between the first quarter second quarter, both actually having gone certainly a meaningful increase in cost just as a bit different, maybe a little bit different nature, full impact of the quarter with the rest of the countries which are all doing a little bit things a little bit differently.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Samik Chatterjee from JPMorgan. You may ask your question.\nSamik Chatterjee: I just wanted to follow up on the order trends and you compensated for that. And if you can kind of help share anything in terms of what you've seen for order trends early on in 2Q just because when I kind of compare the strong order trends you have with the lower economic activity. I mean, I would -- why should I not think that there should be some order cuts down the line from your customers? Because otherwise this given kind of the strength you have, you would definitely have a very strong robust here, right. So just help me think about that. Like, is -- are you starting to see somewhat from customers? Or am I wrong in thinking they should be some down the line?\nCraig Lampo: Yes, well, thank you very much. Look, I think our strong orders in the first quarter. I talked a lot about where those came from. I think it's a little premature to comment here on the second quarter order trends. We're just barely three weeks into the quarter and it's hard to see. I mean, I guess I would say that -- the orders, which in areas like IT datacom those were strong through the end of the quarter. It wasn't that it was kind of a thing early on like in February. I mean, the orders definitely strengthened through the quarter. Does that strengthen through the quarter continue here into the second quarter? Again, I think it remains a little early to say that. Does that mean that there is an order correction coming in? Again, we're dealing in a time period of enormous uncertainty. But one thing is for sure. I mean, when I look at the orders in the market where we probably have the strongest orders, which was IT datacom. These are not people putting stuff on shelves far from it. I mean, these are customers trying to get, frantically trying to get stuck in the field. So that you and I and our children and our parents can have bandwidth that is not a disaster, I mean, I'll tell you I am here in a house with three kids going to school, I mean I have only two kids, but one of them brought, a second mummy with them. And when everybody is in school at the same time and when I am on my perpetual video calls during the course of the day, it isn\u2019t the greatest experience for anybody because the bandwidth is so constrained in many, many places and I'm not talking from the most rural places here. And so, there is -- these upgrades, the capacity expansion, the bandwidth expansion is a real thing. This is not customers just saying I need to buy a bunch of stuff, put it on the shelf just in case these things are going to the field. I mean, you think about the medical market. They are producing every possible thing they can. They need every sensor that they can get. They need every connector that they can get in order to produce lifesaving equipment that needs to save a life like not in six months but like yesterday or today or tomorrow. So, I think this is real demand. I don't personally feel that we're looking at here, a kind of a supply chain build and people putting stuff in warehouses. That's a different dynamic than I believe what we're seeing today.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Delaney from Goldman Sachs. You may ask the question.\nMark Delaney: So Just hoping to better understand that the medical business at Amphenol, maybe some sizing of that business in terms of the percentage of revenue. And then, you have any more details about how much exposure in terms of revenue it may have to some of these areas that are going to help support at COVID-19 patients like ventilators? Thank you.\nAdam Norwitt: Thanks so much Mark. Look, medical part of our industrial market and we haven't specifically split that out, but I would just tell you that it's an important part of our industrial market even though our industrial market doesn't have a dominant segment for sure. And across industrial everything from factory automation, rail mass transit, heavy equipment, instrumentation and other important segments and including medical. Now, I think our medical business in the recent years, we've done a fantastic job of expanding our position in medical products and that started really with some acquisitions we made many years ago, but it was enhanced and accelerated 6.5 years ago when we entered the sensor market. With our original acquisition of GE\u2019s defense sensor business which was 6.5 years ago, who had a substantial sensor position across medical applications, and medical applications which by the way included a longstanding leadership position in respiratory therapy; and you can imagine that today respiratory therapy is kind of an important part of the medical market. We've always had a strong position in areas like patient monitoring and imaging and things like X-ray and CT and MRI and delivery of medications. And so that sensor business really positioned us, I believe even stronger than we were before because the sensor becomes such a critical component. And you'll recall, when we first got into the sensor market, one of the theories and secrecy that we had was that, while sensors representative a wonderful compliment and a part of the interconnect system, oftentimes the sensor element was a critical piece of the technological architecture of the products that we were in. And while it may not have always the highest value as an element, it has enormous value as a kind of tip of the spear into that application and into the engineering teams and the importance of the customer. And I would just say that we saw that and we\u2019ve seen that over these six years, we see it much more today. As we talk and I personally interface with so many medical customers around the world. There's no doubt about it, that having that sensor capabilities, that sensor portfolio that we've built not just with our visual acquisition, but multiple acquisitions thereafter. So it's a company that what it is now that our position in the medical market, not just in terms of size, but the importance that we serve to customers in the medical market has really enhanced. You'll also remember that last year, we made a wonderful acquisition in Germany of a great company called Bernd Richter, a real leader in medical market value-add interconnect, and together with our preexisting companies that are very active in investment products in the medical market. So again, I'm not answering specifically Mark your question, in terms of how, what is the exact size, but I will just tell you that it's a very important market and segments within the industrial market. And it's one where we're very, very proud that our technology can play a significant role in helping the world to do battle against this COVID-19 virus.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Shawn Harrison from Loop. Please ask the question.\nShawn Harrison: Question on capital deployment in terms of thinking this downturn versus 2008, 2009, there wasn't really a lot of M&A activity back in that period other than times like the way that I believe. In the share repurchase activity, wasn't really something that Amphenol did either, and then we had this quarter where significant share repurchase. And wondering if you could maybe just comment on if your view of share repurchases going forward and then also, what do you think of the M&A environment in 2020? Does it dry up?\nCraig Lampo: Sure. Thanks Shawn. Yes, as we did mention, we did purchase this 2.7 million shares during the quarter for the average price of about $96. I would know that I guess that these repurchases did proceed this extreme market volatility that we saw during the quarter. And which kind of somewhat is evidenced by this the average price of the stock that we bought during the quarter. And the timing of our stock repurchasing certainly does always take a number of factors into account with regard to other cash needs in particular period and periods where we have, less acquisitions or other repurchases. There could be a less share repurchase is doing during that quarter or more share repurchase during the quarter when we have those lower cash needs. So that's certainly one of the reasons why we had a little bit higher in the quarter and per se, it gives you maybe a feel for the timing of that. Subsequently, we did draw down the revolver when that extreme kind of market environment took place, but those were really independent actions that really had nothing to do with each other and just so happened to occur in the same quarter while we drew down the $1.25 billion under our revolving credit facility. And our intention would be with a revolving credit facility to really -- as we generate cash, as we continue to explore other opportunities with regards to funding, as the markets became a little bit more stable, we will do intent even as early as the second quarter here to start paying down some of those amounts, I mean the revolver. So, in terms of capital deployment, we do continue to take a flexible and balanced approach that has not changed. We haven't stopped anything kind of in a formal way, but certainly in this environment, where things are a bit of uncertain, we're going to be very thoughtful about our requirement and things like share purchases and other things and would be very prudent now from that perspective. And I guess, I'll let maybe Adam mentioned comment on the M&A.\nAdam Norwitt: Yes. Thanks very much, Craig. I mean, very well said, I would just relative to main environment Shawn. You've correctly point out that back in 2009. We did complete one acquisition early on, onto microwave, a fabulous company by the way. Here 11 years later, I can't tell you how happy we are to own it. We have never been a company that just chases market side or up and down, during times of crisis, bottom fishing if you will for prices and other things like that. We take a very thoughtful long-term approach to our M&A program and that means having long-term conversation with people ultimately dating them with the intention one day to get married. And I can tell you that, in a short-term market dislocation, most people, if they don't have to sell, probably are not going to wants to sell during the short-term markets to location. And probably, you don't want to necessarily buy during that short-term marketplace with location, when you really don't know the full extent of what you're buying. All that being said, what I will tell you this. During this environment, this is a very, very kind of existential environment for many companies, and a company like ours, who has the financial strength that Craig talked about, who has the diversity that we've talked about, who has the geographical diversity as well, the footprint diversity if you will, and who has that culture and reputation as an acquirer, becomes even more attractive destination for companies who may be going through today an existential crisis. Maybe they're only in one market, maybe they're only in one geography and they look kind of over the ledge today at their own existence. And I think that, that is a time where if those companies do survive, they may start thinking long-term about, do I want to do this alone now that I know that this kind of a crisis can happen. And I think the long-term prospects for us being a real acquirer of choice. I believe coming out of this can be quite substantial. Now what does it mean this year? How much of our capital we are going to allocate to west? How much M&A will we do? It's a lot of uncertainty to make any prediction on that front. But our long-term approach to capital deployment clearly is the priority toward new product development M&A and then obviously the dividend, the buyback that Craig has already talked about, and we look forward to continuing to be the acquirer of choice for the thousands of companies in this industry going forward.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Deepa Raghavan from Wells Fargo Securities. Please ask the question.\nDeepa Raghavan: Hey, good afternoon. I'm going to look ahead and ask about better times. Just looking back in history, can you talk about which verticals you typically see the covering earlier and which usually takes longer to recover? And hypothetically, let's assume macro forecasts are right, and we start to see some recovery sometime in the second half. Should we think about most of your sales actually being recoverable, some of something that got pushed out or can there also be examples of lost sales within your portfolio? Thank you.\nAdam Norwitt: Well, thank you very much, Deepa, and I love that you asked about better time. This is a great question and one that is really close to my heart. Look which verticals recover when? The answer to that is it depends. I mean, if you cannot, I believe compare the current environment with either 2009 or 2001. So, in 2001, we had many of our markets, which didn't even go down. You think about the military market as one example, even the industrial market was still relatively strong than it was really a tech bubble that burst and then was followed by the tech collapse. And then the recovery in 2001 was not so fast, if you'll remember well and 2002 was also not the easiest year. If you then go to the financial crisis, we had in the financial crisis, a very severe in the fourth quarter after Lehman Brothers reduction in demand. You'll recall that we quickly adjusted our headcount in the fourth quarter of 2008. Sales I believe were down something like 15% and we adjusted our headcount down by 17% in the same quarter. And we ultimately secured the profitability of the Company in both of those prices is down by 300 basis points Now, I think this crisis is a little different because it's our first global pandemic in our lifetimes. It scares people. It affects people. People are afraid to go to work. They're afraid to go to the grocery store. They don't know. There's an intense personal insecurity to this crisis. But I will tell you too shall pass, I don't know if we're in the middle or you know, the old Winston Churchill saying, I don't know if this is this is not the beginning of the end, but it might be the end of the beginning. I don't know where we are in this crisis, but no doubt about it. It will one day have a beginning, a middle and an end. And what lies beyond that end, I believe an enormous amount of opportunities lie beyond that end. And I think what we are going to see at the end of this crisis, when that \u201cnormal\u201d that you refer to come. It will not be the same normal that we all knew on the 22nd of January. There will be differences. We will reevaluate how we work, how we live, how we learn how we function. And there's one common thread across all of that, from our perspective is people are seeing the importance of electronics in everything, whether that's electronics or medical equipment, whether that's electronics for communication purposes, you name it, safety, HVAC systems building automation. I mean, it doesn't take a big leap to start to think of just dozens and hundreds of new applications that will follow ultimately the reckoning that comes out of this very significant disruption that we've all experienced here. And I can tell you this, Amphenol sits strongly positioned for all of those opportunities wherever they may come. Our organization 123 General Managers around the world, each of them functioning in their little areas of the electronics world are poised to capitalize on whatever comes along. And we're going to be very proud to do that. Now, look what does that mean for the second half. I mean, you mentioned some macro forecasts. In the last 90 days I haven't heard a single forecast that's been correct. So, I don't know what those macro forecasts are really going to be whether there will be an L-shape or V-shape or U-shape and S-shape I don't know you tell me what shape or recovery is going to be better recovery will one day come that I'm sure. And when that comes is there a catch-up of demand, it's hard to say is there a catch up with demand. I mean, we're all sitting in our home. I'm certainly not using a lot of gas right now. So, I don't know that people are going to go use a bunch more gasoline when they get out and catch up to all the gasoline that we didn't use. I haven't filled the tank in my car for I think a month right now. And so, there are some things that need to have disappeared in terms of demand but there's so many opportunities for new things that are going to come out of this whole crisis. And ultimately, I think those things are going to be real positive in the long-term. Not a second half necessarily commentary, but I'm telling you, I think there's going to be a lot of good that's going to come out of it.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Steve Fox from Fox Advisors. Please ask the question.\nSteven Fox: Adam thanks for all the helpful discussion. I guess the one thing I was left wondering about in terms of your own operations was your supply chain. You mentioned disruptions with running your factories, but can you just talk about your ability to source raw materials, subcomponents and how that has been handled and how you think it's going to be handled in this quarter? Thank you.\nAdam Norwitt: Steve, look the supply chain is very important. I mean, we the suppliers are really important for us. One thing about Amphenol that very well, we don't have a centralized supply chain. We don't seek to put all of our stuff into one vendor and leverage that one vendor. We put the responsibility to manage our suppliers across all of our more than 120 general managers around the world. We may share information and do some smart things about that. But we're not putting all of our eggs in one basket of a supplier and I can tell you. Today, I'm very grateful for that. Because there are suppliers even in the month of February through the China shutdown our organization was so much quicker than most others to come back to full production. There were suppliers who were not able to come back who didn't have the wherewithal, the agility, the capabilities to do what our team was so successful at doing and coming back to production. And to the extent that any of those, which for us usually are very small suppliers, create any disruption, we went and help them right away. Our team was there for them supporting those suppliers. We haven't seen anything material in terms of are meaningful, I should say it's a double entendre material anything meaningful in terms of the impact from our supply chain. I guess the one thing I would maybe point to is not really suppliers as much as logistics. It's been well reported. There are some logistical impediments going on in the world right now. Freight capacities are quite significantly limited in certain areas and our team's done a great job of working collaboratively across the organization to make sure that we're getting the product that we need when we need it and getting what our customers need when they need it. So, there's a little bit more work involved in doing that, but now there was 90 days ago.\nOperator: Next question comes from William Stein from SunTrust. Please ask your question.\nWilliam Stein: Great, thanks for taking my question. It relates to the margin trajectory we might expect to over the current and next couple quarters. We understand that the decrementals were a little bit, less let say they were a little bit worse than what they typically are in a downturn for Amphenol because you have some more challenging times in readjusting costs, when you can't take actions on the employee base given the -- all the things going on with COVID. And I wonder whether we should expect this to have a relatively quicker resolution where we could see a quarter here a better than expected decrementals because you can align the cost base with the level of demand or if we should expect another quarter or two with the sort of current more challenging alignment of those two things? Thank you.\nAdam Norwitt: Yes. Thanks a lot for the question. Let me just start off by saying, I think, as a company, we're really just proud of the fact that we were still able to achieve the 70% operating margins in the first quarter with all the obstacles that we had to deal with in the first quarter with China being closed, with the other parts of the world. Having productivity issues and having some of our facilities closed or limited terms of people, so the fact that in that case, so to 70%, and essentially had a sequential quarter kind of conversion from Q4 to Q1 and just 40%, not so far over our typical 30% downside conversion, I think it's just a testament to the team. So I just kind of wanted to start with kind of that because I think that's really just the important point and that we're really proud of. Now, as it relates to kind of going forward into the second quarter and we certainly didn't or make or giving guidance for the second quarter. Adam, we did say that we do expect sales and it has to be lower in the second quarter. So, with that being said, I said that I wouldn't expect profitability or the pressures on our profitability to be meaningfully better in the second quarter than they were in the first quarter. I mentioned before that in the first quarter, we have this China specific event that happened and it really wasn't until the end of the first quarter that we really saw the other parts of the world starting to create issues with regards to adding cost, or limiting our ability to adjust costs. And that's really what we're seeing in a bigger way in the second quarter. And so I think that we would expect still to have a drive from the banning, throughout the second quarter at this point in time. I wouldn't expect dramatically different sequential quarter conversions going into the second quarter that from the first quarter, second quarter, I can maybe normal-ish conversions. But again there's so many unknowns right now, as we kind of come into the second quarter that it's really difficult to compete on that.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jim Suva from Citigroup Investment Research. You may ask your question.\nJim Suva: Thank you so much and great to hear the Amphenol team is doing well and your positive outlook, which a lot of my questions have been answered for that. So, I'll just ask one a little bit. When we think about guide posts and I've been on the sell-side for over 20 years, I think back in history in the global financial crisis, the worst quarter year-over-year was down 19%, but then back in the tech bubble burst, there was some times of down 30% year-over-year. And I think about this crisis, the coronavirus is much different of global plant closures. But then you talked about how positive your team came back in China. So, can you give us any guide posts at all about, is it much different from some of those past historical trends we've seen or the plant closures and coming back make it much different? Any guidance or color would be greatly appreciated.\nAdam Norwitt: Well. Thanks so much Jim. I mentioned earlier that, I think well one can on their face say well there was the global financial crisis, there was the tech collapse and should we or should we not compare this moment to those. I think there is the different here. We have never worked in an environment where governments are so deeply impactful and for good reason, by the way. I mean I think governments need to take a role. They have an extraordinary role to play in protecting the health of all of us on the phone and all of the citizens of the world. And so justifiably, I think governments have taken steps to limit interaction of people and thereby slow the spread of the virus and the way it's happened has been very different. China I talked about was a very clear, very distinct and by the end of a certain time period, which was not so long. I mean it was at the time it felt like ages let me tell you, three weeks felt like for years to all of because we were planning the kind of reentry. But there was a moment in time, where you knew you could take your people back to work as long as you did certain things to protect them. And I think in the rest of the world, the actions haven't been as clear as the actions were in China and thus the coming out of that is also I believe less clear. And so, what is that going to look like? It will depend. It will depend on the country. It will depend on the results. It will depend on the sort of means so many times this term, are we bending or not the curve and all of these various things and it's not dependent on is the fiber capacity in the market now finally filled and we can start re-building fiber optic equipment back in year 2000. It's not dependent demand coming back because people are not getting foreclosed upon in their mortgages and unemployment and all of those things. There an element obviously, I mean unemployment is increasing in many countries, for example, very significantly. So, there is an end demand that is related in some way to this crisis, but not a direct part of the battle against COVID-19. When does that end demand come back depend on so many factors. What's the degree of government stimulus that's going to be available to people? What will companies have in terms of support loans or grants or otherwise? I know, there are a lot of factors that come into this, which makes me feel like to draw that perfect parallel from those two crises. It would be maybe a dangerous parallel to draw. Again, I just reiterate one more time. From our perspective, it just doesn't matter, because our team is ready regardless. We are purpose built for a time of strong demand. We're also purpose built for a time where demand is very uncertain, and that's the agility, the flexibility of all of our organization that and really the resiliency of the organization in a time of kind of unprecedented uncertainty. And our ability to adapt, and to embrace a new environment is I believe second to none, and we'll get through this regardless.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Joseph Spak from RBC Capital Markets. Please ask your question.\nJoseph Spak: Thank you so much, Adam. I do want to just quickly I guess I'll follow on your last comments and go back to some of the color you gave on the China restart in the lessons learned. I think that's important. As you mentioned, that was pretty intense. It's unclear if it's followed elsewhere in the world. But you also mentioned your place to feel safe and I think there's some plants with a decent amount of manual labor and lines can be set up with employees and close to each other. So you might have to do more than as minimally required in certain areas to get that level of comfort among your employees. So we think about, even beyond second quarter when there's obviously still going to be some costs because of the shutdown, there's productivity not get back to where it was until there is a vaccine, is that your view? Or does it sort of not matter, because to follow on your here, your last comments, you may just snapback to pre COVID immediately, either?\nAdam Norwitt: Yes, it's a great question. So I mean, I think what you're saying is, there is a pre-vaccine and the post-vaccine world and I would tend to agree with you. There is a pre-vaccine role and there's a post-vaccine world. And the pre-vaccine world is going to require you to probably take more aggressive steps to protect your people. And I would just point out one thing it was for us absolutely clear, as right on January 23 when that shutdown happened, the pure priority, the overarching priority of our corporation has to be to protect our people. And we do that because it's the right thing to do as a fellow human, of those 75,000 people around the world, but we do it also because it's just good business. If you don't protect your people, you see what happened. And there have been so many examples around the world, some well recorded and others not so well reported of the kind of catastrophic effect on a corporation business if they're not sufficiently protecting their people. So we went overboard. We absolutely went overboard from the very get go making sure that our people were well protected. And yes, we have factories where we have assembly workers who used to work very close together. They're not working close together today. And we figured it out. We\u2019ve repurposed offices. We\u2019ve repurposed warehouses. We've staggered shifts. We've done so many things. Now, do all of those things ultimately hurt productivity in the pre-vaccine medium term, unnecessarily, I don't think they do not necessarily. I mean, you'd be amazed at the resilience and adaptability, not just of our management team, but of our people on the factory floor. And I thought, and I'll just put a plug in here right now. We have every time for our earnings release and management call. These people in our factories are the heroes of Amphenol today. They are everyday walking in the door of a factory. Well, those not the other people who can work from home are doing so, give a lot of people who have to go to work every day to do their jobs. And their jobs are so important today. Like I said, I mean, they're building things that go into life-saving equipment for building things to go into mission critical communications network. And these heroes of our company who are going every day, it\u2019s our job to protect them regardless of if that means I have to space them out in the factory, regardless of whether that means, I have to have the shift not overlap quite as much and lose 2% in productivity that day because of that, that's not a consideration at this point. I believe that our teams are going to make it happen regardless, and we're going to always follow that priority right now. It says we got to protect our people and protect them we will.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from David Kelley from Jefferies. You may ask the question.\nDavid Kelley: I had a quick question on automotive. I believe you mentioned sales decline 8% year-over-year in the quarter. That's significantly outperformed the market. I was just hoping for some color on your exposure and what you're seeing there. Are you seeing any step-up in content? Was there anything region specific that drove that upside? And then just curious, if you're expecting the impact from supply chain timing, that might be a headwind coming into the second quarter here?\nAdam Norwitt: Look, I think we have been outperforming the automotive market for the better part of a decade. And I think, I hate to say outperforming when we're down 2%, I don't like to say that, but I guess maybe it's technically true. I mean, we're down 8%. It's not the greatest thing in the world. But yes, is it outperforming and maybe it is, and I think our outperformance has been because we've just done a great job capitalizing on new electronic applications in the car. I think that this crisis when all is said and done, the automotive market is going to return and I think that that constant quest for new features in cars is going to continue and I would bet that there is going to be some new features that may not be unrelated to keeping people safe in cars and keeping cars clean, keeping the air clean in cars and so many other things like that. So, I personally think that the long-term in the automotive market is remains to be a great opportunity in the long-term constant growth opportunity for Amphenol remains strong.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question comes from Nikolay Todorov from Longbow. Please ask your question.\nNikolay Todorov: I understand it's more of an art than science, but I would love to hear your assessment of what downstream inventories look like. I understand that things in life and communications and IT systems and medical sales orders are going into the field, but what about some of our markets? What is your view on how much current orders are driven by underlying consumption versus inventory positioning?\nAdam Norwitt: Yes, I mean, I think I mentioned earlier, we don't see a lot of customers just putting a bunch of stuff in their warehouses. We don't have perfect visibility, the only place where we have visibility its inventories and our distribution channel. We haven't seen anything abnormal in the inventory amongst our distributors at this point. In fact, I'd say our distributors are continuing to service their customers, very vigorously especially those customers who have incremental demand related to the COVID-19 battles that are that are going on. I wouldn\u2019t say that we see a big mismatch in inventory to the extent that we have this ability.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Joe Giordano from Cowen. Your line is open.\nJoe Giordano: I just wanted to follow up on some of the questions we talked about on productivity. So, I already mentioned like a pre-vaccine, post-vaccine. How do you guys just think about structurally, is this something a fundamental change where the -- what you saw was 100% capacity is now like a 120% capacity, like we have to rethink how these facilities long-term are weighed out? So we need to use more automation. Is there an upward bias on, on labor costs to kind of incentivize people to come back? And just how do you think of that longer term than just overseeing right today?\nAdam Norwitt: Thanks. Look, we don't think about this monolithically. I think that every operation is different in Amphenol. That's one of the beauties of the Company is we have also an enormous amount of operational diversity across the Company. We have some operations are highly automated. We have others they are highly manual. And they usually tend to be very much tailored to the market that they serve the geographies that they service from, is this going to create a new factor for people to consider, of course it is. I think it's going to create a new factor for everybody to consider for the rest of our lives. And that just means that each of our general managers and managing their operation is going to integrate that into their calculus of what are they going to do to optimize a business. But look, we have an expression in Amphenol and no excuses approach to management. It's a team of people who just make this happen. We've been through a lot of different stuff over the course of our careers and my career is now 22 years with the Company wonderfully. And through that time, we have seen so many changes, changes in the cost of labor in certain geographies, changes in where things can be made careerist, I mean, you name it. It's been an enormous amount of changes that come along and the fact now that we need to prioritize and secure our locations for the health of the people. Do I believe that this is going to have a kind of a permanent negative drag on productivity? I do not. Look, in the short term, we have a lot of governmental shutdown for dealing with, of course, that's going to have short term impacts. You're paying people not to work in a number of places. But -- and you're doing that by law and also because it's the right thing to do. And but is this going to have a structural change to Amphenol\u2019s ability to be a highly productive manufacturing organization and thereby to drive strong returns for the Company, I don't think it will.\nOperator: Thank you, speakers. At this time, we don't have any questions on queue. I\u2019ll turn the call back to you for any closing remarks.\nAdam Norwitt: Well, thank you so much, and thank you all for your extended time today. We wanted to give everybody a chance to have the question. Look, I wanted to say to just a few words here. I mentioned earlier, we're in a crisis unlike any of us, have lived through, but there will be a beginning and middle and an end to this crisis. There's no doubt about it. I'm not going to be the one to predict when does the end come, or when does the beginning of the end come, but it will come. There's no doubt about it. And what I have encouraged our employees to do and I will encourage all of you as well is, relish the positives that may come out of it, take advantage of the things that we're learning about ourselves, about how we can work, how we can operate, and about our fellow people that I think are really some of the wonderful silver linings of what is a true tragedy for many people. And that tragedy I'm sure all of you have been touched in some way or another by that tragedy. And we wish that all of you continue to stay safe with your families, your colleagues, and all stay safe. And I'm sure one day we will get the chance to meet all of you in person, and I look forward certainly to sitting in the office with my colleagues at the nearest possible occasion. And regardless of that comes, you can rest assured that the Amphenol management team is there to support all of our stakeholders and to make sure that this company and our people remain safe and strong and that our company remains also healthy and strong for the long-term. Thank you all very much and we look forward to speaking to you again 90 days from now.\nCraig Lampo: Thanks everybody.\nOperator: Thank you for attending today's conference, and have a nice day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Craig Lampo",
            "content": "Thank you very much. Good afternoon, everyone. This is Craig Lampo, Amphenol's CFO and I'm here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO. We would like to welcome you to our first quarter 2020 conference call. As a reminder, during the call, we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures and may make certain forward-looking statements. So please refer to the relevant disclosures in our press release for further information. But before I review the financial performance for the quarter, Adam would like to say a few words. Thanks a lot, Adam. So as Adam just reviewed the company closed the first quarter with sales of $1.862 billion and with GAAP and adjusted diluted EPS of $0.79 and $0.71 respectively. Sales were down 5% in U.S. dollars and 4% in local currencies compared to first quarter of 2019. And from an organic standpoint excluding both acquisitions and currency impacts, sales in the first quarter decreased 9%.  Sequentially sales were down 13% in U.S. dollars and local currency and organically. Breaking down sales into our two segments. The interconnect business, which comprise 96% of our sales was down 5% in U.S. dollars and 4% in local currencies compared to last year. Our cable business, which comprise 4% of our sales, was down 13% in U.S. dollars and 11% in local currencies compared to the first quarter of last year. Adam will comment further on strength by market in few minutes.  Operating income was $317 million for the first quarter of 2020 and operating margin was 17% which was down 310 basis points compared to the first quarter of 2019. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2019, operating margin decreased 300 basis points. The reduction in operating margins reflected a negative conversion rate higher than our typical 30% downside conversion. This elevated conversion was primarily driven by the impact on the first quarter of the COVID-19 pandemic on production and productivity, particularly due to the various government restrictions that limit our ability to adjust payroll costs.  From a segment standpoint, in the Interconnect segment, margins were 19.1% in the first quarter of 2020 which was down compared to 22% for both the first and fourth quarters of 2019. In the Cable segment, margins were 7.6% which is down compared to 11% in the first quarter of 2019 and 10% in the fourth quarter of 2019.  Despite the year-over-year and sequential operating margin decline, we are proud of this quarter's performance given the unprecedented challenges created by the COVID-19 pandemic. Our team's ability to minimize the negative margin impact from this crisis is a direct result of the strength and commitment of the company's enterpreneurial management team, which continues to foster a high performance action-oriented culture and thereby maximize both growth and profitability in an uncertain market environment.  Interest expense for the quarter was $29 million which compares to $30 million in the first quarter last year. And the company's adjusted effective tax rate was 24.5% for both the first quarter of 2020 and 2019 respectively. The adjusted effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2020 excluded a discrete tax benefit of $20 million due to refunds in certain non-U.S. tax jurisdictions and the resulting adjustments to deferred taxes, as well as an excess tax benefit of $5 million associated with stock option exercises during the quarter.  The adjusted effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2019 excludes the impact of acquisition related costs partially offset by the impact of the excess tax benefit associated with stock option exercises during the quarter. The company's GAAP effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2020 including the items just mentioned was 15.9% compared to 22.8% in first quarter of 2019. Adjusted net income was a strong 12% of sales in the first quarter of 2020, another confirmation of the strength of the company's financial performance.  On a GAAP basis diluted EPS declined by 9% in the first quarter to $0.79, compared to $0.87 in the first quarter of 2019. Adjusted diluted EPS declined 20% to $0.71 in the first quarter of 2020 from $0.89 in the first quarter of 2019.  As Adam mentioned, orders for the quarter were $2.150 billion, which was up 7% compared to the first quarter of 2019, resulting in a record book-to-bill ratio of 1.15 to 1. Despite the extremely challenging environment, the company continues to be an excellent generator of cash. Cash flow from operations was $384 million in the first quarter or 177% of adjusted net income and net of capital spending of $61 million, our free cash flow was $323 million or 149% of adjusted net income. From a working capital standpoint, inventory, accounts receivable and accounts payable were $1.3 billion, $1.5 billion and $817 million respectively at the end of March. And inventory days, days sales outstanding and payable days were 92, 75 and 57 days respectively. While DSO and DPO were both in the normal range, DSI was slightly elevated due to the lower sales levels in the first quarter, which were driven primarily by the extended shutdown of production in China as well as the production challenges in other parts of the world. Due to the current crisis, we do expect inventory days to remain somewhat elevated, while sales levels are depressed, but to come back down to normal levels as business returns to a more typical pattern. The COVID-19 pandemic created significant uncertainty -- significant economic uncertainty and volatility in the credit and capital markets during the first quarter of 2020. As a result and as mentioned in our earnings release, as an abundance of caution, in late March, the company proactively bought $1.25 billion under our $2.5 billion revolving credit facility. In addition, due to the significant volatility in the commercial paper markets, the company decided to reduce its reliance on the public commercial paper markets, and as such, approximately half of the proceeds from the revolving credit facility is allocated to repay amounts due under our commercial paper programs. During the first quarter our cash flow from operations of $384 million along with net proceeds from our various credit facilities of $1.36 billion, proceeds from our recently completed bond offering of $400 million and proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $30 million were used primarily to repurchase $257 million of the company's stock at an average price approximately $96, fund repayments under our commercial paper programs of $250 million, fund dividend payments of $74 million, fund net capital expenditure of $60 million, fund acquisitions of $16 million and fund distributions to and purchases of non-controlling interests of $8 million. At March 31st cash and short-term investments were $2.4 billion, of which $1.4 billion was held in the U.S. This elevated level of cash was driven by $400 million on hand from proceeds of the February bond offering, which was subsequently used to fund the $400 million bond maturity at due on April 1st. And the previously noted drawdown of our credit facilities in excess of our current or expected cash needs in order to fund the decision to reduce our reliance on the commercial paper market and to provide a cash buffer during this period of extreme market volatility.  At March 31st there was $1.36 billion outstanding under our credit facilities as well as $138 million of outstanding commercial paper remaining that will come due in April and be repaid with cash on hand. As a result, total debt at March 31st was $5.1 billion and net debt at March 31 was $2.7 billion which was unchanged from the net debt level as of December 31, 2019.  Total cash on hand as well as the remaining availability under our credit facilities was $3.6 billion at the end of the quarter which leaves the company in a very strong liquidity position. The first quarter 2020 EBITDA was $403 million and the pro forma net leverage ratio was 1.4 times.  In summary, although this was certainly a much more challenging quarter than we had anticipated coming into the year, we finished the quarter in a position of real financial strength and with a very strong balance sheet and liquidity position. We believe this financial strength coupled with company's broad market and geographic diversity positions us well for the current more volatile environment which is characterized by moderating demand and continued uncertainty across global markets.  And with that, I will now turn it over to Adam who will provide some commentary on current market trends. Yes, I would just add one quick thing to that Adam, and I agree with actually everything you just said. I think as we're coming into the second quarter, though, I mean, the first quarter, we had the shutdown in China, which was that three week period and then obviously the ramp up from that. And then, really, what from impacted us in other countries, really the most meaningful part of that was probably in the second half of March. So, we're really in the second quarter, that's really an April in the second quarter, really seeing more of an impact from all the other countries and time will tell really how that resolves itself. So, it's a little bit of a difference between the first quarter second quarter, both actually having gone certainly a meaningful increase in cost just as a bit different, maybe a little bit different nature, full impact of the quarter with the rest of the countries which are all doing a little bit things a little bit differently. Yes, well, thank you very much. Look, I think our strong orders in the first quarter. I talked a lot about where those came from. I think it's a little premature to comment here on the second quarter order trends. We're just barely three weeks into the quarter and it's hard to see. I mean, I guess I would say that -- the orders, which in areas like IT datacom those were strong through the end of the quarter. It wasn't that it was kind of a thing early on like in February. I mean, the orders definitely strengthened through the quarter. Does that strengthen through the quarter continue here into the second quarter? Again, I think it remains a little early to say that. Does that mean that there is an order correction coming in? Again, we're dealing in a time period of enormous uncertainty. But one thing is for sure. I mean, when I look at the orders in the market where we probably have the strongest orders, which was IT datacom. These are not people putting stuff on shelves far from it. I mean, these are customers trying to get, frantically trying to get stuck in the field. So that you and I and our children and our parents can have bandwidth that is not a disaster, I mean, I'll tell you I am here in a house with three kids going to school, I mean I have only two kids, but one of them brought, a second mummy with them. And when everybody is in school at the same time and when I am on my perpetual video calls during the course of the day, it isn\u2019t the greatest experience for anybody because the bandwidth is so constrained in many, many places and I'm not talking from the most rural places here. And so, there is -- these upgrades, the capacity expansion, the bandwidth expansion is a real thing. This is not customers just saying I need to buy a bunch of stuff, put it on the shelf just in case these things are going to the field. I mean, you think about the medical market. They are producing every possible thing they can. They need every sensor that they can get. They need every connector that they can get in order to produce lifesaving equipment that needs to save a life like not in six months but like yesterday or today or tomorrow. So, I think this is real demand. I don't personally feel that we're looking at here, a kind of a supply chain build and people putting stuff in warehouses. That's a different dynamic than I believe what we're seeing today. Sure. Thanks Shawn. Yes, as we did mention, we did purchase this 2.7 million shares during the quarter for the average price of about $96. I would know that I guess that these repurchases did proceed this extreme market volatility that we saw during the quarter. And which kind of somewhat is evidenced by this the average price of the stock that we bought during the quarter. And the timing of our stock repurchasing certainly does always take a number of factors into account with regard to other cash needs in particular period and periods where we have, less acquisitions or other repurchases. There could be a less share repurchase is doing during that quarter or more share repurchase during the quarter when we have those lower cash needs. So that's certainly one of the reasons why we had a little bit higher in the quarter and per se, it gives you maybe a feel for the timing of that. Subsequently, we did draw down the revolver when that extreme kind of market environment took place, but those were really independent actions that really had nothing to do with each other and just so happened to occur in the same quarter while we drew down the $1.25 billion under our revolving credit facility. And our intention would be with a revolving credit facility to really -- as we generate cash, as we continue to explore other opportunities with regards to funding, as the markets became a little bit more stable, we will do intent even as early as the second quarter here to start paying down some of those amounts, I mean the revolver. So, in terms of capital deployment, we do continue to take a flexible and balanced approach that has not changed. We haven't stopped anything kind of in a formal way, but certainly in this environment, where things are a bit of uncertain, we're going to be very thoughtful about our requirement and things like share purchases and other things and would be very prudent now from that perspective. And I guess, I'll let maybe Adam mentioned comment on the M&A. Thanks everybody."

            "name": "Adam Norwitt",
            "content": "Well, thank you very much Craig. And first and foremost, I wanted to express my hope to everybody that's here on the phone today that you and your family, your friends and your colleagues are all staying safe and healthy amidst the current COVID-19 crisis. As Craig just mentioned, I'm going to comment on the current environment. I'll discuss also some of our highlights from the first quarter. I'll then turn it over to Craig to provide further detail on our financial performance. And then finally, I'll come back to me to discuss the trends and progress across our served markets, and I'll make a few comments about the future.  No question that we're living in truly unprecedented times as the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted all of us around the world in really extraordinary ways. Here at Amphenol, our first priority from the earliest day has been to ensure the safety and wellbeing of our employers, our suppliers, our customers and the many communities in which we operate around the world. And I'm sure that this pandemic has also personally impacted many of you on the phone here today just like it has really everyone around the world. Our company began to see the impacts from the outbreak at the time of the government restrictions that were imposed by China starting with the shutdown of Wuhan on January 23rd. While we don't have any facilities in Wuhan, our team successfully navigated an unprecedented three weeks shutdown of our 50 manufacturing operations in China. And I just wanted to mention here how truly proud I am of our entire China team, who were able to return to full production level by the beginning of March, substantially earlier than we had originally expected. As the COVID-19 virus has continued to spread around the world, Amphenol\u2019s entire global team has been focused on executing amidst very challenging market conditions and quickly evolving government measures to control the pandemic, all whilst clearly prioritizing the safety and health of our more than 75,000 employees around the world.  To that end, we early on proactively instituted significant measures to protect our employees, which has ultimately enabled us as a company to continue to operate throughout this pandemic. I'm truly proud of the Amphenol organization who despite these unprecedented conditions have continued to execute as Amphenolians always do, including by supporting our communities around the world when they need us the most. We've donated hundreds of thousands of masks to local hospitals, reconditioned machines to produce our own face mask, dedicated 3D printers to help make face shield, significantly expanded our production of components used in ventilators and other critical equipment and ramped up the capacity of our high speed and power product to support the expanded bandwidth needs around the world. And these are just a few of the many, many initiatives that have been taken by our more than 120 operations around the world. And I just wanted to take this opportunity to thank each and every one of our Amphenol employees around the world for their dedication, resolve, agility and focus amidst this most challenging and uncertain times.  Now turning to the first quarter, as I'm sure you all well know, due to the widespread disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, on February 24th, we withdrew our first quarter guidance that had been issued at the time of our January earnings release. Despite this, I'm very proud of the results that the company has ultimately achieved in this uniquely challenging quarter. Our sales reached $1.862 billion, a reduction of 5% in U.S. dollars versus prior year and 9% organically. And that was driven by lower sales in the mobile devices, mobile networks, IT datacom, automotive and industrial markets. These declines largely related to the COVID-19 disruptions in China, including, in particular, the approximately three weeks shutdown of all of our manufacturing operations in that country. I'm very pleased that the company booked $2.150 billion in orders in the first quarter, and that represented a book-to-bill of 1.15 to 1, the highest level in the modern history of the Corporation. And despite the significant disruptions to our operations in the quarter, adjusted operating margins held up very well, reaching 17%. Amphenol financial position is extremely strong, with operating cash flow of $384 million in the first quarter, supporting the company's excellent liquidity which includes a substanti $2.4 billion in cash and cash equivalents at quarter-end. Craig will give more details on this in a few moments.  Just like to close by saying I'm extremely proud of our team and that our performance this quarter once again reflects the discipline and agility of our entrepreneurial organization as we continue to perform well amidst the truly unprecedented challenges related to the COVID-19 crisis.  And with that, I'll turn it over to Craig to review our financial performance and then come back in a few moments to talk about our end markets. Craig, please. Thank you very much Craig. Craig just mentioned the value that we see in the company's balanced and broad end-market diversification. And I can just tell you that, that value is even more clearer in the times like we're living in today. In the quarter, no single end market represented more than 21% of our sales. This diversification continues to mitigate the impact of the volatility of individual end markets and geographies, while also exposing us to leading technologies where ever they may arise across the electronics industry. And this is just a great asset in a dynamic and unpredictable environment like we are experiencing today.  Now turning to our end market, the military market represented 14% of our sales in the quarter. Sales again few very strongly from prior year increasing by a bit less than expected 18% in the first quarter. And this was driven by growth across virtually all segments of the military market including, in particular, helicopters, space, military vehicles and avionics applications. Sequentially, our sales decreased by 5% from the fourth quarter.  Looking now into the second quarter, we expect sales to decrease from the first quarter level. A certain of our facilities that support military customers are operating with reduced staffing as a result of governmental restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Nevertheless, our team focused on the military market has worked hard for many years to strengthen our position across the market while increasing our capacity to serve customers really in all segments of the military market. The company's continued strong performance is a great reflection of the results of those efforts.  Given the ongoing favourable military spending environment, our team continues to solidify our leadership position by ensuring that we execute on the demand that we see in support of the many next generation technologies that are required for modern military hardware.  The commercial aerospace market represented 5% of our sales in the quarter, and our sales were down slightly as production volumes declined, and as overall demand from commercial aircraft manufacturers began to experience the negative impact of the COVID-19 crisis late in the quarter. Sequentially, our sales decreased by 10% from the fourth quarter, which was a bit more than we had expected coming into the first quarter.  There's no doubt that the commercial air market has been significantly impacted by the rapid and unprecedented reduction in air travel around the world. Accordingly, we do expect a further reduction in sales as customers shutdowns and reduced demand for air travel impacts overall aircraft production volumes. Regardless of the difficult environment that we're seeing in the commercial air market today, our team working in this market remains committed to leveraging the company's strong technology position across a wide array of aircraft platforms and next generation systems integrated into those airplanes, and that positions very well for the long-term. The industrial market represented 21% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in the industrial market declined by approximately 3% as growth in medical instrumentation, alternative energy and battery related applications, together with contributions from our acquisitions completed last year were offset by declining sales related to heavy equipment, rail mass transit, oil and gas as well as other segments. On a sequential basis sales in the industrial market were down more than we expected by about 4% from the fourth quarter and it's reflected in particular the China COVID-19 related shutdown. I'd like to take this opportunity to highlight just how proud we are of our team working in the medical segment of our industrial market, who is ramping up our production of sensors, connectors and a wide variety of interconnect assemblies in support of countless applications that are providing medical treatments for COVID-19 patients.  Looking into the second quarter, we expect industrial markets to remain relatively stable, as increases in production in China are offset by lower sales in other geographies related to some of the restrictions on production that we're now seeing. We remain very pleased with the company's broad position in the worldwide industrial market. and through both our acquisitions program as well as our organic innovation, we have developed a very broad array of products across a diversified range of exciting segments within this market. We're proud of the company's long-term success in the industrial market and we look forward to realizing the benefits from our efforts for many years to come.  The automotive markets represented 19% of our sales in the quarter. Sales were weaker than we had expected coming into the quarter due to both the China shutdown in February, as well as COVID-19 related shutdowns by automotive customers in other parts of the world later in the quarter. Sales declined by 8% in U.S. dollars and 6% in local currency and sequentially our automotive sales decreased by 13%. As we look towards the second quarter, we do expect sales to further reduce as customers shut down continue to impact demand, and as the number of our automotive plants are restricted from full operations in certain countries. At this time, it's very difficult to predict the exact timing and nature of the automotive market recovery. Nevertheless, and regardless of this extremely challenging period for the automotive market, we're very confident in our long-term position. When this crisis is behind us, we look forward to once again benefiting from our long-term and consistent strategy of expanding our range of interconnect sensor and antenna products, both organically and through acquisitions, which enable a wide array of on-board electronics across a diversified range of vehicles made by auto manufacturers across the world. The mobile devices market represented 10% of our sales in the quarter. Our sales to mobile device customers were significantly impacted by the three weeks shutdown and subsequent month long ramp up of production in China. Sales in the mobile devices market declined by 20% from prior year and by a greater than expected 43% from the fourth quarter of 2019. Although the first quarter was very difficult for our team working in the mobile devices market, I'm just so proud that they were able to fully recover our production levels by early March. And as we look towards the second quarter, we do expect our sales to mobile device customers increase from these first quarter levels. Regardless of the COVID-19 related disruption in the first quarter, our long-term position in the mobile devices market remain very robust. Our leading array of antennas, interconnect and product and mechanisms continues to enable a broad range of next generation mobile devices. And while there's no doubt that this market will always be one of our most volatile, our outstanding and agile team is poised as always to capture any opportunity from our customers that arises in 2020 and into the future. The mobile networks market represented 7% of our sales in the quarter. Sales decreased as expected from prior year by 14% in U.S. dollars and 31% organically, as we were impacted by reduced demand from wireless OEMs. As we discussed extensively last year, the U.S. government restrictions on sales to certain Chinese entities ultimately resulted in many operator and OEM customers reassessing both their build out plans and inventory levels, leading to lower demand for our products. In addition, the China shutdown related to the COVID-19 crisis also impacted our sales in the first quarter in the mobile networks market. On a sequential basis, our sales actually increased 6% from the fourth quarter, and that was driven by higher sales to mobile network service providers. Given the continued disruptions related to the COVID-19 crisis, as well as the ongoing U.S. government restrictions that I just discussed, we anticipate sales in the second quarter to be similar to those levels that we realized in the first quarter. Regardless of the continued challenges in the mobile networks market, we are confident in the company's long-term position in this important and exciting industry. Our team continues to work aggressively to expand our opportunities with next generation equipment and networks. And as customers plan for these advanced systems, we look forward to benefiting from the increased potential that comes from our unique position with both equipment manufacturers and mobile service providers around the world. I'd just mention in addition that as we all know global communication systems are being stretched by the radical shift in work and education practices due to the COVID-19 crisis. These factors create a significant long-term expansion potential for the company. The information technology and data communications market represented 20% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in the first quarter were weaker than expected due to the impact of the China shutdown and the subsequent ramp back up to full production. Sales declined by 4% in U.S. dollars and 10% organically from prior year, as the contributions from the Charles Industries and XGiga acquisitions completed last year, together with stronger sales of server related products were offset by the impact of the production shutdowns in particular in China. Sequentially, our sales declined by 12% from the fourth quarter. I would mention that we did see a significant uptick in orders in the first quarter from a wide array of customers in the IT datacom market. We believe that surge in activity is related to our customers' efforts and our customers' customers' efforts to increase bandwidth in support of new demands related to the COVID-19 crisis and this includes the increase in online video communication, streaming services and gaming among others. We're well positioned to support these initiatives due to our team's continued efforts at developing industry-leading products across a wide array of technologies including in particular high-speed and power products. And while we do expect sales to increase in the second quarter due to these strong orders, I would mention that we continue to face production challenges in many geographies due to COVID-19 related government restrictions. Nevertheless, we remain very encouraged by the company's strong technology position in the global IT datacom market. Our customers around the world continue to drive their equipment to ever higher levels of performance in order to manage the dramatic increases in demand for bandwidth and processor power. In turn, our team remains singularly focused on enabling this continuing revolution in IT datacom through their ongoing development of a wide range of next generation technologies.  The broadband market represented 4% of our sales in the quarter. Sales decreased by 10% from prior year as spending levels from broadband operators continued to moderate. On a sequential basis, sales decreased by a greater-than-expected 11% from the fourth quarter. We expect sales in the second quarter to increase as customers seek to quickly upgrade capacity in their networks to support the significant increase in demand for bandwidth that I discussed earlier. Our team is working very hard amidst the number of operational challenges to support these upgrades in capacity. Now turning to our outlook. Given the significant uncertainty related to the COVID-19 crisis, we believe it's prudent to withdraw our full year sales and EPS guidance at this time and we will not be providing a specific sales and EPS outlook for the coming quarter. With that said, we do expect sales and EPS in the second quarter to be lower than our first quarter level. This expectation is related to weaker demand in certain markets due to the overall economic environment as well as certain operational restrictions that we're experiencing in several countries related to the government measures that have been implemented to reduce the spread of COVID-19. In some cases, these restrictions have limited our ability to adjust our resources in line with the volume declines we are experiencing, resulting in elevated costs in several of our businesses as we take actions to comply with government mandates, while also ensuring the safety and health of our employees. Nevertheless, despite all these challenges, you can rest assure that the team of Amphenolians around the world is fighting hard to secure the company's overall performance, all while dedicating ourselves to protect the safety and health of our more than 75,000 employees around the world.  So now to summarize, while the first quarter of 2020 has been uniquely challenging, I come away extremely proud of our team's performance. Amidst an unprecedented global pandemic, the Amphenol organization continue to execute extraordinarily well. In fact it is in times of crisis like we are all facing today that the Amphenolian culture demonstrates its true value. The company's strong performance is a direct reflection of our distinct and consistent competitive advantages, our leading technology, our increasing position with customers in diverse markets, a worldwide presence, lean and flexible cost structure, our highly effective acquisition program and our agile entrepreneurial management team.  And I would just like to take this final opportunity to recognize and thank the entire Amphenol organization around the world for their focus on protecting our people and their communities, their dedication to supporting our customers and their agility in the face of uncertainty, all of which helps to create value for all of our stakeholders.  And at this time, operator, we will be very happy to take any questions if there are maybe. Yes. Amit, look, structurally, we are not different than we have been either in good times or bad. And you know it well, this is an organization in many respects that's purpose-built for crisis like we see today. The agility and the flexibility of our organization in times of change have always been nearly the hallmark of Amphenol's performance. And so for sure, the crisis is in many ways different from the prior crisis whether that was the tech collapse of 2001, the financial crisis of 2009. Because this is also a crisis where health of people is an issue. And so, Craig mentioned I think very acutely that our conversion margins going into -- in the first quarter were higher negative conversion margins, because you're dealing with the fact that government shutting down certain production or limiting production. You also have employees where we're taking steps to ensure the safety of our people and some of those steps have at least for the timebeing not the greatest effect on productivity or on efficiency, and all of those things that you have grown to expect about. But no doubt about it. the structural capability of this company, organizational, the cultural capability of this company to achieve the margins that we achieved just 90 days ago in the fourth quarter that hasn't changed whatsoever.  Now is something happens during this crisis that ultimately allows us to do even better, well let's let time tell. But I will say that we are always driving the strong conversion margins on the upside and moderating those conversion margins on the downside even in an environment like today where there are very, very different dynamics. Thanks very much, Wamsi. Look, I think without commenting on any specific program, I would tell you that, that our customers in all of our markets and that includes mobile devices, I think there's an adjustment period to this new way of working. We are all working, and I'm sure all of you on the phone here today are working in a way that is very different than you had worked in the past, sitting in your offices, meeting in conference rooms and now we are all experts on video calls and working remotely and somehow trying to replicate the collaboration and the interaction that you can't really do in person, but that you can seek to replicate through all these different tools that we're all using.  And as it relates to develop a new product, launching new product, no doubt about it that customers have to sort of adjust to this. But I will tell you, our teams who are working on new programs with customers -- and again not just in mobile devices, but overall, the level of interaction with customers now that everybody has kind of figured out the technology and figured out how to work in this way. I think that level of interaction continues really unabated. And in many ways I will tell you this personally, my ability to interact with customers, when I'm not flying $500 a year, it's amazing. I can visit so many customers from just the comfort of my desk here with the TV screen and a camera and that is -- and I know that technology existed before. But we all like to touch and feel and meet people in person and shake hands and I think we've had to adapt very rapidly to this new environment. And I believe this new environment actually creates wonderful opportunity and we'll learn a lot from it.  And again specific to individual launches, I think there were some sort of early adjustment periods that customers had. But by and large, what we see is to the extent that our customers have access to their manufacturing facilities that they can produce in full volumes that we still see an enormous amount of activity with customers around the world. Well. Thanks you very much, Craig. I mean let's go back a little bit. When we think about these bookings, and they were very strong, I mean the strongest book-to-bill in our history, and one of the strongest order quarters we've had as Craig mentioned is up 7% year-over-year. Our original guidance for the quarter would have had a -- I think, at the high-end of $2 billion and we booked orders of $2.150 billion. So that would have been about 7%, 8%, which would have been a strong book-to-bill no doubt about it. So I think some element of the strong book-to-bill is just the production restrictions that we had in the quarter. And there's another element of that book-to-bill, which is really increased demand in certain areas, and pretty sudden increase in demand, whether it's in the wide range of medical products that our team is working on, whether that\u2019s in anything related to bandwidth and communication. And I talked about that in my prepared remarks as well that we see actually sequential increase in sales in a number of those areas. Now, the third category that you alluded to is our customers placing orders to secure position and prevent against supply chain risk or kind of otherwise get in line. There may be some of that, but I would put that kind of in the distant third position of those three factors that I have just reviewed. We haven't seen really things like double ordering or frantic kind of ordering just to kind of get a place in line. That's not what we're thinking. I think we have seen orders that we can't satisfy because of production requirements. Obviously, when you book $2 billion more than -- or $2.150 billion and you ship $1.860 billion, there are some orders that you book that you couldn't get out because of some of the restrictions. But I don't think that the customers really are having that kind of panic buy because of shortages. I think the orders are just a great reflection of the breadth of the importance that we play in the technologies of our customers and the importance in turn of our customers in the things that matter right now today. And I will just say one thing, I mean we have work in the IT datacom market and mobile devices market for so long, as you know very well Craig, and we have always done a phenomenal job of reacting to our customers, reacting to their needs. Those devices, they were supporting so many different applications, from video over the Internet, helping social media, all the various things that were driving demand for things like mobile devices, things like IT datacom. I will tell you, our team today works with a different purpose, because those systems that used to be for gaming and for video are now for educating kids. And without those systems, my kids would not be going to school today, we would not be able to function as a corporation, hospital would not be able to communicate with the families of the patients who they cannot visit physically, because of all of the restrictions. You hear wonderful stories about the use of tablet computers to allow families to tragically meet their loved ones sometimes for the last time and there's very, very critical stories. And I'd just say that our teams around the world feels a sense of purpose around this, and making sure that we can satisfy the requirements that our customers have, and we're fighting really hard to do that. And so, look the strong orders, I think, they\u2019re more a reflection of the urgency of the purpose. And our team is going to find a way no matter what to really support those customers. Yes. Thanks so much, Matt. I mean, look, the first quarter was largely about the sort of unprecedented, very clear shutdown in China. Chinese New Year came and it was on then February 10th when essentially you were allowed to reopen, and by the way, reopened with a lot of challenges because the government put forth a very, very detailed, very detailed requirements for you to reopen your factory, including things like, you had to have enough face masks for every employee to change their mask three times a day and you had to have 14 days of stock and they would come and audit, do you have enough face masks? And do you have enough disinfectant solution, temperature checking devices, all these things, a very rigorous process to reopen. I will say the rest of the world has not been necessarily as clear as what we saw in China, which is not surprising. I mean, every country does things their own way and that is what it is and it's not for us to judge that, but rather to react to it. And so, we operate as you know in 40 countries around the world, and every country has a little bit of a different approach, and even here in the United States where we operate in a number of locations, we have very significant workforce in the U.S. every state has a little bit of a different nuance to that. What are exempted businesses? What are essential businesses and how is that all defined? And so, our team around the world has been reacting to those restrictions, making sure that when we are essential that we're able to operate, making sure that our employees are kept safe, and fortunately we learned a lot in China, a lot and our Chinese team has been so helpful in to all of our other operations in making sure that we can stay open as much as the governments will allow us, as much as they possibly will allow us by putting in place the appropriate protective measures for our employees, and that's been a real critical aspect of staying open, where we have been able to do so, which is by the way, the vast majority of places, is making sure that, we can protect our employees and demonstrate to our people first that it's a safe workplace. And second, demonstrate that to the local governments who in most cases come and audit and inspect that. If your people don't believe they're coming to a safe workplace, they're not going to come. This is a but scary, scary virus and there's no doubt about it that you need to make sure that, the place of work is almost safer than the homes of our people. That's actually our mantra inside of Amphenol, make the workplace safer than the home and then the people will be comfortable and justifiably comfortable in coming in. Now, ultimately, what does that mean? What is our utilization? I'm sorry to tell you, I can't tell you that. We don't have a central computer system and I just don't know exactly what the utilization is. I can tell you that, we have a number of facilities, but not an enormous number for who are operating at lower than their capabilities. The number of facilities that are really not producing is relatively small in other countries, where these restrictions have been a little more rigorous. I would maybe point to a place like in India or Mexico, and even in those countries we are operating, we're not totally shutdown in those countries. We're operating as an essential business where it's appropriate for us to do so. In terms of the second quarter, I think Craig talked about the fact that, we had these extra costs. In the first quarter, we would expect to continue to have extra costs in the second quarter. And what the extent of those will be is really hard to predict, and that's part of the uncertainty that is underlying our reluctance to give a specific outlook here in the second quarter. And I don't know if Craig, you would like to add to that. Thanks so much Mark. Look, medical part of our industrial market and we haven't specifically split that out, but I would just tell you that it's an important part of our industrial market even though our industrial market doesn't have a dominant segment for sure. And across industrial everything from factory automation, rail mass transit, heavy equipment, instrumentation and other important segments and including medical. Now, I think our medical business in the recent years, we've done a fantastic job of expanding our position in medical products and that started really with some acquisitions we made many years ago, but it was enhanced and accelerated 6.5 years ago when we entered the sensor market. With our original acquisition of GE\u2019s defense sensor business which was 6.5 years ago, who had a substantial sensor position across medical applications, and medical applications which by the way included a longstanding leadership position in respiratory therapy; and you can imagine that today respiratory therapy is kind of an important part of the medical market. We've always had a strong position in areas like patient monitoring and imaging and things like X-ray and CT and MRI and delivery of medications. And so that sensor business really positioned us, I believe even stronger than we were before because the sensor becomes such a critical component. And you'll recall, when we first got into the sensor market, one of the theories and secrecy that we had was that, while sensors representative a wonderful compliment and a part of the interconnect system, oftentimes the sensor element was a critical piece of the technological architecture of the products that we were in. And while it may not have always the highest value as an element, it has enormous value as a kind of tip of the spear into that application and into the engineering teams and the importance of the customer. And I would just say that we saw that and we\u2019ve seen that over these six years, we see it much more today. As we talk and I personally interface with so many medical customers around the world. There's no doubt about it, that having that sensor capabilities, that sensor portfolio that we've built not just with our visual acquisition, but multiple acquisitions thereafter. So it's a company that what it is now that our position in the medical market, not just in terms of size, but the importance that we serve to customers in the medical market has really enhanced. You'll also remember that last year, we made a wonderful acquisition in Germany of a great company called Bernd Richter, a real leader in medical market value-add interconnect, and together with our preexisting companies that are very active in investment products in the medical market. So again, I'm not answering specifically Mark your question, in terms of how, what is the exact size, but I will just tell you that it's a very important market and segments within the industrial market. And it's one where we're very, very proud that our technology can play a significant role in helping the world to do battle against this COVID-19 virus. Yes. Thanks very much, Craig. I mean, very well said, I would just relative to main environment Shawn. You've correctly point out that back in 2009. We did complete one acquisition early on, onto microwave, a fabulous company by the way. Here 11 years later, I can't tell you how happy we are to own it. We have never been a company that just chases market side or up and down, during times of crisis, bottom fishing if you will for prices and other things like that. We take a very thoughtful long-term approach to our M&A program and that means having long-term conversation with people ultimately dating them with the intention one day to get married. And I can tell you that, in a short-term market dislocation, most people, if they don't have to sell, probably are not going to wants to sell during the short-term markets to location. And probably, you don't want to necessarily buy during that short-term marketplace with location, when you really don't know the full extent of what you're buying. All that being said, what I will tell you this. During this environment, this is a very, very kind of existential environment for many companies, and a company like ours, who has the financial strength that Craig talked about, who has the diversity that we've talked about, who has the geographical diversity as well, the footprint diversity if you will, and who has that culture and reputation as an acquirer, becomes even more attractive destination for companies who may be going through today an existential crisis. Maybe they're only in one market, maybe they're only in one geography and they look kind of over the ledge today at their own existence. And I think that, that is a time where if those companies do survive, they may start thinking long-term about, do I want to do this alone now that I know that this kind of a crisis can happen. And I think the long-term prospects for us being a real acquirer of choice. I believe coming out of this can be quite substantial. Now what does it mean this year? How much of our capital we are going to allocate to west? How much M&A will we do? It's a lot of uncertainty to make any prediction on that front. But our long-term approach to capital deployment clearly is the priority toward new product development M&A and then obviously the dividend, the buyback that Craig has already talked about, and we look forward to continuing to be the acquirer of choice for the thousands of companies in this industry going forward. Well, thank you very much, Deepa, and I love that you asked about better time. This is a great question and one that is really close to my heart. Look which verticals recover when? The answer to that is it depends. I mean, if you cannot, I believe compare the current environment with either 2009 or 2001. So, in 2001, we had many of our markets, which didn't even go down. You think about the military market as one example, even the industrial market was still relatively strong than it was really a tech bubble that burst and then was followed by the tech collapse. And then the recovery in 2001 was not so fast, if you'll remember well and 2002 was also not the easiest year. If you then go to the financial crisis, we had in the financial crisis, a very severe in the fourth quarter after Lehman Brothers reduction in demand. You'll recall that we quickly adjusted our headcount in the fourth quarter of 2008. Sales I believe were down something like 15% and we adjusted our headcount down by 17% in the same quarter. And we ultimately secured the profitability of the Company in both of those prices is down by 300 basis points Now, I think this crisis is a little different because it's our first global pandemic in our lifetimes. It scares people. It affects people. People are afraid to go to work. They're afraid to go to the grocery store. They don't know. There's an intense personal insecurity to this crisis. But I will tell you too shall pass, I don't know if we're in the middle or you know, the old Winston Churchill saying, I don't know if this is this is not the beginning of the end, but it might be the end of the beginning. I don't know where we are in this crisis, but no doubt about it. It will one day have a beginning, a middle and an end. And what lies beyond that end, I believe an enormous amount of opportunities lie beyond that end. And I think what we are going to see at the end of this crisis, when that \u201cnormal\u201d that you refer to come. It will not be the same normal that we all knew on the 22nd of January. There will be differences. We will reevaluate how we work, how we live, how we learn how we function. And there's one common thread across all of that, from our perspective is people are seeing the importance of electronics in everything, whether that's electronics or medical equipment, whether that's electronics for communication purposes, you name it, safety, HVAC systems building automation. I mean, it doesn't take a big leap to start to think of just dozens and hundreds of new applications that will follow ultimately the reckoning that comes out of this very significant disruption that we've all experienced here. And I can tell you this, Amphenol sits strongly positioned for all of those opportunities wherever they may come. Our organization 123 General Managers around the world, each of them functioning in their little areas of the electronics world are poised to capitalize on whatever comes along. And we're going to be very proud to do that. Now, look what does that mean for the second half. I mean, you mentioned some macro forecasts. In the last 90 days I haven't heard a single forecast that's been correct. So, I don't know what those macro forecasts are really going to be whether there will be an L-shape or V-shape or U-shape and S-shape I don't know you tell me what shape or recovery is going to be better recovery will one day come that I'm sure. And when that comes is there a catch-up of demand, it's hard to say is there a catch up with demand. I mean, we're all sitting in our home. I'm certainly not using a lot of gas right now. So, I don't know that people are going to go use a bunch more gasoline when they get out and catch up to all the gasoline that we didn't use. I haven't filled the tank in my car for I think a month right now. And so, there are some things that need to have disappeared in terms of demand but there's so many opportunities for new things that are going to come out of this whole crisis. And ultimately, I think those things are going to be real positive in the long-term. Not a second half necessarily commentary, but I'm telling you, I think there's going to be a lot of good that's going to come out of it. Steve, look the supply chain is very important. I mean, we the suppliers are really important for us. One thing about Amphenol that very well, we don't have a centralized supply chain. We don't seek to put all of our stuff into one vendor and leverage that one vendor. We put the responsibility to manage our suppliers across all of our more than 120 general managers around the world. We may share information and do some smart things about that. But we're not putting all of our eggs in one basket of a supplier and I can tell you. Today, I'm very grateful for that. Because there are suppliers even in the month of February through the China shutdown our organization was so much quicker than most others to come back to full production. There were suppliers who were not able to come back who didn't have the wherewithal, the agility, the capabilities to do what our team was so successful at doing and coming back to production. And to the extent that any of those, which for us usually are very small suppliers, create any disruption, we went and help them right away. Our team was there for them supporting those suppliers. We haven't seen anything material in terms of are meaningful, I should say it's a double entendre material anything meaningful in terms of the impact from our supply chain. I guess the one thing I would maybe point to is not really suppliers as much as logistics. It's been well reported. There are some logistical impediments going on in the world right now. Freight capacities are quite significantly limited in certain areas and our team's done a great job of working collaboratively across the organization to make sure that we're getting the product that we need when we need it and getting what our customers need when they need it. So, there's a little bit more work involved in doing that, but now there was 90 days ago. Yes. Thanks a lot for the question. Let me just start off by saying, I think, as a company, we're really just proud of the fact that we were still able to achieve the 70% operating margins in the first quarter with all the obstacles that we had to deal with in the first quarter with China being closed, with the other parts of the world. Having productivity issues and having some of our facilities closed or limited terms of people, so the fact that in that case, so to 70%, and essentially had a sequential quarter kind of conversion from Q4 to Q1 and just 40%, not so far over our typical 30% downside conversion, I think it's just a testament to the team. So I just kind of wanted to start with kind of that because I think that's really just the important point and that we're really proud of. Now, as it relates to kind of going forward into the second quarter and we certainly didn't or make or giving guidance for the second quarter. Adam, we did say that we do expect sales and it has to be lower in the second quarter. So, with that being said, I said that I wouldn't expect profitability or the pressures on our profitability to be meaningfully better in the second quarter than they were in the first quarter. I mentioned before that in the first quarter, we have this China specific event that happened and it really wasn't until the end of the first quarter that we really saw the other parts of the world starting to create issues with regards to adding cost, or limiting our ability to adjust costs. And that's really what we're seeing in a bigger way in the second quarter. And so I think that we would expect still to have a drive from the banning, throughout the second quarter at this point in time. I wouldn't expect dramatically different sequential quarter conversions going into the second quarter that from the first quarter, second quarter, I can maybe normal-ish conversions. But again there's so many unknowns right now, as we kind of come into the second quarter that it's really difficult to compete on that. Well. Thanks so much Jim. I mentioned earlier that, I think well one can on their face say well there was the global financial crisis, there was the tech collapse and should we or should we not compare this moment to those. I think there is the different here. We have never worked in an environment where governments are so deeply impactful and for good reason, by the way. I mean I think governments need to take a role. They have an extraordinary role to play in protecting the health of all of us on the phone and all of the citizens of the world. And so justifiably, I think governments have taken steps to limit interaction of people and thereby slow the spread of the virus and the way it's happened has been very different. China I talked about was a very clear, very distinct and by the end of a certain time period, which was not so long. I mean it was at the time it felt like ages let me tell you, three weeks felt like for years to all of because we were planning the kind of reentry. But there was a moment in time, where you knew you could take your people back to work as long as you did certain things to protect them. And I think in the rest of the world, the actions haven't been as clear as the actions were in China and thus the coming out of that is also I believe less clear. And so, what is that going to look like? It will depend. It will depend on the country. It will depend on the results. It will depend on the sort of means so many times this term, are we bending or not the curve and all of these various things and it's not dependent on is the fiber capacity in the market now finally filled and we can start re-building fiber optic equipment back in year 2000. It's not dependent demand coming back because people are not getting foreclosed upon in their mortgages and unemployment and all of those things. There an element obviously, I mean unemployment is increasing in many countries, for example, very significantly. So, there is an end demand that is related in some way to this crisis, but not a direct part of the battle against COVID-19. When does that end demand come back depend on so many factors. What's the degree of government stimulus that's going to be available to people? What will companies have in terms of support loans or grants or otherwise? I know, there are a lot of factors that come into this, which makes me feel like to draw that perfect parallel from those two crises. It would be maybe a dangerous parallel to draw. Again, I just reiterate one more time. From our perspective, it just doesn't matter, because our team is ready regardless. We are purpose built for a time of strong demand. We're also purpose built for a time where demand is very uncertain, and that's the agility, the flexibility of all of our organization that and really the resiliency of the organization in a time of kind of unprecedented uncertainty. And our ability to adapt, and to embrace a new environment is I believe second to none, and we'll get through this regardless. Yes, it's a great question. So I mean, I think what you're saying is, there is a pre-vaccine and the post-vaccine world and I would tend to agree with you. There is a pre-vaccine role and there's a post-vaccine world. And the pre-vaccine world is going to require you to probably take more aggressive steps to protect your people. And I would just point out one thing it was for us absolutely clear, as right on January 23 when that shutdown happened, the pure priority, the overarching priority of our corporation has to be to protect our people. And we do that because it's the right thing to do as a fellow human, of those 75,000 people around the world, but we do it also because it's just good business. If you don't protect your people, you see what happened. And there have been so many examples around the world, some well recorded and others not so well reported of the kind of catastrophic effect on a corporation business if they're not sufficiently protecting their people. So we went overboard. We absolutely went overboard from the very get go making sure that our people were well protected. And yes, we have factories where we have assembly workers who used to work very close together. They're not working close together today. And we figured it out. We\u2019ve repurposed offices. We\u2019ve repurposed warehouses. We've staggered shifts. We've done so many things. Now, do all of those things ultimately hurt productivity in the pre-vaccine medium term, unnecessarily, I don't think they do not necessarily. I mean, you'd be amazed at the resilience and adaptability, not just of our management team, but of our people on the factory floor. And I thought, and I'll just put a plug in here right now. We have every time for our earnings release and management call. These people in our factories are the heroes of Amphenol today. They are everyday walking in the door of a factory. Well, those not the other people who can work from home are doing so, give a lot of people who have to go to work every day to do their jobs. And their jobs are so important today. Like I said, I mean, they're building things that go into life-saving equipment for building things to go into mission critical communications network. And these heroes of our company who are going every day, it\u2019s our job to protect them regardless of if that means I have to space them out in the factory, regardless of whether that means, I have to have the shift not overlap quite as much and lose 2% in productivity that day because of that, that's not a consideration at this point. I believe that our teams are going to make it happen regardless, and we're going to always follow that priority right now. It says we got to protect our people and protect them we will. Look, I think we have been outperforming the automotive market for the better part of a decade. And I think, I hate to say outperforming when we're down 2%, I don't like to say that, but I guess maybe it's technically true. I mean, we're down 8%. It's not the greatest thing in the world. But yes, is it outperforming and maybe it is, and I think our outperformance has been because we've just done a great job capitalizing on new electronic applications in the car. I think that this crisis when all is said and done, the automotive market is going to return and I think that that constant quest for new features in cars is going to continue and I would bet that there is going to be some new features that may not be unrelated to keeping people safe in cars and keeping cars clean, keeping the air clean in cars and so many other things like that. So, I personally think that the long-term in the automotive market is remains to be a great opportunity in the long-term constant growth opportunity for Amphenol remains strong. Yes, I mean, I think I mentioned earlier, we don't see a lot of customers just putting a bunch of stuff in their warehouses. We don't have perfect visibility, the only place where we have visibility its inventories and our distribution channel. We haven't seen anything abnormal in the inventory amongst our distributors at this point. In fact, I'd say our distributors are continuing to service their customers, very vigorously especially those customers who have incremental demand related to the COVID-19 battles that are that are going on. I wouldn\u2019t say that we see a big mismatch in inventory to the extent that we have this ability. Thanks. Look, we don't think about this monolithically. I think that every operation is different in Amphenol. That's one of the beauties of the Company is we have also an enormous amount of operational diversity across the Company. We have some operations are highly automated. We have others they are highly manual. And they usually tend to be very much tailored to the market that they serve the geographies that they service from, is this going to create a new factor for people to consider, of course it is. I think it's going to create a new factor for everybody to consider for the rest of our lives. And that just means that each of our general managers and managing their operation is going to integrate that into their calculus of what are they going to do to optimize a business. But look, we have an expression in Amphenol and no excuses approach to management. It's a team of people who just make this happen. We've been through a lot of different stuff over the course of our careers and my career is now 22 years with the Company wonderfully. And through that time, we have seen so many changes, changes in the cost of labor in certain geographies, changes in where things can be made careerist, I mean, you name it. It's been an enormous amount of changes that come along and the fact now that we need to prioritize and secure our locations for the health of the people. Do I believe that this is going to have a kind of a permanent negative drag on productivity? I do not. Look, in the short term, we have a lot of governmental shutdown for dealing with, of course, that's going to have short term impacts. You're paying people not to work in a number of places. But -- and you're doing that by law and also because it's the right thing to do. And but is this going to have a structural change to Amphenol\u2019s ability to be a highly productive manufacturing organization and thereby to drive strong returns for the Company, I don't think it will. Well, thank you so much, and thank you all for your extended time today. We wanted to give everybody a chance to have the question. Look, I wanted to say to just a few words here. I mentioned earlier, we're in a crisis unlike any of us, have lived through, but there will be a beginning and middle and an end to this crisis. There's no doubt about it. I'm not going to be the one to predict when does the end come, or when does the beginning of the end come, but it will come. There's no doubt about it. And what I have encouraged our employees to do and I will encourage all of you as well is, relish the positives that may come out of it, take advantage of the things that we're learning about ourselves, about how we can work, how we can operate, and about our fellow people that I think are really some of the wonderful silver linings of what is a true tragedy for many people. And that tragedy I'm sure all of you have been touched in some way or another by that tragedy. And we wish that all of you continue to stay safe with your families, your colleagues, and all stay safe. And I'm sure one day we will get the chance to meet all of you in person, and I look forward certainly to sitting in the office with my colleagues at the nearest possible occasion. And regardless of that comes, you can rest assured that the Amphenol management team is there to support all of our stakeholders and to make sure that this company and our people remain safe and strong and that our company remains also healthy and strong for the long-term. Thank you all very much and we look forward to speaking to you again 90 days from now."

        "content": "Operator: Hello, and welcome to the Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call for Amphenol Corporation. [Operator Instructions]. At the request of the company, today's conference is being recorded, if anyone has any objection, you may disconnect at this time.  I would now like to introduce today's conference host, Mr. Craig Lampo. Sir, you may begin.\nCraig Lampo: Thank you very much. Good afternoon, everyone. This is Craig Lampo, Amphenol's CFO, and I'm here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO. We would like to welcome you to our fourth quarter 2021 conference call. Our fourth quarter and full year results were released this morning. I will provide some financial commentary, and then Adam will give you an overview of the business as well as current trends. Then we will take questions. As a reminder, during the call, we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures and may make certain forward-looking statements. So please refer to the relevant disclosures in our press release for further information. In addition, all data discussed during this call will be on a continuing operations basis unless otherwise noted. The company closed the fourth quarter with record sales of $3.027 billion and GAAP and adjusted diluted EPS of $0.72 and $0.70, respectively. We are very proud that the fourth quarter represents the first time in Amphenol's history that we achieved quarterly sales in excess of $3 billion. Fourth quarter sales were up 25% in U.S. dollars and in local currencies and up 18% organically. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2020, the significant sales increase was primarily driven by the robust growth in the IT, data communications, industrial, mobile networks, commercial air, automotive and broadband markets, including contributions from the company's acquisition program. Sequentially, sales were up 7% in U.S. dollars and organically and 8% in local currencies. For the full year 2021, sales were a record $10.876 billion which were up 26% in U.S. dollars, 25% in local currencies and 18% organically compared to 2020. Orders for the quarter were $3.278 billion, which is up 30% compared to the fourth quarter of 2020 and up 9% sequentially, resulting in a strong book-to-bill ratio of 1.08:1. Breaking down fourth quarter sales into our two segments. The Interconnect segment, which comprise 96% of our sales, was up 25% in U.S. dollars, while the Cable segment was up 22% in U.S. dollars. Breaking down full year sales into our two segments. The Interconnect segment was up 27% in U.S. dollars and the Cable segment was up 21% in U.S. dollars. Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes.  GAAP and adjusted operating income was $593 million and $608 million, respectively, in the fourth quarter of 2021 and GAAP operating margin was 19.6%, which decreased by 50 basis points compared to the Q4 of 2020 and by 70 basis points relative to the third quarter of 2021. Fourth quarter 2021 GAAP operating income includes $15 million of acquisition-related costs related to the Halo acquisition, which closed during the fourth quarter. Excluding these costs, the fourth quarter 2021 adjusted operating margin was 20.1%, which decreased by 50 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of 2020 and by 20 basis points relative to the third quarter of 2021.  The year-over-year decrease was primarily driven by the impact of the more challenging commodity and supply chain environment, together with a slight margin dilution of acquisitions, and these impacts were partially offset by the normal operating leverage on higher sales levels as well as the lower negative cost impacts from the pandemic. On a sequential basis, the slight decrease in adjusted operating margin was due to the continued challenging commodity and supply chain environment, which has not yet been fully offset by pricing and other actions. For the full year 2021, GAAP operating margin was 19.4% and adjusted operating margin was 20%. The 80 basis point increase in adjusted operating margin as compared to 2020 was primarily driven by the normal operating leverage on higher sales volumes as well as the lower negative cost impacts resulting from the pandemic, and these benefits were partially offset by the more challenging commodity and supply chain environment experienced in 2021 as well as the current margin dilutive effect of the acquisitions we made during the year. From a segment standpoint, operating margin in the Interconnect segment was 22.1% in the fourth quarter of 2021, and operating margin in the Cable segment was 2.4%. Our margins in the Cable segment continued to be particularly impacted by the ongoing and significant increase in commodity and logistics costs, which have not yet been offset by pricing actions. Given the dynamic overall cost and supply chain environment, we are very proud of the company's operating performance. Our team's ability to effectively manage through all of these many challenges is a direct result of the strength and commitment of the company's entrepreneurial management team, which continues to foster high-performance, action-oriented culture. The company's GAAP effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 18.8% and the adjusted effective tax rate was 23.8%, which compared to 21.7% and 24.5% in the fourth quarter of 2020, respectively. The slightly lower adjusted tax rate in the quarter reflected the year-to-date true-up of a full year adjusted effective tax rate from the expected 24.5% to a slightly lower 24.3% a result -- as a result of a slightly more favorable mix of income for the full year. For the full year 2021, the company's GAAP effective tax rate was 20.6% and the adjusted effective tax rate was 24.3%, which compared to 20.5% and 24.5% in 2020, respectively. In 2022, we expect our adjusted effective tax rate to be approximately 24.5%. GAAP diluted EPS was a record $0.72 in the fourth quarter, an increase of 26% compared to $0.57 in the prior year period and adjusted diluted EPS was also a record $0.70, an increase of 23% compared to $0.57 in the fourth quarter of 2020. For the full year, GAAP diluted EPS was $2.51, a 28% increase from $1.96 in 2020 and adjusted diluted EPS was $2.48 in 2021, an increase of 33% compared to 2020. This was an excellent result, especially considering the significant cost, supply chain and other operational challenges the company faced in 2021. Operating cash flow in the fourth quarter was a record $464 million or 106% of adjusted net income. And net of capital spending -- our free cash flow was also a record $379 million or 87% of adjusted net income. For the full year, 2021 operating cash flow was $1.524 billion or 98% of adjusted net income. And net of capital spending, our free cash flow for 2021 was $1.167 billion or 75% of adjusted net income. From a working capital standpoint, inventory days, days sales outstanding and payable days were 80, 71, 56 days, respectively all of which were within our normal range, and we are especially pleased that our team's focus on all elements of working capital management, which resulted in a significant reduction of the company's inventory days from the third quarter. During the quarter, the company repurchased 2.1 million shares of common stock at an average price of $81, bringing total repurchases during 2021 to 9.3 million shares or $662 million. When combined with our normal quarterly dividend, total capital returned to shareholders in 2021 was more than $1 billion. Total debt at December 31 was $4.8 billion, and net debt was $3.6 billion. Total liquidity at the end of the quarter was $2.9 billion, which included cash and short-term investments on hand of $1.2 billion plus availability under our existing credit facilities. For the quarter and full year 2021 GAAP EBITDA was $726 million and $2.6 billion, respectively. And at the end of 2021, our net leverage ratio was 1.4x. Lastly, as noted in the press release, effective January 1, 2022, we have aligned our businesses into three new reportable segments. We will report results for these new segments as well as comparable historical financial data starting in the first quarter of 2022. I will now turn the call over to Adam, who will provide some commentary on current market trends.\nAdam Norwitt: Well, thank you very much, Craig, and I'd like to also extend my welcome to all of you here on the phone today. And hopefully, it's not too late for me to wish you and your family is all a happy new year. I also want to just express my wishes that everybody here on the call together with your family, your friends and your colleagues are all managing to stay safe and healthy, in particular, amidst the Omicron wave that's occurring in many areas of the country. As Craig mentioned, I'm going to highlight some of our fourth quarter and, in particular, our full year achievements. I'll discuss our trends and progress across our served markets, and then I'll make a few comments on our outlook in the first quarter. And of course, we'll have time for Q&A thereafter. With respect to the fourth quarter, we're truly proud to have finished the year with record sales and adjusted earnings per share in the fourth quarter, both of which were significantly above the guidance that we gave just 90 days ago. Sales grew by a very strong 25% in U.S. dollars and in local currencies reaching a new record of $3.27 billion. On an organic basis, our sales increased by 18%, driven in particular by robust growth in the IT datacom, mobile networks, industrial and automotive end markets. And I'll talk to each of those markets here in a moment. The company booked a record $3.278 billion in orders in the fourth quarter which represented another strong book-to-bill of 1.08:1. Despite the many operational challenges we and others continue to face, including ongoing cost increases related to commodities, supply chain and other pressures, our adjusted operating margins in the quarter reached a very strong 20.1%. Adjusted diluted EPS was a new record $0.70 and represented a robust growth of 23% from prior year, an excellent demonstration of our organization's continued strong execution. And as Craig mentioned, we generated record operating and free cash flow in the quarter of $464 million and $379 million, respectively, both of which are clear reflection of the quality of the company's earnings. Just at the end of this quarter, I'm extremely proud of our team. As these quarter's results once again reflect the discipline and the agility of our entrepreneurial organization who continued to perform very well amidst a very challenging environment. We're also very pleased that in the quarter, we announced on December 1, the acquisition of Halo Technology Limited for a purchase price of approximately $715 million. Halo is a leading provider of active and passive fiber optic interconnect components for the communications infrastructure markets with expected sales this year of approximately $250 million. Halo's product offerings are highly complementary to our existing high-speed and fiber optic Interconnect solutions and represent a significant long-term growth opportunity for Amphenol, in particular with customers in our IT datacom, mobile networks and broadband markets. We're especially excited that Halo significantly bolsters our position in active fiber optic Interconnect products, which is a technology with truly high-growth potential as customers around the world are upgrading their networks to support the acceleration of high-speed data traffic. Halo is an agile supplier of these important products to a wide variety of customers across these communications infrastructure markets, whose unique technology and service offering enables them to realize strong operating results. I'm just very excited to welcome the highly talented and entrepreneurial Halo team to the Amphenol family and look forward to great things from them in the future. We also announced on December 1, the closing of the sale of the MTS Test & Simulation business to Illinois Tool Works or ITW. We remain extremely pleased with the entirety of the MTS acquisition, which as you all recall, was announced last year in the fourth quarter, meaning 2020.  With the disposition of Test & Simulation to ITW, we have now acquired 1 of the leading sensor companies in the industry, further strengthening our broad offering of high-technology sensors. We're very proud of the performance of the MTS sensors team during their first 3 quarters as part of the Amphenol family, and we look forward to them driving outstanding value for many years to come. I remain very confident that our acquisition program will continue to create great value for the company. And in fact, our ability to identify and execute upon acquisitions and then to successfully bring these new companies into Amphenol remains a core competitive advantage for the company. Now turning to the full year of 2021. I can just say it was an extremely successful year for Amphenol despite the many operational and cost challenges that we faced. We expanded our position in the overall market, growing sales by a very strong 26% in U.S. dollars and 18% organically reaching a new sales record of $10.876 billion. I would just note that, in fact, over the past 2 years, both of which have been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, we've grown our sales by more than 32% from our 2019 levels, which is a great confirmation of the value of the company's diversification and the agility of our management team in every environment. Our full year 2021 adjusted operating margins reached 20%, which was an increase of 80 basis points from last year from 2020 despite the multiple pressures on margins that we experienced around the world. And this strong level of profitability enabled us to achieve record adjusted diluted earnings per share of $2.48. We generated operating and free cash flow of $1.524 billion and $1.167 billion, respectively, again, excellent confirmations of the company's superior execution and disciplined working capital management. We also put that cash to work with our acquisition program that created great value in 2021 with 7 new companies added to the Amphenol family. MTS Sensors, Halo, Positronic, LCAB, Unlimited Services, CableCon and Euromicron, have collectively expanded our position across a broad array of technologies and markets while bringing outstanding and talented individuals into the Amphenol family and thereby strengthening our organization. We're excited that these acquisitions represent expanded platforms for the company's future performance. In addition, as Craig noted, in 2021, we bought back over 9.3 million shares under our share buyback program and increased our quarterly dividend by 38% representing a total return of capital to shareholders of just over $1 billion for the year. So while there continues to be a high level of volatility in the overall environment in 2021, as we enter 2022, our agile entrepreneurial management team is confident that we have built further strength from which we can drive superior long-term performance. Now let me turn to the performance of the company across our served markets. And I would just note that we remain very pleased that the company's balanced and broad end market diversification continues to create value for Amphenol with no single end market representing more than 25% of our sales in 2021, and that market, industrial being really one of our most diversified markets across the segments within industrial. We believe that this diversification mitigates the impact of the volatility of individual end markets while continuing to expose us to the leading technologies wherever they may arise across the electronics industry. Now turning to the military market. Military represented 10% of our sales in the fourth quarter and 11% of our sales for the full year of 2021. Our sales grew from prior year by 6% in U.S. dollars in the fourth quarter as we benefited from acquisitions. On an organic basis, our sales did moderate by about 4% driven by reduced sales related to airframe applications and ground vehicles. Sequentially, our sales increased slightly as we had expected coming into the quarter. For the full year 2021, sales to the military market grew by 13% in U.S. dollars and 4% organically, reflecting our leading market position and strong execution across virtually all segments of the military market, together with the benefits of the MTS Sensors and Positronic acquisitions completed earlier in the year. Looking ahead, we expect sales in the first quarter to increase slightly from these fourth quarter levels, and we continue to be excited by the strength of the company's position in the military market. As militaries around the world continue to accelerate their adoption of next-generation technologies, our industry-leading breadth of high-technology Interconnect and Sensor products positions the company strongly across essentially all major defense programs, and this gives us confidence for our long-term performance. The commercial aerospace market represented 2% of our sales in the fourth quarter and as well for the full year of 2021. Sales in the quarter grew 27% in U.S. dollars and 6% organically as we benefited from the beginnings of a recovery in procurement to support growing aircraft production as well as from the contributions from our recent acquisitions. Sequentially we're very pleased that our sales grew a robust 15% from the third quarter, which was in line with our expectations coming into the quarter. For the full year, sales declined by 10%, reflecting the significant impact of the ongoing pandemic on travel and aircraft production. Looking into the first quarter, we expect a sequential moderation in sales from these levels. Regardless of the challenges in the com air market in both 2020 and 2021, our team working in this market remains very committed to leveraging the company's strong Interconnect and Sensor technology positions across a wide array of aircraft platforms and next-generation systems integrated into those airplanes. As personal and business travel continues to recover from the pandemic impacted lows, we look forward to benefiting as jet manufacturers expand their production and, in turn, their procurement of our products. The industrial market represented 25% of our sales in the fourth quarter and for the full year, and sales in this market significantly exceeded our expectations coming into the quarter increasing by a very strong 42% in U.S. dollars and 25% organically from prior year. We experienced robust strength in essentially all segments of the industrial market with particular strength in battery and heavy electric vehicle, transportation, rail mass transit, factory automation, heavy equipment as well as oil and gas. On a sequential basis, our sales increased by 2%, which was significantly better than our expectation for a sequential moderation as we saw broad-based strength. For the full year 2021, sales in the industrial market grew by a very strong 46% in U.S. dollars and 27% organically as we saw again broad-based growth across virtually all market segments of the global industrial market. Looking to the first quarter of 2022, we do expect a sequential moderation in sales from these very strong fourth quarter sales levels. Our outstanding global team working in the industrial market continues to find new opportunities for growth across the many segments of this exciting market. I remain confident that our long-term strategy to expand our high-technology Interconnect Antenna and Sensor offerings, both organically as well as through complementary acquisitions has positioned us to capitalize on the many revolutions happening across the industrial electronics market. We look forward to realizing the benefits of this strategy for many years to come. The automotive market represented 19% of our sales in the fourth quarter and 20% for the full year 2021. Sales in automotive were actually much stronger than we had anticipated coming into the quarter, with revenue growing by a very strong 18% in U.S. dollars and 16% organically versus prior year, and this was driven particularly by strength of our sales in the hybrid and electric vehicle applications as well as our sales to customers in Asia. Sequentially, our automotive sales increased by a very strong 10%, well above our prior expectations for a high single-digit decline as we saw strong demand from customers in anticipation of improving production volumes in the first quarter. For the full year 2021, our sales to the automotive market increased by a strong 47% in U.S. dollars and 41% organically, reflecting the continued recovery of the automotive market as well as our expanded position in next-generation electronics integrated into cars, including, in particular, electric and hybrid drivetrains. Looking into the first quarter, we expect a high single-digit sequential moderation in sales from these very lofty levels that we achieved in the fourth quarter. I remain extremely proud of our team working in the automotive market, who has demonstrated an incredible degree of agility and resiliency in both driving a significant recovery from the reduced sales levels in 2020, while also expertly navigating the myriad of supply chain challenges that struck the entire automotive industry during the course of this year. We look forward to benefiting from their efforts long into the future. The mobile devices market represented 14% of our sales in the fourth quarter and 12% of our sales for the full year of 2021. Our sales to mobile device customers declined from prior year by 5% and in U.S. dollars and 6% organically as declines in products incorporated into smartphones more than offset the growth that we did realize in wearable devices, laptops and tablets. Sequentially, our sales increased by a better-than-expected 14%, driven by higher sales to smartphones and wearable devices. For the full year 2021, sales in the mobile devices market increased by 4% in U.S. dollars and 2% organically as we benefited from growth in our products used in laptops and wearables, offset in part by a moderation of sales related to smartphones and tablets which, as you will recall, were particularly strong during 2020 with all of the work from home and study from home dynamics that were there early on in the pandemic. Looking into the first quarter, we anticipate a typical seasonal sequential decline of approximately 35%. While mobile devices will always remain 1 of our most volatile markets, our outstanding and agile team is poised as always to capture any opportunities for incremental sales that may arise in 2022 and beyond. Our leading array of antennas, interconnect products and mechanisms continue to enable a broad range of next-generation mobile devices, which positions us well for the long term. The mobile networks market represented 5% of our sales in the quarter and for the full year. And we're very pleased that sales in mobile networks increased from prior year by a very strong 36% in U.S. dollars and 28% organically. And this was with growth, particularly from our sales to mobile network operators in support of their next-generation 5G network buildouts. Sequentially, our sales increased by a higher-than-expected 7%. For the full year 2021, our sales to the mobile networks market grew by 12% from prior year and 7% organically. Looking into the first quarter of 2022, we do expect sales to moderate from these very strong levels. Our team continues to work aggressively to realize the benefits of our long-term efforts at expanding our position in next-generation 5G equipment and networks around the world.  As customers continue to ramp up their investments into these advanced systems, we look forward to benefiting from the increased potential that comes from our unique position with both equipment manufacturers and mobile service providers.  The information technology and data communications market represented 22% of our sales in the fourth quarter and 21% of our sales for the full year. Sales in the fourth quarter in IT Datacom were much stronger than expected, rising by 53% in U.S. dollars and 49% organically from prior year as we benefited from broad-based demand for our industry-leading high-speed power and fiber optics solutions. While we saw strength really across server, networking and storage applications, we experienced especially robust growth from web service providers and other data center operators in the quarter. Sequentially, our sales grew by 10%, which was significantly higher than our expectations, which had been coming into the quarter of a slight decline. We do believe our sales growth benefited from some modest pull-in of demand from the first quarter as customers prepared for potential supply chain issues related to Chinese New Year. For the full year 2021, our sales to the IT datacom market grew by a very strong 26% in U.S. dollars and 24% organically as we continue to benefit from our strong technology solutions and leading position across a broad array of applications. Again, sales to web service providers were a significant contributor to our full year growth in 2021.  Looking ahead, we do expect a high single-digit moderation in the first quarter, reflecting the very robust demand in the fourth quarter. Nevertheless, we're excited by our strengthened technology position especially with the addition of Halo's active and passive fiber optic interconnect products. I remain encouraged by the company's outstanding position in the global IT datacom market. Our OEM and service provider customers continue to drive their equipment and networks to ever higher levels of performance in order to manage the continued dramatic increases in demand for bandwidth and processor power. We look forward to realizing the benefits of our leading position for many years to come. And finally, the broadband market represented 3% of our sales in the quarter and 4% for the full year, sales increased by 14% in U.S. dollars and 2% organically from prior year as we benefited from increased spending by cable operators as well as the contributions from our recent acquisitions. On a sequential basis, sales grew by a better-than-expected 10%. For the full year 2021, sales to the broadband market grew by 9% in U.S. dollars and 1% organically. Looking ahead, we expect sales to increase in the low double digits from these levels as we benefit from the addition of Halo's product sales into the broadband market. We remain encouraged by the company's position with broadband customers and we look forward to continuing to support our service provider customers around the world, all of whom are working to increase their bandwidth to support the expansion of high-speed data applications to both homes and businesses. Now turning to our outlook. The current market environment, no doubt, remains highly uncertain with significant continuing supply chain and inflationary challenges as well as the impact of the ongoing pandemic assuming that conditions do not meaningfully worsen and also assuming constant exchange rates. For the first quarter, we expect sales in the range of $2.690 billion to $2.750 billion as well as adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $0.59 to $0.61. This guidance represents very strong sales growth over prior year of 13% to 16% as well as adjusted diluted EPS growth of 13% to 17% compared to the first quarter of last year. Finally, I just want to note, as we described in our press release, effective January 1 of this year, we have aligned our business units into 3 newly formed divisions, Harsh Environment Solutions, Communication Solutions and Interconnect and Sensor Systems. This new alignment will allow us to further scale our business beyond the $10 billion sales level that we crossed last year. Very importantly, this alignment further strengthens our unique and strong Amphenolian culture of entrepreneurship, while reinforcing the accountability of our 130 general managers around the world. We look forward to providing more detail -- financial detail about these reportable segments at the time of our April earnings release. I come away from this quarter still so confident in the ability of our outstanding management team to adapt to the continued challenges in the marketplace and to capitalize on the many future opportunities to grow our market position and expand our profitability. In addition, our entire organization remains committed to delivering long-term sustainable value, all while prioritizing the continued safety and health of each of our employees around the world. And most importantly, I'd just like to close by taking this opportunity to once again thank the entire Amphenol team. In particular, I'd like to extend my thanks to all of our factory workers around the world. While many of us have been able to work from home on occasion during these last two pandemic impacted years, I'm just so inspired by the dedication of our factory workers who never worked a single day at home and it was just a phenomenal thing to see. And the results that we saw in the fourth quarter really are a great credit to their and our entire Amphenol organization's dedication. And with that, operator, we'd be very happy to take any questions that you may have.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. You may go ahead.\nAmit Daryanani: Thanks for taking my questions. I guess, Adam, as I think about the demand vectors that you're seeing, there's obviously some worry out there that you might be over shipping versus end demand in some big rate. If I think about 24% growth in December, your guide is implying a very healthy 14%, 15% growth in March. I think your compare is actually difficult. I'd love to get any perspective you have in terms of the growth that you're seeing, if it's truly end demand or you think there's a bit of an inventory build happening at the customer level and then maybe as a way to think about this in terms of your growth vectors direct versus the channel, that would be helpful, too.\nAdam Norwitt: Yes. Well, thanks so much, Amit, and happy New Year. Look, we don't have a perfect visibility into, as you know, our OEM customers and their warehouses and how much inventory they're holding. But there's no doubt about it that across the electronics industry, and I guess, across really all industries, customers have probably gotten a little more gun shy because of supply chain challenges. At the same time, I can tell you there's robust demand. And I think if you take a market like the automotive industry, as one example, try to go out and buy a car today, it's not an easy thing. I know Craig went out and recently bought a car, and he shared with me that there was nothing to buy. And the choices that one has when one is willing and ready to go out and buy something is just not there still today. And so whether there is a mismatch of components that ultimately is creating difficulty for our end customers to ship things and that can create some challenges across their supply chain. That may very well be. But the end demand by end consumers for things like cars, for things like semiconductors, for things like high-speed data this end demand still seems relatively robust. As it relates to the channel, as you know, very well, distribution represents for us. I think this year, it was about 17 or so percent of our sales, which was a little tick up from years past, and it was 15%, 16%. And we saw very strong demand from distribution through the course of the year. And I wouldn't say that we've seen any inventory build. To the contrary, I would say that probably inventories are a little bit lighter inside distribution, reflecting the strength of the pull-through of demand. What does that mean here going into the first quarter? No doubt about it. There remains a lot of volatility. There remain a lot of supply chain challenges. But I'm sure that whatever comes along, our team is going to be very agile and nimble to jump on any opportunities to ship products like we were in the fourth quarter.\nOperator: The next question is from Matt Sheerin with Stifel. You may go ahead.\nMatthew Sheerin: Yes, thank you. And good afternoon. Adam, I just wanted to talk about the upside that you saw across several end markets at a time when a lot of your peers are even missing numbers or talking about big revenue opportunities that they missed as a result. And I'm wondering whether Amphenol's unique operating model when you've got many operating units running on their own, does that put you at an advantage in a market like this? And then just as a follow-up, regarding your inventory reduction, are you expecting to build in some markets because of their supply chain issues?\nAdam Norwitt: Well, Matt, thank you very much. I mean this is a question that, as you know, is very close to my heart. I mean the simple answer to your question is yes, we do believe that our unique operating model creates a competitive advantage in the marketplace because of the agility the reactivity and the flexibility that it instills at every level of the company. I mentioned in my prepared remarks that we have taken this step effective January 1 of creating the three operating divisions of the company. And the purpose of this is to ensure the long-term scalability of that unique operating model, making sure that every one of our 130 general managers around the world has reports to somebody who has the bandwidth to support them in every way that we need to drive collaboration, to stimulate them to exceed beyond levels that they ever thought they could do and that is really the magic of the Amphenol operating model. When I joined the company 23 years ago, we were just some general managers reporting to our then CEO, Martin Loffler. And it was -- when we were about to reach $2 billion in sales that we created the first concept of a grouping of those general managers, again, to ensure the appropriate span of control, the appropriate attention and the stimulation of all of the value that comes from inside the company. And that group model, we eventually became seven operating groups. And as we have evolved, it became very clear that to continue fostering that unique operating model, we needed to create more operating groups, and I can't have 12 of them reporting to me, and that's why we create now this concept of the divisions. But at the end of the day, all of our jobs is to enable those 130 general managers around the world because that is ultimately what makes this company special. And why we're able to succeed in really good times and bad and in particular, in volatile times like today. In terms of inventory, I mean I think we're very proud of the work of our team and actually reducing our inventory in the fourth quarter, even with a 7% sequential increase in sales and bringing our inventory days basically to a normal level at the end of the year in a time period where there's so much supply chain chaos. And you can imagine in the first quarter that maybe days would go up with the sequential sales that we have guided. But this is a phenomenal reflection of the fact that these 130 general managers, they're not just responsible for sales. They're not just responsible for gross margin. They're responsible for the entirety of their businesses. Every line item of the P&L, every line item of the cash flow, every line item of the balance sheet, and that allows them to really perform in challenging times like today.\nOperator: Our next question is from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. You may go ahead.\nSamik Chatterjee: Thanks for taking my question. I guess I'm more -- I'm looking back and you've typically also provided some color on the full year expectations in the past. And you -- maybe if you can comment on the thinking behind not providing a full year guide? And if you can share how you're thinking about the sustainability of the growth rate that you have in 1Q through the remainder of the year and any thoughts on margins. Just to give us some guide points about how to think about the year?\nAdam Norwitt: I mean, look, very simply put, we remain in a once in a centric global pandemic. I know we here live in Connecticut, where we've just gone through the Omicron wave, that Omicron wave is probably going to other places around the world, including places in which we manufacture products, and it doesn't seem prudent at this point to try to get out ahead of our skis on guessing a pandemic is going to strike and could potentially impact our customers anywhere in the world. And in such an environment, we don't think it's prudent to give guidance beyond the quarter that we've given, and that includes guidance on margins, on sales by market and all the other aspects\nOperator: The next question is from Will Stein with Truist Securities. You may go ahead.\nWilliam Stein: Great, thanks for taking my question. Congrats on the very good results and outlook. I have a question about the new segments and operating structure that you highlighted. Adam, you -- several years ago, you sort of forecasted this to some degree you said that at some point you might need to add a new layer of management. So now we're seeing it. But the question I have is about how this compares to the current organization and, in particular, the current end markets. Will we still have the same end market disclosure at least on the earnings call? And will those in fact, roll up to segments so that we can use want to forecast the other? Or are these sort of orthogonal cuts at revenue? And maybe along with that, from a management perspective, remind us, did the end markets have business leaders one per end market? Or is that just -- is the end market discussion more for our understanding and analysis and not the way the company is managed internally. Sorry for the compound question, but thank you.\nAdam Norwitt: Well, number one, you have a memory like a steel trap as always. And #2, I think you essentially answered your question in certain ways here. Look, we organized our company not by market. And so our 130 general managers are each responsible for a certain distinct type of product across the extraordinary array of products that we see in the interconnect, as we define broadly interconnect products from connectors to value-add cable assemblies, printed circuit assemblies to sensors, to antennas and just the tens and tens and tens of thousands of different types of products that we make. And ultimately, because our general managers are responsible for manufacturing and design and quality and everything, it is really a product focus that each of them have. And as you know, we've talked for many years that one of our strategies that has been so successful is the way that we diversify the company is we design products maybe initially for a customer in a certain market. But then we work very aggressively and collaboratively across the company to proliferate that product across all markets that we can see. So an example is high-speed products. Originally high-speed products were developed for IT applications, for things like core routers and the like. But as high-speed data starts to proliferate into other areas, for example, a fighter jet. Now our team in high speed would work collaboratively with the team who is maybe more focused in the defense market to make sure that we're creating the broadest product offering for those customers.  And so what that ends up meaning is that many of our general managers work across multiple markets. Some of them are focused, some are not, depending on the type of product. And at the end of the day, the divisions that we now will report as reportable segments, they will each sell into multiple of our markets and the markets won't map to the divisions as it were. But we'll provide disclosure on what markets are in which division, but you're going to end up finding that most of our markets are serviced by all three of those divisions.\nCraig Lampo: Yes. And we'll continue to guide by end market as we have done historically. We will not be guiding by division, but we will be giving similar to we give today, financial information, revenue income information at the segment level. And so -- but nothing will change from a guidance perspective in terms of how we talk about guidance.\nAdam Norwitt: And we're not going to change the transparency that we give to all of you with all of our end markets.\nOperator: The next question is from Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs. You may go ahead.\nMark Delaney: Yes, good afternoon and thanks very much for taking the question. I was hoping you could talk a bit about how to think through conversion margins at the EBIT level going forward. Very understandably, you mentioned a few headwinds in terms of M&A and supply chain that impacted the fourth quarter on a year-over-year basis. So I'm curious if you should think it's possible you have better than typical conversion margins this year as you have more opportunity to offset some of those challenges and some maybe above the historical conversion margin levels for 2022? Thank you.\nCraig Lampo: Yes. Thanks, Mark. No, no doubt. I mean I just wanted to start with just saying that we really are actually proud of kind of what we achieved here and for the full year 2021 and for the fourth quarter being at 20.1% and 20% for the full year amidst a really challenging year from a cost and supply chain perspective. The team really did a, I think, outstanding job of kind of navigating that as the year really continued to progressively get worse in regards to just the underlying costs that the organization was seeing and to be able to kind of navigate that through pricing and other actions. I think that the team did a pretty outstanding job of doing that, which has ultimately resulted in the results we have today. As we look into the first quarter, kind of implied in our guidance, I know we don't per se talk about or guide to specific EBIT numbers. But our implied guidance would reflect actually some level of progress made in the first quarter in regards to pricing and other actions so that -- and where you could see that really is kind of the sequential conversion, typically on a lower revenue level, especially going from Q4 to Q1, where we have high single-digit, 10% sequential reduction in revenue, we would see typically kind of high 20s, even 30% kind of negative conversions. And in this implied guide, there's closer to kind of mid 20s sequential conversion. That's even including some negative impact from a conversion perspective related to Halo in regards to because they're around our company average, but that necessarily bring with the normal conversion level. So I think from that perspective, we are seeing some positive momentum as we move into the first quarter. And I don't think I'll talk past the first quarter at this point. Obviously, the team continues to work hard at improving the bottom line and kind of we'll see what happens with the underlying environment as well. But I am confident as we saw in 2021 that the team has done a good job, and we'll continue to do, I think, a very good job of navigating this very difficult environment.\nOperator: The next question is from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. You may go ahead.\nWamsi Mohan: Yes, thank you. Adam, Craig, you both mentioned commodity and logistics costs several times. And you noted that you're taking ongoing price actions. When do you expect these actions to fully offset? I guess, Craig mentioned partly in 1Q, you are making progress. But if these costs stayed relatively fixed, let's say, given the price action that you've taken across your portfolio, when should we think that you would be able to mitigate the entire amount?  And secondarily, would you say that these pricing actions that you've taken are broad-based across the entire portfolio? Are there areas like auto, which typically take longer to have price discussion and price increases filtered through sort of behind the curve? And maybe if you could just characterize Adam, like what percent of the portfolio maybe have seen price increases? Thank you.\nCraig Lampo: Thanks, Wamsi. I think in regards to when our pricing actions could fully offset, I mean, this is kind of a theoretical question because it's difficult to say ultimately what's going to happen to the underlying environment. I think to assume that the underlying environment is going to stay exactly where it is today is a little bit unrealistic. So whether or not it gets better or gets worse. But I could tell you that, again, as I mentioned a minute ago that the team is doing I think a good job, and we are starting to see progress here in the first quarter. So I'm not really sure I can tell you exactly when that would be. But I would tell you that we are confident that based on some of the progress we're starting to make here in the first quarter that we're starting to make some headway on it given the current environment. But we're sitting here again in continuing pandemic, continuing into economic environment that's a bit uncertain. So for me to kind of try to predict when we're going to completely offset the current cost environment is just not something that I guess they're prepared to do.\nAdam Norwitt: And then, Wamsi, relative to our pricing strategy and every customer, every market, every region, every circumstance is different. Pricing is an art, it's not a science. You can bet that every one of our 130 general managers has this at the forefront of their mind. We also know that we -- there are some markets where it's easier to raise price, for example, in distribution, you just sort of announced a price list increase. And there are others where it's more challenging and where you have maybe longer-term contracts or where there's just not -- people are not accustomed to the concept. And so there's a real process of educating customers of being transparent with them and ultimately bringing them around to the understanding that what you're talking to them about is reasonable and especially that it's reasonable in light of your company's steadfast support for them, which is something where I think we stand on very solid ground. We were there for our customers through the pandemic. We were there for them when maybe others were not through the supply chain crisis. And so that -- all things being equal, should position us well to be able to ask nicely of our customers that, that would -- that they should share in that. Also our markets have a lot of different time cycles to them. Some of them are very short-cycle markets where there's really no price change. Others are longer cycle markets. To give you a percent of all where we've been able to achieve pricing, I couldn't even do it. We don't have 1 computer system that can sort of push a button and split that out. But I think we're having increasing success, Craig alluded to that as well. It's a hard job, it's a job that is ultimately the responsibility of our general managers who are best positioned to know what costs are going up and then who themselves sit in front of the customers and have those very difficult negotiations. I think we're going to continue to make good progress over the course of this year, when ultimately we fully offset it, as Craig said, is a theoretical question, that's not so easy for us to answer.\nOperator: The next question is from Nick Todorov with Longbow Research. You may go ahead.\nNikolay Todorov: Thanks. I appreciate it. Good afternoon, guys. Sorry, another pricing question maybe for Craig. Craig, is there a way to break for us the headwind from supply chain versus M&A in 2021 as because 2021 was pretty busy for you from an M&A perspective for you?\nCraig Lampo: Yes. I mean I would say that if you look at our kind of overall conversion for 2021, it was probably actually pretty close to what our target is on an organic basis. That's -- we had some benefit from some pandemic costs offset by some supply chain-related costs. And then kind of the difference that is related to our acquisitions, which did bring with them at least currently a lower operating margin, which over time, we believe that we should be able to get up to the company average. So I think that's the way to think about it. I think that again, we're very proud of the ability to really actually Adam alluded to our 2-year increase in revenue over kind of through a pandemic in the supply chain, we call crisis and of over 32%. And the reality is, actually, our EPS, our earnings actually increased by that -- roughly that same amount a little bit even higher than that slightly.  So I think that typically, we want to have a slightly higher EPS increase. And I think that given the fact that we've done a really good job of kind of offsetting some of these costs, I think, ultimately, we were able to really continue to increase our earnings over that 2-year period at a rate that's slightly under that we would have hoped from an organic perspective, but actually very, I think, respectable and very actually I'm very proud of considering all the costs that existed over the last couple of years here.\nOperator: The next question is from Steven Fox with Fox Advisors. You may go ahead.\nSteven Fox: Thanks. Good afternoon. I guess I was just wondering, respectfully, looking at the last few quarters, the company has sort of look for a moderation in industrial and IT datacom and it's continued to perform a lot better than you guys were thinking and now you're sort of calling for the same thing again. Just stepping back and looking at the past versus going forward, is there anything different in your thinking now that you're seeing in the markets or just still trying to be conservative and any other risks you would point out that maybe we should appreciate? Thanks.\nAdam Norwitt: Well, thanks so much, Steven. Good afternoon to you. And no disrespect at all taken. I think it's a very good question. Look, we come into every quarter in this very uncertain and relatively volatile environment and try to give you and our entire investor base the best assessment that we can give on the basis of what we're hearing from our customers and on the basis of how -- what we're seeing in the supply chain and our operations and all of that. And I think we have outperformed in industrial and IT datacom. And we were really pleasantly surprised last quarter. I mean this is a very significant outperformance that we achieved here in the fourth quarter. I think maybe a little bit less outperformance, but still very strong in the third quarter. Are we going to outperform what we've guided in the first quarter in IT datacom and industrial? I'm not going to say that right now, but you can imagine our team is a very hungry team, who really takes a real make-it-happen attitude and tries to do everything we can. And ultimately, their goal is not just to maximize revenues so that we can report higher revenues, but their goal is to make sure that we're there for our customers when they need us. And in particular, we're there for our customers when others are not there for them because we believe that these two years have really created an opportunity for us to solidify our position with customers in a way that we actually weren't able to do prior to this real crisis over these last two years.  And so whenever we hear from a customer that they need something desperately because others are not able to get it to them. That's where our 130 general managers spring into action with even more vigor and energy than they have before. And because we see that as something that's able to create a long-term platform of sustainable strength with our customers that will create dividends for many years to come. And so what does that ultimately mean here for the first quarter. We're trying to give the best guidance that we can in light of what we see today in what is still a highly uncertain environment. But there's no doubt about it that the Amphenol team is going to fight hard for every possible opportunity to deliver whatever upside is available to us.\nOperator: The next question is from Luke Junk with Baird. You may go ahead.\nLuke Junk: Good afternoon. I had a bigger picture question this afternoon, Adam. If Amphenol becomes a larger company with sales, of course, exceeding $10 billion for the first time this year, does it alter your approach to M&A at all, either in terms of the companies that you're targeting or your ability to integrate deals of all sizes? And I suppose the new segment structure could also play into this specifically, you've done two fairly large deals now in an 8-month window in the form of MTS and Halo. Does it say something about the future direction of the company? Or am I just reading too much into your recent deals?\nAdam Norwitt: No. Luke, it's a great question. I think when we talk about scaling the company, we really think about that in every aspect. Most importantly, we think about making sure that we preserve, secure and evolve that unique operating culture and that we can scale the company amidst that operating culture. That's really step one. But every other aspect of what we do also needs to scale and that includes our M&A program. And I find it really interesting. Over the course of my -- coming close to quarter of a century that I've been with this company 23 years, I started in Amphenol as an M&A intern. So I've been deeply involved in our M&A program all the way back to 1998. And we have said consistently from that time that we would expect that over the long term, acquisitions would roughly represent about 1/3 of our growth -- and that's been the case when we were a less than $900 million revenue company when I joined, all the way to today when we were close to an $11 billion revenue company. And what is interesting, I've referred to these last two years through the cycle, and Craig referred to that as well, we grew by roughly 32% through that cycle, and our organic growth was just over 20% during that time, which tells you that even in a pandemic and even with the size and scale of the company as it is, we've been able to still have acquisitions represent 1/3 of the company's growth. And how do you do that? Well, the arithmetic is pretty straightforward. As the company grows, either you have to make more acquisitions of the same size or you have to make acquisitions a bigger size. And the fact is, I think we've done all of the above. And so when we look at what we have done here with the MTS acquisition, our first-ever public company. When we look at the acquisition at the end of the year of Halo, these are not insignificant sized acquisitions yet we didn't defocus ourselves from making also the really unique enabling tuck-in acquisitions, companies like Positronic and LCAP and Euromicron and CableCon and the like and unlimited services. So we will continue to make acquisitions of all sizes. Now with the new division alignment, it actually opens even further the aperture of the types of deals that we may be able to execute upon because part of what we're doing is creating the bandwidth in our leadership team such that they can devote more time to things like driving collaboration, working with key customers and also making acquisitions. And with the size of these divisions, it would make just as easy as we bring in a $50 million company with the general manager, and we say you're now just part of Amphenol, nothing changes. We can do that with a $1 billion company one day if we find the appropriate company. And so the range of acquisitions, the scale -- the range of the scale of acquisitions that we can make, I think, is really limitless. The opportunity and the resources that we have to devote to executing on those and also making sure that they're successful once we bring them in is also really expanded by this new alignment. And so we see no reason to think amidst this, what is still a very highly fragmented market that we participate in, that M&A can't continue to be a driver like it has been for already more than two decades so far.\nOperator: The next question is from Chris Snyder with UBS. You may go ahead.\nChristopher Snyder: Thank you. I just wanted to follow-up on the previous commentary on M&A strategy. So as does the range of acquisitions widen and maybe the average size pushes higher to kind of achieve that 1/3 growth coming from M&A target. Is there any impact on the multiples that the company is willing to pay or maybe has to pay to go after these larger acquisitions? And are there any maybe increased challenges or difficulty integrating these larger businesses into the broader Amphenol? Thank you.\nAdam Norwitt: Thanks so much, Chris. I mean, look, simply put, I don't think it does have an impact on the multiple. I mean, I will just tell you that you take the MTS acquisition, as an example, and we announced just last quarter that we closed on the disposition of the Test & Simulation business. The net multiple that we ended up paying for 1 of the most precious assets in the industry of some of the most highest technology sensors that there is, was not a double-digit multiple when all was said and done. And I think that is a real testament to our ability to navigate a very challenging and very complex acquisition process, our first ever public company, our first ever concurrent disposition of an asset. And in the end, we get a phenomenal organization with some of the best technology in the industry, amazing people, and we do that in a first single-digit multiple. So I think that is a confirmation of the fact that big does not necessarily equal more expensive. And in terms of the integration, we are never going to relax on the very simple principles that we have always applied to acquisitions, large and small. We look for three things when we look for acquisitions. We look for great people with great products and great position. And it's that first criteria, the great people that is for us the true litmus test of whether we will or will not buy a company. And if it does not have those great people, we walk away every day of the week. And by having those great people, that means that there are people that we can rely upon, and we bring them into our organization, especially as its newly aligned and we let them go do their thing. And all we do is we open doors for them for new opportunities that can only come by being part of a company as broad as global and as strong as Amphenol. And so we think if anything else, if anything, as we have grown, as we've scaled the company, it's added momentum to really what has been a flywheel effect of our acquisition program over many years.\nOperator: The next question is from Joseph Spak with RBC Capital Markets. You may go ahead.\nJoseph Spak : Thanks. I wanted to focus on your automotive business for a second. You outperformed production by an incredible 40% this year. And I was wondering if you could maybe distill that down into how much you think of that came from mix and some of the broader trends in automotive versus share gains? And maybe recenter us for what a -- obviously, that's not sustainable at that level, but like what's a more reasonable go-forward not in any given period, but over time, sort of outgrowth over the coming years given the trends you see in that segment?\nAdam Norwitt: Well, thanks so much, Joe, and I hadn't actually done the math because we don't follow so much what is production and what is not production. I mean we care about the applications that these next-generation technology applications. But no doubt about it, our team did a phenomenal job this year and in particular, did a phenomenal job in capitalizing on new applications. And I would just point to something like the electrification trend where we just had fabulous growth in electrified applications really outperforming and taking more than our fair share of the opportunities in that space. And that's always been our long-term strategy in automotive. We're not trying to take business out of the pockets of those who have it already. That's not a great approach in automotive. But rather we look for the sort of technological innovations and those new adoptions of electronics, and then we aggressively pursue those with our agile entrepreneurial team. And I think that, that's been really successful here in this year.  If I look over the course of kind of the last, call it, 13 years since I've been CEO, which really goes back to the low watermark of our automotive business. I mean we've consistently outperformed in automotive by a very significant margin, kind of year in and year out. And what does that mean in terms of a go-forward outperformance I've never put numbers on this, but we would certainly expect that our team would be able to continue to outperform overall units and what that translates into for content versus share versus new applications. I'll let you -- who is a much bigger expert in this market than me kind of sets out those numbers. But we clearly believe that we can continue to outperform.\nOperator: Our next question is from Jim Suva with Citigroup. You may go ahead.\nJames Suva: Thank you very much. As we wrap it up, a lot of my questions have been answered. I just want to ask 1 about the new segment reporting and kind of your ERP system. Your company has been very well known as being very lean and mean and good controls and folding in everything. So I was just wondering, I assume this doesn't mean like a new ERP system, it doesn't mean a lot more layers of management earlier in the call, you mentioned layers of management or somebody mentioned that. I'm not sure that's what you meant as opposed to just more oversight in communication. But can you talk to us about ERP system because you've done a lot of M&A.  Now you're talking about new reporting and sometimes people wonder about risk there. But I kind of view it as just providing us more information and not more cost and then not a new ERP system. If you could clarify that would be great. Thank you.\nAdam Norwitt: Jim, it's a fabulous question, and we do appreciate it. The answer is a very hard no. I mean we run 130 ERP systems around the company. Each of our general managers is responsible for their own ERP systems. Craig has a fabulous and very simple off-the-shelf consolidation software that works over the web and the fact that we now align those businesses into divisions does not change our computer system whatsoever. And yes, I mean, I think it was -- I believe, Will, who asked the question and alluded to the concept of a layer. I mean we have appointed three new presidents of these divisions, which is technically a layer but it's not a layer of bureaucracy, like you would see in many organizations. I mean in terms of the cost of doing this, it's nothing at all. I mean that's a very marginal incremental investment because the staff at this division is effectively a head of the division with the financial controller to buy his or her side. So it's -- this is not building infrastructure and building layers and bureaucracy. Far from it, it's just creating the bandwidth across our leadership team across what is now 12 group general managers in those three divisions, whereby the 130 general managers can be enabled. We can drive them. We can set aggressive goals, work with them on solving problems when they're small enough to solve and capitalize on opportunities when they're small enough and early enough to capitalize and to capture. And that's been the Amphenol style ever since I was a General Manager just reported to the CEO. And -- but as we've grown, you cannot just have 130 people reporting to one that doesn't work. You lose the benefit of being part of a broader Amphenol and then become just a holding company. And that's not what we are. We're not at all a holding company. In fact, there is a close interaction, close collaboration, synthesis across those 130 entrepreneurial general managers. We have a term for it. We call it a collaborative entrepreneur, and that's really when we say an Amphenolian that's really what we mean. So -- this is not at all creating new computer systems, new layers, new costs, rather, it's enabling and ensuring the scalability of our unique entrepreneurial structure for many, many years to come as we pass $10 billion here in sales.\nOperator: The next question is from David Kelley with Jefferies. You may go ahead.\nDavid Kelley: Good afternoon, Adam and Craig. Thanks for squeezing me in. I was hoping to get some color on recent gross margin trends in light of some of the unique moving parts, inflation, supply chain, you've also done several acquisitions. And then longer term, you've been at 32% historically. Is that the right way to think about core gross margins for the core business?\nCraig Lampo: Yes. Thanks, David. Gross margin is always kind of sometimes a difficult thing to specifically look at with our business. I mean, over time, maybe it's the trending of it is more applicable. But certainly, in any quarters, it's kind of difficult just because of the -- our markets to bring them with them different gross margins and also different operating expense levels. And so that's why we really just don't look at gross margins or measure ourselves based on the gross margin level. We really look at kind of an operating margin level. I think what you kind of need to look at is ultimately that operating margin, and that's trending over time. And certainly over the last 10 years, we've had a certainly a strong performance and growth of that operating margin level, and that's kind of what you kind of need to focus on. I think 10, 20, 50 basis points, even 100 basis point movement in our gross margin isn't necessarily unexpected, given strength in maybe a mobile device market or industrial market, which brings very different gross margins or a Sensor business tends to have higher gross margins and higher SG&A. So I really just wouldn't so much focus. We do tend to get these questions quite a bit, but it's really the operating margins that ultimately, we measure ourselves on. We drive our performance on. And ultimately, I think you should probably focus more on.\nOperator: And our last question comes from Joe Giordano with Cowen. You may go ahead.\nJoseph Giordano: Hey guys, thanks for squeezing me in here. We kind of picked through most. I just wanted to touch on the orders. I mean I think everyone understands that there's a pretty good underlying demand across a lot of these markets. But there does seem to be not just with your results, but others like a scrambling to order stuff in this fourth quarter. Like as you think about the underlying demand and what the orders look like right now, like entering January, do you feel like book-to-bill goes below 1, like at some point over the next couple of quarters? I know we're not doing full year guidance, but just can you kind of compare orders to underlying demand?\nAdam Norwitt: Yes. I think, Joe, we're -- it's hard for us to give a prognosis on what our book-to-bill is going to be. We had a very strong book-to-bill in the year. We finished with a strong book-to-bill. It's clear that our customers want to give us orders. What that book-to-bill will be going forward is actually really hard to predict.  Operator, I think if that's all of our questions. I'd like to just extend my appreciation to everybody on the phone here for spending your precious time with us I wish you all the best as you start the year, and most importantly, I just hope that all of you are able to stay safe and healthy, and we look forward to hearing from you again in just 90 days. Thanks so much, and Happy New Year again.\nCraig Lampo: Thank you, everybody. Bye-bye.\nOperator: Thank you for attending today's conference, and have a nice day.",

            "content": "Thank you very much. Good afternoon, everyone. This is Craig Lampo, Amphenol's CFO, and I'm here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO. We would like to welcome you to our fourth quarter 2021 conference call. Our fourth quarter and full year results were released this morning. I will provide some financial commentary, and then Adam will give you an overview of the business as well as current trends. Then we will take questions. As a reminder, during the call, we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures and may make certain forward-looking statements. So please refer to the relevant disclosures in our press release for further information. In addition, all data discussed during this call will be on a continuing operations basis unless otherwise noted. The company closed the fourth quarter with record sales of $3.027 billion and GAAP and adjusted diluted EPS of $0.72 and $0.70, respectively. We are very proud that the fourth quarter represents the first time in Amphenol's history that we achieved quarterly sales in excess of $3 billion. Fourth quarter sales were up 25% in U.S. dollars and in local currencies and up 18% organically. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2020, the significant sales increase was primarily driven by the robust growth in the IT, data communications, industrial, mobile networks, commercial air, automotive and broadband markets, including contributions from the company's acquisition program. Sequentially, sales were up 7% in U.S. dollars and organically and 8% in local currencies. For the full year 2021, sales were a record $10.876 billion which were up 26% in U.S. dollars, 25% in local currencies and 18% organically compared to 2020. Orders for the quarter were $3.278 billion, which is up 30% compared to the fourth quarter of 2020 and up 9% sequentially, resulting in a strong book-to-bill ratio of 1.08:1. Breaking down fourth quarter sales into our two segments. The Interconnect segment, which comprise 96% of our sales, was up 25% in U.S. dollars, while the Cable segment was up 22% in U.S. dollars. Breaking down full year sales into our two segments. The Interconnect segment was up 27% in U.S. dollars and the Cable segment was up 21% in U.S. dollars. Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes.  GAAP and adjusted operating income was $593 million and $608 million, respectively, in the fourth quarter of 2021 and GAAP operating margin was 19.6%, which decreased by 50 basis points compared to the Q4 of 2020 and by 70 basis points relative to the third quarter of 2021. Fourth quarter 2021 GAAP operating income includes $15 million of acquisition-related costs related to the Halo acquisition, which closed during the fourth quarter. Excluding these costs, the fourth quarter 2021 adjusted operating margin was 20.1%, which decreased by 50 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of 2020 and by 20 basis points relative to the third quarter of 2021.  The year-over-year decrease was primarily driven by the impact of the more challenging commodity and supply chain environment, together with a slight margin dilution of acquisitions, and these impacts were partially offset by the normal operating leverage on higher sales levels as well as the lower negative cost impacts from the pandemic. On a sequential basis, the slight decrease in adjusted operating margin was due to the continued challenging commodity and supply chain environment, which has not yet been fully offset by pricing and other actions. For the full year 2021, GAAP operating margin was 19.4% and adjusted operating margin was 20%. The 80 basis point increase in adjusted operating margin as compared to 2020 was primarily driven by the normal operating leverage on higher sales volumes as well as the lower negative cost impacts resulting from the pandemic, and these benefits were partially offset by the more challenging commodity and supply chain environment experienced in 2021 as well as the current margin dilutive effect of the acquisitions we made during the year. From a segment standpoint, operating margin in the Interconnect segment was 22.1% in the fourth quarter of 2021, and operating margin in the Cable segment was 2.4%. Our margins in the Cable segment continued to be particularly impacted by the ongoing and significant increase in commodity and logistics costs, which have not yet been offset by pricing actions. Given the dynamic overall cost and supply chain environment, we are very proud of the company's operating performance. Our team's ability to effectively manage through all of these many challenges is a direct result of the strength and commitment of the company's entrepreneurial management team, which continues to foster high-performance, action-oriented culture. The company's GAAP effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 18.8% and the adjusted effective tax rate was 23.8%, which compared to 21.7% and 24.5% in the fourth quarter of 2020, respectively. The slightly lower adjusted tax rate in the quarter reflected the year-to-date true-up of a full year adjusted effective tax rate from the expected 24.5% to a slightly lower 24.3% a result -- as a result of a slightly more favorable mix of income for the full year. For the full year 2021, the company's GAAP effective tax rate was 20.6% and the adjusted effective tax rate was 24.3%, which compared to 20.5% and 24.5% in 2020, respectively. In 2022, we expect our adjusted effective tax rate to be approximately 24.5%. GAAP diluted EPS was a record $0.72 in the fourth quarter, an increase of 26% compared to $0.57 in the prior year period and adjusted diluted EPS was also a record $0.70, an increase of 23% compared to $0.57 in the fourth quarter of 2020. For the full year, GAAP diluted EPS was $2.51, a 28% increase from $1.96 in 2020 and adjusted diluted EPS was $2.48 in 2021, an increase of 33% compared to 2020. This was an excellent result, especially considering the significant cost, supply chain and other operational challenges the company faced in 2021. Operating cash flow in the fourth quarter was a record $464 million or 106% of adjusted net income. And net of capital spending -- our free cash flow was also a record $379 million or 87% of adjusted net income. For the full year, 2021 operating cash flow was $1.524 billion or 98% of adjusted net income. And net of capital spending, our free cash flow for 2021 was $1.167 billion or 75% of adjusted net income. From a working capital standpoint, inventory days, days sales outstanding and payable days were 80, 71, 56 days, respectively all of which were within our normal range, and we are especially pleased that our team's focus on all elements of working capital management, which resulted in a significant reduction of the company's inventory days from the third quarter. During the quarter, the company repurchased 2.1 million shares of common stock at an average price of $81, bringing total repurchases during 2021 to 9.3 million shares or $662 million. When combined with our normal quarterly dividend, total capital returned to shareholders in 2021 was more than $1 billion. Total debt at December 31 was $4.8 billion, and net debt was $3.6 billion. Total liquidity at the end of the quarter was $2.9 billion, which included cash and short-term investments on hand of $1.2 billion plus availability under our existing credit facilities. For the quarter and full year 2021 GAAP EBITDA was $726 million and $2.6 billion, respectively. And at the end of 2021, our net leverage ratio was 1.4x. Lastly, as noted in the press release, effective January 1, 2022, we have aligned our businesses into three new reportable segments. We will report results for these new segments as well as comparable historical financial data starting in the first quarter of 2022. I will now turn the call over to Adam, who will provide some commentary on current market trends. Yes. And we'll continue to guide by end market as we have done historically. We will not be guiding by division, but we will be giving similar to we give today, financial information, revenue income information at the segment level. And so -- but nothing will change from a guidance perspective in terms of how we talk about guidance. Yes. Thanks, Mark. No, no doubt. I mean I just wanted to start with just saying that we really are actually proud of kind of what we achieved here and for the full year 2021 and for the fourth quarter being at 20.1% and 20% for the full year amidst a really challenging year from a cost and supply chain perspective. The team really did a, I think, outstanding job of kind of navigating that as the year really continued to progressively get worse in regards to just the underlying costs that the organization was seeing and to be able to kind of navigate that through pricing and other actions. I think that the team did a pretty outstanding job of doing that, which has ultimately resulted in the results we have today. As we look into the first quarter, kind of implied in our guidance, I know we don't per se talk about or guide to specific EBIT numbers. But our implied guidance would reflect actually some level of progress made in the first quarter in regards to pricing and other actions so that -- and where you could see that really is kind of the sequential conversion, typically on a lower revenue level, especially going from Q4 to Q1, where we have high single-digit, 10% sequential reduction in revenue, we would see typically kind of high 20s, even 30% kind of negative conversions. And in this implied guide, there's closer to kind of mid 20s sequential conversion. That's even including some negative impact from a conversion perspective related to Halo in regards to because they're around our company average, but that necessarily bring with the normal conversion level. So I think from that perspective, we are seeing some positive momentum as we move into the first quarter. And I don't think I'll talk past the first quarter at this point. Obviously, the team continues to work hard at improving the bottom line and kind of we'll see what happens with the underlying environment as well. But I am confident as we saw in 2021 that the team has done a good job, and we'll continue to do, I think, a very good job of navigating this very difficult environment. Thanks, Wamsi. I think in regards to when our pricing actions could fully offset, I mean, this is kind of a theoretical question because it's difficult to say ultimately what's going to happen to the underlying environment. I think to assume that the underlying environment is going to stay exactly where it is today is a little bit unrealistic. So whether or not it gets better or gets worse. But I could tell you that, again, as I mentioned a minute ago that the team is doing I think a good job, and we are starting to see progress here in the first quarter. So I'm not really sure I can tell you exactly when that would be. But I would tell you that we are confident that based on some of the progress we're starting to make here in the first quarter that we're starting to make some headway on it given the current environment. But we're sitting here again in continuing pandemic, continuing into economic environment that's a bit uncertain. So for me to kind of try to predict when we're going to completely offset the current cost environment is just not something that I guess they're prepared to do. Yes. I mean I would say that if you look at our kind of overall conversion for 2021, it was probably actually pretty close to what our target is on an organic basis. That's -- we had some benefit from some pandemic costs offset by some supply chain-related costs. And then kind of the difference that is related to our acquisitions, which did bring with them at least currently a lower operating margin, which over time, we believe that we should be able to get up to the company average. So I think that's the way to think about it. I think that again, we're very proud of the ability to really actually Adam alluded to our 2-year increase in revenue over kind of through a pandemic in the supply chain, we call crisis and of over 32%. And the reality is, actually, our EPS, our earnings actually increased by that -- roughly that same amount a little bit even higher than that slightly.  So I think that typically, we want to have a slightly higher EPS increase. And I think that given the fact that we've done a really good job of kind of offsetting some of these costs, I think, ultimately, we were able to really continue to increase our earnings over that 2-year period at a rate that's slightly under that we would have hoped from an organic perspective, but actually very, I think, respectable and very actually I'm very proud of considering all the costs that existed over the last couple of years here. Yes. Thanks, David. Gross margin is always kind of sometimes a difficult thing to specifically look at with our business. I mean, over time, maybe it's the trending of it is more applicable. But certainly, in any quarters, it's kind of difficult just because of the -- our markets to bring them with them different gross margins and also different operating expense levels. And so that's why we really just don't look at gross margins or measure ourselves based on the gross margin level. We really look at kind of an operating margin level. I think what you kind of need to look at is ultimately that operating margin, and that's trending over time. And certainly over the last 10 years, we've had a certainly a strong performance and growth of that operating margin level, and that's kind of what you kind of need to focus on. I think 10, 20, 50 basis points, even 100 basis point movement in our gross margin isn't necessarily unexpected, given strength in maybe a mobile device market or industrial market, which brings very different gross margins or a Sensor business tends to have higher gross margins and higher SG&A. So I really just wouldn't so much focus. We do tend to get these questions quite a bit, but it's really the operating margins that ultimately, we measure ourselves on. We drive our performance on. And ultimately, I think you should probably focus more on. Thank you, everybody. Bye-bye."

            "name": "Adam Norwitt",
            "content": "Well, thank you very much, Craig, and I'd like to also extend my welcome to all of you here on the phone today. And hopefully, it's not too late for me to wish you and your family is all a happy new year. I also want to just express my wishes that everybody here on the call together with your family, your friends and your colleagues are all managing to stay safe and healthy, in particular, amidst the Omicron wave that's occurring in many areas of the country. As Craig mentioned, I'm going to highlight some of our fourth quarter and, in particular, our full year achievements. I'll discuss our trends and progress across our served markets, and then I'll make a few comments on our outlook in the first quarter. And of course, we'll have time for Q&A thereafter. With respect to the fourth quarter, we're truly proud to have finished the year with record sales and adjusted earnings per share in the fourth quarter, both of which were significantly above the guidance that we gave just 90 days ago. Sales grew by a very strong 25% in U.S. dollars and in local currencies reaching a new record of $3.27 billion. On an organic basis, our sales increased by 18%, driven in particular by robust growth in the IT datacom, mobile networks, industrial and automotive end markets. And I'll talk to each of those markets here in a moment. The company booked a record $3.278 billion in orders in the fourth quarter which represented another strong book-to-bill of 1.08:1. Despite the many operational challenges we and others continue to face, including ongoing cost increases related to commodities, supply chain and other pressures, our adjusted operating margins in the quarter reached a very strong 20.1%. Adjusted diluted EPS was a new record $0.70 and represented a robust growth of 23% from prior year, an excellent demonstration of our organization's continued strong execution. And as Craig mentioned, we generated record operating and free cash flow in the quarter of $464 million and $379 million, respectively, both of which are clear reflection of the quality of the company's earnings. Just at the end of this quarter, I'm extremely proud of our team. As these quarter's results once again reflect the discipline and the agility of our entrepreneurial organization who continued to perform very well amidst a very challenging environment. We're also very pleased that in the quarter, we announced on December 1, the acquisition of Halo Technology Limited for a purchase price of approximately $715 million. Halo is a leading provider of active and passive fiber optic interconnect components for the communications infrastructure markets with expected sales this year of approximately $250 million. Halo's product offerings are highly complementary to our existing high-speed and fiber optic Interconnect solutions and represent a significant long-term growth opportunity for Amphenol, in particular with customers in our IT datacom, mobile networks and broadband markets. We're especially excited that Halo significantly bolsters our position in active fiber optic Interconnect products, which is a technology with truly high-growth potential as customers around the world are upgrading their networks to support the acceleration of high-speed data traffic. Halo is an agile supplier of these important products to a wide variety of customers across these communications infrastructure markets, whose unique technology and service offering enables them to realize strong operating results. I'm just very excited to welcome the highly talented and entrepreneurial Halo team to the Amphenol family and look forward to great things from them in the future. We also announced on December 1, the closing of the sale of the MTS Test & Simulation business to Illinois Tool Works or ITW. We remain extremely pleased with the entirety of the MTS acquisition, which as you all recall, was announced last year in the fourth quarter, meaning 2020.  With the disposition of Test & Simulation to ITW, we have now acquired 1 of the leading sensor companies in the industry, further strengthening our broad offering of high-technology sensors. We're very proud of the performance of the MTS sensors team during their first 3 quarters as part of the Amphenol family, and we look forward to them driving outstanding value for many years to come. I remain very confident that our acquisition program will continue to create great value for the company. And in fact, our ability to identify and execute upon acquisitions and then to successfully bring these new companies into Amphenol remains a core competitive advantage for the company. Now turning to the full year of 2021. I can just say it was an extremely successful year for Amphenol despite the many operational and cost challenges that we faced. We expanded our position in the overall market, growing sales by a very strong 26% in U.S. dollars and 18% organically reaching a new sales record of $10.876 billion. I would just note that, in fact, over the past 2 years, both of which have been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, we've grown our sales by more than 32% from our 2019 levels, which is a great confirmation of the value of the company's diversification and the agility of our management team in every environment. Our full year 2021 adjusted operating margins reached 20%, which was an increase of 80 basis points from last year from 2020 despite the multiple pressures on margins that we experienced around the world. And this strong level of profitability enabled us to achieve record adjusted diluted earnings per share of $2.48. We generated operating and free cash flow of $1.524 billion and $1.167 billion, respectively, again, excellent confirmations of the company's superior execution and disciplined working capital management. We also put that cash to work with our acquisition program that created great value in 2021 with 7 new companies added to the Amphenol family. MTS Sensors, Halo, Positronic, LCAB, Unlimited Services, CableCon and Euromicron, have collectively expanded our position across a broad array of technologies and markets while bringing outstanding and talented individuals into the Amphenol family and thereby strengthening our organization. We're excited that these acquisitions represent expanded platforms for the company's future performance. In addition, as Craig noted, in 2021, we bought back over 9.3 million shares under our share buyback program and increased our quarterly dividend by 38% representing a total return of capital to shareholders of just over $1 billion for the year. So while there continues to be a high level of volatility in the overall environment in 2021, as we enter 2022, our agile entrepreneurial management team is confident that we have built further strength from which we can drive superior long-term performance. Now let me turn to the performance of the company across our served markets. And I would just note that we remain very pleased that the company's balanced and broad end market diversification continues to create value for Amphenol with no single end market representing more than 25% of our sales in 2021, and that market, industrial being really one of our most diversified markets across the segments within industrial. We believe that this diversification mitigates the impact of the volatility of individual end markets while continuing to expose us to the leading technologies wherever they may arise across the electronics industry. Now turning to the military market. Military represented 10% of our sales in the fourth quarter and 11% of our sales for the full year of 2021. Our sales grew from prior year by 6% in U.S. dollars in the fourth quarter as we benefited from acquisitions. On an organic basis, our sales did moderate by about 4% driven by reduced sales related to airframe applications and ground vehicles. Sequentially, our sales increased slightly as we had expected coming into the quarter. For the full year 2021, sales to the military market grew by 13% in U.S. dollars and 4% organically, reflecting our leading market position and strong execution across virtually all segments of the military market, together with the benefits of the MTS Sensors and Positronic acquisitions completed earlier in the year. Looking ahead, we expect sales in the first quarter to increase slightly from these fourth quarter levels, and we continue to be excited by the strength of the company's position in the military market. As militaries around the world continue to accelerate their adoption of next-generation technologies, our industry-leading breadth of high-technology Interconnect and Sensor products positions the company strongly across essentially all major defense programs, and this gives us confidence for our long-term performance. The commercial aerospace market represented 2% of our sales in the fourth quarter and as well for the full year of 2021. Sales in the quarter grew 27% in U.S. dollars and 6% organically as we benefited from the beginnings of a recovery in procurement to support growing aircraft production as well as from the contributions from our recent acquisitions. Sequentially we're very pleased that our sales grew a robust 15% from the third quarter, which was in line with our expectations coming into the quarter. For the full year, sales declined by 10%, reflecting the significant impact of the ongoing pandemic on travel and aircraft production. Looking into the first quarter, we expect a sequential moderation in sales from these levels. Regardless of the challenges in the com air market in both 2020 and 2021, our team working in this market remains very committed to leveraging the company's strong Interconnect and Sensor technology positions across a wide array of aircraft platforms and next-generation systems integrated into those airplanes. As personal and business travel continues to recover from the pandemic impacted lows, we look forward to benefiting as jet manufacturers expand their production and, in turn, their procurement of our products. The industrial market represented 25% of our sales in the fourth quarter and for the full year, and sales in this market significantly exceeded our expectations coming into the quarter increasing by a very strong 42% in U.S. dollars and 25% organically from prior year. We experienced robust strength in essentially all segments of the industrial market with particular strength in battery and heavy electric vehicle, transportation, rail mass transit, factory automation, heavy equipment as well as oil and gas. On a sequential basis, our sales increased by 2%, which was significantly better than our expectation for a sequential moderation as we saw broad-based strength. For the full year 2021, sales in the industrial market grew by a very strong 46% in U.S. dollars and 27% organically as we saw again broad-based growth across virtually all market segments of the global industrial market. Looking to the first quarter of 2022, we do expect a sequential moderation in sales from these very strong fourth quarter sales levels. Our outstanding global team working in the industrial market continues to find new opportunities for growth across the many segments of this exciting market. I remain confident that our long-term strategy to expand our high-technology Interconnect Antenna and Sensor offerings, both organically as well as through complementary acquisitions has positioned us to capitalize on the many revolutions happening across the industrial electronics market. We look forward to realizing the benefits of this strategy for many years to come. The automotive market represented 19% of our sales in the fourth quarter and 20% for the full year 2021. Sales in automotive were actually much stronger than we had anticipated coming into the quarter, with revenue growing by a very strong 18% in U.S. dollars and 16% organically versus prior year, and this was driven particularly by strength of our sales in the hybrid and electric vehicle applications as well as our sales to customers in Asia. Sequentially, our automotive sales increased by a very strong 10%, well above our prior expectations for a high single-digit decline as we saw strong demand from customers in anticipation of improving production volumes in the first quarter. For the full year 2021, our sales to the automotive market increased by a strong 47% in U.S. dollars and 41% organically, reflecting the continued recovery of the automotive market as well as our expanded position in next-generation electronics integrated into cars, including, in particular, electric and hybrid drivetrains. Looking into the first quarter, we expect a high single-digit sequential moderation in sales from these very lofty levels that we achieved in the fourth quarter. I remain extremely proud of our team working in the automotive market, who has demonstrated an incredible degree of agility and resiliency in both driving a significant recovery from the reduced sales levels in 2020, while also expertly navigating the myriad of supply chain challenges that struck the entire automotive industry during the course of this year. We look forward to benefiting from their efforts long into the future. The mobile devices market represented 14% of our sales in the fourth quarter and 12% of our sales for the full year of 2021. Our sales to mobile device customers declined from prior year by 5% and in U.S. dollars and 6% organically as declines in products incorporated into smartphones more than offset the growth that we did realize in wearable devices, laptops and tablets. Sequentially, our sales increased by a better-than-expected 14%, driven by higher sales to smartphones and wearable devices. For the full year 2021, sales in the mobile devices market increased by 4% in U.S. dollars and 2% organically as we benefited from growth in our products used in laptops and wearables, offset in part by a moderation of sales related to smartphones and tablets which, as you will recall, were particularly strong during 2020 with all of the work from home and study from home dynamics that were there early on in the pandemic. Looking into the first quarter, we anticipate a typical seasonal sequential decline of approximately 35%. While mobile devices will always remain 1 of our most volatile markets, our outstanding and agile team is poised as always to capture any opportunities for incremental sales that may arise in 2022 and beyond. Our leading array of antennas, interconnect products and mechanisms continue to enable a broad range of next-generation mobile devices, which positions us well for the long term. The mobile networks market represented 5% of our sales in the quarter and for the full year. And we're very pleased that sales in mobile networks increased from prior year by a very strong 36% in U.S. dollars and 28% organically. And this was with growth, particularly from our sales to mobile network operators in support of their next-generation 5G network buildouts. Sequentially, our sales increased by a higher-than-expected 7%. For the full year 2021, our sales to the mobile networks market grew by 12% from prior year and 7% organically. Looking into the first quarter of 2022, we do expect sales to moderate from these very strong levels. Our team continues to work aggressively to realize the benefits of our long-term efforts at expanding our position in next-generation 5G equipment and networks around the world.  As customers continue to ramp up their investments into these advanced systems, we look forward to benefiting from the increased potential that comes from our unique position with both equipment manufacturers and mobile service providers.  The information technology and data communications market represented 22% of our sales in the fourth quarter and 21% of our sales for the full year. Sales in the fourth quarter in IT Datacom were much stronger than expected, rising by 53% in U.S. dollars and 49% organically from prior year as we benefited from broad-based demand for our industry-leading high-speed power and fiber optics solutions. While we saw strength really across server, networking and storage applications, we experienced especially robust growth from web service providers and other data center operators in the quarter. Sequentially, our sales grew by 10%, which was significantly higher than our expectations, which had been coming into the quarter of a slight decline. We do believe our sales growth benefited from some modest pull-in of demand from the first quarter as customers prepared for potential supply chain issues related to Chinese New Year. For the full year 2021, our sales to the IT datacom market grew by a very strong 26% in U.S. dollars and 24% organically as we continue to benefit from our strong technology solutions and leading position across a broad array of applications. Again, sales to web service providers were a significant contributor to our full year growth in 2021.  Looking ahead, we do expect a high single-digit moderation in the first quarter, reflecting the very robust demand in the fourth quarter. Nevertheless, we're excited by our strengthened technology position especially with the addition of Halo's active and passive fiber optic interconnect products. I remain encouraged by the company's outstanding position in the global IT datacom market. Our OEM and service provider customers continue to drive their equipment and networks to ever higher levels of performance in order to manage the continued dramatic increases in demand for bandwidth and processor power. We look forward to realizing the benefits of our leading position for many years to come. And finally, the broadband market represented 3% of our sales in the quarter and 4% for the full year, sales increased by 14% in U.S. dollars and 2% organically from prior year as we benefited from increased spending by cable operators as well as the contributions from our recent acquisitions. On a sequential basis, sales grew by a better-than-expected 10%. For the full year 2021, sales to the broadband market grew by 9% in U.S. dollars and 1% organically. Looking ahead, we expect sales to increase in the low double digits from these levels as we benefit from the addition of Halo's product sales into the broadband market. We remain encouraged by the company's position with broadband customers and we look forward to continuing to support our service provider customers around the world, all of whom are working to increase their bandwidth to support the expansion of high-speed data applications to both homes and businesses. Now turning to our outlook. The current market environment, no doubt, remains highly uncertain with significant continuing supply chain and inflationary challenges as well as the impact of the ongoing pandemic assuming that conditions do not meaningfully worsen and also assuming constant exchange rates. For the first quarter, we expect sales in the range of $2.690 billion to $2.750 billion as well as adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $0.59 to $0.61. This guidance represents very strong sales growth over prior year of 13% to 16% as well as adjusted diluted EPS growth of 13% to 17% compared to the first quarter of last year. Finally, I just want to note, as we described in our press release, effective January 1 of this year, we have aligned our business units into 3 newly formed divisions, Harsh Environment Solutions, Communication Solutions and Interconnect and Sensor Systems. This new alignment will allow us to further scale our business beyond the $10 billion sales level that we crossed last year. Very importantly, this alignment further strengthens our unique and strong Amphenolian culture of entrepreneurship, while reinforcing the accountability of our 130 general managers around the world. We look forward to providing more detail -- financial detail about these reportable segments at the time of our April earnings release. I come away from this quarter still so confident in the ability of our outstanding management team to adapt to the continued challenges in the marketplace and to capitalize on the many future opportunities to grow our market position and expand our profitability. In addition, our entire organization remains committed to delivering long-term sustainable value, all while prioritizing the continued safety and health of each of our employees around the world. And most importantly, I'd just like to close by taking this opportunity to once again thank the entire Amphenol team. In particular, I'd like to extend my thanks to all of our factory workers around the world. While many of us have been able to work from home on occasion during these last two pandemic impacted years, I'm just so inspired by the dedication of our factory workers who never worked a single day at home and it was just a phenomenal thing to see. And the results that we saw in the fourth quarter really are a great credit to their and our entire Amphenol organization's dedication. And with that, operator, we'd be very happy to take any questions that you may have. Yes. Well, thanks so much, Amit, and happy New Year. Look, we don't have a perfect visibility into, as you know, our OEM customers and their warehouses and how much inventory they're holding. But there's no doubt about it that across the electronics industry, and I guess, across really all industries, customers have probably gotten a little more gun shy because of supply chain challenges. At the same time, I can tell you there's robust demand. And I think if you take a market like the automotive industry, as one example, try to go out and buy a car today, it's not an easy thing. I know Craig went out and recently bought a car, and he shared with me that there was nothing to buy. And the choices that one has when one is willing and ready to go out and buy something is just not there still today. And so whether there is a mismatch of components that ultimately is creating difficulty for our end customers to ship things and that can create some challenges across their supply chain. That may very well be. But the end demand by end consumers for things like cars, for things like semiconductors, for things like high-speed data this end demand still seems relatively robust. As it relates to the channel, as you know, very well, distribution represents for us. I think this year, it was about 17 or so percent of our sales, which was a little tick up from years past, and it was 15%, 16%. And we saw very strong demand from distribution through the course of the year. And I wouldn't say that we've seen any inventory build. To the contrary, I would say that probably inventories are a little bit lighter inside distribution, reflecting the strength of the pull-through of demand. What does that mean here going into the first quarter? No doubt about it. There remains a lot of volatility. There remain a lot of supply chain challenges. But I'm sure that whatever comes along, our team is going to be very agile and nimble to jump on any opportunities to ship products like we were in the fourth quarter. Well, Matt, thank you very much. I mean this is a question that, as you know, is very close to my heart. I mean the simple answer to your question is yes, we do believe that our unique operating model creates a competitive advantage in the marketplace because of the agility the reactivity and the flexibility that it instills at every level of the company. I mentioned in my prepared remarks that we have taken this step effective January 1 of creating the three operating divisions of the company. And the purpose of this is to ensure the long-term scalability of that unique operating model, making sure that every one of our 130 general managers around the world has reports to somebody who has the bandwidth to support them in every way that we need to drive collaboration, to stimulate them to exceed beyond levels that they ever thought they could do and that is really the magic of the Amphenol operating model. When I joined the company 23 years ago, we were just some general managers reporting to our then CEO, Martin Loffler. And it was -- when we were about to reach $2 billion in sales that we created the first concept of a grouping of those general managers, again, to ensure the appropriate span of control, the appropriate attention and the stimulation of all of the value that comes from inside the company. And that group model, we eventually became seven operating groups. And as we have evolved, it became very clear that to continue fostering that unique operating model, we needed to create more operating groups, and I can't have 12 of them reporting to me, and that's why we create now this concept of the divisions. But at the end of the day, all of our jobs is to enable those 130 general managers around the world because that is ultimately what makes this company special. And why we're able to succeed in really good times and bad and in particular, in volatile times like today. In terms of inventory, I mean I think we're very proud of the work of our team and actually reducing our inventory in the fourth quarter, even with a 7% sequential increase in sales and bringing our inventory days basically to a normal level at the end of the year in a time period where there's so much supply chain chaos. And you can imagine in the first quarter that maybe days would go up with the sequential sales that we have guided. But this is a phenomenal reflection of the fact that these 130 general managers, they're not just responsible for sales. They're not just responsible for gross margin. They're responsible for the entirety of their businesses. Every line item of the P&L, every line item of the cash flow, every line item of the balance sheet, and that allows them to really perform in challenging times like today. I mean, look, very simply put, we remain in a once in a centric global pandemic. I know we here live in Connecticut, where we've just gone through the Omicron wave, that Omicron wave is probably going to other places around the world, including places in which we manufacture products, and it doesn't seem prudent at this point to try to get out ahead of our skis on guessing a pandemic is going to strike and could potentially impact our customers anywhere in the world. And in such an environment, we don't think it's prudent to give guidance beyond the quarter that we've given, and that includes guidance on margins, on sales by market and all the other aspects Well, number one, you have a memory like a steel trap as always. And #2, I think you essentially answered your question in certain ways here. Look, we organized our company not by market. And so our 130 general managers are each responsible for a certain distinct type of product across the extraordinary array of products that we see in the interconnect, as we define broadly interconnect products from connectors to value-add cable assemblies, printed circuit assemblies to sensors, to antennas and just the tens and tens and tens of thousands of different types of products that we make. And ultimately, because our general managers are responsible for manufacturing and design and quality and everything, it is really a product focus that each of them have. And as you know, we've talked for many years that one of our strategies that has been so successful is the way that we diversify the company is we design products maybe initially for a customer in a certain market. But then we work very aggressively and collaboratively across the company to proliferate that product across all markets that we can see. So an example is high-speed products. Originally high-speed products were developed for IT applications, for things like core routers and the like. But as high-speed data starts to proliferate into other areas, for example, a fighter jet. Now our team in high speed would work collaboratively with the team who is maybe more focused in the defense market to make sure that we're creating the broadest product offering for those customers.  And so what that ends up meaning is that many of our general managers work across multiple markets. Some of them are focused, some are not, depending on the type of product. And at the end of the day, the divisions that we now will report as reportable segments, they will each sell into multiple of our markets and the markets won't map to the divisions as it were. But we'll provide disclosure on what markets are in which division, but you're going to end up finding that most of our markets are serviced by all three of those divisions. And we're not going to change the transparency that we give to all of you with all of our end markets. And then, Wamsi, relative to our pricing strategy and every customer, every market, every region, every circumstance is different. Pricing is an art, it's not a science. You can bet that every one of our 130 general managers has this at the forefront of their mind. We also know that we -- there are some markets where it's easier to raise price, for example, in distribution, you just sort of announced a price list increase. And there are others where it's more challenging and where you have maybe longer-term contracts or where there's just not -- people are not accustomed to the concept. And so there's a real process of educating customers of being transparent with them and ultimately bringing them around to the understanding that what you're talking to them about is reasonable and especially that it's reasonable in light of your company's steadfast support for them, which is something where I think we stand on very solid ground. We were there for our customers through the pandemic. We were there for them when maybe others were not through the supply chain crisis. And so that -- all things being equal, should position us well to be able to ask nicely of our customers that, that would -- that they should share in that. Also our markets have a lot of different time cycles to them. Some of them are very short-cycle markets where there's really no price change. Others are longer cycle markets. To give you a percent of all where we've been able to achieve pricing, I couldn't even do it. We don't have 1 computer system that can sort of push a button and split that out. But I think we're having increasing success, Craig alluded to that as well. It's a hard job, it's a job that is ultimately the responsibility of our general managers who are best positioned to know what costs are going up and then who themselves sit in front of the customers and have those very difficult negotiations. I think we're going to continue to make good progress over the course of this year, when ultimately we fully offset it, as Craig said, is a theoretical question, that's not so easy for us to answer. Well, thanks so much, Steven. Good afternoon to you. And no disrespect at all taken. I think it's a very good question. Look, we come into every quarter in this very uncertain and relatively volatile environment and try to give you and our entire investor base the best assessment that we can give on the basis of what we're hearing from our customers and on the basis of how -- what we're seeing in the supply chain and our operations and all of that. And I think we have outperformed in industrial and IT datacom. And we were really pleasantly surprised last quarter. I mean this is a very significant outperformance that we achieved here in the fourth quarter. I think maybe a little bit less outperformance, but still very strong in the third quarter. Are we going to outperform what we've guided in the first quarter in IT datacom and industrial? I'm not going to say that right now, but you can imagine our team is a very hungry team, who really takes a real make-it-happen attitude and tries to do everything we can. And ultimately, their goal is not just to maximize revenues so that we can report higher revenues, but their goal is to make sure that we're there for our customers when they need us. And in particular, we're there for our customers when others are not there for them because we believe that these two years have really created an opportunity for us to solidify our position with customers in a way that we actually weren't able to do prior to this real crisis over these last two years.  And so whenever we hear from a customer that they need something desperately because others are not able to get it to them. That's where our 130 general managers spring into action with even more vigor and energy than they have before. And because we see that as something that's able to create a long-term platform of sustainable strength with our customers that will create dividends for many years to come. And so what does that ultimately mean here for the first quarter. We're trying to give the best guidance that we can in light of what we see today in what is still a highly uncertain environment. But there's no doubt about it that the Amphenol team is going to fight hard for every possible opportunity to deliver whatever upside is available to us. No. Luke, it's a great question. I think when we talk about scaling the company, we really think about that in every aspect. Most importantly, we think about making sure that we preserve, secure and evolve that unique operating culture and that we can scale the company amidst that operating culture. That's really step one. But every other aspect of what we do also needs to scale and that includes our M&A program. And I find it really interesting. Over the course of my -- coming close to quarter of a century that I've been with this company 23 years, I started in Amphenol as an M&A intern. So I've been deeply involved in our M&A program all the way back to 1998. And we have said consistently from that time that we would expect that over the long term, acquisitions would roughly represent about 1/3 of our growth -- and that's been the case when we were a less than $900 million revenue company when I joined, all the way to today when we were close to an $11 billion revenue company. And what is interesting, I've referred to these last two years through the cycle, and Craig referred to that as well, we grew by roughly 32% through that cycle, and our organic growth was just over 20% during that time, which tells you that even in a pandemic and even with the size and scale of the company as it is, we've been able to still have acquisitions represent 1/3 of the company's growth. And how do you do that? Well, the arithmetic is pretty straightforward. As the company grows, either you have to make more acquisitions of the same size or you have to make acquisitions a bigger size. And the fact is, I think we've done all of the above. And so when we look at what we have done here with the MTS acquisition, our first-ever public company. When we look at the acquisition at the end of the year of Halo, these are not insignificant sized acquisitions yet we didn't defocus ourselves from making also the really unique enabling tuck-in acquisitions, companies like Positronic and LCAP and Euromicron and CableCon and the like and unlimited services. So we will continue to make acquisitions of all sizes. Now with the new division alignment, it actually opens even further the aperture of the types of deals that we may be able to execute upon because part of what we're doing is creating the bandwidth in our leadership team such that they can devote more time to things like driving collaboration, working with key customers and also making acquisitions. And with the size of these divisions, it would make just as easy as we bring in a $50 million company with the general manager, and we say you're now just part of Amphenol, nothing changes. We can do that with a $1 billion company one day if we find the appropriate company. And so the range of acquisitions, the scale -- the range of the scale of acquisitions that we can make, I think, is really limitless. The opportunity and the resources that we have to devote to executing on those and also making sure that they're successful once we bring them in is also really expanded by this new alignment. And so we see no reason to think amidst this, what is still a very highly fragmented market that we participate in, that M&A can't continue to be a driver like it has been for already more than two decades so far. Thanks so much, Chris. I mean, look, simply put, I don't think it does have an impact on the multiple. I mean, I will just tell you that you take the MTS acquisition, as an example, and we announced just last quarter that we closed on the disposition of the Test & Simulation business. The net multiple that we ended up paying for 1 of the most precious assets in the industry of some of the most highest technology sensors that there is, was not a double-digit multiple when all was said and done. And I think that is a real testament to our ability to navigate a very challenging and very complex acquisition process, our first ever public company, our first ever concurrent disposition of an asset. And in the end, we get a phenomenal organization with some of the best technology in the industry, amazing people, and we do that in a first single-digit multiple. So I think that is a confirmation of the fact that big does not necessarily equal more expensive. And in terms of the integration, we are never going to relax on the very simple principles that we have always applied to acquisitions, large and small. We look for three things when we look for acquisitions. We look for great people with great products and great position. And it's that first criteria, the great people that is for us the true litmus test of whether we will or will not buy a company. And if it does not have those great people, we walk away every day of the week. And by having those great people, that means that there are people that we can rely upon, and we bring them into our organization, especially as its newly aligned and we let them go do their thing. And all we do is we open doors for them for new opportunities that can only come by being part of a company as broad as global and as strong as Amphenol. And so we think if anything else, if anything, as we have grown, as we've scaled the company, it's added momentum to really what has been a flywheel effect of our acquisition program over many years. Well, thanks so much, Joe, and I hadn't actually done the math because we don't follow so much what is production and what is not production. I mean we care about the applications that these next-generation technology applications. But no doubt about it, our team did a phenomenal job this year and in particular, did a phenomenal job in capitalizing on new applications. And I would just point to something like the electrification trend where we just had fabulous growth in electrified applications really outperforming and taking more than our fair share of the opportunities in that space. And that's always been our long-term strategy in automotive. We're not trying to take business out of the pockets of those who have it already. That's not a great approach in automotive. But rather we look for the sort of technological innovations and those new adoptions of electronics, and then we aggressively pursue those with our agile entrepreneurial team. And I think that, that's been really successful here in this year.  If I look over the course of kind of the last, call it, 13 years since I've been CEO, which really goes back to the low watermark of our automotive business. I mean we've consistently outperformed in automotive by a very significant margin, kind of year in and year out. And what does that mean in terms of a go-forward outperformance I've never put numbers on this, but we would certainly expect that our team would be able to continue to outperform overall units and what that translates into for content versus share versus new applications. I'll let you -- who is a much bigger expert in this market than me kind of sets out those numbers. But we clearly believe that we can continue to outperform. Jim, it's a fabulous question, and we do appreciate it. The answer is a very hard no. I mean we run 130 ERP systems around the company. Each of our general managers is responsible for their own ERP systems. Craig has a fabulous and very simple off-the-shelf consolidation software that works over the web and the fact that we now align those businesses into divisions does not change our computer system whatsoever. And yes, I mean, I think it was -- I believe, Will, who asked the question and alluded to the concept of a layer. I mean we have appointed three new presidents of these divisions, which is technically a layer but it's not a layer of bureaucracy, like you would see in many organizations. I mean in terms of the cost of doing this, it's nothing at all. I mean that's a very marginal incremental investment because the staff at this division is effectively a head of the division with the financial controller to buy his or her side. So it's -- this is not building infrastructure and building layers and bureaucracy. Far from it, it's just creating the bandwidth across our leadership team across what is now 12 group general managers in those three divisions, whereby the 130 general managers can be enabled. We can drive them. We can set aggressive goals, work with them on solving problems when they're small enough to solve and capitalize on opportunities when they're small enough and early enough to capitalize and to capture. And that's been the Amphenol style ever since I was a General Manager just reported to the CEO. And -- but as we've grown, you cannot just have 130 people reporting to one that doesn't work. You lose the benefit of being part of a broader Amphenol and then become just a holding company. And that's not what we are. We're not at all a holding company. In fact, there is a close interaction, close collaboration, synthesis across those 130 entrepreneurial general managers. We have a term for it. We call it a collaborative entrepreneur, and that's really when we say an Amphenolian that's really what we mean. So -- this is not at all creating new computer systems, new layers, new costs, rather, it's enabling and ensuring the scalability of our unique entrepreneurial structure for many, many years to come as we pass $10 billion here in sales. Yes. I think, Joe, we're -- it's hard for us to give a prognosis on what our book-to-bill is going to be. We had a very strong book-to-bill in the year. We finished with a strong book-to-bill. It's clear that our customers want to give us orders. What that book-to-bill will be going forward is actually really hard to predict.  Operator, I think if that's all of our questions. I'd like to just extend my appreciation to everybody on the phone here for spending your precious time with us I wish you all the best as you start the year, and most importantly, I just hope that all of you are able to stay safe and healthy, and we look forward to hearing from you again in just 90 days. Thanks so much, and Happy New Year again."

        "content": "Operator: Hello, and welcome to the Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call for Amphenol Corporation. Following today's presentation, there will be a formal question-and-answer session. Until then all lines will remain in a listen-only mode. At the request of the company, today's conference is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to introduce today's conference host, Mr. Craig Lampo. Thank you, sir. You may begin.\nCraig Lampo: Thank you very much. Good afternoon, everyone. This is Craig Lampo, Amphenol's CFO, and I'm here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO. We would like to welcome you to our third quarter 2021 conference call. Our third quarter 2021 results were released this morning. I will provide some financial commentary, and then Adam will give an overview of the business as well as current trends, and then we'll take some questions. As a reminder, during the call, we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures and may make certain forward-looking statements. Please refer to the relevant disclosures in our press release for further information. In addition, all data discussed during this call will be on a continuing operations basis unless otherwise noted. The company closed the third quarter with record sales of $2.818 billion and GAAP and adjusted diluted EPS of $0.67 and $0.65 respectively. Sales were up 21% in U.S. dollars, 20% in local currencies and 13% organically compared to the third quarter of 2020. Sequentially, sales are up 6% in U.S. dollars in local currencies and organically. Orders for the quarter were $3.016 billion, which was up 33% compared to the third quarter of 2020. And down 3% sequentially resulting in a very strong book-to-bill ratio of 1.07:1. Breaking down sales into our two segments. The interconnect segment, which comprised 96% of sales, was up 21% in U.S. dollars and 20% local currencies compared to the third quarter of last year. Our cable segment which comprised 4% of our sales was up 18% in U.S. dollars and 17% in local currencies compared to the third quarter of last year. Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes. Operating income was $571 million in the third quarter. Operating margin was 20.3%, which decreased by 20 basis points compared to the third quarter of 2020, but increased by 30 basis points sequentially when compared to the second quarter of 2021 adjusted operating margin. The year-over-year decline in operating margin was primarily driven by the impact of the more challenging commodity and supply chain environment in 2021, together with the slight margin dilution of recent acquisitions, including MTS, which are currently operating at a lower operating margin than the company average. The sequential increase in operating margin compared to the second quarter adjusted operating margin was driven by normal conversion on the increased sales levels. From a segment standpoint, in the interconnect segment, margins were 22.4% in the third quarter of 2021, which was equal to the third quarter of 2020 and increased from 22% in the second quarter of 2021. In the cable segment, margins were 3.8%, which decreased from 10.7% of third quarter of 2020 and 6.1% in the second quarter of 2021. Our margins in the cable segment continue to be particularly impacted by the ongoing and sudden increase in commodity and logistics costs, which have not yet been offset by pricing actions. Given the dynamic economic environment, we are very proud of the company's performance. Our team's ability to effectively manage amidst many challenges is a direct result of the strength and commitment of the company's entrepreneurial management team, which continues to foster a high-performance action oriented culture. The company\u2019s GAAP effective tax rate for the third quarter was 22.2%, which compared to 22.1% in the third quarter of 2020. On an adjusted basis, the effective tax rate was 24.5% in the third quarter of both 2021 and 2020. GAAP diluted EPS was $0.67 an increase of 20% compared to $0.56 in the prior year period and adjusted diluted EPS was at record $0.65, an increase of 18% compared to $0.55 in the third quarter of 2020. Operating cash flow in the third quarter was $328 million or 81% of adjusted net income. Net of capital spending, our free cash flow was $238 million or 59% of adjusted net income. Cash flow in the quarter was a bit lower than we would typically expect primarily due to the higher than typical increase in inventory levels, driven by the continuous of challenging supply chain environment. From a working capital standpoint, inventory days, days sales outstanding and payable days were 91, 70 and 61 days respectively. While days sales and payable days were both within our normal range. Inventory days at the quarter end were elevated for the reason just mentioned as well as the impact of recent acquisitions, which have inventory days that are currently significantly above the company average. As mentioned in today's earnings release, the company's Board of Directors has approved a 38% increase in the company's quarterly dividend to $0.20 from $0.145 per share effective for payments beginning in January of 2022. During the quarter, the company repurchased 2.3 million shares of company\u2019s of common stock for approximately $171 million at an average price of approximately $73. And at the end of the quarter, total debt was $5.2 billion and net debt was $3.9 billion. Total liquidity at the end of the quarter was $2.9 billion, which included cash and short-term investments on hand at $1.3 billion plus availability under our existing credit facilities. Third quarter 2021 GAAP EBITDA was $686 million and our net leverage ratio was 1.6 times. As previously discussed, due to the pending sale of the MTS test and simulation business, that business is being reported as a discontinued operation. And therefore, its expected results are excluded from our Q4 guidance. In addition, the company will incur certain additional cash tax and other acquisition related costs upon the divestiture of the test and simulation business, which is not included in income from continuing operations. I will now turn the call over to Adam who will provide some commentary on current market trends.\nAdam Norwitt: Well, thank you very much, Craig, and like to extend my welcome to everybody here on the phone today. And I hope that all of you had an enjoyable and healthy summer and are staying dry here if you're in the Northeast today. As Craig mentioned, I'm going to highlight some of our achievements here in the third quarter. I will discuss the trends and our progress across our served markets. And then finally I'll make some comments on our outlook for the fourth quarter and for the full year of 2021. And of course we'll have time at the end for questions. As Craig went over, our results in the third quarter were substantially better than we had expected coming into the quarter. We exceeded the high end of our guidance in sales, as well as an adjusted diluted earnings per share. Our sales grew a very strong 21% in U.S. dollars and 20% in local currencies reaching a new record $2.818 billion. On an organic basis, our sales increased by 13% with broad-based growth across most of our served markets, as well as contributions from the company's acquisition program. Orders in the quarter were robust, again, more than $3 billion, $3.016 billion. And this represented another strong book-to-bill at 1.07:1. That despite the many operational challenges that we've continued to face throughout the quarter, including continued cost increases related to commodities, supply chain and other logistics pressures. We were very pleased to deliver robust operating margins of 20.3% in the quarter. And as Craig detailed, that was a 30 basis point sequential improvement. Our EPS \u2013 adjusted diluted EPS grew strongly from prior year increasing by 18% to a new record $0.65. And that's just an excellent reflection once again of our organizations continued strong execution. The company generated operating and free cash flow of $328 million and $238 million in the third quarter. And we're very pleased that the Board of Directors just approved yesterday an increase in our dividend of 38% effective in January of next year. Coming out of this quarter, I'm just extremely proud of our team around the world. These results once again reflect the discipline as well as the agility of our entrepreneurial organization, as we continued to perform well, amidst a very dynamic and challenging environment. Now turning to our trends and progress across our served markets. We're very pleased that the company broadened balanced and market diversification continues to create value for Amphenol. Very importantly, our diversification mitigates the impact of the volatility of individual and markets, while also at the same time, exposing us to leading technologies wherever they may arise across the electronics industry. And these are both important benefits, especially amidst such a dynamic market environment. Turning first to the military market. This market represented 10% of our sales in the third quarter. Sales grew by 7% from prior year and declined by 4% organically, which was a little bit lower than our expectation heading into the quarter. On an organic basis, growth in ordinance, airframe and space-related products was more than offset by moderations of our sales of products that were used in vehicle, naval and communications applications. Sequentially, sales declined by about 3%. Looking into the fourth quarter, we now expect a slight sequential sales increase. And for the full year of 2021, this would imply a mid-teens increase in sales from last year's levels. We continue to be excited by the strength of Amphenol position in the military market as defense customers around the world continue to adopt next generation technologies at an increasing pace. Our industry leading breadth of high technology, interconnect and sensor products positions the company strongly across essentially all major defense programs. And this gives us confidence for our long-term performance. The commercial aerospace market represented 2% of our sales in the quarter. Sales were flat compared to prior year and declined by about 19% organically as the benefit of our recent acquisitions was offset by continued declines in demand from aircraft manufacturers. As expected coming into the quarter, our sales declined by about 3% sequentially. Looking into the fourth quarter, we're happy that to now expect the mid-teens increase in sales compared to these levels. And for the full year 2021, this would imply a roughly 10% sales decline compared to last year, a clear reflection of the pandemic related headwinds that have impacted the travel industry and thus the commercial aircraft market during the COVID-19 pandemic. Regardless of this challenging environment so far our team working in the commercial aerospace market remains committed to leveraging the company's strong interconnect and sensor technology position across a wide array of airplane platforms and next generation systems integrated into those aircraft. As personal and business travel continues to recover from the pandemic impacted lows, we do look forward to benefiting as jet manufacturers expand their production and in turn expand their procurement of our components. The industrial market represented 26% of our sales in the quarter. Sales increased by a very strong 44% in U.S. dollars and 24% organically. This excellent growth was broad-based across most segments of the worldwide industrial market, including in particular, the battery and heavy electric vehicle, factory automation, oil and gas, rail mass transit, heavy equipment, alternative energy and instrumentation segments together with the contributions from our recent acquisitions. On a sequential basis, sales increased by 4% from the second quarter, which was much better than our expectations coming into the quarter. Looking into the fourth quarter, we expect sales to moderate from these levels. But for the full year of 2021, we expect sales to increase more than 40% from prior year, a very strong performance. I remain extremely proud of our global team working in the industrial market. Our long-term strategy to expand our high technology interconnect antenna and sensor offering both organically and through complementary acquisitions has positioned the company to capitalize on the many revolutions that are occurring across the industrial electronics market. We look forward to realizing the benefits of the strategy for many years to come. The automotive market represented 19% of our sales in the quarter. And despite the widely reported challenges across the automotive market, our sales actually came in higher than expectations in the quarter growing a strong 31% in U.S. dollars and 26% organically. This strong performance reflected our automotive teams, excellent execution in the face of numerous supply chain challenges as well as robust growth of our products used in electric and hybrid electric vehicles. This was another clear confirmation of our global teams long-term efforts at designing and high voltage and other interconnect and sensor products into these next generation platforms. On a sequential basis, sales were flat compared to the second quarter. The widely reported supply chain challenges in the auto industry continued to impact demand from vehicle manufacturers around the world. Accordingly, we do expect in the fourth quarter, a high single digit sequential moderation in sales. For the full year 2021, this implies sales will increase by more than 40% compared to last year driven by our expanded position in next generation electronics integrated into cars, including in particular those electric and hybrid drive trains. I remain extremely proud of our team working in the automotive market, who has continued to demonstrate a high degree of agility and resiliency in both driving a significant recovery from last year\u2019s reduced sales levels, while also expertly navigating the myriad of supply chain challenges that the entire automotive industry is facing. We look forward to benefiting from their efforts long into the future. The mobile devices market represented 13% of our sales in the quarter. And our sales in this market declined from prior year by 5% as modest growth in sales of products incorporated into smart phones and laptops was more than offset by declines in wearables and tablets. Sequentially, sales increased by a stronger than expected 36% driven by higher sales across virtually all product categories that we serve. Looking into the fourth quarter, we expect a continued mid to high single digit increase in sales from these third quarter levels. And for the full year, we anticipate sales to grow modestly from 2020, which is in fact, an impressive achievement given last year\u2019s robust demand. I remain very proud of our team working in the mobile devices market. Their unique agility continues to enable the company to react quickly to changing demand in this most volatile of markets. With our leading array of antennas, interconnect products and mechanisms enabling a broad range of next generation mobile devices. We're positioned well for the long term. Turning to mobile networks market. This market represented 5% of our sales in the quarter and sales increased by 11% from prior year and 7% organically. And this sales growth was really driven by our sales to mobile service providers, which was offset by a small moderation of sales to OEMs. On a sequential basis, our sales increased just slightly, which was largely in line with our expectations coming into the quarter. For the fourth quarter, we expect another slight sequential increase in sales. As mobile networks customers continue to ramp up their investments in 5G and other next generation networks. And for 2021, this would imply that our sales would grow by approximately 10%. Our team continues to work aggressively in the mobile networks market to realize the benefits of our efforts to expand our position in next generation 5G equipment and networks around the world. As our customers ramp up their investments into these advanced systems, we look forward to benefiting from the increased potential that comes from our unique position with both equipment manufacturers and mobile service providers. The information technology in datacom market represented 22% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in this market rose from prior year by a very strong 28% in U.S. dollars and 26% organically. And this is driven by increased demand from OEMs and in particular increased demand from web service providers. Sequentially, our sales grew by a better than expected 10% from second quarter levels. As we look into the fourth quarter, we do expect a slight decline from these elevated levels. And for the full year of 2021, we expect sales to increase in the low 20% range. We remain encouraged by the company's outstanding position in the global IT data datacom market. Our OEM and service provider customers continue to drive their equipment and networks to ever higher levels of performance in order to manage the continued dramatic increases in demand for bandwidth and processor power. In turn, our team remained highly focused on enabling this continuing revolution and IT datacom with industry leading high speed, power and fiber optic interconnect products. We look forward to realizing the benefits of that leading position for many years to come. And finally, the broadband market represented 3% of our sales in the quarter. Sales declined by 5% from prior and 10% organically as cable operator procurement moderated. On a sequential basis, sales decreased by a slightly better than expected 3%. For the fourth quarter, we now expect a further moderation in sales from these levels and for the full year 2021, we anticipate that sales will grow in the mid single digits. Despite this more challenging environment in the broadband market, we continue to look forward to supporting our service provider customers around the world. All of them are working to increase their bandwidth to support the expansion of high-speed data applications to homes and to businesses. Now turning to our outlook. There's no question that the current market environment remains highly uncertain with significant supply chain and inflationary challenges, as well as the ongoing pandemic given this and assuming constant exchange rates. For the fourth quarter, we expect sales in the range of $2.690 billion to $2.750 billion and adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $0.61 to $0.63. This would represent year-over-year sales growth of 11% to 13% and adjusted diluted EPS growth of 7% to 11%. Our fourth quarter guidance represents an expectation for full year sales of $10.540 billion to $10.600 billion and full adjusted diluted EPS of $2.39 to $2.41. This outlook represents full year sales and adjusted EPS growth of 23% and 28% to 29% respectively. I remain confident in the ability of our outstanding management team to adapt to the continued challenges in the marketplace and to capitalize on the many future opportunities to grow our market position and expand our profitability. In addition, our entire organization remains committed to delivering long-term sustainable value all while prioritizing the continued safety and health of each of our employees around the world. Most importantly, I'd like to take this opportunity to once again, thank the entire Amphenol team for their truly outstanding efforts here in the third quarter. And with that operator, we'd be very happy to take any questions.\nOperator: Thank you. The question-and-answer period will now begin. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Sir, you may go ahead.\nAmit Daryanani: Thanks a lot and good afternoon. Adam, there's been a fair amount of talk, a lot of talk maybe around just supply chain challenges, inventory build and everything else. Yes, love to get your perspective, what are you seeing from that basis across your customer base? Are you starting to see your order the demand start to moderate a bit of customers being less eager to expedite orders or anything you're seeing variation between the channel and OEM demand trends? Just anything you see from that basis would be helpful.\nAdam Norwitt: Yes, thanks very much, Amit. I mean, no doubt about it. A lot of chatter, a lot of news, you can't pick up the paper without reading about supply chains. I think for the first 22 years of my so far 23 year career, I don't recall that the front page was plastered with things about the supply chain. And now it seems to be virtually every day that you read something about it. And no question throughout the quarter, there remained just a number of real significant challenges that our team fought through and really fought through. I think when you see the results in particular growing sequentially by 6% in the quarter which was above our expectations, amidst, what I would say we are continued serious supply chain impediments, some of which even worsen throughout the quarter, whether that's availability of logistics and freight, the cost of raw materials, the availability of raw materials, even talking about things like labor shortages, which are there are pockets of that around the world as well. And so no question that those are all dynamics that our team faced and across that entrepreneurial Amphenol organization, our team just made it happen. Now in terms of inventory builds and orders moderating, I mean, we've still had strong orders in the quarter. There's no doubt about it. And even though our book-to-bill was a bit lower 1.07 compared to the second quarter, most of the reasons why our book-to-bill was lower because our sales grew into the level of the bookings. Orders were down by maybe 3% from the second quarter. But sales were up by 6% thus the slightly lower, but still robust book-to-bill. In terms of inventory, I mean, you saw for sure that our inventory was up a little bit and I think many have seen a little bit elevated inventory, which is not surprising given both our growth as a company, very significant growth, but also the very significant supply chain impediments that are out there. To the extent that our customers have more inventory. We don't always have perfect visibility into that. I will say what we do have visibility to, which is in particular in distribution, we haven't seen really abnormal levels of inventory amongst our distributor for our products. In fact, I think what we've seen is continued strong sell-through of the products into customers around the world. And knowing that our distribution business is predominantly industrial and aerospace [indiscernible] business, we've seen continued really strong demand in particular across the industrial market. What \u2013 in terms of the customers and their willingness to pull product, we talked about last quarter in the automotive market, for example, that we probably could have shipped more if customers wanted it. And I think we continue to see some instances anecdotes where customers, because they don\u2019t have all the components that they need to make their finished product be it a car or a truck or otherwise. They in the end don\u2019t take our product as opposed to necessarily building the inventory of our product. They just tell us not to ship it. So a lot going on, but I think at the end of the day, amidst all these challenges, the performance of the company has shown very brightly.\nOperator: And our next question is from Steven Fox from Fox Advisors. You may go ahead.\nSteven Fox: Hi, good afternoon. Adam, I was wondering if you could just maybe touch on IT datacom a little bit more. It\u2019s been a very good year for that market for you guys. And after what seems like better expected quarters each quarter, you seem to sort of look for it to slowdown. So I\u2019m just curious, like where are you seeing maybe concerns, where are you seeing more opportunities, whether markets or share trends or new products, et cetera. Thanks.\nAdam Norwitt: Yes. Well, thanks so much, Steve. I mean no doubt about it. It\u2019s been a very, very strong year and I would almost say a very strong couple of years for our team work in the IT datacom market. I mean not forgetting that last year, we grew in that market by 15%. And this year, continuing to exceed our expectations with sales in this quarter in particular are growing by 28% and 10% sequentially. So no question about it. And I think when I look into the fourth quarter, we\u2019re coming from very elevated levels of demand. And we\u2019re not guiding to like a catastrophic reduction. We\u2019re talking about a modest sequential decline in the fourth quarter, which I think given the overall environment, given the overall demand from our customers and in particular customers in web service where we\u2019ve seen just really strong growth and whether you call them cloud or web service providers and we\u2019ve seen outstanding growth in that business over the last couple of years. And once in a while, you could have a moderation. There could even be a little bit of seasonality that could come into that. So I don\u2019t think that this fourth quarter guide is at all a turnaround in that business. It would still by the way in the fourth quarter reflect very, very strong year-over-year growth in that IT datacom market. And in the end, I think would be a very, very strong year for that market, for our teamwork in that market.\nOperator: And our next question is from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. You may go ahead.\nWamsi Mohan: Yes. Thank you. Adam, you guys have done a tremendous job maintaining profitability through so many difficult cycles. As you look at the cycle here, and through 2021, how much would you say your ability to raise prices has offset some of these inflationary pressures? And as you look into 2022, it sounded from some of the comments, especially in cable, that there was room to raise pricing some more to catch up. If you could just characterize sort of 2021, 2022 from ability to sort of recapture some of that, potential inflationary elements and how you think about it into 2022. That\u2019d be great. Thank you.\nCraig Lampo: Hey Wamsi, this is Craig. I think that if we think about our profitability, we\u2019re certainly very proud of our achievement in the quarter. And certainly, this year given the significant challenging costs environment. And certainly at that cost environment has been increasingly, I\u2019d say gotten worse over the course of the year. And I think that we have done a good job of neutralizing that worsening environment, given the actions we\u2019ve been able to take during the year. And one of those actions clearly is being able to pass on some of that cost to our customers, to the degree that we can offset it in other ways. And so certainly the management team, I think has done a really good job of that. Different markets are more challenging than other markets and certainly things like distribution is easier to pass on pricing and other markets are a little bit more difficult, our channels are difficult to impress on pricing. But I think overall, we\u2019ve done a pretty good job and most of the markets are passing on some of the pricing. I wouldn\u2019t make the exception and you comment on cable. And certainly that, that market is a different type of market from a competitive environment, as well as the products are a little bit different more \u2013 they\u2019re certainly more cost sensitive and certainly more impacted by logistics costs, which we\u2019ve seen a significant increase of. And there\u2019s been quite an quick increase of those types of costs that absolutely have had an impact that we haven\u2019t necessarily been able to offset at this point and the team\u2019s doing certainly a good job of working through that. And we do think over some period of time, they\u2019ll be able to offset those cost pressures, but that\u2019s something that in that market, you can\u2019t really do or in overnight, other markets, like automotive aren\u2019t so easy, but certainly I think the team\u2019s done a good job of starting those conversations and there\u2019s other markets that are easier. So I think that we\u2019ve done a good job. I think that we\u2019ve been able to offset the majority certainly of the sequential increases that we\u2019ve seen during the year of the cost environment. And we\u2019re not guiding into 2022 at this point, but I do believe that the cost environment is not going to get any easier any time soon. So the team certainly has been tasked with and I think they\u2019re doing a good job of continuing those conversations with their customers. And all of the markets, some of which are easier and some of which are harder. And in terms of being able to ultimately pass on those cost increases to our customers and to be able to continue to leverage and increase our margins as we continue to grow.\nAdam Norwitt: I would just add Wamsi to that one important principle here, pricing is an art, it\u2019s not just you issue a price increase and off it goes. And the beauty of how we\u2019re organized is that we\u2019re not making those pricing decisions here at headquarters, rather we have 125 general managers around the world, and those general managers are best suited to make the right decision around pricing, because they know the strength of their own position. They know their competitive position. They know their technology position. And they also can go to a customer and say, look, I have tried everything else. And the only remaining thing I can do is raise the price to you. And then it\u2019s a genuine, it\u2019s a reasonable discussion. And it\u2019s one that\u2019s grounded in fact, and basis as opposed to in corporate policy. And I think that\u2019s why we\u2019ve always been maybe a little bit more successful in moderating the impacts of these, because our general managers have every tool available to them. All of the functions, all of the inputs are part of their responsibility. And thus, they\u2019re able to go out and make it happen. And just because the cost of materials is up, or the cost of logistics is up, it does not give absolution to an Amphenol general manager for their performance, not in our company. I mean no matter what the cycle is, we have absolute standards for performance and they have to hit that and they\u2019ll figure it out. And if that means, having those tough discussions with customers, then that\u2019s what they\u2019re going to do.\nOperator: And our next question is from Samik Chatterjee from JPMorgan. You may go ahead.\nJoe Cardoso: Thank you. This is Joe Cardoso on for Samik. So broader question, I guess, the setup and guidance for 3Q seems there very similar to what we are seeing now for 4Q. However Amphenol was able to outperform the high end of the guide in terms of both revenue and earnings in 3Q. I guess can you help investors understand why they shouldn\u2019t expect a similar level of outperformance this time around, for example, are there headwinds around supply and costs intensifying or were there any materials surprises you would point out in 3Q that are not sustainable into 4Q? Any color around the puts and takes there as would be appreciated. Thank you.\nAdam Norwitt: Sure. Thanks very much, Joe. I mean, look, we always give guidance with the information at hand just as we did 90 days ago, we\u2019re doing here today. And so I wouldn\u2019t point to some different dynamic nor would I say that one should expect that we\u2019re going to be by the same amount that we beat last quarter. Our team is always going to strive to maximize our results, amidst, whatever environment we\u2019re in. And as we\u2019ve talked at nauseam, it\u2019s a very dynamic environment and they\u2019re going to continue to push, till the last minute of the last hour of the last day of the year in supporting our customers and executing amidst this environment. And if that ends up that we \u2013 that that this guidance is exceeded and that will be what it will be, but right now we\u2019re giving guidance based on what we see in the marketplace.\nOperator: And our next question is from William Stein with Truist Securities. You may go ahead.\nWilliam Stein: Great. Thank you for taking my question. Adam, I wanted to ask about lead times and expedites. It doesn\u2019t really sound like you\u2019re significantly stretched from a lead time perspective. So maybe you can provide some context, I\u2019m aware in every end market, every company within the Amphenol umbrella has different characteristics and so, an average might not be meaningful, but however you can describe the current lead time situation relative to how might\u2019ve been, let\u2019s say a quarter ago and versus what would be sort of a middle of the cycle sort of dynamic. And then the degree to which expedite requests might have change. There are some companies in the supply chain talking about the level or number of expedited parts falling significantly in the last quarter. I\u2019m wondering if you\u2019re seeing that same dynamic. Thank you.\nAdam Norwitt: Thanks so much, Will. I mean relative to our lead times, I mean, it should not be surprising that maybe we have a little bit of extra lead times now than we would have had a year ago. It is a very constrained environment. Sometimes even just getting materials in from overseas, if you need to have to do that, whatever there\u2019s just a lot of sort of sand in the gears of the global supply chain and that can lead to extra lead times. Also I\u2019ve talked about our orders, maybe not even because of our own lead times, but just customers opening up the aperture of their order window a little bit longer and that has led to some of the higher levels of orders that we\u2019ve seen in addition to just overall robust demand. As it relates to expedite requests, I don\u2019t know that I can give you a good read on that more thoroughly or systematically across the company. I mean we continue to have some customers who really need product. I mean to the extent that we are using a material that is really constrained, and there are certain cases of that, I continued to see the odd expedite request here and there. I don\u2019t know that I have a good read on whether it\u2019s less or more the same. I mean I guess I would say it\u2019s kind of the same over the last 90 days. Nothing that I would take note of really.\nOperator: And our next question is from Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs. You may go ahead.\nMark Delaney: Yes. Good afternoon, and thanks very much for taking the question. I was hoping to get an update on what the company has seen in China both from a demand and an operational perspective. There\u2019s been a number of headlines around companies having a more difficult time operating in China things like electricity, shortages, certain materials constraints. And I\u2019m hoping you could elaborate on what Amphenol seeing there. Thank you.\nAdam Norwitt: Thanks so much, Mark, and good afternoon to you. I think one thing that I would just point out from this last quarter is actually our growth on a year-over-year basis was very balanced across all the geographies. I mean almost extremely balanced on an organic basis virtually every region grew by that, that 13% organically. And that, that was really nice to see actually a bit surprising given the sort of dynamics, whether they be pandemic related, supply chain related, electricity related or otherwise. And our team in China continues to do a fabulous job of managing through whatever challenges come their way and that did include in the quarter some challenges related to the availability of electricity. But fortunately for us, our approach operationally around the world, and that is the same approach that we have in China is never and not to put all our eggs in one basket. People are sometimes surprised that we have so many facilities around the world, something like 200, 250 facilities, and that includes something like 50 facilities in China that are spread across the country. And so when there are pockets of challenges over the last year and a half, whether that be from COVID-related shutdown, supply chain challenges, or even the electricity issues that you\u2019ve heard about in China, that\u2019s not having a material impact across the company, but rather may create a single challenge for one or another operation. And the local management team just makes it happen. And that\u2019s a \u2013 that\u2019s kind of the approach that we take.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Nik Todorov with Longbow Research. You may go ahead.\nNik Todorov: Yes. Thanks and congrats on great results. I have a question on auto. Adam, if you look at your auto numbers, it seems like they again outperform relative to peers. And you \u2013 I think you\u2019ve talked about seeing upside in the quarter relative to expectations. So why in your view, you continue to see upside in the quarter. Maybe going back to the expedite, do you continue to see expedites in auto? I\u2019m just curious because your lead times are relatively maybe they\u2019d be a little bit extended, but they\u2019re still nothing compared to what symptoms they saw and I\u2019m sure you don\u2019t \u2013 you\u2019re not the one that are constraining the auto production. So why do you think you continue to see upside things?\nAdam Norwitt: Yes. Thanks. Thanks very much, Nik. Look, this is a long story for us, which is that we\u2019ve been growing our automotive business for more than a decade through a consistent strategy of growing both organically and through acquisitions, into new electronics applications, new applications in the car. Throughout the course of that time, we expanded our product offering from simple connectors and cable assemblies to sensors and antennas, complex center assemblies and the like. And through it all, our strategy has not been to just take share out of incumbents, but rather to participate in the expansion of electronics in the automotive market. And that expansion of electronics has really accelerated throughout that time. As I highlighted in my prepared remarks, one area of expansion for electronics has been across the electrification of vehicles, both electric and hybrid vehicles, where we've leveraged our strong legacy and high voltage capabilities to really be a strong participant in that area. And that's been a great growth driver for us for many quarters. And that included in the quarter that just completed. Have we seen expedites in the automotive market? I would actually say we've seen this quarter and last quarter more of the opposite of expedites. We've seen that customers have pushed out demand because of supply shortages that they're seeing from other types of commodities. You mentioned semiconductors as one example, as opposed to expedites that of customers pulling in. And \u2013 but for those other supply chain shortages, I'm sure automotive business would have been even more robust than it was.\nOperator: Our next question is from Luke Junk with Baird. You may go ahead.\nLuke Junk: Good afternoon, everyone. Adam, I've got another auto question. This one may be a little bigger picture. A lot of the discussion around your business these days is around EVs and rightly so. But what I wanted to ask you about is knock on effects that you're seeing on some other factors, some of the industry have talked about a so-called Tesla halo, i.e., the fact that consumer expectations for tech in the vehicle are just simply much higher in an EV. And I'm wondering as you look across your business and the growth that you're seeing, both right now and over the few years, how does this accelerated proliferation of technology inside the vehicle plates, the company strengths and positioning relative to electrification?\nAdam Norwitt: Well, look, it's a great question. And it's a question that I wouldn't even confine to EVs. I mean, you point out the consumer expectations for technology in EVs, but I would just say consumer expectations for technology in vehicles [indiscernible] has expanded and has continued to accelerate over many years. I mean, I just look at, my kids, when we get in a car, you've got like a spaghetti of cables that people want to plug in to various parts of the car. And then you now have car companies coming and putting in things like wireless charging and outlets in different places as opposed to. We having one of these massive things that every kid has to plug their thing into a cigarette lighter. Now everybody has their little connectors all over the car and things like that. And whether it'd be navigation systems, communication systems, safety systems, passenger comfort systems we have seen. And I think we are living through a revolution of electronics in vehicles and that's all vehicles because we shouldn't forget like in the global automotive market, I don't know, hybrid and EVs. I'm not perfectly familiar with every one of these numbers, but I think they still represent less than 10%. And that's if you include hybrid of all total vehicle volumes, but I would say all vehicles are adopting more electronics because the car companies have realized not only that their customers want these things, but actually they can make more money on these things. These type of features are things that people will actually pay more for and thereby allow the car companies to make more profit from their products and look, it's great news for anybody working in the automotive electronics market. It's \u2013 and for our company where again, our strategy has not been to go take share out of others, but rather to work on the new things that are happening in the car. I think our company comes out of that very well positioned.\nOperator: And our next question is from Jim Suva of Citigroup. You may go ahead.\nJim Suva: Thank you. I just have one question and I don't know if it's for Craig or Adam, but either one is fine and that is on your cable products, operating margins, of course, raw materials of copper, aluminum, and all that have gone up. It sounds like you've mentioned you are putting in price increases, which is fair and good to hear, but the operating margins of below 4%, that's pretty what's the right word, unprecedented in a opportunity to see upside from there, as opposed to things about overall concern. So, do you think we're kind of at the lowest level here, or do you think they're going to be at these while \u2013 level of suppression for a while, but if you can just kind of talk about the profitability of that segment, because it seems like while a small part of a company overall, it is materially challenged right now, but I think there could be potential there. Thank you.\nAdam Norwitt: Yes. Thanks Jim. Yes, there's no doubt that the profitability of the cable segment is at the lowest level it's been in certainly in my memory. And I think, but when we talk about it being unprecedented, I think we're also in an unprecedented environment from a cost perspective. And especially as it relates to things that impact that segment, which are things like logistics and things like certain commodity costs that have always had a more of a significant impact on that segment. We've talked about commodities and cost environment impacting that segment more. And when you're in a more unprecedented environment where the costs have just increased so quickly and so significantly. And then you're in a market where it's not as easy to overnight increase prices, even in an precedent cost environment due to the competitive dynamics and other factors within those \u2013 within that market, that it just becomes an unfortunate situation that it does have a more significant impact in the short-term here. There's no doubt that the team is working hard on pricing actions, and we're confident that there will be successful over some period of time. Don't forget this is 4% of the company right now. It's relatively small, but for the businesses that are you involved in dealing with this that's \u2013 this is impactful for them as it is for any other operations. So it's not that it's not meaningful, but it certainly has a lower impact on the overall company, but there's no doubt as the new management team is extremely focused on this. We are optimistic that over some not so long-term period of time and this shorter term, we'll be able to get these margins back up. Whether or not it's next quarter or the quarter after, I think time will tell, but we are optimistic that it will. We are on the lower end of the scale in terms of profitability in this market. And it will improve over those coming quarters.\nOperator: And our next question is from Chris Snyder with UBS. You may go ahead.\nChris Snyder: Thank you. So I have another one on auto. I mean, the company was up over 20% organic against the backdrop of high teens declines and auto production. So very, very substantial levels of outgrowth. I understand all powertrains are seeing content gains, but this outgrowth inflection we've seen over the last year kind of really lines up with ramping EV production. So I guess the question is, would you guys be able to provide maybe what percentage of auto revenues are coming from high voltage today? So we could try to kind of see how that's lining up against EV units?\nAdam Norwitt: Yes. Thanks. Thanks very much, Chris. I mean, look, we give a lot of details across the company. And I think we haven't publicly talked about the specific numbers of what makes up, what different powertrains make up, what different sales of our automotive market. But what we have said very consistently, and I would say it again this quarter is that the growth in our EV business, whether that's an auto or also our industrial electrification business have been significant drivers of our out-performance. So, you can imagine that after a number of quarters of doing so that business represents a lot more today than it did many quarters ago. And it's a meaningful piece of the business. It has a real impact on the business and it continues to have great potential for the future.\nOperator: Our next question is from David Kelley with Jefferies. You may go ahead.\nDavid Kelley: Good afternoon, Adam and Craig. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe if we could dig a bit deeper into the industrial strength. You noted growth across a number of your end market exposures there. So how should we think about the end market dynamics in some nation? And again, realizing there's a lot of puts and takes there versus Amphenol is kind of content opportunity and some of your market share gains. And then if I may, how should we think about some of the moderation and to your end, is there a specific end market where you expect to see that?\nAdam Norwitt: Yes. Well, thanks very much, David. I mean, you said it the industrial market is for us a very, very diversified range of segments. Now, everything from medical to heavy vehicles, to oil and gas, things like marine, factory automation that the battery and heavy electric vehicles, alternative energy. I mean, even an area like building automation where we've seen a lot of strong growth. I mean, what I think really unique here in the third quarter was virtually every one of those segments grew in the quarter. So, you don't always see that usually there's some sort of counter cyclicality across one or another of those segments, and we thought really strong performance across all of them. And when I think about why the company has really done such an excellent job in industrial, I mean, I'd point to a few factors. Number one is, our strategy for many years has been to build out a range of products that make us more important to customers across the industrial world. And again, remembering that what ties those products together is that they're all harsh environments solutions. So whether they be discreet connectors of value add interconnect assemblies center, antennas, or the like. These are all products that have to be ruggedized. They have to be fit to an environment that maybe as an ultra clean environment in an operating theater, or maybe an ultra dirty environment in an oil and gas drilling setup, or in an alternative energy on an offshore windmill or something like that. So all of these have just really uniquely challenging environments around them and what we see in common across these customers and where a lot of our growth has come from. This is really the second factor is that customers across the industrial market are adopting electronics at an increasing pace. So the same discussion that we add in the auto market, just a few moments ago, we see that really broadly across the industrial market as customers adopt next generation electronic systems and put those systems into tougher and tougher environments. I would also say that the industrial market is a very fragmented market from a competitive perspective. And so while for sure we're taking advantage of new things in this market like we are in automotive. I think there's also the fact that we continue to gain position against competitors who either don't have the breadth of offering, don't have the geographical position to support customers on a global basis. Don't have the diverse and resilient footprint that has been able to support those customers during the pandemic or during all the other disruptions that have come along and thereby customers have come increasingly to us to solve their problems, and we've not disappointed them. And that creates a positive feedback loop. So it's a market that I think we're very excited about. I think our team working in this market is just doing a great job. If you look into the fourth quarter for sure, you can look at that fourth quarter kind of through the prism of saying, well, we're guiding it to be down slightly. But in fact, on a year-over-year basis, it's going to be an outstanding fourth quarter as well. So, I think the team just continues to excel, and we're very excited about the industrial market for many years to come.\nOperator: And our next question is from Joe Giordano from Cowen. You may go ahead.\nJoe Giordano: Hey, good afternoon guys. Adam, you've articulated your position in overall views of operating in China many times on these calls. But I don't want to give you the chance to do it again, just in light of the ramp ups intentions. And is it more challenging for companies to do business? Like I understand how you guys are positioned there. It clearly works. You have to on the margins, think about things slightly different as to how you deploy capital or how you do incremental \u2013 grow incrementally in a region like that. Is how increasing escalation here impacted the way you do things?\nAdam Norwitt: Well, look, I mean, we're not blind to the world around us. So there's no doubt about it. I mean, the geopolitical tension that has been present for a number of years has certainly not gone away. And for one [ph] would fully advocate that countries like the U.S. and China, the world's two largest economies should for sure get along. There's lots and lots of reasons why we shouldn't. By the way, firstly, I'm very optimistic that long term that is going to be the case. But as it relates to our position in any country, including China, I mean, I would just remind everybody, we have a very unique operating strategy. We rely on local managers in every country that we operate and we operate in more than 40 countries around the world. And in each of those places, we have local general managers who have the authority to run their business as they need to run it in that region to be most successful. And so our general managers in China are able to tailor make how they do business, obviously within the confines of ethics and law and everything that it means to be a global company. But they're able to meet their customers on a level playing field with their local competitors. But in fact, it's not a level playing field, because then they're able to bring the totality of Amphenol capabilities to bear in support of those customers. And that's where the advantages is. We bring the best of both worlds of both being a local partner, but also a global company who has global resources, global breadth and global capabilities. And that's why we've been successful in India. That's why we've been successful in China. That's why we've been successful in France, in Germany and the UK. And of course here in the U.S. It's a very unique operating model that is, that works really, really well in a world where everybody's getting along, but it also works really well in a world where people aren't necessarily getting along. In terms of how we deploy our capital, we're always careful about deploying capital in every country in the world. We're always going to incorporate all the sort of risks and opportunities into our calculus about what we're going to invest in and what we're not going to invest in. And ultimately those investment ideas are all coming up from below, not sort of dictated from above. But for sure, we're going to apply appropriate scrutiny to investments in every place in the world, using sort of the full picture of the environment into which we're investing.\nOperator: And our last question comes from Joseph Spak with RBC Capital Markets. You may go ahead.\nJoseph Spak: Thanks Adam. I just to follow on one more on China. Are you seeing any impact either direct or indirect from some of the power shortages that that have been going on and how's that impacting the business?\nAdam Norwitt: Thanks Joe very much. Look, I think we've seen a lot of challenges and I talked a little bit about this earlier. But \u2013 and those challenges have included in China, a few power shortages. But I think like I described, luckily for us, our approach is to not put all our eggs in one manufacturing basket. And so while we've had maybe an odd power shortage in one location or another. It hasn't had a meaningful impact on the company. And our local team is doing a fabulous job of mitigating any impact that there could be of such shortages. It gives everybody something else to think about in a time where there's a lot going on.\nOperator: And I would now like to turn the call back to Mr. Norwitt for closing remarks.\nAdam Norwitt: Well, thank you so much. And I'd like to just extend my best wishes to everyone here on the phone. Thank you so much for taking the time with us. And we will talk to you after the holiday season. So I will be the first to wish everybody a happy holiday season and a happy and successful end of the year. And we'll talk to you in 2022. Thanks so much.\nCraig Lampo: Thank you. Have a great day.\nOperator: And this concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may disconnect at this time.",

            "name": "Craig Lampo",
            "content": "Thank you very much. Good afternoon, everyone. This is Craig Lampo, Amphenol's CFO, and I'm here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO. We would like to welcome you to our third quarter 2021 conference call. Our third quarter 2021 results were released this morning. I will provide some financial commentary, and then Adam will give an overview of the business as well as current trends, and then we'll take some questions. As a reminder, during the call, we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures and may make certain forward-looking statements. Please refer to the relevant disclosures in our press release for further information. In addition, all data discussed during this call will be on a continuing operations basis unless otherwise noted. The company closed the third quarter with record sales of $2.818 billion and GAAP and adjusted diluted EPS of $0.67 and $0.65 respectively. Sales were up 21% in U.S. dollars, 20% in local currencies and 13% organically compared to the third quarter of 2020. Sequentially, sales are up 6% in U.S. dollars in local currencies and organically. Orders for the quarter were $3.016 billion, which was up 33% compared to the third quarter of 2020. And down 3% sequentially resulting in a very strong book-to-bill ratio of 1.07:1. Breaking down sales into our two segments. The interconnect segment, which comprised 96% of sales, was up 21% in U.S. dollars and 20% local currencies compared to the third quarter of last year. Our cable segment which comprised 4% of our sales was up 18% in U.S. dollars and 17% in local currencies compared to the third quarter of last year. Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes. Operating income was $571 million in the third quarter. Operating margin was 20.3%, which decreased by 20 basis points compared to the third quarter of 2020, but increased by 30 basis points sequentially when compared to the second quarter of 2021 adjusted operating margin. The year-over-year decline in operating margin was primarily driven by the impact of the more challenging commodity and supply chain environment in 2021, together with the slight margin dilution of recent acquisitions, including MTS, which are currently operating at a lower operating margin than the company average. The sequential increase in operating margin compared to the second quarter adjusted operating margin was driven by normal conversion on the increased sales levels. From a segment standpoint, in the interconnect segment, margins were 22.4% in the third quarter of 2021, which was equal to the third quarter of 2020 and increased from 22% in the second quarter of 2021. In the cable segment, margins were 3.8%, which decreased from 10.7% of third quarter of 2020 and 6.1% in the second quarter of 2021. Our margins in the cable segment continue to be particularly impacted by the ongoing and sudden increase in commodity and logistics costs, which have not yet been offset by pricing actions. Given the dynamic economic environment, we are very proud of the company's performance. Our team's ability to effectively manage amidst many challenges is a direct result of the strength and commitment of the company's entrepreneurial management team, which continues to foster a high-performance action oriented culture. The company\u2019s GAAP effective tax rate for the third quarter was 22.2%, which compared to 22.1% in the third quarter of 2020. On an adjusted basis, the effective tax rate was 24.5% in the third quarter of both 2021 and 2020. GAAP diluted EPS was $0.67 an increase of 20% compared to $0.56 in the prior year period and adjusted diluted EPS was at record $0.65, an increase of 18% compared to $0.55 in the third quarter of 2020. Operating cash flow in the third quarter was $328 million or 81% of adjusted net income. Net of capital spending, our free cash flow was $238 million or 59% of adjusted net income. Cash flow in the quarter was a bit lower than we would typically expect primarily due to the higher than typical increase in inventory levels, driven by the continuous of challenging supply chain environment. From a working capital standpoint, inventory days, days sales outstanding and payable days were 91, 70 and 61 days respectively. While days sales and payable days were both within our normal range. Inventory days at the quarter end were elevated for the reason just mentioned as well as the impact of recent acquisitions, which have inventory days that are currently significantly above the company average. As mentioned in today's earnings release, the company's Board of Directors has approved a 38% increase in the company's quarterly dividend to $0.20 from $0.145 per share effective for payments beginning in January of 2022. During the quarter, the company repurchased 2.3 million shares of company\u2019s of common stock for approximately $171 million at an average price of approximately $73. And at the end of the quarter, total debt was $5.2 billion and net debt was $3.9 billion. Total liquidity at the end of the quarter was $2.9 billion, which included cash and short-term investments on hand at $1.3 billion plus availability under our existing credit facilities. Third quarter 2021 GAAP EBITDA was $686 million and our net leverage ratio was 1.6 times. As previously discussed, due to the pending sale of the MTS test and simulation business, that business is being reported as a discontinued operation. And therefore, its expected results are excluded from our Q4 guidance. In addition, the company will incur certain additional cash tax and other acquisition related costs upon the divestiture of the test and simulation business, which is not included in income from continuing operations. I will now turn the call over to Adam who will provide some commentary on current market trends. Hey Wamsi, this is Craig. I think that if we think about our profitability, we\u2019re certainly very proud of our achievement in the quarter. And certainly, this year given the significant challenging costs environment. And certainly at that cost environment has been increasingly, I\u2019d say gotten worse over the course of the year. And I think that we have done a good job of neutralizing that worsening environment, given the actions we\u2019ve been able to take during the year. And one of those actions clearly is being able to pass on some of that cost to our customers, to the degree that we can offset it in other ways. And so certainly the management team, I think has done a really good job of that. Different markets are more challenging than other markets and certainly things like distribution is easier to pass on pricing and other markets are a little bit more difficult, our channels are difficult to impress on pricing. But I think overall, we\u2019ve done a pretty good job and most of the markets are passing on some of the pricing. I wouldn\u2019t make the exception and you comment on cable. And certainly that, that market is a different type of market from a competitive environment, as well as the products are a little bit different more \u2013 they\u2019re certainly more cost sensitive and certainly more impacted by logistics costs, which we\u2019ve seen a significant increase of. And there\u2019s been quite an quick increase of those types of costs that absolutely have had an impact that we haven\u2019t necessarily been able to offset at this point and the team\u2019s doing certainly a good job of working through that. And we do think over some period of time, they\u2019ll be able to offset those cost pressures, but that\u2019s something that in that market, you can\u2019t really do or in overnight, other markets, like automotive aren\u2019t so easy, but certainly I think the team\u2019s done a good job of starting those conversations and there\u2019s other markets that are easier. So I think that we\u2019ve done a good job. I think that we\u2019ve been able to offset the majority certainly of the sequential increases that we\u2019ve seen during the year of the cost environment. And we\u2019re not guiding into 2022 at this point, but I do believe that the cost environment is not going to get any easier any time soon. So the team certainly has been tasked with and I think they\u2019re doing a good job of continuing those conversations with their customers. And all of the markets, some of which are easier and some of which are harder. And in terms of being able to ultimately pass on those cost increases to our customers and to be able to continue to leverage and increase our margins as we continue to grow. Thank you. Have a great day."

            "name": "Adam Norwitt",
            "content": "Well, thank you very much, Craig, and like to extend my welcome to everybody here on the phone today. And I hope that all of you had an enjoyable and healthy summer and are staying dry here if you're in the Northeast today. As Craig mentioned, I'm going to highlight some of our achievements here in the third quarter. I will discuss the trends and our progress across our served markets. And then finally I'll make some comments on our outlook for the fourth quarter and for the full year of 2021. And of course we'll have time at the end for questions. As Craig went over, our results in the third quarter were substantially better than we had expected coming into the quarter. We exceeded the high end of our guidance in sales, as well as an adjusted diluted earnings per share. Our sales grew a very strong 21% in U.S. dollars and 20% in local currencies reaching a new record $2.818 billion. On an organic basis, our sales increased by 13% with broad-based growth across most of our served markets, as well as contributions from the company's acquisition program. Orders in the quarter were robust, again, more than $3 billion, $3.016 billion. And this represented another strong book-to-bill at 1.07:1. That despite the many operational challenges that we've continued to face throughout the quarter, including continued cost increases related to commodities, supply chain and other logistics pressures. We were very pleased to deliver robust operating margins of 20.3% in the quarter. And as Craig detailed, that was a 30 basis point sequential improvement. Our EPS \u2013 adjusted diluted EPS grew strongly from prior year increasing by 18% to a new record $0.65. And that's just an excellent reflection once again of our organizations continued strong execution. The company generated operating and free cash flow of $328 million and $238 million in the third quarter. And we're very pleased that the Board of Directors just approved yesterday an increase in our dividend of 38% effective in January of next year. Coming out of this quarter, I'm just extremely proud of our team around the world. These results once again reflect the discipline as well as the agility of our entrepreneurial organization, as we continued to perform well, amidst a very dynamic and challenging environment. Now turning to our trends and progress across our served markets. We're very pleased that the company broadened balanced and market diversification continues to create value for Amphenol. Very importantly, our diversification mitigates the impact of the volatility of individual and markets, while also at the same time, exposing us to leading technologies wherever they may arise across the electronics industry. And these are both important benefits, especially amidst such a dynamic market environment. Turning first to the military market. This market represented 10% of our sales in the third quarter. Sales grew by 7% from prior year and declined by 4% organically, which was a little bit lower than our expectation heading into the quarter. On an organic basis, growth in ordinance, airframe and space-related products was more than offset by moderations of our sales of products that were used in vehicle, naval and communications applications. Sequentially, sales declined by about 3%. Looking into the fourth quarter, we now expect a slight sequential sales increase. And for the full year of 2021, this would imply a mid-teens increase in sales from last year's levels. We continue to be excited by the strength of Amphenol position in the military market as defense customers around the world continue to adopt next generation technologies at an increasing pace. Our industry leading breadth of high technology, interconnect and sensor products positions the company strongly across essentially all major defense programs. And this gives us confidence for our long-term performance. The commercial aerospace market represented 2% of our sales in the quarter. Sales were flat compared to prior year and declined by about 19% organically as the benefit of our recent acquisitions was offset by continued declines in demand from aircraft manufacturers. As expected coming into the quarter, our sales declined by about 3% sequentially. Looking into the fourth quarter, we're happy that to now expect the mid-teens increase in sales compared to these levels. And for the full year 2021, this would imply a roughly 10% sales decline compared to last year, a clear reflection of the pandemic related headwinds that have impacted the travel industry and thus the commercial aircraft market during the COVID-19 pandemic. Regardless of this challenging environment so far our team working in the commercial aerospace market remains committed to leveraging the company's strong interconnect and sensor technology position across a wide array of airplane platforms and next generation systems integrated into those aircraft. As personal and business travel continues to recover from the pandemic impacted lows, we do look forward to benefiting as jet manufacturers expand their production and in turn expand their procurement of our components. The industrial market represented 26% of our sales in the quarter. Sales increased by a very strong 44% in U.S. dollars and 24% organically. This excellent growth was broad-based across most segments of the worldwide industrial market, including in particular, the battery and heavy electric vehicle, factory automation, oil and gas, rail mass transit, heavy equipment, alternative energy and instrumentation segments together with the contributions from our recent acquisitions. On a sequential basis, sales increased by 4% from the second quarter, which was much better than our expectations coming into the quarter. Looking into the fourth quarter, we expect sales to moderate from these levels. But for the full year of 2021, we expect sales to increase more than 40% from prior year, a very strong performance. I remain extremely proud of our global team working in the industrial market. Our long-term strategy to expand our high technology interconnect antenna and sensor offering both organically and through complementary acquisitions has positioned the company to capitalize on the many revolutions that are occurring across the industrial electronics market. We look forward to realizing the benefits of the strategy for many years to come. The automotive market represented 19% of our sales in the quarter. And despite the widely reported challenges across the automotive market, our sales actually came in higher than expectations in the quarter growing a strong 31% in U.S. dollars and 26% organically. This strong performance reflected our automotive teams, excellent execution in the face of numerous supply chain challenges as well as robust growth of our products used in electric and hybrid electric vehicles. This was another clear confirmation of our global teams long-term efforts at designing and high voltage and other interconnect and sensor products into these next generation platforms. On a sequential basis, sales were flat compared to the second quarter. The widely reported supply chain challenges in the auto industry continued to impact demand from vehicle manufacturers around the world. Accordingly, we do expect in the fourth quarter, a high single digit sequential moderation in sales. For the full year 2021, this implies sales will increase by more than 40% compared to last year driven by our expanded position in next generation electronics integrated into cars, including in particular those electric and hybrid drive trains. I remain extremely proud of our team working in the automotive market, who has continued to demonstrate a high degree of agility and resiliency in both driving a significant recovery from last year\u2019s reduced sales levels, while also expertly navigating the myriad of supply chain challenges that the entire automotive industry is facing. We look forward to benefiting from their efforts long into the future. The mobile devices market represented 13% of our sales in the quarter. And our sales in this market declined from prior year by 5% as modest growth in sales of products incorporated into smart phones and laptops was more than offset by declines in wearables and tablets. Sequentially, sales increased by a stronger than expected 36% driven by higher sales across virtually all product categories that we serve. Looking into the fourth quarter, we expect a continued mid to high single digit increase in sales from these third quarter levels. And for the full year, we anticipate sales to grow modestly from 2020, which is in fact, an impressive achievement given last year\u2019s robust demand. I remain very proud of our team working in the mobile devices market. Their unique agility continues to enable the company to react quickly to changing demand in this most volatile of markets. With our leading array of antennas, interconnect products and mechanisms enabling a broad range of next generation mobile devices. We're positioned well for the long term. Turning to mobile networks market. This market represented 5% of our sales in the quarter and sales increased by 11% from prior year and 7% organically. And this sales growth was really driven by our sales to mobile service providers, which was offset by a small moderation of sales to OEMs. On a sequential basis, our sales increased just slightly, which was largely in line with our expectations coming into the quarter. For the fourth quarter, we expect another slight sequential increase in sales. As mobile networks customers continue to ramp up their investments in 5G and other next generation networks. And for 2021, this would imply that our sales would grow by approximately 10%. Our team continues to work aggressively in the mobile networks market to realize the benefits of our efforts to expand our position in next generation 5G equipment and networks around the world. As our customers ramp up their investments into these advanced systems, we look forward to benefiting from the increased potential that comes from our unique position with both equipment manufacturers and mobile service providers. The information technology in datacom market represented 22% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in this market rose from prior year by a very strong 28% in U.S. dollars and 26% organically. And this is driven by increased demand from OEMs and in particular increased demand from web service providers. Sequentially, our sales grew by a better than expected 10% from second quarter levels. As we look into the fourth quarter, we do expect a slight decline from these elevated levels. And for the full year of 2021, we expect sales to increase in the low 20% range. We remain encouraged by the company's outstanding position in the global IT data datacom market. Our OEM and service provider customers continue to drive their equipment and networks to ever higher levels of performance in order to manage the continued dramatic increases in demand for bandwidth and processor power. In turn, our team remained highly focused on enabling this continuing revolution and IT datacom with industry leading high speed, power and fiber optic interconnect products. We look forward to realizing the benefits of that leading position for many years to come. And finally, the broadband market represented 3% of our sales in the quarter. Sales declined by 5% from prior and 10% organically as cable operator procurement moderated. On a sequential basis, sales decreased by a slightly better than expected 3%. For the fourth quarter, we now expect a further moderation in sales from these levels and for the full year 2021, we anticipate that sales will grow in the mid single digits. Despite this more challenging environment in the broadband market, we continue to look forward to supporting our service provider customers around the world. All of them are working to increase their bandwidth to support the expansion of high-speed data applications to homes and to businesses. Now turning to our outlook. There's no question that the current market environment remains highly uncertain with significant supply chain and inflationary challenges, as well as the ongoing pandemic given this and assuming constant exchange rates. For the fourth quarter, we expect sales in the range of $2.690 billion to $2.750 billion and adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $0.61 to $0.63. This would represent year-over-year sales growth of 11% to 13% and adjusted diluted EPS growth of 7% to 11%. Our fourth quarter guidance represents an expectation for full year sales of $10.540 billion to $10.600 billion and full adjusted diluted EPS of $2.39 to $2.41. This outlook represents full year sales and adjusted EPS growth of 23% and 28% to 29% respectively. I remain confident in the ability of our outstanding management team to adapt to the continued challenges in the marketplace and to capitalize on the many future opportunities to grow our market position and expand our profitability. In addition, our entire organization remains committed to delivering long-term sustainable value all while prioritizing the continued safety and health of each of our employees around the world. Most importantly, I'd like to take this opportunity to once again, thank the entire Amphenol team for their truly outstanding efforts here in the third quarter. And with that operator, we'd be very happy to take any questions. Yes, thanks very much, Amit. I mean, no doubt about it. A lot of chatter, a lot of news, you can't pick up the paper without reading about supply chains. I think for the first 22 years of my so far 23 year career, I don't recall that the front page was plastered with things about the supply chain. And now it seems to be virtually every day that you read something about it. And no question throughout the quarter, there remained just a number of real significant challenges that our team fought through and really fought through. I think when you see the results in particular growing sequentially by 6% in the quarter which was above our expectations, amidst, what I would say we are continued serious supply chain impediments, some of which even worsen throughout the quarter, whether that's availability of logistics and freight, the cost of raw materials, the availability of raw materials, even talking about things like labor shortages, which are there are pockets of that around the world as well. And so no question that those are all dynamics that our team faced and across that entrepreneurial Amphenol organization, our team just made it happen. Now in terms of inventory builds and orders moderating, I mean, we've still had strong orders in the quarter. There's no doubt about it. And even though our book-to-bill was a bit lower 1.07 compared to the second quarter, most of the reasons why our book-to-bill was lower because our sales grew into the level of the bookings. Orders were down by maybe 3% from the second quarter. But sales were up by 6% thus the slightly lower, but still robust book-to-bill. In terms of inventory, I mean, you saw for sure that our inventory was up a little bit and I think many have seen a little bit elevated inventory, which is not surprising given both our growth as a company, very significant growth, but also the very significant supply chain impediments that are out there. To the extent that our customers have more inventory. We don't always have perfect visibility into that. I will say what we do have visibility to, which is in particular in distribution, we haven't seen really abnormal levels of inventory amongst our distributor for our products. In fact, I think what we've seen is continued strong sell-through of the products into customers around the world. And knowing that our distribution business is predominantly industrial and aerospace [indiscernible] business, we've seen continued really strong demand in particular across the industrial market. What \u2013 in terms of the customers and their willingness to pull product, we talked about last quarter in the automotive market, for example, that we probably could have shipped more if customers wanted it. And I think we continue to see some instances anecdotes where customers, because they don\u2019t have all the components that they need to make their finished product be it a car or a truck or otherwise. They in the end don\u2019t take our product as opposed to necessarily building the inventory of our product. They just tell us not to ship it. So a lot going on, but I think at the end of the day, amidst all these challenges, the performance of the company has shown very brightly. Yes. Well, thanks so much, Steve. I mean no doubt about it. It\u2019s been a very, very strong year and I would almost say a very strong couple of years for our team work in the IT datacom market. I mean not forgetting that last year, we grew in that market by 15%. And this year, continuing to exceed our expectations with sales in this quarter in particular are growing by 28% and 10% sequentially. So no question about it. And I think when I look into the fourth quarter, we\u2019re coming from very elevated levels of demand. And we\u2019re not guiding to like a catastrophic reduction. We\u2019re talking about a modest sequential decline in the fourth quarter, which I think given the overall environment, given the overall demand from our customers and in particular customers in web service where we\u2019ve seen just really strong growth and whether you call them cloud or web service providers and we\u2019ve seen outstanding growth in that business over the last couple of years. And once in a while, you could have a moderation. There could even be a little bit of seasonality that could come into that. So I don\u2019t think that this fourth quarter guide is at all a turnaround in that business. It would still by the way in the fourth quarter reflect very, very strong year-over-year growth in that IT datacom market. And in the end, I think would be a very, very strong year for that market, for our teamwork in that market. I would just add Wamsi to that one important principle here, pricing is an art, it\u2019s not just you issue a price increase and off it goes. And the beauty of how we\u2019re organized is that we\u2019re not making those pricing decisions here at headquarters, rather we have 125 general managers around the world, and those general managers are best suited to make the right decision around pricing, because they know the strength of their own position. They know their competitive position. They know their technology position. And they also can go to a customer and say, look, I have tried everything else. And the only remaining thing I can do is raise the price to you. And then it\u2019s a genuine, it\u2019s a reasonable discussion. And it\u2019s one that\u2019s grounded in fact, and basis as opposed to in corporate policy. And I think that\u2019s why we\u2019ve always been maybe a little bit more successful in moderating the impacts of these, because our general managers have every tool available to them. All of the functions, all of the inputs are part of their responsibility. And thus, they\u2019re able to go out and make it happen. And just because the cost of materials is up, or the cost of logistics is up, it does not give absolution to an Amphenol general manager for their performance, not in our company. I mean no matter what the cycle is, we have absolute standards for performance and they have to hit that and they\u2019ll figure it out. And if that means, having those tough discussions with customers, then that\u2019s what they\u2019re going to do. Sure. Thanks very much, Joe. I mean, look, we always give guidance with the information at hand just as we did 90 days ago, we\u2019re doing here today. And so I wouldn\u2019t point to some different dynamic nor would I say that one should expect that we\u2019re going to be by the same amount that we beat last quarter. Our team is always going to strive to maximize our results, amidst, whatever environment we\u2019re in. And as we\u2019ve talked at nauseam, it\u2019s a very dynamic environment and they\u2019re going to continue to push, till the last minute of the last hour of the last day of the year in supporting our customers and executing amidst this environment. And if that ends up that we \u2013 that that this guidance is exceeded and that will be what it will be, but right now we\u2019re giving guidance based on what we see in the marketplace. Thanks so much, Will. I mean relative to our lead times, I mean, it should not be surprising that maybe we have a little bit of extra lead times now than we would have had a year ago. It is a very constrained environment. Sometimes even just getting materials in from overseas, if you need to have to do that, whatever there\u2019s just a lot of sort of sand in the gears of the global supply chain and that can lead to extra lead times. Also I\u2019ve talked about our orders, maybe not even because of our own lead times, but just customers opening up the aperture of their order window a little bit longer and that has led to some of the higher levels of orders that we\u2019ve seen in addition to just overall robust demand. As it relates to expedite requests, I don\u2019t know that I can give you a good read on that more thoroughly or systematically across the company. I mean we continue to have some customers who really need product. I mean to the extent that we are using a material that is really constrained, and there are certain cases of that, I continued to see the odd expedite request here and there. I don\u2019t know that I have a good read on whether it\u2019s less or more the same. I mean I guess I would say it\u2019s kind of the same over the last 90 days. Nothing that I would take note of really. Thanks so much, Mark, and good afternoon to you. I think one thing that I would just point out from this last quarter is actually our growth on a year-over-year basis was very balanced across all the geographies. I mean almost extremely balanced on an organic basis virtually every region grew by that, that 13% organically. And that, that was really nice to see actually a bit surprising given the sort of dynamics, whether they be pandemic related, supply chain related, electricity related or otherwise. And our team in China continues to do a fabulous job of managing through whatever challenges come their way and that did include in the quarter some challenges related to the availability of electricity. But fortunately for us, our approach operationally around the world, and that is the same approach that we have in China is never and not to put all our eggs in one basket. People are sometimes surprised that we have so many facilities around the world, something like 200, 250 facilities, and that includes something like 50 facilities in China that are spread across the country. And so when there are pockets of challenges over the last year and a half, whether that be from COVID-related shutdown, supply chain challenges, or even the electricity issues that you\u2019ve heard about in China, that\u2019s not having a material impact across the company, but rather may create a single challenge for one or another operation. And the local management team just makes it happen. And that\u2019s a \u2013 that\u2019s kind of the approach that we take. Yes. Thanks. Thanks very much, Nik. Look, this is a long story for us, which is that we\u2019ve been growing our automotive business for more than a decade through a consistent strategy of growing both organically and through acquisitions, into new electronics applications, new applications in the car. Throughout the course of that time, we expanded our product offering from simple connectors and cable assemblies to sensors and antennas, complex center assemblies and the like. And through it all, our strategy has not been to just take share out of incumbents, but rather to participate in the expansion of electronics in the automotive market. And that expansion of electronics has really accelerated throughout that time. As I highlighted in my prepared remarks, one area of expansion for electronics has been across the electrification of vehicles, both electric and hybrid vehicles, where we've leveraged our strong legacy and high voltage capabilities to really be a strong participant in that area. And that's been a great growth driver for us for many quarters. And that included in the quarter that just completed. Have we seen expedites in the automotive market? I would actually say we've seen this quarter and last quarter more of the opposite of expedites. We've seen that customers have pushed out demand because of supply shortages that they're seeing from other types of commodities. You mentioned semiconductors as one example, as opposed to expedites that of customers pulling in. And \u2013 but for those other supply chain shortages, I'm sure automotive business would have been even more robust than it was. Well, look, it's a great question. And it's a question that I wouldn't even confine to EVs. I mean, you point out the consumer expectations for technology in EVs, but I would just say consumer expectations for technology in vehicles [indiscernible] has expanded and has continued to accelerate over many years. I mean, I just look at, my kids, when we get in a car, you've got like a spaghetti of cables that people want to plug in to various parts of the car. And then you now have car companies coming and putting in things like wireless charging and outlets in different places as opposed to. We having one of these massive things that every kid has to plug their thing into a cigarette lighter. Now everybody has their little connectors all over the car and things like that. And whether it'd be navigation systems, communication systems, safety systems, passenger comfort systems we have seen. And I think we are living through a revolution of electronics in vehicles and that's all vehicles because we shouldn't forget like in the global automotive market, I don't know, hybrid and EVs. I'm not perfectly familiar with every one of these numbers, but I think they still represent less than 10%. And that's if you include hybrid of all total vehicle volumes, but I would say all vehicles are adopting more electronics because the car companies have realized not only that their customers want these things, but actually they can make more money on these things. These type of features are things that people will actually pay more for and thereby allow the car companies to make more profit from their products and look, it's great news for anybody working in the automotive electronics market. It's \u2013 and for our company where again, our strategy has not been to go take share out of others, but rather to work on the new things that are happening in the car. I think our company comes out of that very well positioned. Yes. Thanks Jim. Yes, there's no doubt that the profitability of the cable segment is at the lowest level it's been in certainly in my memory. And I think, but when we talk about it being unprecedented, I think we're also in an unprecedented environment from a cost perspective. And especially as it relates to things that impact that segment, which are things like logistics and things like certain commodity costs that have always had a more of a significant impact on that segment. We've talked about commodities and cost environment impacting that segment more. And when you're in a more unprecedented environment where the costs have just increased so quickly and so significantly. And then you're in a market where it's not as easy to overnight increase prices, even in an precedent cost environment due to the competitive dynamics and other factors within those \u2013 within that market, that it just becomes an unfortunate situation that it does have a more significant impact in the short-term here. There's no doubt that the team is working hard on pricing actions, and we're confident that there will be successful over some period of time. Don't forget this is 4% of the company right now. It's relatively small, but for the businesses that are you involved in dealing with this that's \u2013 this is impactful for them as it is for any other operations. So it's not that it's not meaningful, but it certainly has a lower impact on the overall company, but there's no doubt as the new management team is extremely focused on this. We are optimistic that over some not so long-term period of time and this shorter term, we'll be able to get these margins back up. Whether or not it's next quarter or the quarter after, I think time will tell, but we are optimistic that it will. We are on the lower end of the scale in terms of profitability in this market. And it will improve over those coming quarters. Yes. Thanks. Thanks very much, Chris. I mean, look, we give a lot of details across the company. And I think we haven't publicly talked about the specific numbers of what makes up, what different powertrains make up, what different sales of our automotive market. But what we have said very consistently, and I would say it again this quarter is that the growth in our EV business, whether that's an auto or also our industrial electrification business have been significant drivers of our out-performance. So, you can imagine that after a number of quarters of doing so that business represents a lot more today than it did many quarters ago. And it's a meaningful piece of the business. It has a real impact on the business and it continues to have great potential for the future. Yes. Well, thanks very much, David. I mean, you said it the industrial market is for us a very, very diversified range of segments. Now, everything from medical to heavy vehicles, to oil and gas, things like marine, factory automation that the battery and heavy electric vehicles, alternative energy. I mean, even an area like building automation where we've seen a lot of strong growth. I mean, what I think really unique here in the third quarter was virtually every one of those segments grew in the quarter. So, you don't always see that usually there's some sort of counter cyclicality across one or another of those segments, and we thought really strong performance across all of them. And when I think about why the company has really done such an excellent job in industrial, I mean, I'd point to a few factors. Number one is, our strategy for many years has been to build out a range of products that make us more important to customers across the industrial world. And again, remembering that what ties those products together is that they're all harsh environments solutions. So whether they be discreet connectors of value add interconnect assemblies center, antennas, or the like. These are all products that have to be ruggedized. They have to be fit to an environment that maybe as an ultra clean environment in an operating theater, or maybe an ultra dirty environment in an oil and gas drilling setup, or in an alternative energy on an offshore windmill or something like that. So all of these have just really uniquely challenging environments around them and what we see in common across these customers and where a lot of our growth has come from. This is really the second factor is that customers across the industrial market are adopting electronics at an increasing pace. So the same discussion that we add in the auto market, just a few moments ago, we see that really broadly across the industrial market as customers adopt next generation electronic systems and put those systems into tougher and tougher environments. I would also say that the industrial market is a very fragmented market from a competitive perspective. And so while for sure we're taking advantage of new things in this market like we are in automotive. I think there's also the fact that we continue to gain position against competitors who either don't have the breadth of offering, don't have the geographical position to support customers on a global basis. Don't have the diverse and resilient footprint that has been able to support those customers during the pandemic or during all the other disruptions that have come along and thereby customers have come increasingly to us to solve their problems, and we've not disappointed them. And that creates a positive feedback loop. So it's a market that I think we're very excited about. I think our team working in this market is just doing a great job. If you look into the fourth quarter for sure, you can look at that fourth quarter kind of through the prism of saying, well, we're guiding it to be down slightly. But in fact, on a year-over-year basis, it's going to be an outstanding fourth quarter as well. So, I think the team just continues to excel, and we're very excited about the industrial market for many years to come. Well, look, I mean, we're not blind to the world around us. So there's no doubt about it. I mean, the geopolitical tension that has been present for a number of years has certainly not gone away. And for one [ph] would fully advocate that countries like the U.S. and China, the world's two largest economies should for sure get along. There's lots and lots of reasons why we shouldn't. By the way, firstly, I'm very optimistic that long term that is going to be the case. But as it relates to our position in any country, including China, I mean, I would just remind everybody, we have a very unique operating strategy. We rely on local managers in every country that we operate and we operate in more than 40 countries around the world. And in each of those places, we have local general managers who have the authority to run their business as they need to run it in that region to be most successful. And so our general managers in China are able to tailor make how they do business, obviously within the confines of ethics and law and everything that it means to be a global company. But they're able to meet their customers on a level playing field with their local competitors. But in fact, it's not a level playing field, because then they're able to bring the totality of Amphenol capabilities to bear in support of those customers. And that's where the advantages is. We bring the best of both worlds of both being a local partner, but also a global company who has global resources, global breadth and global capabilities. And that's why we've been successful in India. That's why we've been successful in China. That's why we've been successful in France, in Germany and the UK. And of course here in the U.S. It's a very unique operating model that is, that works really, really well in a world where everybody's getting along, but it also works really well in a world where people aren't necessarily getting along. In terms of how we deploy our capital, we're always careful about deploying capital in every country in the world. We're always going to incorporate all the sort of risks and opportunities into our calculus about what we're going to invest in and what we're not going to invest in. And ultimately those investment ideas are all coming up from below, not sort of dictated from above. But for sure, we're going to apply appropriate scrutiny to investments in every place in the world, using sort of the full picture of the environment into which we're investing. Thanks Joe very much. Look, I think we've seen a lot of challenges and I talked a little bit about this earlier. But \u2013 and those challenges have included in China, a few power shortages. But I think like I described, luckily for us, our approach is to not put all our eggs in one manufacturing basket. And so while we've had maybe an odd power shortage in one location or another. It hasn't had a meaningful impact on the company. And our local team is doing a fabulous job of mitigating any impact that there could be of such shortages. It gives everybody something else to think about in a time where there's a lot going on. Well, thank you so much. And I'd like to just extend my best wishes to everyone here on the phone. Thank you so much for taking the time with us. And we will talk to you after the holiday season. So I will be the first to wish everybody a happy holiday season and a happy and successful end of the year. And we'll talk to you in 2022. Thanks so much."

        "content": "Operator: Hello and welcome to the Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call for Amphenol Corporation. Following today\u2019s presentation, there will be a formal question-and-answer session. Until then, all lines will remain in a listen-only mode. At the request of the company, today\u2019s conference is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, you may disconnect at this time. Now, I would like to introduce today\u2019s conference host, Mr. Craig Lampo. Sir, you may begin.\nCraig Lampo: Thank you very much. Good afternoon, everyone. This is Craig Lampo, Amphenol\u2019s CFO. And I\u2019m here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO. We would like to welcome you to our second quarter 2021 conference call. Our second quarter 2021 results were released this morning. I will provide some financial commentary, and then, Adam will give an overview of the business as well as current trends. And then we\u2019ll take some questions. As a reminder, during the call, we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures and may make certain forward-looking statements. So please refer to the relevant disclosures in our press release for further information. In addition, all data discussed during this call will be on a continuing-operations basis unless otherwise noted. The company closed the second quarter with record sales of $2.654 billion, and GAAP and adjusted diluted EPS of $0.59 and $0.61 respectively. Sales were up 34% in U.S. dollars, 30% in local currencies and 22% organically compared to the second quarter of 2020. Sequentially, sales were up 12% in U.S. dollars and in local currencies, and 7% organically. Orders for the quarter were a record $3.120 billion, which was up 50% compared to the second quarter of 2020, and up 14% sequentially, resulting in a very strong book-to-bill ratio of 1.18 to 1. Breaking down sales into our 2 segments, the interconnect segment, which comprise 96% of our sales, was up 34% in U.S. dollars, and 30% in local currencies compared to the second quarter of last year. Our cable segment, which comprise 4% of our sales was up 27% in U.S. dollars and 24% local currencies compared to the second quarter of last year. Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes. GAAP and adjusted operating income were $476 million and $532 million respectively in the second quarter of 2021. GAAP operating income includes $55 million of transactions, severance, restructuring and certain other non-cash costs related to the MTS acquisition. And the company also incurred $34 million related to the extinguishment of outstanding MTS senior notes. That in accordance with GAAP was recorded as an increase to goodwill in the second quarter, and therefore, had no impact on the second quarter earnings. Excluding these acquisition-related costs, adjusted operating margin was 20%, which increased by strong 200 basis points compared to the second quarter of last year and increased by 40 basis points sequentially. The year-over-year improvement in adjusted operating margin was primarily driven by normal operating leverage on the higher sales volumes and a lower cost impact from the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by the impact of the challenging commodity and supply chain environment that we experienced in this year\u2019s quarter. The sequential increase in adjusted operating margin was driven by the normal conversion on the increased sales levels, partially offset by the impact of MTS Sensors business, which is currently operating below the company\u2019s average operating margin. From a segment standpoint, in the interconnect segment margins were 22% in the second quarter of 2021, which increased from 20% in the second quarter of 2020 and increased 50 basis points sequentially. In the cable segment, margins were 6.1%, which decreased from 9.4% in the second quarter of 2020 and 8.8% in the first quarter. These lower margins in the cable segment are directly related to the rapid increases in the prices of certain commodity and logistics costs, which we have not yet been able to offset with pricing actions. Given the dynamic market environment, we are very proud of the company\u2019s performance. Our team\u2019s ability to effectively manage through the current market challenges is a direct result of the strength and commitment of the company\u2019s entrepreneurial management team, which continues to foster high-performance action-oriented culture. The company\u2019s GAAP effective tax rate for the second quarter was 17.5%, which compare to 20.7% in the second quarter of 2020. On an adjusted basis, this effective tax rate was 24.5% in the second quarter of both 2021 and 2020. GAAP diluted EPS was $0.59, an increase of 40% compared to the $0.42 in the prior year period. And adjusted diluted EPS was a record $0.61, an increase of 53% compared to $0.40 in the second quarter of 2020. The company continues to be an excellent generator of cash. Operating cash flow was $411 million in the second quarter, or 109% of adjusted net income. And net of capital spending, our free cash flow was $307 million or 81% of adjusted net income. From a working capital standpoint, inventory days, days sales outstanding, and payable days were 85, 71 and 60 days respectively, all excluding the impact of acquisitions in the quarter and within our normal range. During the quarter, the company repurchased 2.5 million shares of common stock for approximately $167 million, at an average price of approximately $67. At the end of the quarter, total debt was $5.2 billion and net debt was $4 billion. Total liquidity at the end of the quarter was $2.3 billion, which included cash and short-term investments on hand of $1.2 billion, plus availability under our existing credit facilities. Second quarter 2021 GAAP EBITDA was $597 million, and our net leverage ratio was 1.6 times. On a pro forma basis, after giving effect to the sale of MTS Test & Simulation business, net leverage at June 30, 2021 would have been 1.3 times. As previously discussed, due to the pending sale of the MTS Test & Simulation business, that business is being reported as a discontinued operation, and therefore, it\u2019s expected results are excluded from our Q3 guidance. In addition, in conjunction with the divestiture of the Test & Simulation business, the company will incur certain additional cash tax related another acquisition related cost in the third quarter, which will not be included in income from continuing operation, and therefore are not included in our guidance. I will now turn the call over to Adam, who will provide some commentary on current market trends.\nAdam Norwitt: Well, thank you very much, Craig. And I\u2019d like to extend my welcome to all of you here on the call today. And I hope that you, your family, friends and colleagues continue to stay safe and healthy and indeed are able to enjoy the summer so far. As Craig mentioned, I\u2019m going to highlight some of our achievements in the second quarter. I\u2019ll then get into a discussion of the trends, and our trends and progress across our served markets. I\u2019ll make some commentary on our outlook for the third quarter. And then, of course, we\u2019ll have time for questions at the end. Our results in the second quarter were substantially better than expected, as we exceeded the high-end of our guidance and sales and adjusted diluted earnings per share. Craig already mentioned our sales grow very strong 34% in U.S. dollars and 30% in local currency is reaching a new record of $2.654 billion. On an organic basis, our sales increased by 22% with growth driven in particular by the automotive, military, industrial and broadband markets, as well as contributions from the company\u2019s acquisition program. We\u2019re very pleased to book record orders in the quarter of $3.120 billion, and that represented a very strong book-to-bill of 1.18 to 1. Despite facing operational challenges in certain geographies related to the ongoing pandemic as well as continued increases in costs related to commodities and supply chain pressures. We were very pleased to deliver very strong adjusted operating margins of 20.0% in the quarter. This was a 200 basis point increase from last year\u2019s levels, and a 40 basis point improvement sequentially. Adjusted diluted EPS grew very significant 53% from prior year to another new record of $0.61 and just an outstanding reflection of our continued strong execution. And then, finally, the company generated operating and free cash flow of $411 million and $307 million respectively in the second quarter. I just can\u2019t emphasize enough how proud I am of our organization around the world. These results once again reflect the discipline and agility of our entrepreneurial organization. As we have continued to perform well amidst, what is a very dynamic and challenging environment? Very pleased that in the quarter we closed on the acquisition of Unlimited Services. Unlimited based in Oconto, Wisconsin, but also with operations in Mexico and has annual sales of approximately $50 million. This is a great manufacturer of cable assemblies for the industrial market primarily, with a particular focus on heavy vehicles. The addition of unlimited broadens our already strong position in value-add interconnect products that are integrated into a wide array of industrial applications. As we welcome this outstanding new team to Amphenol, I remain very confident that our acquisition program will continue to create great value for the company. In fact, our ability to identify and execute upon acquisitions, and then to successfully bring these new companies into Amphenol remains a core competitive advantage for the company. Now turning to our served markets, I just would comment once again, how pleased we are that the company is broad and balanced, and market diversification continues to create real value for us. We believe that ultimately, this diversification mitigates the impact of the volatility of individual end markets, while also giving us broad exposure to leading technologies and the innovations of those technologies, wherever they may arise across the broad scope of the electronics industry. Turning to the military market, the military market represented 11% of our sales in the quarter. And as expected sales grew a strong 45% from the COVID impacted prior year second quarter, and were up 30% organically and this was really driven by broad strength across virtually all segments of the military market. On a sequential basis, sales increased by 12%, also very strong. As we look into the third quarter, we remains \u2013 we expect sales to remain at these current elevated levels. And we continue to be very excited by the strength of our position in the military market. And that position is really based upon our industry leading breadth of high technology interconnect and now sensor products. Together with our support of essentially all major military programs, this gives us great confidence for our long-term performance in this important area. The commercial air market represented 2% of our sales in the quarter. Sales grew by 7% versus prior year really with the benefit of the contributions of our recent acquisitions. On an organic basis, sales were declined \u2013 were down by about 14%, as the commercial aircraft market continued to experience declines in demand for new aircraft production. Sequentially, however, our sales did increase by better than expected 19%. And that\u2019s really from the benefit of the MTS acquisition as well as some organic progress. As we look ahead, we expect a slight seasonal moderation in sales in the third quarter, which we would typically see in commercial air. And regardless of the ongoing difficult environment, our team working in this commercial aerospace market remains committed to leveraging the company\u2019s strong interconnect and sensor technology position across a wide array of aircraft platforms and next generation systems that are integrated into those planes. As personal and business travel continues to recover from the pandemic, we look forward to jet manufacturers beginning to expand their production levels. The industrial market represented 27% of our sales in the quarter, and our performance in the second quarter and industrial was really much stronger than expected with sales increasing by 54% in U.S. dollars and 28% organically. This growth was broad-based across most areas of the worldwide industrial market, and was driven in particular by organic strength in the transportation, battery and heavy electric vehicle, marine and energy generation segments, together with the contributions from our acquisitions that have been completed over the past year. On a sequential basis, sales increased by very strong 26% from the first quarter, really with the benefit of acquisitions as well as strong organic performance. Looking into the third quarter, we expect sales to remain at these elevated levels, despite what would typically be a seasonally lower quarter. I can\u2019t say enough how proud I am of our team working in the industrial market. And we\u2019ve had a long-term strategy to expand our high technology, interconnect, antenna and sensor offering both organically as well as through complementary acquisitions. And that strategy has positioned us strongly with industrial customers around the world, who are accelerating their adoption of electronics. The acquisition of Unlimited Services further bolsters our leading value-add capabilities in this important market and we look forward to realizing the benefits of this strategy for many years to come. The Automotive market represented 20% of our sales in the quarter. And I just say that sales were higher than our expectations, probably a very strong 134% in U.S. dollars and 117% organically, as our team was able to execute strongly in the face of a robust and broad recovery in the automotive market. In particular, we once again drove very strong growth of our products used in electric \u2013 hybrid electric vehicles this quarter, which confirms again for us our global team\u2019s long-term efforts at designing in high voltage and other interconnect and sensor products into these important next generation platforms. Despite an increase in production disruptions among our automotive customers, due to the widely reported global supply chain issues, we were able to achieve a small sequential increase in our sales, which was a bit better than we had expected coming into the quarter. No doubt about it, though, there continued to be a range of widely reported supply chain challenges that that are rising within the automotive industry and this is impacting overall demand from vehicle manufacturers around the world. Accordingly, as we look towards the third quarter, we do expect a modest sequential decline in our sales. I remain extremely proud of our team working in the automotive market. They continue to demonstrate a high degree of agility and resiliency in both driving a significant recovery from last year as reduced production levels. While expertly navigating the myriad of supply chain challenges that the entire automotive industry is still facing. We look forward to benefiting from their efforts long into the future. Turning to the mobile devices market, that market represented 10% of our sales in the quarter. Our sales to customers in the mobile devices market declined from prior year by 4% in U.S. dollars and 6% organically, as declines in handsets and laptops more than offset growth in wearables. And I would just remind you that our last year second quarter did include a significant sequential recovery and really a catch up from the COVID impacted first quarter of 2020, which made the comparison versus prior year a little more challenging. Sequentially, our sales felt by 6% from the first quarter, which was modestly better than our expectations. Looking to the third quarter, we now expect an approximately 25% increase in sales from these second quarter levels as we benefit from the seasonally typical higher demand in the mobile device market as customers launch a range of new products. While mobile devices remains the most volatile of Amphenol end markets, our outstanding and agile team is poised as always to capture any opportunities for incremental sales that may arise in the second half of 2021 and beyond. Our leading array of antennas, interconnect products and mechanisms continues to enable a broad range of next generation mobile devices, thereby positioning us well for the long-term in this exciting market. The mobile networks market represented 5% of our sales in the quarter. Sales were flat to prior year and down 4% organically. The sales to both OEMs and the wireless service providers moderated. On a sequential basis, however, our sales increased by 5% compared to the first quarter, which was in line with our expectations coming into the second quarter. And as we look towards the third quarter, we expect a further increase in sales as mobile networks customers ramp up their investments in next generation networks. Our team around the world continues to work aggressively to realize the benefits of our efforts at expanding our position in such next generation networks and the equipment that populates them around the world. And as customers ramp up these investments of such advanced systems, we look forward to benefiting from the increased potential that comes from our unique position with both equipment manufacturers and mobile service providers. The information technology and data communications market increased by 21% in the second quarter. Sales in the second quarter rose by 5% in U.S. dollars and 3% organically from the very significant levels in last year\u2019s second quarter. Our strength this quarter was driven in particular by robust sales to web service providers, which was partially offset by some weakness in sales to network equipment OEMs. Sequentially, our sales grew a very strong 20% from the first quarter, which significantly outperformed our original expectations. Looking now into the third quarter, we expect sales to increase modestly from these very high levels. We remain very encouraged by the company\u2019s outstanding position in the global IT data comm market. Our OEM and web service provider customers around the world continue to drive their equipment and networks to ever higher levels of performance in order to manage the continued dramatic increases in demand for bandwidth and processor power. In turn, our team is singularly focused on enabling this continuing revolution in IT data comm, with industry-leading high-speed, power, and fiber-optic interconnect products. And we look forward to realizing the benefits of our leading position for many years to come. Turning finally to the broadband market, this market represented 4% of our sales in the quarter and sales increased by 12% from prior year and were flat organically as we benefited from our recent acquisition of Cabelcon. On a sequential basis, sales increased by 7% from the first quarter, which was a bit lower than we had anticipated coming into the quarter. For the third quarter, we expect sales to moderate from current levels, as operators digest the really high levels of spending that they have exhibited over the recent quarters. And regardless of this more muted outlook, we continue to look forward to supporting our broadband service operator customers around the world, all of whom are working to increase their bandwidth to support the expansion of high-speed data applications to homes and businesses. Now, turning to our outlook, and I would just note that given the current dynamic market environment, and of course, assuming no new material disruptions from the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as constant exchange rates. In the third quarter, we expect sales in the range of $2.640 billion to $2.700 billion, and adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $0.60 to $0.62. This would represent sales growth of 14% to 16%, and adjusted diluted EPS growth of 9% to 13% compared to the third quarter of last year. I remain confident in the ability of our outstanding entrepreneurial management team to adapt to the continued challenges in the marketplace and to capitalize on the many opportunities to grow our market position and expand our profitability. I can just say that our entire organization remains committed to delivering long-term and sustainable value, all while prioritizing the continued safety and health of each of our employees around the world. And most importantly, I\u2019d like to take this opportunity to once again, thank the entire global Amphenol team for their truly outstanding efforts here in the second quarter. And with that, operator, we\u2019ll be very happy to take any questions that there may be.\nOperator: Thank you. And, participants, we will now begin our question. Please be reminded that questioners are only allowed to ask one question. Now, our first question is from Wamsi Mohan of Bank of America. Sir, your line is now open.\nWamsi Mohan: Yes, thank you. Adam, can you talk about what you\u2019re seeing as far as inventory levels go, particularly in the channel in industrial where you expect that low-teens growth quarter on quarter? You grew almost double that. If you could give us some sense of where things stand, that\u2019d be great. Thank you.\nAdam Norwitt: Thank you very much, Wamsi. I mean, we\u2019ve talked about this in the past that we don\u2019t have necessarily perfect visibility into the inventory, in particular of our OEM and service provider customers. But as far as the channel is concerned, we have not seen any real changes in the inventory levels. In fact, it appears that for the vast majority of our distributors, in particular, with respect to the industrial market, they want to ship it out as soon as we can get it to them. There\u2019s clearly a very significant end-demand across really many segments of the industrial market. And I mentioned earlier that we saw growth across virtually every segment of the industrial market, and whether that was in marine applications, in industrial batteries, in electrification of industrial vehicles, in transportation, heavy equipment, factory automation. I mean, we saw even growth in areas like oil and gas, where we haven\u2019t seen so much growth in the past. Instrumentation, where we continued to see very robust performance over a long time period. So I wouldn\u2019t say that across the industrial market we\u2019ve seen necessarily any worrisome inventory trends. I think that more broadly across the whole company, again, maybe the only area where you hear talk of inventory issues acutely is that there is not a lot of inventory of cars on lots right now. And so, I don\u2019t know what that means through the whole chain. But for sure, dealer inventories of vehicles are extremely low by any measure. And I think there is a lot of supply chain issues that are going on around the automotive industry that I\u2019m sure others will ask about, and many have spoken about and reported about. But by and large, we see inventory as relatively healthy.\nOperator: Thank you. Now, our next question is from Amit Daryanani of Evercore. Sir, line is now open.\nAmit Daryanani: Perfect. Thanks a lot and good afternoon. I guess, my question is around the supply chain dynamics, as well I\u2019d love to understand, Adam, how is it on to \u2013 how is it playing out for Amphenol from operations, from a P&L basis, what\u2019s the impact on your revenue and margin that\u2019s coming from the supply chain issues? And then, beyond the operational challenges, I\u2019d love to understand, does this create an opportunity for you over time to win new customers, to have new share gain? And if so, which segment of those opportunity is bigger?\nAdam Norwitt: Yeah, well, thank you very much, Amit. Look, I mean, the current supply chain environment is certainly not for the faint of heart. And I think our agility as an organization that, that unique entrepreneurship of what we call Amphenoleans around the world, in many ways, is an ideal approach to deal with a supply chain environment that is so broadly disrupted, and where new things pop up every day. And so, could we have shipped a little bit more in certain cases? I\u2019m sure we probably could have. Did it cost us money? In many cases, I\u2019m sure it did. To put a number on that is not easy for us to do. But I can tell you that it\u2019s more than zero. And I think, for sure, the cost of the supply chain, whether that\u2019s freight and logistics, whether that\u2019s the cost of commodities, the availability of certain things, a lot of stuff went on over the course of this quarter. There was floods in Germany. There were challenges with various countries. There were some COVID-related things that were happening in particular in places like Southeast Asia. So our general managers, all 125 of them, each of them had to deal with a unique set of challenges. And they had to tailor make their approach to exactly what they were facing. It wasn\u2019t that we had to sort of process all of this in this sort of corporate wayback machine, and then issue a bunch of edicts to say, here\u2019s what we should do. It was really dealt with on an individual case-by-case basis in the moment. And that kind of moment-by-moment management, it is a real premium in a time like this. And, as it relates to your second question or the second part of your question, for sure, if we are satisfying the needs of our customers, better than our competitors are doing in a time when they need us the most, when they have robust demand from their customers, when they\u2019re facing a much broader array of supply chain challenges, because fortunate for us, we don\u2019t buy a ton of semiconductors. We buy a little bit here and there. But we have a lot of customers who are facing really existential kind of shortages in certain semiconductors. And when we can help them, for example, they\u2019re redesigning a system to change a chip that they can\u2019t get support of. They\u2019re redesigning that. And all of a sudden, that redesign requires them to completely redesign an interconnect system. Our team does it. In one case, we did this in 5 days. A customer came to us, said they had to totally change the design of their system. Otherwise, they wouldn\u2019t have a chip for a year. They redesigned it. Our team went, completely redesigned the system, 5 days later, sent them samples. And they came to us with big orders thereafter. So those are the kind of situations that are popping up more and more. And I think long-term customers don\u2019t forget if you were there for them when they needed you the most.\nOperator: Thank you. Now, our next question is from Jim Suva of Citigroup Investment Research. Sir, your line is now open.\nJim Suva: Thank you, and congratulations to you and your team for all the hard work during the challenging times. I wanted to ask a question kind of on raw material and input costs. And, of course, we\u2019ve seen them all kind of skyrocket. Does that mean your sales people need to be more active or change terms or do you have like indexing into your contracts when raw materials go up a lot? I assume some of your contracts are very long-term in nature or do you hedge it out with some financial instruments? I\u2019m just kind of curious, because it\u2019s pretty unprecedented that copper, steel or aluminum, resins and costs have recently been moving a lot. Thank you so much.\nAdam Norwitt: Well, thank you so much, Jim. And no doubt about it. I mean, there are certain dynamics, which one could call unprecedented. And I think, amidst that unprecedented inflationary environment on certain commodities, we were able to deliver exactly 20% adjusted operating margins here in the quarter, which I think is a testament to the hard work of our team around the world. Each of whom is facing a different set of challenges. But no doubt about it, if you\u2019re a general manager in Amphenol, we don\u2019t tie their hands, and say, you\u2019re only in charge of this or you\u2019re only in charge of that. They have every lever to pull in order to ultimately meet their obligations to reach their performance objective. And so, that means when all of your input prices have gone up, you\u2019re going to figure a way out of that. And sometimes when they go up very quickly, that makes it hard, and no doubt about it. We\u2019ve seen relatively quick increases in a lot of different input costs. And again, not just commodities, but also the cost of freight and other logistics. And that sometimes there can be a little bit of a delay, if that comes in so fast. But by and large, our interactions with customers, the sort of contracts or programs that we have with them, generally, they\u2019re not indexed. And as you know, we generally don\u2019t hedge either. And the reason we don\u2019t hedge is because then you are kind of detached from the reality of the moment when you want to have discussions with customers. And those discussions with customers, for sure, are ongoing, because when you have such significant increases in the input costs, we\u2019re going to do everything in our power to offset those costs with our own management, redesigning the products, changing suppliers, pitting our suppliers against each other, reducing overhead, reducing every aspect. But sometimes there is only the option to pass that price, that cost increase onto your customer. We do that very thoughtfully. Every market is a little bit different, how that works. But our customers know that we don\u2019t do that lightly. We don\u2019t take that initiative lightly. But ultimately, you sometimes do have to pass the price on. And I can tell you, our sales teams around the world, together with our operating teams, they\u2019re working hand in hand, to make sure that we\u2019ve done everything possible before we go into a customer and ask for them to share in the pain of these increases. But when you have such severe and sudden increases, ultimately, then the pricing does become very important. And I think our team is working that. It\u2019s hard work. There\u2019s no doubt about it. But I think our teams is making really good progress in that front. And again, it\u2019s very market dependent. It\u2019s very region dependent. But there\u2019s no one I would want more than a general manager who knows her business front to back, to be the one who sits in front of a customer and decides is this now the right moment to ask that customer to share in the challenges that we\u2019re facing.\nOperator: Thank you. Now, our next question is from Mark Delaney from Goldman Sachs. Sir, your line is now open.\nMark Delaney: Yes, good afternoon, and thanks for taking the question. I was hoping to talk about MTS and perhaps you can share some of your early impressions of the company and what opportunities you may be seeing to not only sell the MTS centers on a standalone basis, but combine it into full solutions or something or other product lines. And, on a related note with MTS, Craig, I think you said the margins are still below corporate average. Maybe talk about when you see that getting back in line with the Amphenol average. Thank you.\nAdam Norwitt: Well, thanks so much, Mark. I\u2019ll let Craig talk about the margins in a second. But I can just tell you, our early impressions of the company are very, very positive. I mean, we said and I think I mentioned last quarter, that MTS, the Sensors business is run by a team that we know well. And in particular, the person leading that organization is just a phenomenal, phenomenal leader who has an extraordinary organization underneath him. And the way that they have embraced being part of Amphenol is just truly rewarding for all of us in the company. We\u2019ve known them for a long time. This was not a new acquaintance that we made through this process, but rather we\u2019ve known them all the way back to when they were part of a family-owned company that ultimately MTS acquired. Our customers have received this extremely well. We\u2019ve become more important to customers across the markets, whether that be industrial, military, commercial air and automotive. I continue to be just amazed by the uniqueness and the depth of the technology that we acquired in this business, force, vibration, sensors, pressure sensors, position, just a variety of products that really operate at the harshest of environments and with the highest of performance. In terms of being able to sell more complete solutions, I can tell you that there\u2019s already early activities, real collaborative activities ongoing across the company, with people within our interconnect businesses, working together, getting to know the MTS Sensors organization, creating the sort of fiber of the relationships that ultimately can lead long-term to really collaborative success in the various markets that we serve. So all early returns for MTS, including their absolute performance, which is coming out a little bit better than we had thought in the quarter. All early returns are favorable. And I\u2019ll let Craig maybe comment specifically on the margin.\nCraig Lampo: Yeah, Mark, thanks for the question on the margin. As you mentioned, I did, I have mentioned in the past that there, mid-teens profitability when we acquired them. As Adam mentioned, we were just really happy with the progress they\u2019ve made, and kind of all aspects honestly of the business. From a profitability perspective, we always say that profit ultimately is really just the byproduct of the value that you bring to kind of your customers, and there\u2019s no doubt that this company brings a lot of value to all their customers, and we believe that there\u2019s plenty of opportunity throughout the business to be able to increase that profitability in the business. I will tell you that even in the second quarter, I say, we have seen green shoots, I guess of progress in that area. The time it will take ultimately to get them to that company average or beyond is certainly, will be told in the future here on that, and we\u2019re not necessarily going to try to estimate that at this time vis-\u00e0-vis every acquisition is different. And the task that need to happen differentiating amount of time. But I would tell you that the \u2013 second quarter here, the first quarter that we\u2019ve had them. As part of Amphenol, we\u2019ve certainly seen some progress in that area, and certainly areas of opportunity in the future. And I would say that we\u2019re even more optimistic, and we were optimistic in early on that that they will be able to ultimately get to that target that we have for them to be at the company average, and hopefully beyond in the future.\nOperator: Thank you. Now, our next question is from William Stein from Truist.\nElliot Smith: Hi. This is Elliot Smith on for Will. I wanted to ask about the mobile devices end market. I know it can be quite volatile quarter-to-quarter. But can you speak to what you are seeing now and potentially over the next several quarters in terms of the end market content trajectory and potential growth?\nAdam Norwitt: So thanks very much, Elliot. I think you correctly termed that it is a very volatile market on a quarter-to-quarter basis. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, are year-over-year \u2013 the year-over-year performance in the market was significantly impacted by the strength that we had a year-ago in the second quarter, which was really a catch up from the significant COVID impacts that we saw in the first quarter of 2020. This is not a market I\u2019d like to get out ahead of my skis on in terms of several quarters out and giving a prognosis. But what I can say is that our position in the mobile market is an extremely strong position, we continue to have a unique ability to react quickly to customers when they need us the most. And that includes sometimes when our competitors aren\u2019t able to support the customers, in particular, when they\u2019re launching new products. Our guidance for the third quarter being up about 25% or so on a quarter-to-quarter basis is a strong outlook. And I think not inconsistent, if you look over a long time period with a kind of second quarter to third quarter trajectory. What it will be in the quarters thereafter, again, I\u2019m not going to get ahead of my skis and giving a prognosis on mobile devices over the long-term. But the content opportunity, as you say, there\u2019s no reason to think that the content opportunity with these devices as they become more complicated as they have different feature sets, as they support different types of communication standards in them. Those have usually been in the past strong drivers of content in mobile devices and we have no reason to believe that that would change in the future.\nOperator: Thank you. Now our next question is from Joe Giordano from Cowen. Sir, your line is now open.\nJoseph Giordano: Can you guys hear me?\nAdam Norwitt: Yes. Hi, Joe.\nJoseph Giordano: Hey, good afternoon, guys. Just curious on IT-Datacom, I mean, you guys came in so much stronger than your initial view last quarter. Just curious, how would you categorize that from like within market dynamics, just the overall spending in the industry was significantly better, where you guys picking up specific share anywhere? How would you categorize that outperformance relative to your initial view?\nAdam Norwitt: Joe, I guess, it\u2019s a combination of sort of all the above, and our team continues to do a phenomenal job in IT-Datacom, in particular, a phenomenal job enabling web service providers whose spending and we can call them web service providers like either you can call them cloud providers or whatever. And the fact is the service providers who are making meaningful and very meaningful investments in high speed data processing in order to enable the explosion of traffic that all of them are seeing. And our team has just done an amazing job of reacting to that increase in demand. And we did that over the course of the last year, when it was even more critical. And we talked about this several times last year that our growth in IT-Datacom over the course of 2020. I think growing close to 50%, for example, sequentially in the second quarter, and reacting to this the literal explosion of data traffic resulting from all the video meetings and remote work and remote school and all of that. We made a lot of good friends in that market by stepping up and really enabling our customers when they needed us the most. At the same time, if anything we\u2019ve seen an acceleration in new product development, as our customers look to really push the limits of the bandwidth of their systems. And that involves new interconnect solutions that ultimately can enable that high speed, it involves new power solutions that can help the efficiency and there\u2019s so many dynamics that are going on across IT-Datacom all of which converge on the need for higher performance interconnect products. And whether that\u2019s web service providers and video over the internet, whether that\u2019s even like cryptocurrency and the processor power that\u2019s being used in support of the crypto market. I mean, these are all things that are just driving extraordinary demand for high speed and high efficiency, high speed interconnect and high efficiency power interconnect. And I can just tell you, our team working in both of those areas, has done a bang-up job to react to this to scale our capacity quickly in the face of really unexpected levels of demand. And this quarter was another example of that we certainly did not expect a 20% sequential growth, I think, we came into the quarter thinking kind of mid-single-digits and that that requires you to perform on that it requires you to have enough people and machines and automation and tooling and factory floor space and ready source of materials. And I think our team just did a great job of reacting in the moment here.\nOperator: Thank you. Now, our next question is from Chris Snyder of UBS. Sir, your line is now open.\nChris Snyder: Thank you. So industrial and auto have seen a pretty massive inflection in end market outgrowth over the last year or so. It sounds like there\u2019s not been much or if any supply chain talents here. So is this outgrowth in collection, it\u2019s driven by share gains or just an acceleration in the electronics revolution, so to speak. And if so, would we expect a structurally higher level of end market outgrowth relative to what we were seeing in the years leading up to COVID?\nAdam Norwitt: Yeah, I mean, look I don\u2019t know how it\u2019s going to look in the future, but for sure, over the course of the last year, and we shouldn\u2019t forget Q2 of last year was almost the nuclear winter for the automotive industry. But over the last year, our team working in industrial, working in automotive has clearly done an outstanding job of supporting customers when they needed us the most, and in certain cases doing that because some competitors could not rise to the occasion. So I think that there has been for us some outperformance relative to the industry. I think as well, we clearly have seen an acceleration of the adoption of electronics across the automotive industry, across the many, many segments of the industrial market, this kind of electronification of everything, if you will. And, it\u2019s not just EVs and it\u2019s not just batteries for those EVs. We\u2019re really seeing so many examples of traditionally mechanical fuel based hydraulic, converting to an electronic control, electronic functionality. And each time that happens, that\u2019s a new inflection point whereby if we can step in with the right types of interconnect products, the right types of sensors, leading edge products, if we can do that in a timely fashion, we can have it available for the customers when they need it, when they\u2019re seeing also an increase in their end demand that positions us very well. And so, I think, all of the factors that you mentioned have all come together in a very positive fashion to ultimately lead to us having the growth that we realized this quarter, as well as the positive outlook that we see in the third quarter, and I would hope also beyond. What does that mean for the long-term? Typically, the adoption of electronics is a one-way ratchet. It\u2019s not that people adopt a new electronic system, and then one-day go back to a mechanical system. That\u2019s not really how the evolution of electronics operates. And so, I think, long-term, it gives me some encouragement to see that there has been an acceleration and that kind of step function adoption of electronics, you would hope would continue to create the opportunities for the long-term.\nOperator: Thank you. Now our next question is from David Kelley from Jefferies. Sir, your line is now open.\nDavid Kelley: Hi, good afternoon, Adam and Craig. I always ask the automotive question, but the organic growth really stands out. So you referenced electrification as a driver, we\u2019re seeing EV auto sales really start to inflect and actually reach some scale now. Is there any way to quantify the contribution for you and then even taken a step back just more broadly in autos. Just curious, if you\u2019re seeing any customers start to build some inventories? You reference the below dealer inventory levels, so with some planning for the medium-term, just curious if you\u2019re seeing that in the market?\nAdam Norwitt: Yeah, I mean, look, I think the organic growth was pretty special, David. So I don\u2019t blame you for asking another automotive question. Again, I always say you can teach the master class here on automotive. But, yeah, 117% organic growth albeit to a quarter that was a pretty rough quarter a year-ago, but still it was really a very, very special performance. And our automotive team is very proud and justifiably proud of what they were able to achieve. I relative to the contribution of EV, I can tell you that, if you can imagine that the growth of EV was substantially higher than the growth that I just mentioned of that 117%. And without giving a specific amount of the total of our EV business, it\u2019s bigger than it used to be, and it\u2019s meaningful. It\u2019s a meaningful business. It clearly is an area of success for the company. And it\u2019s one that we look forward to realizing the benefits for many years to come. Relative to inventory, I would actually say that what we\u2019ve seen more of in the automotive market than stockpiling of inventory is we\u2019ve seen customers not wanting to take our product, because they all of a sudden can\u2019t get the appropriate semiconductor to finish the vehicle. And so we\u2019ve seen more, what I would call, push out of deliveries, as opposed to customers just throwing a bunch of stuff in their warehouses, now could there be some buildup of component inventory in certain places, there could be and we may not see it perfectly. But what we have seen for sure, and that went through the course of the quarter, is customers saying, well, we\u2019re going to have to shut down our factory for a couple of weeks. And that\u2019s we don\u2019t need your stuff right now. And we\u2019ve had to react quickly to that and that\u2019s actually meant that for us. We ended up with may be a little bit more of our own finished goods, a little bit more of our own work in progress than we would have liked in the course of the quarter. And still with that, we were able to achieve that 117% organic growth. So I don\u2019t know that there\u2019s a big build up, there could be pockets of it, but the more obvious thing that we saw with the quarter where these push outs from customers, who couldn\u2019t get matching components to make the car.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is from Joseph Spak from RBC Capital Markets. Sir, your line is now open.\nJoseph Spak: Thank you. I too I\u2019m going to follow up on automotive, sorry. So it doesn\u2019t sound like you think inventory is a big issue, it did sound like you maybe took a little bit of share, and obviously it is helping. And I know even when compared to global production, your geographic exposure probably helped you a little bit, because of the larger recovery in North America and Europe. I guess, what I\u2019m \u2013 the other factor, I\u2019m wondering about is, is there a material content per vehicle difference between, let\u2019s call it, high value vehicles like a full-size truck and the lower value vehicle, because that can obviously also help and as we started thinking about next year maybe some of the volume recoveries more in those lower volume vehicles?\nAdam Norwitt: Yeah, well, Joe, again, no problem to get another auto question. I should say that you and David could probably co-teach the master class together. But look one maybe thing I would mention, you alluded to regional in automotive, and actually we saw really strong performance across all of the regions where we operate. And I would tell you actually that our business now regionally is more balanced than ever before is roughly equal size between Asia and Europe, and just to tick lower in North America. So that\u2019s quite a transformation. If you think about it over a decade, when at one point, our business was kind of two-thirds in Europe, and maybe a fifth in North America and the rest in Asia. So we\u2019ve made really great progress in Asia. And I would also say that in Asia, we\u2019ve made great progress also in the electrification in EVs, where our teams just done a fabulous job. Relative to your question do luxury cars have more content, for example, than a lower end car? I think the answer to that is absolutely, yes. That\u2019s always been the case, I think that will always be the case. But what are the differences that we have seen, and that\u2019s not just the difference of this year or last year, but maybe over the last kind of half a decade or so. As we have seen that more and more automakers are equipping their lower end cars with a greater degree of electronic functionality than they did in the past. The traditional approach for automakers to just stop their high-end cars with every possible feature to test out electronics in those cars to put the newest thing there first, and then maybe it would trickle down to the low-end more fleet-type cars, or maybe it wouldn\u2019t. But I tell you, you get any car of any size now and it\u2019s going to have features in it that you never would have imagined before even in like the smallest kind of Fiat 500 or something like that. You\u2019re going to see just a real array of electronics functionality. So, for sure, $100,000 car is always going to have more content as a $30,000 car. But I don\u2019t know that the intensity of electronics in that $100,000 is so many multiples more than it is on that maybe $30,000 car, in the past that would have been quite a different intensity of the electronic value in the car. So what does that mean for long-term? Our companies selling more high value trucks and luxury cars today, and maybe they\u2019ll sell more low value cars in the future that that I don\u2019t have a good read on, but I think there\u2019s electronics opportunities across all these types of cars.\nOperator: Thank you. Now our next question is from Samik Chatterjee from JPMorgan. Sir, your line is now open.\nSamik Chatterjee: Hi, thank you, and good afternoon, Adam and Craig. I guess, I have a more quick one, just trying to get a better handle on the difference between orders and your revenue guide for the next quarter. I mean, when I look at the difference now it\u2019s about $400 million last quarter, I think when you guided the difference was about $300 million. So just kind of wondering, is that more of a supply concern and securing supply? Or are you getting orders with longer lead times from your customers just kind of getting trying to get a better handle of what you\u2019re trying to bake in there, and if it\u2019s conservative at all. And then, I think in conjunction with that, I think one thing that I wanted to understand is broadly across your businesses. If you\u2019re just kind of feeling that the supply constraints are getting tougher, or are they getting easier to navigate at this point? Thank you.\nAdam Norwitt: Thanks, Samik. Well, first, I guess, maybe we have a little bit different numbers in automotive then what you mentioned, I think our automotive business at a 20% of sales that works out more than $0.5 billion in the quarter. And with the guidance that I\u2019ve given, it wouldn\u2019t be so dissimilar in the third quarter. So I\u2019m not sure the numbers that you referred to. Relative to supply constraints, are they getting better, worse, staying the same? I don\u2019t know. I guess, it feels about the same. I wouldn\u2019t say that it feels that much worse. And there are a few things that maybe do feel a little bit worse, like freight. The cost of freight is not that great. So the price of a container from Asia to the U.S. and, it\u2019s not that that\u2019s a huge impact on us. But once in a while you do that or your customer does that. And those have gotten quite a bit more expensive over the recent times, even just the availability of that. There\u2019s also been a few sorts of funky things that have happened, like there were some floods in Germany, which are really tragic. And we feel for the people of Germany that suffered through these, just sudden catastrophic floods. And there\u2019s a \u2013 Germany has a pretty decent sized electronics supply chain of vendors and various things like that. And we\u2019ve seen a disruption or two there. I talked about the COVID-related restrictions that are happening a little bit in Southeast Asia. So I don\u2019t know that I would say it\u2019s getting easier. That\u2019s for sure.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is from Luke Junk from Baird. Sir, your line is now open.\nLuke Junk: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I had a big picture question this afternoon. And it\u2019s about the competitive landscape in your auto business. As we move into what\u2019s increasingly an EV world, you\u2019ve made, if we look over the last 10, 20 years great inroads growing in auto in what has been a combustion world, of course, where there are a lot of incumbent players. In a world where there are no true incumbents with respect to EV powertrains, how has that changed the competitive landscape for Amphenol, both in terms of your view of the opportunity set, and ultimately, how aggressively you pursue that business?\nAdam Norwitt: Well, I mean, the last part of your question I\u2019ll answer first, which is I think we\u2019ve pursued this business very aggressively over a long time period. We shouldn\u2019t forget that the whole concept of a high-voltage system in a car is not new. In fact, our teams have been working on development of specific automotive capable high-voltage interconnect systems for, I don\u2019t know, the whole time I\u2019ve been CEO. And I\u2019ve been CEO for nearly 13 years now. So I think that\u2019s not a new development. I don\u2019t think EVs are a new thing, hybrids aren\u2019t a new thing. But they\u2019re growing. And I think they\u2019re reaching \u2013 I don\u2019t know if you want to call it an inflection point. Someone mentioned that term earlier. But for sure, the adoption of these vehicles is accelerating on a global basis, even if they still represent a relatively modest proportion of the overall vehicle market. I mean, the vast majority of cars sold today are still combustion engine cars. But to your point, we have I think in EVs a proposition maybe that we didn\u2019t have in traditional automotive, which is that we\u2019ve been making high-voltage connectors for a very, very long time. I mean, if you think about the legacy of Amphenol over the nearly 9 decades that our company has been in business, we were early on a leader in the innovation and development of power interconnect that\u2019s used in military, aerospace, industrial applications. And that came with unique proprietary technologies, in particular around the efficient and safe transmission of high-voltage power across an interconnect system that requires a very unique contact technology that we have developed over many, many years. And so, early on, and when I say early on, this is a dozen years ago or more when we were really working early on in these hybrid electric vehicles, we were already repackaging our high-voltage interconnect technologies from the military and industrial into a more of an automotive type interconnect interface and otherwise. And so, that gave us a very strong position. So it\u2019s not new to us to be making high-voltage products. And to the extent that there are more traditional incumbents who are pure automotive companies, who may not have had that rich legacy of high-power, high-voltage interconnect, we could, on occasion, have an advantage. Granted they have an advantage with the breadth that they work in that market. So it\u2019s not that this is a kind of a clear path to world domination in the EV market. I mean, we have a lot of competition and we respect them a great deal. But if anything, I think our outperformance in automotive over many years, and in particular, over the recent years, there has been a not insignificant component of that, which has been us realizing the benefits of our position in high-voltage products.\nOperator: Excuse me, participants. Thank you for holding and sorry about the technical issue. We now have Mr. Craig Lampo online.\nAdam Norwitt: Hello, operator, do we have any more questions, please?\nOperator: Thank you for that, Mr. Lampo. As of now, we don\u2019t have any questions on queue. I will turn it back on to Amphenol for any closing remarks.\nAdam Norwitt: Okay. Well, thank you very much. And we apologize everybody. There appears to have been a communications issue with the provider here. And we apologize if anybody did not, was not able to have their questions answered. Of course, you can feel free to reach out to our Investor Relations team, to Craig and Sherri. But let me just take this moment to thank all of you again for your time here in this summer and we\u2019re very proud again of the company\u2019s results over the course of this second quarter. And we look forward to finishing the second half, also in the third quarter strongly as we go into 2021. And I want to take this opportunity also to wish each of you that you have a little bit of rest as the summer continues and come back recharged when we talk to each other 90 days from now. Thank you all so much and we\u2019ll talk to you soon.\nCraig Lampo: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for attending today\u2019s conference call, and have a nice day.",

            "name": "Craig Lampo",
            "content": "Thank you very much. Good afternoon, everyone. This is Craig Lampo, Amphenol\u2019s CFO. And I\u2019m here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO. We would like to welcome you to our second quarter 2021 conference call. Our second quarter 2021 results were released this morning. I will provide some financial commentary, and then, Adam will give an overview of the business as well as current trends. And then we\u2019ll take some questions. As a reminder, during the call, we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures and may make certain forward-looking statements. So please refer to the relevant disclosures in our press release for further information. In addition, all data discussed during this call will be on a continuing-operations basis unless otherwise noted. The company closed the second quarter with record sales of $2.654 billion, and GAAP and adjusted diluted EPS of $0.59 and $0.61 respectively. Sales were up 34% in U.S. dollars, 30% in local currencies and 22% organically compared to the second quarter of 2020. Sequentially, sales were up 12% in U.S. dollars and in local currencies, and 7% organically. Orders for the quarter were a record $3.120 billion, which was up 50% compared to the second quarter of 2020, and up 14% sequentially, resulting in a very strong book-to-bill ratio of 1.18 to 1. Breaking down sales into our 2 segments, the interconnect segment, which comprise 96% of our sales, was up 34% in U.S. dollars, and 30% in local currencies compared to the second quarter of last year. Our cable segment, which comprise 4% of our sales was up 27% in U.S. dollars and 24% local currencies compared to the second quarter of last year. Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes. GAAP and adjusted operating income were $476 million and $532 million respectively in the second quarter of 2021. GAAP operating income includes $55 million of transactions, severance, restructuring and certain other non-cash costs related to the MTS acquisition. And the company also incurred $34 million related to the extinguishment of outstanding MTS senior notes. That in accordance with GAAP was recorded as an increase to goodwill in the second quarter, and therefore, had no impact on the second quarter earnings. Excluding these acquisition-related costs, adjusted operating margin was 20%, which increased by strong 200 basis points compared to the second quarter of last year and increased by 40 basis points sequentially. The year-over-year improvement in adjusted operating margin was primarily driven by normal operating leverage on the higher sales volumes and a lower cost impact from the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by the impact of the challenging commodity and supply chain environment that we experienced in this year\u2019s quarter. The sequential increase in adjusted operating margin was driven by the normal conversion on the increased sales levels, partially offset by the impact of MTS Sensors business, which is currently operating below the company\u2019s average operating margin. From a segment standpoint, in the interconnect segment margins were 22% in the second quarter of 2021, which increased from 20% in the second quarter of 2020 and increased 50 basis points sequentially. In the cable segment, margins were 6.1%, which decreased from 9.4% in the second quarter of 2020 and 8.8% in the first quarter. These lower margins in the cable segment are directly related to the rapid increases in the prices of certain commodity and logistics costs, which we have not yet been able to offset with pricing actions. Given the dynamic market environment, we are very proud of the company\u2019s performance. Our team\u2019s ability to effectively manage through the current market challenges is a direct result of the strength and commitment of the company\u2019s entrepreneurial management team, which continues to foster high-performance action-oriented culture. The company\u2019s GAAP effective tax rate for the second quarter was 17.5%, which compare to 20.7% in the second quarter of 2020. On an adjusted basis, this effective tax rate was 24.5% in the second quarter of both 2021 and 2020. GAAP diluted EPS was $0.59, an increase of 40% compared to the $0.42 in the prior year period. And adjusted diluted EPS was a record $0.61, an increase of 53% compared to $0.40 in the second quarter of 2020. The company continues to be an excellent generator of cash. Operating cash flow was $411 million in the second quarter, or 109% of adjusted net income. And net of capital spending, our free cash flow was $307 million or 81% of adjusted net income. From a working capital standpoint, inventory days, days sales outstanding, and payable days were 85, 71 and 60 days respectively, all excluding the impact of acquisitions in the quarter and within our normal range. During the quarter, the company repurchased 2.5 million shares of common stock for approximately $167 million, at an average price of approximately $67. At the end of the quarter, total debt was $5.2 billion and net debt was $4 billion. Total liquidity at the end of the quarter was $2.3 billion, which included cash and short-term investments on hand of $1.2 billion, plus availability under our existing credit facilities. Second quarter 2021 GAAP EBITDA was $597 million, and our net leverage ratio was 1.6 times. On a pro forma basis, after giving effect to the sale of MTS Test & Simulation business, net leverage at June 30, 2021 would have been 1.3 times. As previously discussed, due to the pending sale of the MTS Test & Simulation business, that business is being reported as a discontinued operation, and therefore, it\u2019s expected results are excluded from our Q3 guidance. In addition, in conjunction with the divestiture of the Test & Simulation business, the company will incur certain additional cash tax related another acquisition related cost in the third quarter, which will not be included in income from continuing operation, and therefore are not included in our guidance. I will now turn the call over to Adam, who will provide some commentary on current market trends. Yeah, Mark, thanks for the question on the margin. As you mentioned, I did, I have mentioned in the past that there, mid-teens profitability when we acquired them. As Adam mentioned, we were just really happy with the progress they\u2019ve made, and kind of all aspects honestly of the business. From a profitability perspective, we always say that profit ultimately is really just the byproduct of the value that you bring to kind of your customers, and there\u2019s no doubt that this company brings a lot of value to all their customers, and we believe that there\u2019s plenty of opportunity throughout the business to be able to increase that profitability in the business. I will tell you that even in the second quarter, I say, we have seen green shoots, I guess of progress in that area. The time it will take ultimately to get them to that company average or beyond is certainly, will be told in the future here on that, and we\u2019re not necessarily going to try to estimate that at this time vis-\u00e0-vis every acquisition is different. And the task that need to happen differentiating amount of time. But I would tell you that the \u2013 second quarter here, the first quarter that we\u2019ve had them. As part of Amphenol, we\u2019ve certainly seen some progress in that area, and certainly areas of opportunity in the future. And I would say that we\u2019re even more optimistic, and we were optimistic in early on that that they will be able to ultimately get to that target that we have for them to be at the company average, and hopefully beyond in the future. Thank you."

            "name": "Adam Norwitt",
            "content": "Well, thank you very much, Craig. And I\u2019d like to extend my welcome to all of you here on the call today. And I hope that you, your family, friends and colleagues continue to stay safe and healthy and indeed are able to enjoy the summer so far. As Craig mentioned, I\u2019m going to highlight some of our achievements in the second quarter. I\u2019ll then get into a discussion of the trends, and our trends and progress across our served markets. I\u2019ll make some commentary on our outlook for the third quarter. And then, of course, we\u2019ll have time for questions at the end. Our results in the second quarter were substantially better than expected, as we exceeded the high-end of our guidance and sales and adjusted diluted earnings per share. Craig already mentioned our sales grow very strong 34% in U.S. dollars and 30% in local currency is reaching a new record of $2.654 billion. On an organic basis, our sales increased by 22% with growth driven in particular by the automotive, military, industrial and broadband markets, as well as contributions from the company\u2019s acquisition program. We\u2019re very pleased to book record orders in the quarter of $3.120 billion, and that represented a very strong book-to-bill of 1.18 to 1. Despite facing operational challenges in certain geographies related to the ongoing pandemic as well as continued increases in costs related to commodities and supply chain pressures. We were very pleased to deliver very strong adjusted operating margins of 20.0% in the quarter. This was a 200 basis point increase from last year\u2019s levels, and a 40 basis point improvement sequentially. Adjusted diluted EPS grew very significant 53% from prior year to another new record of $0.61 and just an outstanding reflection of our continued strong execution. And then, finally, the company generated operating and free cash flow of $411 million and $307 million respectively in the second quarter. I just can\u2019t emphasize enough how proud I am of our organization around the world. These results once again reflect the discipline and agility of our entrepreneurial organization. As we have continued to perform well amidst, what is a very dynamic and challenging environment? Very pleased that in the quarter we closed on the acquisition of Unlimited Services. Unlimited based in Oconto, Wisconsin, but also with operations in Mexico and has annual sales of approximately $50 million. This is a great manufacturer of cable assemblies for the industrial market primarily, with a particular focus on heavy vehicles. The addition of unlimited broadens our already strong position in value-add interconnect products that are integrated into a wide array of industrial applications. As we welcome this outstanding new team to Amphenol, I remain very confident that our acquisition program will continue to create great value for the company. In fact, our ability to identify and execute upon acquisitions, and then to successfully bring these new companies into Amphenol remains a core competitive advantage for the company. Now turning to our served markets, I just would comment once again, how pleased we are that the company is broad and balanced, and market diversification continues to create real value for us. We believe that ultimately, this diversification mitigates the impact of the volatility of individual end markets, while also giving us broad exposure to leading technologies and the innovations of those technologies, wherever they may arise across the broad scope of the electronics industry. Turning to the military market, the military market represented 11% of our sales in the quarter. And as expected sales grew a strong 45% from the COVID impacted prior year second quarter, and were up 30% organically and this was really driven by broad strength across virtually all segments of the military market. On a sequential basis, sales increased by 12%, also very strong. As we look into the third quarter, we remains \u2013 we expect sales to remain at these current elevated levels. And we continue to be very excited by the strength of our position in the military market. And that position is really based upon our industry leading breadth of high technology interconnect and now sensor products. Together with our support of essentially all major military programs, this gives us great confidence for our long-term performance in this important area. The commercial air market represented 2% of our sales in the quarter. Sales grew by 7% versus prior year really with the benefit of the contributions of our recent acquisitions. On an organic basis, sales were declined \u2013 were down by about 14%, as the commercial aircraft market continued to experience declines in demand for new aircraft production. Sequentially, however, our sales did increase by better than expected 19%. And that\u2019s really from the benefit of the MTS acquisition as well as some organic progress. As we look ahead, we expect a slight seasonal moderation in sales in the third quarter, which we would typically see in commercial air. And regardless of the ongoing difficult environment, our team working in this commercial aerospace market remains committed to leveraging the company\u2019s strong interconnect and sensor technology position across a wide array of aircraft platforms and next generation systems that are integrated into those planes. As personal and business travel continues to recover from the pandemic, we look forward to jet manufacturers beginning to expand their production levels. The industrial market represented 27% of our sales in the quarter, and our performance in the second quarter and industrial was really much stronger than expected with sales increasing by 54% in U.S. dollars and 28% organically. This growth was broad-based across most areas of the worldwide industrial market, and was driven in particular by organic strength in the transportation, battery and heavy electric vehicle, marine and energy generation segments, together with the contributions from our acquisitions that have been completed over the past year. On a sequential basis, sales increased by very strong 26% from the first quarter, really with the benefit of acquisitions as well as strong organic performance. Looking into the third quarter, we expect sales to remain at these elevated levels, despite what would typically be a seasonally lower quarter. I can\u2019t say enough how proud I am of our team working in the industrial market. And we\u2019ve had a long-term strategy to expand our high technology, interconnect, antenna and sensor offering both organically as well as through complementary acquisitions. And that strategy has positioned us strongly with industrial customers around the world, who are accelerating their adoption of electronics. The acquisition of Unlimited Services further bolsters our leading value-add capabilities in this important market and we look forward to realizing the benefits of this strategy for many years to come. The Automotive market represented 20% of our sales in the quarter. And I just say that sales were higher than our expectations, probably a very strong 134% in U.S. dollars and 117% organically, as our team was able to execute strongly in the face of a robust and broad recovery in the automotive market. In particular, we once again drove very strong growth of our products used in electric \u2013 hybrid electric vehicles this quarter, which confirms again for us our global team\u2019s long-term efforts at designing in high voltage and other interconnect and sensor products into these important next generation platforms. Despite an increase in production disruptions among our automotive customers, due to the widely reported global supply chain issues, we were able to achieve a small sequential increase in our sales, which was a bit better than we had expected coming into the quarter. No doubt about it, though, there continued to be a range of widely reported supply chain challenges that that are rising within the automotive industry and this is impacting overall demand from vehicle manufacturers around the world. Accordingly, as we look towards the third quarter, we do expect a modest sequential decline in our sales. I remain extremely proud of our team working in the automotive market. They continue to demonstrate a high degree of agility and resiliency in both driving a significant recovery from last year as reduced production levels. While expertly navigating the myriad of supply chain challenges that the entire automotive industry is still facing. We look forward to benefiting from their efforts long into the future. Turning to the mobile devices market, that market represented 10% of our sales in the quarter. Our sales to customers in the mobile devices market declined from prior year by 4% in U.S. dollars and 6% organically, as declines in handsets and laptops more than offset growth in wearables. And I would just remind you that our last year second quarter did include a significant sequential recovery and really a catch up from the COVID impacted first quarter of 2020, which made the comparison versus prior year a little more challenging. Sequentially, our sales felt by 6% from the first quarter, which was modestly better than our expectations. Looking to the third quarter, we now expect an approximately 25% increase in sales from these second quarter levels as we benefit from the seasonally typical higher demand in the mobile device market as customers launch a range of new products. While mobile devices remains the most volatile of Amphenol end markets, our outstanding and agile team is poised as always to capture any opportunities for incremental sales that may arise in the second half of 2021 and beyond. Our leading array of antennas, interconnect products and mechanisms continues to enable a broad range of next generation mobile devices, thereby positioning us well for the long-term in this exciting market. The mobile networks market represented 5% of our sales in the quarter. Sales were flat to prior year and down 4% organically. The sales to both OEMs and the wireless service providers moderated. On a sequential basis, however, our sales increased by 5% compared to the first quarter, which was in line with our expectations coming into the second quarter. And as we look towards the third quarter, we expect a further increase in sales as mobile networks customers ramp up their investments in next generation networks. Our team around the world continues to work aggressively to realize the benefits of our efforts at expanding our position in such next generation networks and the equipment that populates them around the world. And as customers ramp up these investments of such advanced systems, we look forward to benefiting from the increased potential that comes from our unique position with both equipment manufacturers and mobile service providers. The information technology and data communications market increased by 21% in the second quarter. Sales in the second quarter rose by 5% in U.S. dollars and 3% organically from the very significant levels in last year\u2019s second quarter. Our strength this quarter was driven in particular by robust sales to web service providers, which was partially offset by some weakness in sales to network equipment OEMs. Sequentially, our sales grew a very strong 20% from the first quarter, which significantly outperformed our original expectations. Looking now into the third quarter, we expect sales to increase modestly from these very high levels. We remain very encouraged by the company\u2019s outstanding position in the global IT data comm market. Our OEM and web service provider customers around the world continue to drive their equipment and networks to ever higher levels of performance in order to manage the continued dramatic increases in demand for bandwidth and processor power. In turn, our team is singularly focused on enabling this continuing revolution in IT data comm, with industry-leading high-speed, power, and fiber-optic interconnect products. And we look forward to realizing the benefits of our leading position for many years to come. Turning finally to the broadband market, this market represented 4% of our sales in the quarter and sales increased by 12% from prior year and were flat organically as we benefited from our recent acquisition of Cabelcon. On a sequential basis, sales increased by 7% from the first quarter, which was a bit lower than we had anticipated coming into the quarter. For the third quarter, we expect sales to moderate from current levels, as operators digest the really high levels of spending that they have exhibited over the recent quarters. And regardless of this more muted outlook, we continue to look forward to supporting our broadband service operator customers around the world, all of whom are working to increase their bandwidth to support the expansion of high-speed data applications to homes and businesses. Now, turning to our outlook, and I would just note that given the current dynamic market environment, and of course, assuming no new material disruptions from the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as constant exchange rates. In the third quarter, we expect sales in the range of $2.640 billion to $2.700 billion, and adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $0.60 to $0.62. This would represent sales growth of 14% to 16%, and adjusted diluted EPS growth of 9% to 13% compared to the third quarter of last year. I remain confident in the ability of our outstanding entrepreneurial management team to adapt to the continued challenges in the marketplace and to capitalize on the many opportunities to grow our market position and expand our profitability. I can just say that our entire organization remains committed to delivering long-term and sustainable value, all while prioritizing the continued safety and health of each of our employees around the world. And most importantly, I\u2019d like to take this opportunity to once again, thank the entire global Amphenol team for their truly outstanding efforts here in the second quarter. And with that, operator, we\u2019ll be very happy to take any questions that there may be. Thank you very much, Wamsi. I mean, we\u2019ve talked about this in the past that we don\u2019t have necessarily perfect visibility into the inventory, in particular of our OEM and service provider customers. But as far as the channel is concerned, we have not seen any real changes in the inventory levels. In fact, it appears that for the vast majority of our distributors, in particular, with respect to the industrial market, they want to ship it out as soon as we can get it to them. There\u2019s clearly a very significant end-demand across really many segments of the industrial market. And I mentioned earlier that we saw growth across virtually every segment of the industrial market, and whether that was in marine applications, in industrial batteries, in electrification of industrial vehicles, in transportation, heavy equipment, factory automation. I mean, we saw even growth in areas like oil and gas, where we haven\u2019t seen so much growth in the past. Instrumentation, where we continued to see very robust performance over a long time period. So I wouldn\u2019t say that across the industrial market we\u2019ve seen necessarily any worrisome inventory trends. I think that more broadly across the whole company, again, maybe the only area where you hear talk of inventory issues acutely is that there is not a lot of inventory of cars on lots right now. And so, I don\u2019t know what that means through the whole chain. But for sure, dealer inventories of vehicles are extremely low by any measure. And I think there is a lot of supply chain issues that are going on around the automotive industry that I\u2019m sure others will ask about, and many have spoken about and reported about. But by and large, we see inventory as relatively healthy. Yeah, well, thank you very much, Amit. Look, I mean, the current supply chain environment is certainly not for the faint of heart. And I think our agility as an organization that, that unique entrepreneurship of what we call Amphenoleans around the world, in many ways, is an ideal approach to deal with a supply chain environment that is so broadly disrupted, and where new things pop up every day. And so, could we have shipped a little bit more in certain cases? I\u2019m sure we probably could have. Did it cost us money? In many cases, I\u2019m sure it did. To put a number on that is not easy for us to do. But I can tell you that it\u2019s more than zero. And I think, for sure, the cost of the supply chain, whether that\u2019s freight and logistics, whether that\u2019s the cost of commodities, the availability of certain things, a lot of stuff went on over the course of this quarter. There was floods in Germany. There were challenges with various countries. There were some COVID-related things that were happening in particular in places like Southeast Asia. So our general managers, all 125 of them, each of them had to deal with a unique set of challenges. And they had to tailor make their approach to exactly what they were facing. It wasn\u2019t that we had to sort of process all of this in this sort of corporate wayback machine, and then issue a bunch of edicts to say, here\u2019s what we should do. It was really dealt with on an individual case-by-case basis in the moment. And that kind of moment-by-moment management, it is a real premium in a time like this. And, as it relates to your second question or the second part of your question, for sure, if we are satisfying the needs of our customers, better than our competitors are doing in a time when they need us the most, when they have robust demand from their customers, when they\u2019re facing a much broader array of supply chain challenges, because fortunate for us, we don\u2019t buy a ton of semiconductors. We buy a little bit here and there. But we have a lot of customers who are facing really existential kind of shortages in certain semiconductors. And when we can help them, for example, they\u2019re redesigning a system to change a chip that they can\u2019t get support of. They\u2019re redesigning that. And all of a sudden, that redesign requires them to completely redesign an interconnect system. Our team does it. In one case, we did this in 5 days. A customer came to us, said they had to totally change the design of their system. Otherwise, they wouldn\u2019t have a chip for a year. They redesigned it. Our team went, completely redesigned the system, 5 days later, sent them samples. And they came to us with big orders thereafter. So those are the kind of situations that are popping up more and more. And I think long-term customers don\u2019t forget if you were there for them when they needed you the most. Well, thank you so much, Jim. And no doubt about it. I mean, there are certain dynamics, which one could call unprecedented. And I think, amidst that unprecedented inflationary environment on certain commodities, we were able to deliver exactly 20% adjusted operating margins here in the quarter, which I think is a testament to the hard work of our team around the world. Each of whom is facing a different set of challenges. But no doubt about it, if you\u2019re a general manager in Amphenol, we don\u2019t tie their hands, and say, you\u2019re only in charge of this or you\u2019re only in charge of that. They have every lever to pull in order to ultimately meet their obligations to reach their performance objective. And so, that means when all of your input prices have gone up, you\u2019re going to figure a way out of that. And sometimes when they go up very quickly, that makes it hard, and no doubt about it. We\u2019ve seen relatively quick increases in a lot of different input costs. And again, not just commodities, but also the cost of freight and other logistics. And that sometimes there can be a little bit of a delay, if that comes in so fast. But by and large, our interactions with customers, the sort of contracts or programs that we have with them, generally, they\u2019re not indexed. And as you know, we generally don\u2019t hedge either. And the reason we don\u2019t hedge is because then you are kind of detached from the reality of the moment when you want to have discussions with customers. And those discussions with customers, for sure, are ongoing, because when you have such significant increases in the input costs, we\u2019re going to do everything in our power to offset those costs with our own management, redesigning the products, changing suppliers, pitting our suppliers against each other, reducing overhead, reducing every aspect. But sometimes there is only the option to pass that price, that cost increase onto your customer. We do that very thoughtfully. Every market is a little bit different, how that works. But our customers know that we don\u2019t do that lightly. We don\u2019t take that initiative lightly. But ultimately, you sometimes do have to pass the price on. And I can tell you, our sales teams around the world, together with our operating teams, they\u2019re working hand in hand, to make sure that we\u2019ve done everything possible before we go into a customer and ask for them to share in the pain of these increases. But when you have such severe and sudden increases, ultimately, then the pricing does become very important. And I think our team is working that. It\u2019s hard work. There\u2019s no doubt about it. But I think our teams is making really good progress in that front. And again, it\u2019s very market dependent. It\u2019s very region dependent. But there\u2019s no one I would want more than a general manager who knows her business front to back, to be the one who sits in front of a customer and decides is this now the right moment to ask that customer to share in the challenges that we\u2019re facing. Well, thanks so much, Mark. I\u2019ll let Craig talk about the margins in a second. But I can just tell you, our early impressions of the company are very, very positive. I mean, we said and I think I mentioned last quarter, that MTS, the Sensors business is run by a team that we know well. And in particular, the person leading that organization is just a phenomenal, phenomenal leader who has an extraordinary organization underneath him. And the way that they have embraced being part of Amphenol is just truly rewarding for all of us in the company. We\u2019ve known them for a long time. This was not a new acquaintance that we made through this process, but rather we\u2019ve known them all the way back to when they were part of a family-owned company that ultimately MTS acquired. Our customers have received this extremely well. We\u2019ve become more important to customers across the markets, whether that be industrial, military, commercial air and automotive. I continue to be just amazed by the uniqueness and the depth of the technology that we acquired in this business, force, vibration, sensors, pressure sensors, position, just a variety of products that really operate at the harshest of environments and with the highest of performance. In terms of being able to sell more complete solutions, I can tell you that there\u2019s already early activities, real collaborative activities ongoing across the company, with people within our interconnect businesses, working together, getting to know the MTS Sensors organization, creating the sort of fiber of the relationships that ultimately can lead long-term to really collaborative success in the various markets that we serve. So all early returns for MTS, including their absolute performance, which is coming out a little bit better than we had thought in the quarter. All early returns are favorable. And I\u2019ll let Craig maybe comment specifically on the margin. So thanks very much, Elliot. I think you correctly termed that it is a very volatile market on a quarter-to-quarter basis. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, are year-over-year \u2013 the year-over-year performance in the market was significantly impacted by the strength that we had a year-ago in the second quarter, which was really a catch up from the significant COVID impacts that we saw in the first quarter of 2020. This is not a market I\u2019d like to get out ahead of my skis on in terms of several quarters out and giving a prognosis. But what I can say is that our position in the mobile market is an extremely strong position, we continue to have a unique ability to react quickly to customers when they need us the most. And that includes sometimes when our competitors aren\u2019t able to support the customers, in particular, when they\u2019re launching new products. Our guidance for the third quarter being up about 25% or so on a quarter-to-quarter basis is a strong outlook. And I think not inconsistent, if you look over a long time period with a kind of second quarter to third quarter trajectory. What it will be in the quarters thereafter, again, I\u2019m not going to get ahead of my skis and giving a prognosis on mobile devices over the long-term. But the content opportunity, as you say, there\u2019s no reason to think that the content opportunity with these devices as they become more complicated as they have different feature sets, as they support different types of communication standards in them. Those have usually been in the past strong drivers of content in mobile devices and we have no reason to believe that that would change in the future. Yes. Hi, Joe. Joe, I guess, it\u2019s a combination of sort of all the above, and our team continues to do a phenomenal job in IT-Datacom, in particular, a phenomenal job enabling web service providers whose spending and we can call them web service providers like either you can call them cloud providers or whatever. And the fact is the service providers who are making meaningful and very meaningful investments in high speed data processing in order to enable the explosion of traffic that all of them are seeing. And our team has just done an amazing job of reacting to that increase in demand. And we did that over the course of the last year, when it was even more critical. And we talked about this several times last year that our growth in IT-Datacom over the course of 2020. I think growing close to 50%, for example, sequentially in the second quarter, and reacting to this the literal explosion of data traffic resulting from all the video meetings and remote work and remote school and all of that. We made a lot of good friends in that market by stepping up and really enabling our customers when they needed us the most. At the same time, if anything we\u2019ve seen an acceleration in new product development, as our customers look to really push the limits of the bandwidth of their systems. And that involves new interconnect solutions that ultimately can enable that high speed, it involves new power solutions that can help the efficiency and there\u2019s so many dynamics that are going on across IT-Datacom all of which converge on the need for higher performance interconnect products. And whether that\u2019s web service providers and video over the internet, whether that\u2019s even like cryptocurrency and the processor power that\u2019s being used in support of the crypto market. I mean, these are all things that are just driving extraordinary demand for high speed and high efficiency, high speed interconnect and high efficiency power interconnect. And I can just tell you, our team working in both of those areas, has done a bang-up job to react to this to scale our capacity quickly in the face of really unexpected levels of demand. And this quarter was another example of that we certainly did not expect a 20% sequential growth, I think, we came into the quarter thinking kind of mid-single-digits and that that requires you to perform on that it requires you to have enough people and machines and automation and tooling and factory floor space and ready source of materials. And I think our team just did a great job of reacting in the moment here. Yeah, I mean, look I don\u2019t know how it\u2019s going to look in the future, but for sure, over the course of the last year, and we shouldn\u2019t forget Q2 of last year was almost the nuclear winter for the automotive industry. But over the last year, our team working in industrial, working in automotive has clearly done an outstanding job of supporting customers when they needed us the most, and in certain cases doing that because some competitors could not rise to the occasion. So I think that there has been for us some outperformance relative to the industry. I think as well, we clearly have seen an acceleration of the adoption of electronics across the automotive industry, across the many, many segments of the industrial market, this kind of electronification of everything, if you will. And, it\u2019s not just EVs and it\u2019s not just batteries for those EVs. We\u2019re really seeing so many examples of traditionally mechanical fuel based hydraulic, converting to an electronic control, electronic functionality. And each time that happens, that\u2019s a new inflection point whereby if we can step in with the right types of interconnect products, the right types of sensors, leading edge products, if we can do that in a timely fashion, we can have it available for the customers when they need it, when they\u2019re seeing also an increase in their end demand that positions us very well. And so, I think, all of the factors that you mentioned have all come together in a very positive fashion to ultimately lead to us having the growth that we realized this quarter, as well as the positive outlook that we see in the third quarter, and I would hope also beyond. What does that mean for the long-term? Typically, the adoption of electronics is a one-way ratchet. It\u2019s not that people adopt a new electronic system, and then one-day go back to a mechanical system. That\u2019s not really how the evolution of electronics operates. And so, I think, long-term, it gives me some encouragement to see that there has been an acceleration and that kind of step function adoption of electronics, you would hope would continue to create the opportunities for the long-term. Yeah, I mean, look, I think the organic growth was pretty special, David. So I don\u2019t blame you for asking another automotive question. Again, I always say you can teach the master class here on automotive. But, yeah, 117% organic growth albeit to a quarter that was a pretty rough quarter a year-ago, but still it was really a very, very special performance. And our automotive team is very proud and justifiably proud of what they were able to achieve. I relative to the contribution of EV, I can tell you that, if you can imagine that the growth of EV was substantially higher than the growth that I just mentioned of that 117%. And without giving a specific amount of the total of our EV business, it\u2019s bigger than it used to be, and it\u2019s meaningful. It\u2019s a meaningful business. It clearly is an area of success for the company. And it\u2019s one that we look forward to realizing the benefits for many years to come. Relative to inventory, I would actually say that what we\u2019ve seen more of in the automotive market than stockpiling of inventory is we\u2019ve seen customers not wanting to take our product, because they all of a sudden can\u2019t get the appropriate semiconductor to finish the vehicle. And so we\u2019ve seen more, what I would call, push out of deliveries, as opposed to customers just throwing a bunch of stuff in their warehouses, now could there be some buildup of component inventory in certain places, there could be and we may not see it perfectly. But what we have seen for sure, and that went through the course of the quarter, is customers saying, well, we\u2019re going to have to shut down our factory for a couple of weeks. And that\u2019s we don\u2019t need your stuff right now. And we\u2019ve had to react quickly to that and that\u2019s actually meant that for us. We ended up with may be a little bit more of our own finished goods, a little bit more of our own work in progress than we would have liked in the course of the quarter. And still with that, we were able to achieve that 117% organic growth. So I don\u2019t know that there\u2019s a big build up, there could be pockets of it, but the more obvious thing that we saw with the quarter where these push outs from customers, who couldn\u2019t get matching components to make the car. Yeah, well, Joe, again, no problem to get another auto question. I should say that you and David could probably co-teach the master class together. But look one maybe thing I would mention, you alluded to regional in automotive, and actually we saw really strong performance across all of the regions where we operate. And I would tell you actually that our business now regionally is more balanced than ever before is roughly equal size between Asia and Europe, and just to tick lower in North America. So that\u2019s quite a transformation. If you think about it over a decade, when at one point, our business was kind of two-thirds in Europe, and maybe a fifth in North America and the rest in Asia. So we\u2019ve made really great progress in Asia. And I would also say that in Asia, we\u2019ve made great progress also in the electrification in EVs, where our teams just done a fabulous job. Relative to your question do luxury cars have more content, for example, than a lower end car? I think the answer to that is absolutely, yes. That\u2019s always been the case, I think that will always be the case. But what are the differences that we have seen, and that\u2019s not just the difference of this year or last year, but maybe over the last kind of half a decade or so. As we have seen that more and more automakers are equipping their lower end cars with a greater degree of electronic functionality than they did in the past. The traditional approach for automakers to just stop their high-end cars with every possible feature to test out electronics in those cars to put the newest thing there first, and then maybe it would trickle down to the low-end more fleet-type cars, or maybe it wouldn\u2019t. But I tell you, you get any car of any size now and it\u2019s going to have features in it that you never would have imagined before even in like the smallest kind of Fiat 500 or something like that. You\u2019re going to see just a real array of electronics functionality. So, for sure, $100,000 car is always going to have more content as a $30,000 car. But I don\u2019t know that the intensity of electronics in that $100,000 is so many multiples more than it is on that maybe $30,000 car, in the past that would have been quite a different intensity of the electronic value in the car. So what does that mean for long-term? Our companies selling more high value trucks and luxury cars today, and maybe they\u2019ll sell more low value cars in the future that that I don\u2019t have a good read on, but I think there\u2019s electronics opportunities across all these types of cars. Thanks, Samik. Well, first, I guess, maybe we have a little bit different numbers in automotive then what you mentioned, I think our automotive business at a 20% of sales that works out more than $0.5 billion in the quarter. And with the guidance that I\u2019ve given, it wouldn\u2019t be so dissimilar in the third quarter. So I\u2019m not sure the numbers that you referred to. Relative to supply constraints, are they getting better, worse, staying the same? I don\u2019t know. I guess, it feels about the same. I wouldn\u2019t say that it feels that much worse. And there are a few things that maybe do feel a little bit worse, like freight. The cost of freight is not that great. So the price of a container from Asia to the U.S. and, it\u2019s not that that\u2019s a huge impact on us. But once in a while you do that or your customer does that. And those have gotten quite a bit more expensive over the recent times, even just the availability of that. There\u2019s also been a few sorts of funky things that have happened, like there were some floods in Germany, which are really tragic. And we feel for the people of Germany that suffered through these, just sudden catastrophic floods. And there\u2019s a \u2013 Germany has a pretty decent sized electronics supply chain of vendors and various things like that. And we\u2019ve seen a disruption or two there. I talked about the COVID-related restrictions that are happening a little bit in Southeast Asia. So I don\u2019t know that I would say it\u2019s getting easier. That\u2019s for sure. Well, I mean, the last part of your question I\u2019ll answer first, which is I think we\u2019ve pursued this business very aggressively over a long time period. We shouldn\u2019t forget that the whole concept of a high-voltage system in a car is not new. In fact, our teams have been working on development of specific automotive capable high-voltage interconnect systems for, I don\u2019t know, the whole time I\u2019ve been CEO. And I\u2019ve been CEO for nearly 13 years now. So I think that\u2019s not a new development. I don\u2019t think EVs are a new thing, hybrids aren\u2019t a new thing. But they\u2019re growing. And I think they\u2019re reaching \u2013 I don\u2019t know if you want to call it an inflection point. Someone mentioned that term earlier. But for sure, the adoption of these vehicles is accelerating on a global basis, even if they still represent a relatively modest proportion of the overall vehicle market. I mean, the vast majority of cars sold today are still combustion engine cars. But to your point, we have I think in EVs a proposition maybe that we didn\u2019t have in traditional automotive, which is that we\u2019ve been making high-voltage connectors for a very, very long time. I mean, if you think about the legacy of Amphenol over the nearly 9 decades that our company has been in business, we were early on a leader in the innovation and development of power interconnect that\u2019s used in military, aerospace, industrial applications. And that came with unique proprietary technologies, in particular around the efficient and safe transmission of high-voltage power across an interconnect system that requires a very unique contact technology that we have developed over many, many years. And so, early on, and when I say early on, this is a dozen years ago or more when we were really working early on in these hybrid electric vehicles, we were already repackaging our high-voltage interconnect technologies from the military and industrial into a more of an automotive type interconnect interface and otherwise. And so, that gave us a very strong position. So it\u2019s not new to us to be making high-voltage products. And to the extent that there are more traditional incumbents who are pure automotive companies, who may not have had that rich legacy of high-power, high-voltage interconnect, we could, on occasion, have an advantage. Granted they have an advantage with the breadth that they work in that market. So it\u2019s not that this is a kind of a clear path to world domination in the EV market. I mean, we have a lot of competition and we respect them a great deal. But if anything, I think our outperformance in automotive over many years, and in particular, over the recent years, there has been a not insignificant component of that, which has been us realizing the benefits of our position in high-voltage products. Hello, operator, do we have any more questions, please? Okay. Well, thank you very much. And we apologize everybody. There appears to have been a communications issue with the provider here. And we apologize if anybody did not, was not able to have their questions answered. Of course, you can feel free to reach out to our Investor Relations team, to Craig and Sherri. But let me just take this moment to thank all of you again for your time here in this summer and we\u2019re very proud again of the company\u2019s results over the course of this second quarter. And we look forward to finishing the second half, also in the third quarter strongly as we go into 2021. And I want to take this opportunity also to wish each of you that you have a little bit of rest as the summer continues and come back recharged when we talk to each other 90 days from now. Thank you all so much and we\u2019ll talk to you soon."

        "content": "Operator: Hello, and welcome to the First Quarter Earnings Conference Call for Amphenol Corporation. [Operator Instructions]. At the request of the company, today's conference is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, you may disconnect at this time.  I would now like to introduce today's conference host, Mr. Craig Lampo. Sir, you may begin.\nCraig Lampo: Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. This is Craig Lampo, Amphenol's CFO. And I'm here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO. We would like to welcome you to our first quarter 2021 conference call, and our first quarter 2021 results were released this morning. I will provide some financial commentary and then Adam will give an overview of the business as well as current trends. Then we will take questions.  As a reminder, during the call, we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures and may make certain forward-looking statements. Please refer to the relevant disclosures in our press release for further information. In addition, as a result of our previously announced 2-for-1 stock split effective on March 4, 2021, all share and per share data discussed on this earnings call is on a post-split basis.  The company closed the first quarter with sales of $2.377 billion and GAAP and adjusted diluted EPS of $0.53 and $0.52, respectively. Sales were up 28% in U.S. dollars, 25% local currencies and 23% organically compared to the first quarter of 2020. Sequentially, sales were down 2% in U.S. dollars, 3% in local currencies and 4% organically. Orders for the quarter were $2.734 billion, which was up 27% compared to the first quarter of 2020 and up 9% sequentially, resulting in a very strong book-to-bill ratio of 1.15:1.  Breaking down sales into our 2 segments. The interconnect business, which comprised 96% of sales, was up 28% in U.S. dollars and 25% in local currencies compared to the first quarter of last year. Our cable business, which comprised 4% of our sales, was up 17% in U.S. dollars and 18% in local currencies compared to the first quarter of last year's.  Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes. Operating income was $465 million in the first quarter of 2021. Operating margin of 19.6% was down 100 basis points sequentially compared to the fourth quarter of 2020 adjusted operating margin and up a strong 260 basis points compared to the first quarter of 2020. The year-over-year improvement in operating margin was primarily driven by normal operating leverage on the higher sales volumes, combined with the benefit of a lower cost impact resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by the impact of a more challenging commodity and supply chain environment.  The sequential decline in operating margin was driven by normal conversion on the reduced sales levels as well as a more challenging commodity and supply chain environment. From a segment standpoint, the interconnect segment -- in the interconnect segment, margins were 21.5% in the first quarter of 2021, which increased from 19.1% in the first quarter of 2020 and decreased 100 basis points sequentially.  In the cable segment, margins were 8.8%, which increased from 7.6% in the first quarter of 2020 and decreased from 10.3% in the fourth quarter. Given the continuing challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, we are very proud of the company's performance. Our team's ability to effectively manage through this crisis is a direct result of the strength and commitment of the company's entrepreneurial management team, which continues to foster a high-performance, action-oriented culture, which has enabled us to capitalize on the many opportunities for incremental sales, while driving strong operating performance in this very dynamic market environment.  The company's GAAP effective tax rate for the first quarter was 23.9%, which compared to 15.9% in the first quarter of 2020. On an adjusted basis, the effective tax rate was 24.5% in the first quarter of both 2021 and 2020. On a GAAP basis, diluted EPS increased by 33% to $0.53 compared to $0.40 in the prior year period. Adjusted diluted EPS increased by 49% to $0.52 from 35% -- $0.35 in the first quarter of 2020.  The company continues to be an excellent generator of cash. Cash flow from operations was $321 million in the first quarter or 97% of GAAP net income. And net of capital spending, our free cash flow was $243 million or 74% of net income. From a working capital standpoint, inventory days, days sales outstanding and payable days were 85, 73 and 59 days, respectively, all within their normal ranges.  During the quarter, the company repurchased 2.4 million shares of common stock for approximately $153 million. And during the month of April, the company repurchased a small amount of remaining stock authorized under our existing stock repurchase plan. As a result and as mentioned in today's earnings release, yesterday, the company's Board of Directors approved a new 3-year open market stock repurchase plan for the purchase of up to $2 billion of the company's common stock.  At March 31, cash and short-term investments were $2.4 billion, of which $963 million was held in the U.S., with the remainder held outside of the U.S. The elevated level of cash on hand at the end of the first quarter was driven by borrowings under the company's U.S. commercial paper program in anticipation of the MTS closing in early April. Total debt was $4.6 billion, and net debt was $2.3 billion. Total available liquidity at the end of the quarter was $4.1 billion, which included total cash and short-term investments on hand. First quarter 2021 EBITDA was $559 million, and our net leverage ratio was 1.0x.  Following the close of the quarter, on April 7, we completed the acquisition of MTS, which Adam will discuss in more detail in a moment. The MTS acquisition was funded by a combination of cash and cash equivalents on hand as well as additional borrowings under the company's U.S. commercial paper program. On a pro forma basis, including the MTS acquisition and the anticipated divestiture of the test and simulation business, total available liquidity and net leverage at March 31, 2020 would be $3.2 billion and 1.4x, respectively. Until the divestiture of the MTS test and simulation business has closed, we will account for and report the test and simulation business as a discontinued operation.  As such, the expected sales and earnings of the test and simulation business are not included in our guidance. Our guidance also excludes cash and noncash expenses that will be expensed in the second quarter related to the MTS acquisition. These expenses, which we expect to total approximately $85 million or $0.12 per share, include costs related to the early extinguishment of debt, noncash purchase accounting-related expenses, external transaction expenses, severance and other costs. In conjunction with the divestiture of the test and simulation business, the company will also incur certain additional cash tax-related and other acquisition-related costs, which will not be included in income from continuing operations.  Our guidance does incorporate the expected results of the MTS Sensors business, which as previously announced, is expected to generate $350 million in sales and $0.05 in diluted EPS in the first 12 months after closing.  I will now turn it over to Adam, who will provide some commentary on current market trends as well as our recently completed acquisitions.\nAdam Norwitt: Well, thank you very much, Craig, and I'd like to also extend my welcome to everybody on the call here today. And I certainly hope that you, your family, your friends and all of your colleagues are continuing to stay safe and healthy. As Craig mentioned, I'm going to highlight some of our achievements in the first quarter. I'll then discuss our trends and our progress across our diversified served markets. And then finally, I'll make a few comments on our outlook for the second quarter. And of course, we'll have time for Q&A at the end.  Our results in the first quarter were substantially better than we had expected coming into the quarter as we exceeded the high end of our guidance in sales as well as adjusted diluted earnings per share. Sales grew a very strong 28% in U.S. dollars and 25% in local currencies. And on an organic basis, sales increased by 23%. And we had organic growth in nearly all of our end markets and driven particularly by growth in the automotive, mobile devices, industrial and IT datacom markets. And I'll talk about each of those markets in a few moments.  Craig mentioned, we booked record orders in the quarter of $2.734 billion, and that represented a very strong book-to-bill of 1.15:1. Despite continuing to face a range of operational challenges related to the ongoing pandemic as well as increased costs related to commodities and supply chain pressures, our operating margins were very healthy in the quarter, reaching 19.6%, which was a 260 basis point increase from last year's levels.  Craig mentioned our adjusted diluted EPS grew a very robust 49% from prior year, which is again an excellent reflection of the Amphenol organization's strong execution. We generated operating and free cash flow of $321 million and $243 million in the first quarter, respectively, both clear reflections of the high quality of the company's earnings. I just want to say how proud I am of our team this quarter. And our results once again reflect the discipline and agility of our entrepreneurial organization as we continue to perform well amidst the very dynamic and challenging environment.  And I'd like to make a few comments on our acquisitions in the quarter. As you can tell, our small acquisition team here in Wallingford was very busy in the first quarter, closing 3 additional acquisitions since our last earnings release and bringing our total number of acquisitions closed this year to 5. First, as we announced on April 7, we were very pleased to close on the acquisition of MTS Systems earlier than originally anticipated.  Also, as previously announced, we had signed an agreement to sell the MTS test and simulation business to Illinois Tool Works for a sale price of $750 million. And that is -- that remains subject to certain post-closing adjustments and excludes transaction-related expenses. We expect this sale to close following the receipt of all required regulatory approvals.  We're really excited to welcome the talented MTS Sensors team to the Amphenol family. We especially look forward to the strength of the combined breadth of our company's highly complementary sensor product portfolios, which, we believe, will enable us to offer our customers an expanded array of innovative technologies across multiple end markets.  We expect the MTS Sensors business to add approximately $350 million of sales and $0.05 in adjusted diluted earnings per share in the first 12 months after closing. More importantly, though, we look forward to realizing the long-term benefits of the opportunities created by the collective strengths of Amphenol and MTS Sensors for many years to come. We're truly excited about this significant acquisition, which ultimately has positioned Amphenol as one of the broadest and most diversified sensor companies in the industry.  In addition to the MTS acquisition, we also closed on 2 other small acquisitions during the first quarter. In February, we acquired Euromicron, a manufacturer of highly engineered fiber optic interconnect solutions for the mobile networks and IT datacom markets. Based in Germany, with annual sales of approximately $25 million, Euromicron represents a great addition to our interconnect product offering for customers across the European communications market.  And then in March, we completed the acquisition of Cabelcon from Corning Inc. Cabelcon, which also has sales of approximately $25 million, is a Denmark-based designer and manufacturer of high-technology connectors and interconnect assemblies, primarily for customers in the European broadband market. As we welcome these outstanding companies to the Amphenol family, I remain confident that our acquisition program will continue to create great value for Amphenol. Our ability to identify and execute upon acquisitions and then to successfully bring these new companies into Amphenol remains a core competitive advantage for the company.  Now turning to our trends across our served markets. I would just comment that we remain very pleased that the company's balanced and broad end market diversification continues to create great value. We believe this diversification mitigates the impact of the volatility of individual end markets while continuing to expose us to leading technologies wherever they may arise across the electronics industry. This diversification has become ever more valuable given the many market dynamics related to the COVID-19 pandemic.  Now turning first to the military market. The military market represented 11% of our sales in the quarter. And as we had expected coming into the quarter, sales grew by 3% from prior year and were essentially flat organically with growth in naval, unmanned aerial vehicles, communications and vehicle ground systems, offset by declines or flat performance in other applications. Sequentially, our sales were modestly down by about 3%.  Looking into the second quarter, we expect sales to grow in the low double digits from these first quarter levels as we benefit from the addition of MTS Sensors together with the increased demand for interconnect products. We're especially excited by the addition of the sensors products of MTS to our military product offering. Together with our already leading interconnect products as well as our broad exposure across virtually all defense programs, we look forward to supporting the continued adoption of next-generation electronics into a wide array of military hardware.  The commercial aerospace market represented 2% of our sales in the quarter. And not surprisingly, and as expected, sales were down significantly, declining by 47% from prior year as the commercial aircraft market continued to experience unprecedented declines in demand for new aircraft due to the ongoing pandemic-related disruptions to the global travel industry. Sequentially, our sales were a bit better than expected, moderating by just 3% from the fourth quarter.  And looking into the second quarter, we do expect a sequential improvement in sales as we benefit from our recently completed acquisitions. Regardless of the ongoing challenging environment in commercial air, our team working in this market remains committed to leveraging the company's strong interconnect and sensor technology position across a wide array of aircraft platforms and next-generation systems integrated into those airplanes.  The industrial market represented 24% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in industrial in the first quarter were better than expected, growing a very strong 33% in U.S. dollars and 33% organically. This was driven by robust growth in battery and electric heavy vehicle applications, rail mass transit, heavy equipment, instrumentation, factory automation, alternative energy and medical, really a broad performance across many of the segments. On a sequential basis, sales grew by a better-than-expected 6% versus the fourth quarter.  Looking into the second quarter, we expect the industrial market to once again grow in the low teens versus the first quarter. And as we benefit from the addition of MTS Sensors, while continuing to gain momentum in many segments of the industrial market. The acquisition of MTS Sensors has expanded our range of sensors sold into the industrial market, adding position, vibration, force and shock sensors that are used in a wide array of industrial applications.  Together with our existing sensor operations, we now have a diversified range of sensors supporting virtually all of the segments of the industrial market that we serve. I remain truly proud of our team working across the industrial market around the world. Our high-technology interconnect antenna and sensor offering positions us strongly with customers who are accelerating their adoption of electronics, no matter the application. The automotive market represented 22% of our sales in the quarter, and sales in this market were also much stronger than we expected, growing 52% in U.S. dollars and 44% organically, as our team was able to execute strongly in the face of a robust and broad recovery in the automotive market.  In particular, we saw very strong growth of our products that are used in electric and hybrid electric vehicles in the quarter. A great confirmation of our global team's long-term efforts at designing in high-voltage and other interconnect and sensor products into these important next-generation platforms. Sequentially, our sales increased by 6% from the fourth quarter.  Now as has been widely reported, there are a variety of supply chain challenges facing the automotive industry. Accordingly, as we look towards the second quarter, we do expect a modest sequential decline in sales as the global supply chain disruptions temporarily impact certain pockets of new vehicle production. I'm extremely proud of our team working in the automotive market. They have really demonstrated their agility and resiliency through these most turbulent times and thereby, have secured the company's position with our customers across the automotive market. We look forward to benefiting from their efforts long into the future.  The mobile devices market represented 12% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in this market increased by a better-than-expected 51% from prior year, with strength across all product types, including particularly in wearables and laptops. Sequentially, our sales declined by 35%, which was a bit better than our expectations coming into the quarter and is within the typical range of first quarter seasonality that we have seen traditionally in the mobile devices market.  Looking at the second quarter, we anticipate a further high single-digit sequential sales decline, which is also not atypical for this market in the second quarter. While mobile devices will always remain one of our most volatile markets, our outstanding and uniquely agile team is poised as always to capture any opportunities for incremental sales that may arise in 2021 and beyond. Our leading array of antennas, interconnect products and mechanisms continues to enable a broad range of next-generation mobile devices, thereby positioning us well for the long term.  Now turning to the mobile networks market. This market represented 6% of our sales in the quarter, and sales did grow from prior year by 4% in U.S. dollars and 1% organically, as strength from products sold to OEMs was offset in part by a moderation of our sales to network operators. We were encouraged, though, to realize a better-than-expected sequential growth of 19% in the mobile networks market in the quarter as mobile network operators increased their spending on next-generation networks.  Looking to the second quarter, we do expect a modest increase in sales from these first quarter levels, helped by the addition of Euromicron, which expands our offering for mobile networks operators in Europe and positions us well to support future network upgrades. Our team continues to work aggressively to expand our position in next-generation equipment and systems around the world. And as our customers ramp up the investment of these advanced networks, we look forward to benefiting from the increased potential that comes from our unique position with both original equipment manufacturers as well as mobile network service providers.  The information technology and data communications market represented 19% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in the quarter were stronger than expected, rising 25% in U.S. dollars and 24% organically from prior year, really on broad-based strength across networking, storage and server applications. While we had expect sales to decline coming out of the fourth quarter, we were pleased to realize actually a sequential growth of 6% as customers continue to increase their demand for our high-technology products, use service providers and in data centers around the world. Looking to the second quarter, we expect a further increase of sales in the mid-single digits from these levels as customer demand continues to accelerate.  We remain very encouraged by the company's outstanding technology position in the global IT datacom market. Our customers around the world, no doubt about it, are continuing to drive their equipment to ever higher levels of performance in order to manage the dramatic increases in demand for bandwidth and processor power. In turn, our team remains singularly focused on enabling this continuing revolution in IT datacom with our unique, high-speed, power and other interconnect products. Finally, the broadband market represented 4% of our sales in the quarter, and sales grew by a very strong 16% from prior year as broadband spending levels remained elevated.  On a sequential basis, sales grew slightly from the fourth quarter. We do expect a high-teens sequential sales increase in the second quarter as customers continue to upgrade the capacity of their networks to support the significant increase in demand for bandwidth and as we benefit from our recent acquisitions, including Cabelcon. The addition of Cabelcon expands our offering for broadband customers in the European market, which enables us to provide a more diversified range of products for their next-generation networks and the related upgrades.  We look forward to continuing to offer this expanded product offering to broadband service operators around the world, all of whom are working to increase bandwidth to support the expansion of high-speed data applications to homes and businesses.  Now turning to our outlook, and given the current still dynamic market environment as well as assuming no new material disruptions from the COVID-19 pandemic and constant exchange rates. For the second quarter, we now expect sales in the range of $2.415 billion to $2.475 billion and adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $0.53 to $0.55. This would represent strong sales growth of 22% to 25% and adjusted diluted EPS growth of 33% to 38% compared to the second quarter of last year. And I would just note that the second quarter of last year, as you will recall, was already a strong recovery quarter for the company coming out of the first quarter.  I remain confident in the ability of our outstanding management team to adapt to the ongoing challenges that are in the marketplace and to capitalize on the many future opportunities to grow our market position and expand our profitability. The entire Amphenol organization remains committed to delivering long-term sustainable value, all while prioritizing the continued safety and health of each of our employees around the world.  And most importantly, I'd like to just take this opportunity to thank the entire Amphenol team for their truly outstanding efforts here in the first quarter. And with that, operator, we'd be happy to take whatever questions there may be.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Now our first question is from Chris Snyder of UBS.\nChristopher Snyder: I guess my question is on supply chain. If you look across the end markets, just given the really -- or the stronger-than-expected growth, did you see any inventory building across any of the end markets? And then kind of staying on that supply chain, as we look into Q2, the top line guidance seems a bit light relative to the Q1 orders and the 1.15 book-to-bill. I mean is there an implication here that deliveries may be pushed out to the right a little bit, just given all the supply chain disruptions we're seeing?\nAdam Norwitt: Yes. Well, thanks very much, Chris. I mean first, relative to supply chain and our robust results in the first quarter, I mean I would tell you that across the board, customers want our product because their end customers, by and large, also need the product. Whether that's delivering IT datacom connectors that go into web service providers to satisfy the demand for bandwidth that is happening, whether it's automotive customers scrambling to build as many cars as they can, given the low inventory -- low dealer inventories that are out there, we really saw customers taking product and converting that product into their end systems.  And we don't -- obviously don't get full visibility into the warehouses of our customers, but we do get some visibility into the distribution channel. And there, we did not see any material increases in inventory or any noticeable inventory builds. I mean actually, to the contrary, our growth in distribution, our book-to-bill in distribution was not meaningfully higher than what we saw across the total company.  Relative to the second quarter, look, we think there's a very strong guidance from several perspectives. First and foremost, there are these supply chain challenges. And I think some of these have been widely reported, in particular, in places like the automotive market, where I talked about that we do see the automotive market having a slight downtick in demand in the second quarter as certain customers have had to take factories offline or otherwise curtail production because of supply chain challenges. So there's no doubt that we see that.  As well, when you look at, on a year-over-year basis, our second quarter guidance, as I mentioned just a few moments ago, this is a very strong guidance, 25% growth at the high end of guidance. And that's on top of a second quarter last year where we had grown already 7% sequentially from the first quarter. You'll also remember that in our mobile devices business, we had a very strong comeback last year in the second quarter. And so that 25% comparison, when seen in the context of last year, I think, is a very, very robust demand.  In terms of the orders, yes, these are very strong orders that we received in the quarter. And could there be some customers who are maybe opening up the aperture of their order scheduling, ordering a little bit longer out? There could be some of that. I think we have some customers, there are many across the supply chain who are a little skittish because of some of the challenges that are so widely reported and that I'm sure all of you know even better than I do, and that can cause some customers to maybe order a little bit more in advance, not to build inventory per se, but to get it on the books.  But look, all that being said, if you look at our orders on a year-over-year basis, they also grew at a similar rate to what our sales grew, about 27%, I think, was the order growth. And I think they're reflective of strong demand on our products from our customers, who we have consistently supported through all cycles of this crisis. And when you look at our performance across each of the individual markets, it's clear that customers are coming back to us because we were there for them when they needed us the most.\nOperator: Now our next question is from Wamsi Mohan of Bank of America.\nWamsi Mohan: Adam, I was wondering if we could just step back perhaps, given your really broad diversified portfolio. How should investors think about the areas in which Amphenol can benefit from this proposed infrastructure plan?\nAdam Norwitt: Well, Wamsi, it's a great question. And it's still a proposed infrastructure plan, obviously. So I take everything with a grain of salt, in particular, with the political system that we have now in the U.S. But look, I think we have a lot of our businesses that do stand to play a role in upgrading the infrastructure of the U.S., especially because infrastructure is being defined, as I would think it should be, in a very broad sense.  It's not just roads and highways and bridges and tunnels and airports, which would stimulate demand for a wide variety of products that we sell into heavy equipment and otherwise. But infrastructure means the domestic capacity to produce electronic components in certain cases. Infrastructure means bandwidth. Infrastructure means access to data, access to devices. And I think that all of these things ultimately today have a common thread, and that is that the adoption of electronics and, in turn, our ability to enable that adoption of electronics, plays a significant role in the upgrade of those various \"elements\" of infrastructure.  And so whatever the -- ends up coming out of kind of the sausage factory at Washington, if you will, there's no question to me that electronics is going to play a significant role in helping this country to upgrade its infrastructure in the broadest sense. And I think we're very well positioned across our end markets to play some constructive role in that.\nOperator: Now our next question is from Amit Daryanani of Evercore.\nAmit Daryanani: I guess my question is really around, Adam, when I look at your growth rates for the first half of this year, they're about 25% or so. Much of this, I assume, is a cyclical market recovery. But I'm wondering if you could actually talk about if Amphenol is seeing share gains pick up as well in the first half of the year, especially as I imagine that your peers have not been able to ramp up capacity as quickly as demand has come back. And if that's true going forward, could that enable you to grow at a larger premium to the underlying industry growth rate and share gains become bigger for you, hopefully?\nAdam Norwitt: Well, thank you very much, Amit, and greetings to you as well. Look, I think the numbers here a little bit speak for themselves. When you look at our overall growth, growing 28% or 23% organically in the quarter, or when you look at some of the individual markets where we had significant growth in a number of our markets, clearly outpacing whatever the industry growth rate will be. And I'm not an expert in exactly what various industry growth rates are. But clearly, growing in industrial by 33% organically and automotive by 44% organically and mobile devices by 51% organically and IT datacom by 25%. Those are clearly ahead of the overall industry growth rates.  And you're correct. I think there is a meaningful component of that growth, which is our ability to react quickly, despite a very challenging environment. It should not be understated. There still remains many challenges today in the world, both with COVID and with the supply chain. But our ability to react quickly in an entrepreneurial and agile fashion to satisfy the demand of customers when they need it has been, I think, through this whole cycle, an extraordinary advantage that we brought to bear.  And as customers think for the long term about with whom do they want to partner, it's going to be very hard to forget who was there for you when the chips were down at the greatest moment. Who was there for you during the depths of the pandemic when bandwidth was at such a premium and factories were closing all over place because of shutdown orders and the spread of the virus, and who was there to react when you needed to help you support your end customers. And I think that is something that our customers reflect on, integrate into their buying behavior, incorporate into their decisions about who should be their partner going forward.  And so does that mean that we have a high potential to continue to outpace the market? And we've outgrown the market for now 2 decades. And I think that this just reinforces for our customers why having Amphenol as your first phone call is a really important principle and a very helpful way to run your supply chain.\nOperator: Now our next question is from James Suva of Citigroup Investment Research.\nJames Suva: And it's nice to see Amphenol continue to make acquisitions. In the past history, sometimes acquisitions have been companies that really needed a global footprint for sales or a global manufacturing footprint or helping to polish their operations. And others have been strategic to help the company grow in the future. But the recently announced acquisitions that you just talked about today, can you help us figure which they are more for the growth or health of operations and you can really improve their profitability or go to market? How do they fit into the Amphenol family?\nAdam Norwitt: Thank you very much, Jim. I mean, look, our criteria for acquisitions has always started with two things, and that's people and the products, in other words, the technology that those companies have. And so the very first test for us is, are we acquiring a company that has people who have passion, drive, integrity and entrepreneurial spirit that we think will fit into the Amphenol organization. And then second, do they have unique enabling technologies that ultimately solve real problems for their customers. And then when we found those companies, we don't focus on either growth or on improvement in operating performance. We try to do both of those things.  And our acquisition program, which has been so successful over so many years, has really been successful because we were able to find ways to accelerate the growth of those companies and find ways to improve their operating performance. And so I would say that the 3 acquisitions that we're talking about today, of course, MTS being far and away bigger than Euromicron or Cabelcon, they all share that great potential, both from a top line growth perspective, taking advantage of being part of Amphenol, taking advantage of being part of a global company with strong partnership, preferred supplier relationships with customers across all of our end markets, but also being part of a company that has access to low-cost manufacturing when appropriate, who has access to collaborative initiatives across the company from a technology or sourcing perspective that ultimately can help to drive better operating performance. And so I would say, with these 3 companies, we think that they all have great growth and profitability improvement potential, despite their very different scales.\nOperator: Now our next question is from Matt Sheerin from Stifel.\nMatthew Sheerin: A question, Craig, regarding your commentary about some cost headwinds weighing somewhat on your margins. Could you quantify that in terms of maybe what in terms of basis points you've seen? And is that just an issue that you see persisting over the next couple of quarters that we're hearing from other suppliers as well?\nCraig Lampo: Yes. Thanks, Matt. Yes, I mean, I just want to start by saying we are actually extremely proud of the ability to achieve these strong operating margins in the first quarter, I mean, 19.6% in this challenging environment while we still have COVID costs. And then on top of that, we've seen certainly increasingly challenging commodity and supply chain environment. I think it's really just a great achievement, and I really am happy with the performance of the general managers to be able to offset some of these costs that they're seeing.  The reality is, is that we have seen increasing challenging environment as we come into the first quarter. To quantify that is a little bit difficult. But I think the way I would think about it is that if you -- as we kind of came into the first quarter from the fourth quarter, sequentially, we would expect a typical close to 30% kind of sequential downside conversion. So really, the gap between that is -- the vast majority of that, I think, is really the pressures from the commodity and supply chain environment. I mean there is some small component related to some of the acquisitions of Positronic as well as Euromicron that we closed earlier in the quarter. But the vast majority really would be that kind of cost environment that we're seeing some headwinds from.  In terms of how long that will last, I mean there's certainly -- we're doing -- I think the team is again doing a good job of trying to offset some of that, I think, through taking some cost actions and over time, maybe also through passing on some of those increases to customers to the extent you can't do it within the factories. But I don't think this is necessarily something that we're going to be able to necessarily get through in the quarter. So that certainly is still included in kind of our second quarter guidance that we gave is expect to still have some of those headwinds we haven't guided to the rest of the year. So I guess I won't comment on that.  But certainly, I think that this environment that we find ourselves in now, I'm very happy with kind of what we've been able to achieve in terms of offsetting a certain level of those costs. But I think that the reality is that the -- we're probably sitting here at least for another quarter here with some of those cost headwinds that we see today.\nAdam Norwitt: And Matt, I would just add to that a little color. There are certain parts of this, which are pretty significant cost differences in commodities, for example. I mean, they're all very well reported. And the way that Amphenol operates is we have close to 125 general managers around the world, and each of them is really tuning their operation in light of the costs that are hitting them, in particular.  So you take an example, a general manager in our cable business, which has a very high component of material cost, very significant in our cable segment, there's not a choice, but to go and work with customers and to make sure you take a leadership position in adjusting price to account for those commodity prices. And we would certainly expect that others in the industry would have that same dynamic. And that's just one example of how it goes.  But the beauty is that these general managers have every tool available to them to adjust, whether it's from the price you sell to the customer, to every element of cost are all in the power of the general managers. And when you see a sudden increase in some of these things, it can take a short while to work through it. But Craig and I are confident that over time, our team is going to manage this, as they always have.\nOperator: Now our next question is from Mark Delaney of Goldman Sachs.\nMark Delaney: This quarter was certainly a good illustration of Amphenol's leadership and operational flexibility, but I'd still be interested in understanding if you're thinking of any -- making any changes in how the company operates going forward in terms of things like how you're sourcing material, where you locate manufacturing or inventory management once you have some time to fully reflect on how COVID and some of the trade issues have stressed global supply chains or even just because Amphenol is becoming a bigger company with the M&A that you've done, including most recently with MTS?\nAdam Norwitt: Thanks so much, Mark. I mean, look, the answer I'll give you is really 2 sides. The answer is no, we think that our approach, our culture, the unique entrepreneurial organizational structure that we have had in Amphenol for many decades is uniquely tailored to an environment like we've been in and to an environment like we're headed into. But the other answer is yes, every day, meaning we're making changes every day. We're not making those changes from here at headquarters. We're not deciding on a blanket approach like we're going to go out of one country and go into this country, or we're going to increase our inventory this much or we're going to change how we're sourcing things. But those general managers around the world are every day making course corrections. And some of them pretty significant course corrections in the moment to react to the environment that is around them.  So when tariffs came in, you'll remember this already, it seems like so long ago that there was the thing called tariffs several years ago. But our team immediately reacted to that in every way possible from moving production to changing logistical flows, to doing lots of other things to passing on the price to customers when there was no other option. And that was a real-time, in the moment kind of transformation, but not at a corporate level, rather it was at the individual operating unit levels.  And I think as we've gone through the pandemic, as we see the very robust demand coming out of this part of the cycle, we're making lots of changes every day to make sure that we remain the most competitive, that we are able to outperform the market at the highest degree possible and that we're able to deliver to the bottom line superior operating profitability and ultimately convert that to cash. And those are just day-to-day decisions that are made by our general managers, obviously, in some consultation with us. But ultimately, the proof, I think, is really in the pudding of that approach.\nOperator: Now our next question is from Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley.\nCraig Hettenbach: Just questions on MTS. I think their operating margins are roughly in the mid-teens. And I know other acquisitions you've done in the past where they've been lower. There's a path to kind of get them to corporate average. So just curious if there's any similarities or differences in terms of that approach for this deal? And then, Adam, you mentioned a number of the key markets for MTS where they play. Any of those stand out in particular from a growth perspective that you're most excited about?\nAdam Norwitt: Thanks very much, Craig. I think you're roughly accurate about the operating margins with MTS. Obviously, there will be some amortization, and we include amortization in our numbers, so that they can have a little bit of downward impact on the operating margins. But you're right, I mean every company who comes into Amphenol thinks about how are they going to achieve, ultimately, that growth in margins to get up to the Amphenol corporate average or above.  Obviously, an average is just an average, and there are some above and some below. And I would tell you that the management team in the MTS Sensors business is an extraordinarily capable team of individuals. The gentleman who leads that business, who led the business inside of MTS, who, by the way, led the predecessor family-owned company that was acquired by MTS, I mean this is a just truly outstanding individual who also likes to see that his company is doing as well as his sister companies. And there's no doubt about it that there's a little bit of peer pressure inside of Amphenol when you come in and see the margins of your peers. And something tells me that that's an organization that does not want to be below the average. And how long is that going to take? That's always a question. But when there's is a will, there's a way. And I think this is a team that has an extraordinary will to make that happen.  In terms of the markets with the MTS Sensors business, I talked already that they have strong position in industrial and military and then in commercial air and automotive, roughly in that order, I would say, in terms of magnitude. And they participate in just some of the most exciting applications within those. MTS makes products that are really at the cutting edge of the harsh environment, high-performance requirements of some of these systems. So when you're making like a turbine, and that turbine, be it a gas turbine or a windmill, and you want to know that, that thing is operating with good function and smoothly and that there's no issues inside the turbine. You're going to use a sensor from MTS, or a number of sensors, let me say, that are going to be in the most harsh of environments, hot, out in the middle of the ocean, you name it, that are going to ultimately tell you, is your system working or not and do you need to go maintain that. That's just one example of these extraordinary harsh environment vibration, force, pressure and position sensors that they sell.  I had the good fortune to go around to several of the factories just in the last couple of weeks. And had been there, of course, before. But going now as the owner is a little bit different. And not only do you see products that are truly at the high leading edge of sensor technology, but these are sensor products where the harsh environment interconnect packaging of those sensors is almost of equal import to the good functioning of the product in the systems where they participate.  And so we see just great opportunities in the industrial market, across many segments of the industrial market, in the military market, as I spoke earlier, where we have already a leading position in military interconnect. We're just really excited to now have a significant position also in sensors in the military market as well in automotive and in commercial air. And so we see great opportunities really across the markets of MTS and look forward to taking full advantage for many years to come.\nOperator: Our next question is from William Stein of Truist Securities.\nWilliam Stein: Congrats on the very good results today. I would like to ask you about the commercial aerospace end market. That end market was already in a pretty significant downturn because of the 737 MAX grounding and then we had COVID obviously stopped travel and demand for planes. But I think you guided this segment up sequentially. And I wonder if that's an indication that you think we're past the bottom here. And I wonder what you're seeing in terms of recovery, what you're seeing in the order book and maybe what you're hearing more anecdotally from your customers?\nAdam Norwitt: Thanks, Will. Yes, I mean, it's a tough time in the commercial air market. There's no doubt about it. I mean it's hard to think of a market that was not -- that was more heavily impacted over the last 1.5 years than the commercial air market. It represents now just 2% of our sales. And we did guide it up sequentially in the quarter ahead. Although I would say that that's really the impact of the MTS Sensors acquisition. I don't know that I would necessarily say that I'm kind of calling a bottom, so to speak. But clearly, the rate is declining. The rate of decline on a sequential basis is getting smaller. It's down by just 3% sequentially in the quarter, which is, I guess, a green shoot of encouragement, if you will.  But the commercial air market has a tough road ahead of it. And our team working in that market is doing everything they can to continue to diversify their business to make sure that the products that they sell, which have other applications, are being proliferated and we're re-devoting resources to designing in those products into other applications, where they can be very enabling technologies such that when the commercial air market does eventually come back, which it will, we're not going back to horses and buggies, we will be flying again one day. And I hope to be doing so very soon after I get my second shot tomorrow morning together with Craig. That market will come back. And when it comes back, our operations working in that market will be stronger than ever because they will have taken this opportunity to diversify themselves, diversify their product sets, leverage their resources in a broader fashion. And I think that's the way to deal with a crisis like this, and that's always been the Amphenol way.\nOperator: Now our next question is from Joe Giordano from Cowen.\nJoseph Giordano: So we've heard kind of like different strategies and different responses from many companies this season about how they're dealing with sourcing of components that are in scarcity. And we've heard some say that the ability to like leverage all their individual businesses as one big customer kind of gives them leverage at suppliers. I think you guys are probably going the other way. Can you kind of talk about how the structure of Amphenol as kind of small independent companies essentially gives them an advantage when sourcing? Is it because some of these businesses are small enough that they're -- it's not a big quantity that they need? Can you maybe just talk us through that relative to some other maybe ways to accomplish that?\nAdam Norwitt: Yes. Look, Joe, we try to have the best of both worlds in sourcing. And so at the end of the day, sourcing happens under the purview of those 125 general managers around the world. And sometimes it's good to be small and sometimes it's good to be big. And what we try to do is we present ourselves as whichever is most beneficial in the moment. So we oftentimes are a few general managers who buy a common material will work together and they may go together to a vendor. That's what gets us the results that we need. But in other cases, it's a very local decision where maybe a purchasing person says to a local sales rep, hey, just sneak me what I need here, no one's going to notice. And in between both of those, there's a whole spectrum of techniques, strategies, tactics that our supply chain team around the world will be taking.  The most important principle, though, is this, if you have supply chain disconnected from the business, it's actually really hard to decide, ultimately, am I doing the right thing? How do I -- what if I need to redesign something? Well, if there's this monolithic engineering team and a monolithic sourcing team and the sourcing team says, we can't get this part, we need to redesign it, and it has to go sort of up and down the corporate chain to get that redesign resources to be allocated or to convince the engineer to do so, that can be a very laborious process.  Whereas in our organization, the purchasing person is sitting in the door right next to the engineering person reporting to the general manager who's 2 doors down from her. And they can just get in the room together and say, look, we can't find this thing, let's redesign it right now, let's reallocate the resources, let's make it happen. And it's that kind of real-time, connected to the business approach. Whether it is dealing with shortages, whether it's dealing with logistical challenges, whether it's dealing with quality issues, whether it's dealing with new design, whatever, we've always found that, that approach can be very effective. But we try to be what will make us be the most successful, let's say that.\nOperator: Our next question is from David Kelley from Jefferies.\nDavid Kelley: Just hoping to follow up on automotive. Really robust growth versus underlying production in the quarter. You referenced electrification wins as a contributor. And then you mentioned broadly, you aren't seeing channel inventory build, but I would assume you delivered to market share gains and then probably benefited from favorable mix as well. Just hoping you can walk us through some of the drivers of you're really showing automotive performance in the quarter.\nAdam Norwitt: Sure. Well, thanks very much, David. I mean, you know the underlying market much better than I do. You could teach a master class on it, for sure. But what I would tell you is our team in all regions really performed very strongly here. And we saw great growth really across the board, across the regions. And we saw disproportionate growth from new programs that we're -- that we've long worked to design ourselves in on relative to EVs. But it wasn't exclusively EVs. We saw growth in lots of other new platforms as well.  And I think our long-term share gains in the automotive market, and I referenced this earlier, is really a function of us focusing our efforts on next-generation technologies in car, next-generation systems, next-generation applications, everything from passenger comfort and connectivity, to safety, to engine management, emissions control and obviously, high voltage related to EVs and hybrid EVs.  And I think all of those things are helping us to outperform the broader market in a quarter like we just had here in the first quarter, but also over a very long time period. We're really talking about the better part of the decade, where we have had a relatively consistent performance that is a decent amount, if not far in excess of the underlying unit production volumes that are out there.  So there's not like 1 silver bullet to this. I think it's been a collective approach. It's been our acquisition program, where we've added new companies, both interconnect, antenna and sensor companies. And it's a lot of work on engineering of next-generation systems that go into these cars across all of the regions. And I think when we put all that together, ultimately, we've seen strong performance.\nOperator: Now our next question is from Samik Chatterjee of JPMorgan.\nSamik Chatterjee: I wanted to get your views on mobile networks. You mentioned you had better revenue than you expected in the quarter. You're guiding to sequential improvement in revenues. And how should I think about visibility or sustainability of this improvement through the rest of the year? And how correlated is that going to be to some of the like 5G CapEx plans that the North American telcos recently outlined? How much of that is going to probably help sustain some of this growth through the rest of the year?\nAdam Norwitt: Thank you, Samik. Well, look, we're really pleased with the sequential growth that we saw in this market. Obviously, that's a market that, over the last year or 2, has not always had the most robust growth as the operators have somehow struggled. There's been a lot of corporate things going on, delays in investment last year. We also saw some redeployment of the investment towards really the core of the networks to support the massive growth in bandwidth. But we've always talked about the fact that our team has been working diligently over many years to design in our products into next-generation systems and networks, be they 5G or otherwise.  And I think we start to see kind of some early progress with that here in the first quarter. And to the extent that operators are expanding their investment, we would hope to benefit from that. It may not always be in a perfect quarter-to-quarter correlation. We don't have a position with absolutely every operator with the exact same degree of success. But we have a very strong position on the equipment, that is really going to enable 5G for the long term. And so to the extent that 5G creates incremental capital spending, which, again, has yet to be perfectly articulated, then, for sure, we would feel like we would be in a good position to be able to benefit from that in the medium and long term.\nOperator: Our next question is from Luke Junk from Baird.\nLuke Junk: Adam, you mentioned hybrids and electric vehicles especially as a growth driver in your end market discussion of both auto and industrial trends this afternoon. Could you help us better understand the span of EV-related products, especially across those two segments? And in particular, I'm wondering how might differentiate the company's opportunity set versus some of your connector peers that have a more auto-based focus.\nAdam Norwitt: Thanks very much, Luke. Yes. No, you picked up on that very astutely. We participate in the electrification of vehicles, whether those are passenger vehicles or commercial vehicles, and both have been really great drivers for us in recent quarters and years. And in the industrial, we talk about that industrial battery and the heavy vehicles. There's a wide range of vehicles that are undergoing electrification right now from big trucks, and there's plenty of news media around that, to postal vehicles and trash trucks and buses and goods vehicles, delivery vans, you name it. And so all of that is what we classify really in our industrial business or industrial market as that battery heavy vehicle.  And then when we talk about automotive, the hybrid EV, that's really passenger cars and the related products. In addition, we think about the charging infrastructure for electrification as really an infrastructure piece and that we think about in our industrial business as well. And that's all -- those are all components of areas where we've seen strong performance in -- certainly in the first quarter and over a number of years and look forward to that. Because I think if you confine your view of electrification just to passenger vehicles, you're missing a really exciting area of the electronics revolution, which is that electrification more broadly.  By the way, I mean, we're working as well with the Department of Defense in certain countries on the electrification of military vehicles, which, I think, is going to be a long process. But over the long term, we see that as an area that can also be another benefit and another growth lever along this just real kind of, call it, a megatrend, if you will, of electrification across kind of all things that move.\nOperator: Now our next question is from Steven Fox from Fox Advisors.\nSteven Fox: Craig, I just wanted to talk a little bit more about your extra costs in the coming quarter. If I applied your analysis for Q1 to Q2, it looks like the pressure is about $20 million or so, similar to Q1. I imagine there's some M&A impacting your incrementals. But can you talk about whether that's in the ballpark and what you guys are doing to sort of reduce that $20 million nut going forward?\nCraig Lampo: Yes. Thanks, Steve. Yes. No, actually, your math probably isn't so far off. It's certainly in the range of what we'd probably quantify that as. And if you look sequentially going from Q1 to Q2, essentially, a lot of that growth is our acquisitions that we just announced. So as you can imagine, the sequential conversion is going to be a little bit lower than your typical conversion just because those are -- acquisitions are at a lower profitability level as an average of the company.  And clearly, as we talked about with MTS specifically, but also related to the other 2, over time, we would expect to be able to work those up to the company average. But as we -- talking about Q2 specifically, that sequential conversion really mostly is impacted related to the acquisitions. But essentially, the cost impact that you just quantified is kind of is in that ballpark that we had in Q1 essentially we're expecting to still see in Q2 as the team continues to work through all those actions to ultimately, over time, neutralize those impacts.\nOperator: As of this time, we don't have any further questions on queue. Now I'll turn the call back to Mr. Lampo for closing remarks.\nAdam Norwitt: Well, this is Mr. Norwitt. But anyway, thank you very much, and we truly appreciate everybody's time today on the call. And I did want to take a moment just to wish everybody good health here. And I hope everybody is getting the chance to be vaccinated soon, wherever you may be. And I wanted to make just a special comment and note about any of you who may have friends or family in India. We obviously have an organization in India, and we're very carefully attentive to the ongoing situation with the pandemic there and doing our part to help the communities in India. And I just wanted to send our best wishes to any of you on the phone here today with family and friends in India. It's a fabulous country, and I'm sure they're going to work their way through this difficult stage in the pandemic.  Thank you all to everybody and wish you all good health, and we'll talk to you all in the next 90 days.\nCraig Lampo: Thank you, everybody. Bye, bye.\nOperator: Thank you. And thank you, everyone, for attending today's conference. Have a nice day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Craig Lampo",
            "content": "Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. This is Craig Lampo, Amphenol's CFO. And I'm here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO. We would like to welcome you to our first quarter 2021 conference call, and our first quarter 2021 results were released this morning. I will provide some financial commentary and then Adam will give an overview of the business as well as current trends. Then we will take questions.  As a reminder, during the call, we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures and may make certain forward-looking statements. Please refer to the relevant disclosures in our press release for further information. In addition, as a result of our previously announced 2-for-1 stock split effective on March 4, 2021, all share and per share data discussed on this earnings call is on a post-split basis.  The company closed the first quarter with sales of $2.377 billion and GAAP and adjusted diluted EPS of $0.53 and $0.52, respectively. Sales were up 28% in U.S. dollars, 25% local currencies and 23% organically compared to the first quarter of 2020. Sequentially, sales were down 2% in U.S. dollars, 3% in local currencies and 4% organically. Orders for the quarter were $2.734 billion, which was up 27% compared to the first quarter of 2020 and up 9% sequentially, resulting in a very strong book-to-bill ratio of 1.15:1.  Breaking down sales into our 2 segments. The interconnect business, which comprised 96% of sales, was up 28% in U.S. dollars and 25% in local currencies compared to the first quarter of last year. Our cable business, which comprised 4% of our sales, was up 17% in U.S. dollars and 18% in local currencies compared to the first quarter of last year's.  Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes. Operating income was $465 million in the first quarter of 2021. Operating margin of 19.6% was down 100 basis points sequentially compared to the fourth quarter of 2020 adjusted operating margin and up a strong 260 basis points compared to the first quarter of 2020. The year-over-year improvement in operating margin was primarily driven by normal operating leverage on the higher sales volumes, combined with the benefit of a lower cost impact resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by the impact of a more challenging commodity and supply chain environment.  The sequential decline in operating margin was driven by normal conversion on the reduced sales levels as well as a more challenging commodity and supply chain environment. From a segment standpoint, the interconnect segment -- in the interconnect segment, margins were 21.5% in the first quarter of 2021, which increased from 19.1% in the first quarter of 2020 and decreased 100 basis points sequentially.  In the cable segment, margins were 8.8%, which increased from 7.6% in the first quarter of 2020 and decreased from 10.3% in the fourth quarter. Given the continuing challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, we are very proud of the company's performance. Our team's ability to effectively manage through this crisis is a direct result of the strength and commitment of the company's entrepreneurial management team, which continues to foster a high-performance, action-oriented culture, which has enabled us to capitalize on the many opportunities for incremental sales, while driving strong operating performance in this very dynamic market environment.  The company's GAAP effective tax rate for the first quarter was 23.9%, which compared to 15.9% in the first quarter of 2020. On an adjusted basis, the effective tax rate was 24.5% in the first quarter of both 2021 and 2020. On a GAAP basis, diluted EPS increased by 33% to $0.53 compared to $0.40 in the prior year period. Adjusted diluted EPS increased by 49% to $0.52 from 35% -- $0.35 in the first quarter of 2020.  The company continues to be an excellent generator of cash. Cash flow from operations was $321 million in the first quarter or 97% of GAAP net income. And net of capital spending, our free cash flow was $243 million or 74% of net income. From a working capital standpoint, inventory days, days sales outstanding and payable days were 85, 73 and 59 days, respectively, all within their normal ranges.  During the quarter, the company repurchased 2.4 million shares of common stock for approximately $153 million. And during the month of April, the company repurchased a small amount of remaining stock authorized under our existing stock repurchase plan. As a result and as mentioned in today's earnings release, yesterday, the company's Board of Directors approved a new 3-year open market stock repurchase plan for the purchase of up to $2 billion of the company's common stock.  At March 31, cash and short-term investments were $2.4 billion, of which $963 million was held in the U.S., with the remainder held outside of the U.S. The elevated level of cash on hand at the end of the first quarter was driven by borrowings under the company's U.S. commercial paper program in anticipation of the MTS closing in early April. Total debt was $4.6 billion, and net debt was $2.3 billion. Total available liquidity at the end of the quarter was $4.1 billion, which included total cash and short-term investments on hand. First quarter 2021 EBITDA was $559 million, and our net leverage ratio was 1.0x.  Following the close of the quarter, on April 7, we completed the acquisition of MTS, which Adam will discuss in more detail in a moment. The MTS acquisition was funded by a combination of cash and cash equivalents on hand as well as additional borrowings under the company's U.S. commercial paper program. On a pro forma basis, including the MTS acquisition and the anticipated divestiture of the test and simulation business, total available liquidity and net leverage at March 31, 2020 would be $3.2 billion and 1.4x, respectively. Until the divestiture of the MTS test and simulation business has closed, we will account for and report the test and simulation business as a discontinued operation.  As such, the expected sales and earnings of the test and simulation business are not included in our guidance. Our guidance also excludes cash and noncash expenses that will be expensed in the second quarter related to the MTS acquisition. These expenses, which we expect to total approximately $85 million or $0.12 per share, include costs related to the early extinguishment of debt, noncash purchase accounting-related expenses, external transaction expenses, severance and other costs. In conjunction with the divestiture of the test and simulation business, the company will also incur certain additional cash tax-related and other acquisition-related costs, which will not be included in income from continuing operations.  Our guidance does incorporate the expected results of the MTS Sensors business, which as previously announced, is expected to generate $350 million in sales and $0.05 in diluted EPS in the first 12 months after closing.  I will now turn it over to Adam, who will provide some commentary on current market trends as well as our recently completed acquisitions. Yes. Thanks, Matt. Yes, I mean, I just want to start by saying we are actually extremely proud of the ability to achieve these strong operating margins in the first quarter, I mean, 19.6% in this challenging environment while we still have COVID costs. And then on top of that, we've seen certainly increasingly challenging commodity and supply chain environment. I think it's really just a great achievement, and I really am happy with the performance of the general managers to be able to offset some of these costs that they're seeing.  The reality is, is that we have seen increasing challenging environment as we come into the first quarter. To quantify that is a little bit difficult. But I think the way I would think about it is that if you -- as we kind of came into the first quarter from the fourth quarter, sequentially, we would expect a typical close to 30% kind of sequential downside conversion. So really, the gap between that is -- the vast majority of that, I think, is really the pressures from the commodity and supply chain environment. I mean there is some small component related to some of the acquisitions of Positronic as well as Euromicron that we closed earlier in the quarter. But the vast majority really would be that kind of cost environment that we're seeing some headwinds from.  In terms of how long that will last, I mean there's certainly -- we're doing -- I think the team is again doing a good job of trying to offset some of that, I think, through taking some cost actions and over time, maybe also through passing on some of those increases to customers to the extent you can't do it within the factories. But I don't think this is necessarily something that we're going to be able to necessarily get through in the quarter. So that certainly is still included in kind of our second quarter guidance that we gave is expect to still have some of those headwinds we haven't guided to the rest of the year. So I guess I won't comment on that.  But certainly, I think that this environment that we find ourselves in now, I'm very happy with kind of what we've been able to achieve in terms of offsetting a certain level of those costs. But I think that the reality is that the -- we're probably sitting here at least for another quarter here with some of those cost headwinds that we see today. Yes. Thanks, Steve. Yes. No, actually, your math probably isn't so far off. It's certainly in the range of what we'd probably quantify that as. And if you look sequentially going from Q1 to Q2, essentially, a lot of that growth is our acquisitions that we just announced. So as you can imagine, the sequential conversion is going to be a little bit lower than your typical conversion just because those are -- acquisitions are at a lower profitability level as an average of the company.  And clearly, as we talked about with MTS specifically, but also related to the other 2, over time, we would expect to be able to work those up to the company average. But as we -- talking about Q2 specifically, that sequential conversion really mostly is impacted related to the acquisitions. But essentially, the cost impact that you just quantified is kind of is in that ballpark that we had in Q1 essentially we're expecting to still see in Q2 as the team continues to work through all those actions to ultimately, over time, neutralize those impacts. Thank you, everybody. Bye, bye."

            "name": "Adam Norwitt",
            "content": "Well, thank you very much, Craig, and I'd like to also extend my welcome to everybody on the call here today. And I certainly hope that you, your family, your friends and all of your colleagues are continuing to stay safe and healthy. As Craig mentioned, I'm going to highlight some of our achievements in the first quarter. I'll then discuss our trends and our progress across our diversified served markets. And then finally, I'll make a few comments on our outlook for the second quarter. And of course, we'll have time for Q&A at the end.  Our results in the first quarter were substantially better than we had expected coming into the quarter as we exceeded the high end of our guidance in sales as well as adjusted diluted earnings per share. Sales grew a very strong 28% in U.S. dollars and 25% in local currencies. And on an organic basis, sales increased by 23%. And we had organic growth in nearly all of our end markets and driven particularly by growth in the automotive, mobile devices, industrial and IT datacom markets. And I'll talk about each of those markets in a few moments.  Craig mentioned, we booked record orders in the quarter of $2.734 billion, and that represented a very strong book-to-bill of 1.15:1. Despite continuing to face a range of operational challenges related to the ongoing pandemic as well as increased costs related to commodities and supply chain pressures, our operating margins were very healthy in the quarter, reaching 19.6%, which was a 260 basis point increase from last year's levels.  Craig mentioned our adjusted diluted EPS grew a very robust 49% from prior year, which is again an excellent reflection of the Amphenol organization's strong execution. We generated operating and free cash flow of $321 million and $243 million in the first quarter, respectively, both clear reflections of the high quality of the company's earnings. I just want to say how proud I am of our team this quarter. And our results once again reflect the discipline and agility of our entrepreneurial organization as we continue to perform well amidst the very dynamic and challenging environment.  And I'd like to make a few comments on our acquisitions in the quarter. As you can tell, our small acquisition team here in Wallingford was very busy in the first quarter, closing 3 additional acquisitions since our last earnings release and bringing our total number of acquisitions closed this year to 5. First, as we announced on April 7, we were very pleased to close on the acquisition of MTS Systems earlier than originally anticipated.  Also, as previously announced, we had signed an agreement to sell the MTS test and simulation business to Illinois Tool Works for a sale price of $750 million. And that is -- that remains subject to certain post-closing adjustments and excludes transaction-related expenses. We expect this sale to close following the receipt of all required regulatory approvals.  We're really excited to welcome the talented MTS Sensors team to the Amphenol family. We especially look forward to the strength of the combined breadth of our company's highly complementary sensor product portfolios, which, we believe, will enable us to offer our customers an expanded array of innovative technologies across multiple end markets.  We expect the MTS Sensors business to add approximately $350 million of sales and $0.05 in adjusted diluted earnings per share in the first 12 months after closing. More importantly, though, we look forward to realizing the long-term benefits of the opportunities created by the collective strengths of Amphenol and MTS Sensors for many years to come. We're truly excited about this significant acquisition, which ultimately has positioned Amphenol as one of the broadest and most diversified sensor companies in the industry.  In addition to the MTS acquisition, we also closed on 2 other small acquisitions during the first quarter. In February, we acquired Euromicron, a manufacturer of highly engineered fiber optic interconnect solutions for the mobile networks and IT datacom markets. Based in Germany, with annual sales of approximately $25 million, Euromicron represents a great addition to our interconnect product offering for customers across the European communications market.  And then in March, we completed the acquisition of Cabelcon from Corning Inc. Cabelcon, which also has sales of approximately $25 million, is a Denmark-based designer and manufacturer of high-technology connectors and interconnect assemblies, primarily for customers in the European broadband market. As we welcome these outstanding companies to the Amphenol family, I remain confident that our acquisition program will continue to create great value for Amphenol. Our ability to identify and execute upon acquisitions and then to successfully bring these new companies into Amphenol remains a core competitive advantage for the company.  Now turning to our trends across our served markets. I would just comment that we remain very pleased that the company's balanced and broad end market diversification continues to create great value. We believe this diversification mitigates the impact of the volatility of individual end markets while continuing to expose us to leading technologies wherever they may arise across the electronics industry. This diversification has become ever more valuable given the many market dynamics related to the COVID-19 pandemic.  Now turning first to the military market. The military market represented 11% of our sales in the quarter. And as we had expected coming into the quarter, sales grew by 3% from prior year and were essentially flat organically with growth in naval, unmanned aerial vehicles, communications and vehicle ground systems, offset by declines or flat performance in other applications. Sequentially, our sales were modestly down by about 3%.  Looking into the second quarter, we expect sales to grow in the low double digits from these first quarter levels as we benefit from the addition of MTS Sensors together with the increased demand for interconnect products. We're especially excited by the addition of the sensors products of MTS to our military product offering. Together with our already leading interconnect products as well as our broad exposure across virtually all defense programs, we look forward to supporting the continued adoption of next-generation electronics into a wide array of military hardware.  The commercial aerospace market represented 2% of our sales in the quarter. And not surprisingly, and as expected, sales were down significantly, declining by 47% from prior year as the commercial aircraft market continued to experience unprecedented declines in demand for new aircraft due to the ongoing pandemic-related disruptions to the global travel industry. Sequentially, our sales were a bit better than expected, moderating by just 3% from the fourth quarter.  And looking into the second quarter, we do expect a sequential improvement in sales as we benefit from our recently completed acquisitions. Regardless of the ongoing challenging environment in commercial air, our team working in this market remains committed to leveraging the company's strong interconnect and sensor technology position across a wide array of aircraft platforms and next-generation systems integrated into those airplanes.  The industrial market represented 24% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in industrial in the first quarter were better than expected, growing a very strong 33% in U.S. dollars and 33% organically. This was driven by robust growth in battery and electric heavy vehicle applications, rail mass transit, heavy equipment, instrumentation, factory automation, alternative energy and medical, really a broad performance across many of the segments. On a sequential basis, sales grew by a better-than-expected 6% versus the fourth quarter.  Looking into the second quarter, we expect the industrial market to once again grow in the low teens versus the first quarter. And as we benefit from the addition of MTS Sensors, while continuing to gain momentum in many segments of the industrial market. The acquisition of MTS Sensors has expanded our range of sensors sold into the industrial market, adding position, vibration, force and shock sensors that are used in a wide array of industrial applications.  Together with our existing sensor operations, we now have a diversified range of sensors supporting virtually all of the segments of the industrial market that we serve. I remain truly proud of our team working across the industrial market around the world. Our high-technology interconnect antenna and sensor offering positions us strongly with customers who are accelerating their adoption of electronics, no matter the application. The automotive market represented 22% of our sales in the quarter, and sales in this market were also much stronger than we expected, growing 52% in U.S. dollars and 44% organically, as our team was able to execute strongly in the face of a robust and broad recovery in the automotive market.  In particular, we saw very strong growth of our products that are used in electric and hybrid electric vehicles in the quarter. A great confirmation of our global team's long-term efforts at designing in high-voltage and other interconnect and sensor products into these important next-generation platforms. Sequentially, our sales increased by 6% from the fourth quarter.  Now as has been widely reported, there are a variety of supply chain challenges facing the automotive industry. Accordingly, as we look towards the second quarter, we do expect a modest sequential decline in sales as the global supply chain disruptions temporarily impact certain pockets of new vehicle production. I'm extremely proud of our team working in the automotive market. They have really demonstrated their agility and resiliency through these most turbulent times and thereby, have secured the company's position with our customers across the automotive market. We look forward to benefiting from their efforts long into the future.  The mobile devices market represented 12% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in this market increased by a better-than-expected 51% from prior year, with strength across all product types, including particularly in wearables and laptops. Sequentially, our sales declined by 35%, which was a bit better than our expectations coming into the quarter and is within the typical range of first quarter seasonality that we have seen traditionally in the mobile devices market.  Looking at the second quarter, we anticipate a further high single-digit sequential sales decline, which is also not atypical for this market in the second quarter. While mobile devices will always remain one of our most volatile markets, our outstanding and uniquely agile team is poised as always to capture any opportunities for incremental sales that may arise in 2021 and beyond. Our leading array of antennas, interconnect products and mechanisms continues to enable a broad range of next-generation mobile devices, thereby positioning us well for the long term.  Now turning to the mobile networks market. This market represented 6% of our sales in the quarter, and sales did grow from prior year by 4% in U.S. dollars and 1% organically, as strength from products sold to OEMs was offset in part by a moderation of our sales to network operators. We were encouraged, though, to realize a better-than-expected sequential growth of 19% in the mobile networks market in the quarter as mobile network operators increased their spending on next-generation networks.  Looking to the second quarter, we do expect a modest increase in sales from these first quarter levels, helped by the addition of Euromicron, which expands our offering for mobile networks operators in Europe and positions us well to support future network upgrades. Our team continues to work aggressively to expand our position in next-generation equipment and systems around the world. And as our customers ramp up the investment of these advanced networks, we look forward to benefiting from the increased potential that comes from our unique position with both original equipment manufacturers as well as mobile network service providers.  The information technology and data communications market represented 19% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in the quarter were stronger than expected, rising 25% in U.S. dollars and 24% organically from prior year, really on broad-based strength across networking, storage and server applications. While we had expect sales to decline coming out of the fourth quarter, we were pleased to realize actually a sequential growth of 6% as customers continue to increase their demand for our high-technology products, use service providers and in data centers around the world. Looking to the second quarter, we expect a further increase of sales in the mid-single digits from these levels as customer demand continues to accelerate.  We remain very encouraged by the company's outstanding technology position in the global IT datacom market. Our customers around the world, no doubt about it, are continuing to drive their equipment to ever higher levels of performance in order to manage the dramatic increases in demand for bandwidth and processor power. In turn, our team remains singularly focused on enabling this continuing revolution in IT datacom with our unique, high-speed, power and other interconnect products. Finally, the broadband market represented 4% of our sales in the quarter, and sales grew by a very strong 16% from prior year as broadband spending levels remained elevated.  On a sequential basis, sales grew slightly from the fourth quarter. We do expect a high-teens sequential sales increase in the second quarter as customers continue to upgrade the capacity of their networks to support the significant increase in demand for bandwidth and as we benefit from our recent acquisitions, including Cabelcon. The addition of Cabelcon expands our offering for broadband customers in the European market, which enables us to provide a more diversified range of products for their next-generation networks and the related upgrades.  We look forward to continuing to offer this expanded product offering to broadband service operators around the world, all of whom are working to increase bandwidth to support the expansion of high-speed data applications to homes and businesses.  Now turning to our outlook, and given the current still dynamic market environment as well as assuming no new material disruptions from the COVID-19 pandemic and constant exchange rates. For the second quarter, we now expect sales in the range of $2.415 billion to $2.475 billion and adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $0.53 to $0.55. This would represent strong sales growth of 22% to 25% and adjusted diluted EPS growth of 33% to 38% compared to the second quarter of last year. And I would just note that the second quarter of last year, as you will recall, was already a strong recovery quarter for the company coming out of the first quarter.  I remain confident in the ability of our outstanding management team to adapt to the ongoing challenges that are in the marketplace and to capitalize on the many future opportunities to grow our market position and expand our profitability. The entire Amphenol organization remains committed to delivering long-term sustainable value, all while prioritizing the continued safety and health of each of our employees around the world.  And most importantly, I'd like to just take this opportunity to thank the entire Amphenol team for their truly outstanding efforts here in the first quarter. And with that, operator, we'd be happy to take whatever questions there may be. Yes. Well, thanks very much, Chris. I mean first, relative to supply chain and our robust results in the first quarter, I mean I would tell you that across the board, customers want our product because their end customers, by and large, also need the product. Whether that's delivering IT datacom connectors that go into web service providers to satisfy the demand for bandwidth that is happening, whether it's automotive customers scrambling to build as many cars as they can, given the low inventory -- low dealer inventories that are out there, we really saw customers taking product and converting that product into their end systems.  And we don't -- obviously don't get full visibility into the warehouses of our customers, but we do get some visibility into the distribution channel. And there, we did not see any material increases in inventory or any noticeable inventory builds. I mean actually, to the contrary, our growth in distribution, our book-to-bill in distribution was not meaningfully higher than what we saw across the total company.  Relative to the second quarter, look, we think there's a very strong guidance from several perspectives. First and foremost, there are these supply chain challenges. And I think some of these have been widely reported, in particular, in places like the automotive market, where I talked about that we do see the automotive market having a slight downtick in demand in the second quarter as certain customers have had to take factories offline or otherwise curtail production because of supply chain challenges. So there's no doubt that we see that.  As well, when you look at, on a year-over-year basis, our second quarter guidance, as I mentioned just a few moments ago, this is a very strong guidance, 25% growth at the high end of guidance. And that's on top of a second quarter last year where we had grown already 7% sequentially from the first quarter. You'll also remember that in our mobile devices business, we had a very strong comeback last year in the second quarter. And so that 25% comparison, when seen in the context of last year, I think, is a very, very robust demand.  In terms of the orders, yes, these are very strong orders that we received in the quarter. And could there be some customers who are maybe opening up the aperture of their order scheduling, ordering a little bit longer out? There could be some of that. I think we have some customers, there are many across the supply chain who are a little skittish because of some of the challenges that are so widely reported and that I'm sure all of you know even better than I do, and that can cause some customers to maybe order a little bit more in advance, not to build inventory per se, but to get it on the books.  But look, all that being said, if you look at our orders on a year-over-year basis, they also grew at a similar rate to what our sales grew, about 27%, I think, was the order growth. And I think they're reflective of strong demand on our products from our customers, who we have consistently supported through all cycles of this crisis. And when you look at our performance across each of the individual markets, it's clear that customers are coming back to us because we were there for them when they needed us the most. Well, Wamsi, it's a great question. And it's still a proposed infrastructure plan, obviously. So I take everything with a grain of salt, in particular, with the political system that we have now in the U.S. But look, I think we have a lot of our businesses that do stand to play a role in upgrading the infrastructure of the U.S., especially because infrastructure is being defined, as I would think it should be, in a very broad sense.  It's not just roads and highways and bridges and tunnels and airports, which would stimulate demand for a wide variety of products that we sell into heavy equipment and otherwise. But infrastructure means the domestic capacity to produce electronic components in certain cases. Infrastructure means bandwidth. Infrastructure means access to data, access to devices. And I think that all of these things ultimately today have a common thread, and that is that the adoption of electronics and, in turn, our ability to enable that adoption of electronics, plays a significant role in the upgrade of those various \"elements\" of infrastructure.  And so whatever the -- ends up coming out of kind of the sausage factory at Washington, if you will, there's no question to me that electronics is going to play a significant role in helping this country to upgrade its infrastructure in the broadest sense. And I think we're very well positioned across our end markets to play some constructive role in that. Well, thank you very much, Amit, and greetings to you as well. Look, I think the numbers here a little bit speak for themselves. When you look at our overall growth, growing 28% or 23% organically in the quarter, or when you look at some of the individual markets where we had significant growth in a number of our markets, clearly outpacing whatever the industry growth rate will be. And I'm not an expert in exactly what various industry growth rates are. But clearly, growing in industrial by 33% organically and automotive by 44% organically and mobile devices by 51% organically and IT datacom by 25%. Those are clearly ahead of the overall industry growth rates.  And you're correct. I think there is a meaningful component of that growth, which is our ability to react quickly, despite a very challenging environment. It should not be understated. There still remains many challenges today in the world, both with COVID and with the supply chain. But our ability to react quickly in an entrepreneurial and agile fashion to satisfy the demand of customers when they need it has been, I think, through this whole cycle, an extraordinary advantage that we brought to bear.  And as customers think for the long term about with whom do they want to partner, it's going to be very hard to forget who was there for you when the chips were down at the greatest moment. Who was there for you during the depths of the pandemic when bandwidth was at such a premium and factories were closing all over place because of shutdown orders and the spread of the virus, and who was there to react when you needed to help you support your end customers. And I think that is something that our customers reflect on, integrate into their buying behavior, incorporate into their decisions about who should be their partner going forward.  And so does that mean that we have a high potential to continue to outpace the market? And we've outgrown the market for now 2 decades. And I think that this just reinforces for our customers why having Amphenol as your first phone call is a really important principle and a very helpful way to run your supply chain. Thank you very much, Jim. I mean, look, our criteria for acquisitions has always started with two things, and that's people and the products, in other words, the technology that those companies have. And so the very first test for us is, are we acquiring a company that has people who have passion, drive, integrity and entrepreneurial spirit that we think will fit into the Amphenol organization. And then second, do they have unique enabling technologies that ultimately solve real problems for their customers. And then when we found those companies, we don't focus on either growth or on improvement in operating performance. We try to do both of those things.  And our acquisition program, which has been so successful over so many years, has really been successful because we were able to find ways to accelerate the growth of those companies and find ways to improve their operating performance. And so I would say that the 3 acquisitions that we're talking about today, of course, MTS being far and away bigger than Euromicron or Cabelcon, they all share that great potential, both from a top line growth perspective, taking advantage of being part of Amphenol, taking advantage of being part of a global company with strong partnership, preferred supplier relationships with customers across all of our end markets, but also being part of a company that has access to low-cost manufacturing when appropriate, who has access to collaborative initiatives across the company from a technology or sourcing perspective that ultimately can help to drive better operating performance. And so I would say, with these 3 companies, we think that they all have great growth and profitability improvement potential, despite their very different scales. And Matt, I would just add to that a little color. There are certain parts of this, which are pretty significant cost differences in commodities, for example. I mean, they're all very well reported. And the way that Amphenol operates is we have close to 125 general managers around the world, and each of them is really tuning their operation in light of the costs that are hitting them, in particular.  So you take an example, a general manager in our cable business, which has a very high component of material cost, very significant in our cable segment, there's not a choice, but to go and work with customers and to make sure you take a leadership position in adjusting price to account for those commodity prices. And we would certainly expect that others in the industry would have that same dynamic. And that's just one example of how it goes.  But the beauty is that these general managers have every tool available to them to adjust, whether it's from the price you sell to the customer, to every element of cost are all in the power of the general managers. And when you see a sudden increase in some of these things, it can take a short while to work through it. But Craig and I are confident that over time, our team is going to manage this, as they always have. Thanks so much, Mark. I mean, look, the answer I'll give you is really 2 sides. The answer is no, we think that our approach, our culture, the unique entrepreneurial organizational structure that we have had in Amphenol for many decades is uniquely tailored to an environment like we've been in and to an environment like we're headed into. But the other answer is yes, every day, meaning we're making changes every day. We're not making those changes from here at headquarters. We're not deciding on a blanket approach like we're going to go out of one country and go into this country, or we're going to increase our inventory this much or we're going to change how we're sourcing things. But those general managers around the world are every day making course corrections. And some of them pretty significant course corrections in the moment to react to the environment that is around them.  So when tariffs came in, you'll remember this already, it seems like so long ago that there was the thing called tariffs several years ago. But our team immediately reacted to that in every way possible from moving production to changing logistical flows, to doing lots of other things to passing on the price to customers when there was no other option. And that was a real-time, in the moment kind of transformation, but not at a corporate level, rather it was at the individual operating unit levels.  And I think as we've gone through the pandemic, as we see the very robust demand coming out of this part of the cycle, we're making lots of changes every day to make sure that we remain the most competitive, that we are able to outperform the market at the highest degree possible and that we're able to deliver to the bottom line superior operating profitability and ultimately convert that to cash. And those are just day-to-day decisions that are made by our general managers, obviously, in some consultation with us. But ultimately, the proof, I think, is really in the pudding of that approach. Thanks very much, Craig. I think you're roughly accurate about the operating margins with MTS. Obviously, there will be some amortization, and we include amortization in our numbers, so that they can have a little bit of downward impact on the operating margins. But you're right, I mean every company who comes into Amphenol thinks about how are they going to achieve, ultimately, that growth in margins to get up to the Amphenol corporate average or above.  Obviously, an average is just an average, and there are some above and some below. And I would tell you that the management team in the MTS Sensors business is an extraordinarily capable team of individuals. The gentleman who leads that business, who led the business inside of MTS, who, by the way, led the predecessor family-owned company that was acquired by MTS, I mean this is a just truly outstanding individual who also likes to see that his company is doing as well as his sister companies. And there's no doubt about it that there's a little bit of peer pressure inside of Amphenol when you come in and see the margins of your peers. And something tells me that that's an organization that does not want to be below the average. And how long is that going to take? That's always a question. But when there's is a will, there's a way. And I think this is a team that has an extraordinary will to make that happen.  In terms of the markets with the MTS Sensors business, I talked already that they have strong position in industrial and military and then in commercial air and automotive, roughly in that order, I would say, in terms of magnitude. And they participate in just some of the most exciting applications within those. MTS makes products that are really at the cutting edge of the harsh environment, high-performance requirements of some of these systems. So when you're making like a turbine, and that turbine, be it a gas turbine or a windmill, and you want to know that, that thing is operating with good function and smoothly and that there's no issues inside the turbine. You're going to use a sensor from MTS, or a number of sensors, let me say, that are going to be in the most harsh of environments, hot, out in the middle of the ocean, you name it, that are going to ultimately tell you, is your system working or not and do you need to go maintain that. That's just one example of these extraordinary harsh environment vibration, force, pressure and position sensors that they sell.  I had the good fortune to go around to several of the factories just in the last couple of weeks. And had been there, of course, before. But going now as the owner is a little bit different. And not only do you see products that are truly at the high leading edge of sensor technology, but these are sensor products where the harsh environment interconnect packaging of those sensors is almost of equal import to the good functioning of the product in the systems where they participate.  And so we see just great opportunities in the industrial market, across many segments of the industrial market, in the military market, as I spoke earlier, where we have already a leading position in military interconnect. We're just really excited to now have a significant position also in sensors in the military market as well in automotive and in commercial air. And so we see great opportunities really across the markets of MTS and look forward to taking full advantage for many years to come. Thanks, Will. Yes, I mean, it's a tough time in the commercial air market. There's no doubt about it. I mean it's hard to think of a market that was not -- that was more heavily impacted over the last 1.5 years than the commercial air market. It represents now just 2% of our sales. And we did guide it up sequentially in the quarter ahead. Although I would say that that's really the impact of the MTS Sensors acquisition. I don't know that I would necessarily say that I'm kind of calling a bottom, so to speak. But clearly, the rate is declining. The rate of decline on a sequential basis is getting smaller. It's down by just 3% sequentially in the quarter, which is, I guess, a green shoot of encouragement, if you will.  But the commercial air market has a tough road ahead of it. And our team working in that market is doing everything they can to continue to diversify their business to make sure that the products that they sell, which have other applications, are being proliferated and we're re-devoting resources to designing in those products into other applications, where they can be very enabling technologies such that when the commercial air market does eventually come back, which it will, we're not going back to horses and buggies, we will be flying again one day. And I hope to be doing so very soon after I get my second shot tomorrow morning together with Craig. That market will come back. And when it comes back, our operations working in that market will be stronger than ever because they will have taken this opportunity to diversify themselves, diversify their product sets, leverage their resources in a broader fashion. And I think that's the way to deal with a crisis like this, and that's always been the Amphenol way. Yes. Look, Joe, we try to have the best of both worlds in sourcing. And so at the end of the day, sourcing happens under the purview of those 125 general managers around the world. And sometimes it's good to be small and sometimes it's good to be big. And what we try to do is we present ourselves as whichever is most beneficial in the moment. So we oftentimes are a few general managers who buy a common material will work together and they may go together to a vendor. That's what gets us the results that we need. But in other cases, it's a very local decision where maybe a purchasing person says to a local sales rep, hey, just sneak me what I need here, no one's going to notice. And in between both of those, there's a whole spectrum of techniques, strategies, tactics that our supply chain team around the world will be taking.  The most important principle, though, is this, if you have supply chain disconnected from the business, it's actually really hard to decide, ultimately, am I doing the right thing? How do I -- what if I need to redesign something? Well, if there's this monolithic engineering team and a monolithic sourcing team and the sourcing team says, we can't get this part, we need to redesign it, and it has to go sort of up and down the corporate chain to get that redesign resources to be allocated or to convince the engineer to do so, that can be a very laborious process.  Whereas in our organization, the purchasing person is sitting in the door right next to the engineering person reporting to the general manager who's 2 doors down from her. And they can just get in the room together and say, look, we can't find this thing, let's redesign it right now, let's reallocate the resources, let's make it happen. And it's that kind of real-time, connected to the business approach. Whether it is dealing with shortages, whether it's dealing with logistical challenges, whether it's dealing with quality issues, whether it's dealing with new design, whatever, we've always found that, that approach can be very effective. But we try to be what will make us be the most successful, let's say that. Sure. Well, thanks very much, David. I mean, you know the underlying market much better than I do. You could teach a master class on it, for sure. But what I would tell you is our team in all regions really performed very strongly here. And we saw great growth really across the board, across the regions. And we saw disproportionate growth from new programs that we're -- that we've long worked to design ourselves in on relative to EVs. But it wasn't exclusively EVs. We saw growth in lots of other new platforms as well.  And I think our long-term share gains in the automotive market, and I referenced this earlier, is really a function of us focusing our efforts on next-generation technologies in car, next-generation systems, next-generation applications, everything from passenger comfort and connectivity, to safety, to engine management, emissions control and obviously, high voltage related to EVs and hybrid EVs.  And I think all of those things are helping us to outperform the broader market in a quarter like we just had here in the first quarter, but also over a very long time period. We're really talking about the better part of the decade, where we have had a relatively consistent performance that is a decent amount, if not far in excess of the underlying unit production volumes that are out there.  So there's not like 1 silver bullet to this. I think it's been a collective approach. It's been our acquisition program, where we've added new companies, both interconnect, antenna and sensor companies. And it's a lot of work on engineering of next-generation systems that go into these cars across all of the regions. And I think when we put all that together, ultimately, we've seen strong performance. Thank you, Samik. Well, look, we're really pleased with the sequential growth that we saw in this market. Obviously, that's a market that, over the last year or 2, has not always had the most robust growth as the operators have somehow struggled. There's been a lot of corporate things going on, delays in investment last year. We also saw some redeployment of the investment towards really the core of the networks to support the massive growth in bandwidth. But we've always talked about the fact that our team has been working diligently over many years to design in our products into next-generation systems and networks, be they 5G or otherwise.  And I think we start to see kind of some early progress with that here in the first quarter. And to the extent that operators are expanding their investment, we would hope to benefit from that. It may not always be in a perfect quarter-to-quarter correlation. We don't have a position with absolutely every operator with the exact same degree of success. But we have a very strong position on the equipment, that is really going to enable 5G for the long term. And so to the extent that 5G creates incremental capital spending, which, again, has yet to be perfectly articulated, then, for sure, we would feel like we would be in a good position to be able to benefit from that in the medium and long term. Thanks very much, Luke. Yes. No, you picked up on that very astutely. We participate in the electrification of vehicles, whether those are passenger vehicles or commercial vehicles, and both have been really great drivers for us in recent quarters and years. And in the industrial, we talk about that industrial battery and the heavy vehicles. There's a wide range of vehicles that are undergoing electrification right now from big trucks, and there's plenty of news media around that, to postal vehicles and trash trucks and buses and goods vehicles, delivery vans, you name it. And so all of that is what we classify really in our industrial business or industrial market as that battery heavy vehicle.  And then when we talk about automotive, the hybrid EV, that's really passenger cars and the related products. In addition, we think about the charging infrastructure for electrification as really an infrastructure piece and that we think about in our industrial business as well. And that's all -- those are all components of areas where we've seen strong performance in -- certainly in the first quarter and over a number of years and look forward to that. Because I think if you confine your view of electrification just to passenger vehicles, you're missing a really exciting area of the electronics revolution, which is that electrification more broadly.  By the way, I mean, we're working as well with the Department of Defense in certain countries on the electrification of military vehicles, which, I think, is going to be a long process. But over the long term, we see that as an area that can also be another benefit and another growth lever along this just real kind of, call it, a megatrend, if you will, of electrification across kind of all things that move. Well, this is Mr. Norwitt. But anyway, thank you very much, and we truly appreciate everybody's time today on the call. And I did want to take a moment just to wish everybody good health here. And I hope everybody is getting the chance to be vaccinated soon, wherever you may be. And I wanted to make just a special comment and note about any of you who may have friends or family in India. We obviously have an organization in India, and we're very carefully attentive to the ongoing situation with the pandemic there and doing our part to help the communities in India. And I just wanted to send our best wishes to any of you on the phone here today with family and friends in India. It's a fabulous country, and I'm sure they're going to work their way through this difficult stage in the pandemic.  Thank you all to everybody and wish you all good health, and we'll talk to you all in the next 90 days."

        "content": "Operator: Hello, and welcome to the Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call for Amphenol Corporation. Following the presentation, there will be a formal question-and-answer session. Until then, all lines will remain in a listen-only mode. At the request of the company, today's conference is being recorded today. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce today's conference host, Mr. Craig Lampo. Sir, you may begin.\nCraig Lampo: Good afternoon, everyone. This is Craig Lampo, Amphenol's CFO, and I'm here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO. We would like to wish everyone Happy New Year and welcome you to our fourth quarter 2022 conference call. Our fourth quarter 2022 results were released this morning. I will provide some financial commentary, and then Adam will give an overview of the business and current trends, then we will take questions. As a reminder, during the call, we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures and make certain forward-looking statements. So please refer to the relevant disclosures in our press release for further information. In addition, all prior year comparative data discussed during this year is on a continuing operations basis. The company closed the fourth quarter with sales of $3.239 billion and GAAP and adjusted diluted EPS of $0.82 and $0.78, respectively. Fourth quarter sales were up 7% in U.S. dollars 11% local currencies and 8% organically, compared to the fourth quarter of 2021. Sequentially, sales were down by 2% in U.S. dollars, 1% in local currencies and 2% organically. Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes. For the full-year 2022, sales were a record $12.623 billion, which were up 16% U.S. dollars 19% in local currencies and 15% organically, compared to 2021. Orders in the quarter were $2.884 billion, which was down 12%, compared to the fourth quarter of 2021 and 8% sequentially, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 0.89:1. This was driven by lower bookings in the communications related markets. For the full-year, orders were $12.925 billion, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.02:1. GAAP and adjusted operating income were $666 million and $676 million, respectively, in fourth quarter of 2022. GAAP and adjusted operating margin were 20.6% and 20.9% respectively in the fourth quarter. On a GAAP basis, operating margin increased by 100 basis points, compared to the fourth quarter of \u201921 and decreased by 10 basis points, sequentially. GAAP operating margin for the fourth quarter included approximately $10 million of acquisition related costs. On an adjusted basis, operating margin increased by 80 basis points, compared to the fourth quarter of \u201921 and decreased by 10 basis points sequentially. The year-over-year increase in adjusted operating margin was driven by strong operating leverage on the higher sales volumes, as well as the benefit of ongoing pricing actions. On a sequential basis, the slight decrease in adjusted operating margin reflected normal downside conversion on the lower sales levels. For the year 2022, GAAP operating margin was 20.5% and adjusted operating margin was 20.7%, when compared to 2021, adjusted operating margin increased by 70 basis points, which was primarily driven by normal operating leverage on higher sales volumes, as well as the benefit of pricing actions. Given the overall cost and supply chain headwinds we experienced in 2022, we are very proud that our adjusted operating margin equals our previous full-year record operating margin set in 2018. Breaking down fourth quarter and full- year results by segment, in the harsh environment solutions segment, sales were $795 million and $3.107 billion in the fourth quarter and full-year of 2022 respectively. Compared to the prior year fourth quarter, segment sales increased 10% in U.S. dollars and 12% organically. Compared to the full-year 2021, segment sales increased by 13% in U.S. dollars and 15% organically. Segment operating margin was 25.7% and 25.8% in the fourth quarter and full-year of 2022 respectively. In the Communications Solutions segment, sales were $1.436 billion and $5.652 billion in the fourth quarter and full-year of 2022. Compared to the prior year fourth quarter segment sales increased 1% in U.S. dollars and organically, compared to the full-year 2021, segment sales increased by 17% in U.S. dollars and 13% organically. Segment operating margin was 22.2% and 22% in the fourth quarter and full-year of 2022. In the Interconnect and Sensor Systems segment, sales were $1.008 billion and $3.863 billion in the fourth quarter and full-year of 2022. Compared to the prior year fourth quarter, segment sales increased 14% in U.S. dollars and 17% organically. Compared to the full-year 2021, segment sales increased by 17% in U.S. dollars and 18% organically. Segment operating margin was 19.2% and 18.5% in the fourth quarter and full-year of 2022. The company's GAAP effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 19.2% and the adjusted effective tax rate was 24.5%, which compares to 18.8% and 23.8% in the fourth quarter of 2021 respectively. For the full-year 2022, GAAP effective tax rate was 22.3% and adjusted effective tax rate was 24.5%, which compared to 20.6% and 24.3% in 2021. In 2023, we expect our adjusted effective tax rate to be approximately 24%. GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations was $0.82 in the fourth quarter, an increase of 14%, compared to $0.72 in the prior period. Adjusted diluted EPS was $0.78, an increase of 11%, compared to the $0.70 in the fourth quarter of \u201921. This was an excellent result. For the full-year, GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations was $3.06, a 22$ increase from $2.51 in 2021. Adjusted diluted EPS was $3 in 2022, a 21% increase from $2.48 in 2021. Operating cash flow in the fourth quarter was a record $705 million or 147% of adjusted net income and net of capital spending, our free cash flow was a record $613 million or $127% of adjusted net income. We are pleased to have delivered a cash flow yield at these strong levels. For the full-year 2022, operating cash was a record $2.175 billion or 117% of adjusted net income and net of capital spending our free cash flow for 2022 was a record $1.796 billion or 96% of adjusted net income, a very strong result. From a working capital standpoint, inventory days, days sales outstanding and payable days were 86, 73 and 54 days respectively. During the quarter, the company repurchased 2.3 shares of common stock at an average price of approximately $75, bringing total repurchases during 2022 to 9.9 shares or $731 million. When combined with our normal quarterly dividend, total capital return to shareholders in 2022 was more than $1.2 billion. Total debt at December 31 was $4.6 billion and net debt was $3.1 billion. Total liquidity at the end of the quarter was a very strong $4.1 billion, which included cash and short-term investments on hand of $1.4 billion plus availability under existing credit facilities. Fourth quarter and full-year 2022 EBITDA was $798 million and $3.1 billion, respectively. And at the end of the fourth quarter of 2022, our net leverage ratio was 1 times. I also wanted to make a few comments on interest expense. As I mentioned last quarter, due to the rising interest rate environment, our interest expense had increased primarily as a result of our floating rate convertible paper, which represents approximately 14% of our total debt outstanding at the end of the year. Based on current and near-term expected interest rates and debt levels, we expect 2023 quarterly interest expense to be approximately $40 million, which is reflected in our first quarter guidance. I\u2019d now turn it over to Adam, who will provide some commentary on current market trends, as well as the recently completed acquisition this month.\nAdam Norwitt: Well, thank you very much, Craig. And welcome to all of you to our first earnings call of 2023 and I hope it's not too late to wish as well all of you a Happy New Year and to those of you celebrate the Lunar New Year, wish you all a happy year of the rabbit. As Craig mentioned, I'm going to highlight our fourth quarter and full-year 2022 achievements, including some discussion about the acquisitions that we mentioned in our press release. I\u2019ll then discuss our trends and progress in our served markets and then make some comments on our outlook for the first quarter, and of course, we'll have time for questions at the end. Looking to the fourth quarter, our results in the fourth quarter were stronger-than-expected. Exceeding the high-end of our guidance in sales and adjusted diluted earnings per share. Sales grew by 7% in U.S. dollars and 11% in local currencies, reaching $3.239 billion. On an organic basis, our sales increased by 8% and that was driven by robust growth in the broadband, commercial air, automotive and military end markets. And I'll give some more details about those markets in a few moments. The company booked $2.884 billion in orders in the fourth quarter, representing a book-to-bill of 0.89:1, and this negative book-to-bill was driven by order reductions in several of the communications related markets as certain customers adjusted demand in light of excess inventory that they had built up throughout 2022. We're especially pleased to have delivered another quarter of resilient and strong profitability with adjusted operating margins reaching 20.9% and 80 basis point increase from prior year. We achieved these results despite the continued wide range of challenges around the world. Adjusted diluted EPS, as Craig mentioned were $0.78, representing robust growth of 11% from prior year and that's another excellent reflection of our organization's continued strong execution. Finally, the company generated record operating free cash flow in the quarter of $705 million and $613 million, respectively, clear reflections of the quality of the company's earnings. I'm extremely proud of our team around the world and our results this quarter once again reflect the discipline and agility of our entrepreneurial organization as we continue to perform well amidst the challenging and dynamic environment. We're also pleased to announce that we closed the acquisition of Control Measure Regulation Group or CMR just here in January. CMR is based in France and has annual sales of approximately $75 million and they're a manufacturer of a broad array of cable assemblies and complex interconnect assemblies for the industrial market with a particular focus on heavy equipment engine applications. This acquisition further expands our offering of high technology, value-added interconnect products in the diversified industrial market. In addition, we're pleased to have signed an agreement for the acquisition of the North American hybrid and fiber optic cable and cable assembly, as well as the global infrastructure antenna business of RFS at the end of the fourth quarter. Based just down the street from us here in Meriden, Connecticut, RFS is a provider of Interconnect and Antenna products for the mobile networks market with expected sales of approximately $100 million in 2023. This acquisition, which we anticipate will close by the end of the second quarter and thus is not included in our guidance, expands Amphenol\u2019s product offering and presence with mobile network service providers, who are continuing to invest in their next generation 5G networks. As we welcome the outstanding CMR team to Amphenol and look ahead to welcome the RFS team once that transaction closes, we remain confident that our acquisition program will continue to create great value for the company. Our ability to identify and execute upon acquisitions and successfully bring these new companies into Amphenol remains a core competitive advantage for the company. I just want to make a few comments about 2022. And I would just say that 2022 was another very successful year for Amphenol. We expanded our position in the overall market, growing sales by 16% in U.S. dollars, 19% in local currencies and 15% organically reaching a new sales record of $12.623 billion. In fact, over the past three very dynamic years, we're proud to have grown our sales by more than 50% from our 2019 levels, actually 53% to be exact, a great reflection of the company's diversification and agility in these truly dynamic times. Our full-year 2022 adjusted operating margins reached 20.7% and that was an increase of 70 basis points from 2021. This strong level of profitability enabled us to achieve record adjusted diluted EPS of $3. Finally, we generated record operating and free cash flow of $2.175 billion and $1.796 billion respectively, clear confirmations of the company's superior execution and disciplined working capital management. Our acquisition program again created value this year with two new companies added to the Amphenol family in 2022 and one added here already in 2023. CMR, NPI and ICA Holdings have expanded our position across a broad array of technologies, particularly in the industrial market, while bringing outstanding and talented individuals into the Amphenol family. We're excited that these acquisitions, as well as the RFS acquisition, which we expect to close at the end of the second quarter, represent expanded platforms for the company's future performance. We also bought back in 2022 almost 10 million shares under our share buyback program and increased our quarterly dividend by 5%, representing as Craig detailed a total return of capital to shareholders of just over $1.2 billion for the year. Finally and really importantly, especially in this today's dynamic environment, we come out of 2022 in a uniquely robust financial position with the lowest leverage and highest liquidity and availability we've seen really in modern times. And while there continued to be a high level of volatility in the overall market environment in 2022, as we enter 2023, our agile entrepreneurial management team is confident that we have built further strength from which we can drive superior long-term performance. I'd like to spend a little bit of time to talk about our trends and progress across our served markets, and I would just comment that we remain very pleased that our balanced and broad end market diversification continues to create real value for the company with no single end market representing more than 25% of our sales in the year of 2022. We believe this diversification mitigates the impact of the volatility of individual end markets, while continuing to expose us to leading technologies wherever they may arise across the electronics industry. Turning first to the military market, this market represented 10% of our sales in the fourth quarter and 9% of our sales for the full-year. Sales in the quarter grew strongly from prior year, increasing by 11% in U.S. dollars and 13% in local currencies and on an organic basis sales increased by 12% with broad-based growth across virtually all applications, but particularly military vehicles, space and airframes. Sequentially, our sales increased by a better-than-expected 11%. For the full-year 2022, sales grew by 4% in U.S. dollars, 6% in local currencies and 4% organically, reflecting our operational execution, as well as strength in space related unmanned aerial vehicles, ground vehicles and avionics applications. Looking ahead, we expect sales in the first quarter to grow slightly from these fourth quarter levels and we continue to be excited by the strength of the company's position in the defense market, where we offer the industry's broadest array of high technology Interconnect products. As the geopolitical environment has become more dynamic, militaries around the world are expanding their investments in next generation technologies, thereby increasing the demand potential. We look forward to supporting this increased demand with our expanded range of Interconnect and Sensor products, as well as our significant investments in new capacity that we have made in recent years. The commercial aerospace market represented 3% of our sales in the fourth quarter, as well as for the full-year 2022. And in the quarter, our sales grew by very strong 33% in U.S. dollars and 38% in local currency and organic. As we benefited from the continued recovery in the commercial air market. Sequentially, our sales grew by 13% from the third quarter, which was well ahead of our expectations coming into the quarter. For the full-year 2022, sales increased by 36% in U. S dollars, 40% in local currency and 36% organically, reflecting our strong design in positions on a broad range of platforms, as well as the ongoing recovery in demand for aircraft. Looking into the first quarter of \u201923, we expect now a modest sequential moderation in sales. I just want to say how grateful I am to our team that's working in the commercial air market. Over the last three years, they performed really well amidst a truly volatile demand environment. And with the ongoing recovery in travel and thus in demand for jetliners, our team's efforts to strengthen our breadth of high technology Interconnect and Sensor products, while diversifying our market position, including into next generation aircraft are now paying real dividends. We look forward to realizing the benefits of this in 2023 and beyond. Industrial market represented 25percent of our sales both in the fourth quarter and for the full-year and sales in the quarter grew by 7% in U.S. dollars, 12% in local currency and 7% organically from the prior year fourth quarter. This growth was driven in particular by sales into alternative energy, battery and electric heavy vehicle, factory automation, oil and gas and medical applications. On a sequential basis, sales were down by just 1%, which was a bit better than our expectations. For the full-year 2022, sales grew by a strong 14% in U.S. dollars, 19% in local currency and 13% organically, and we really had broad-based growth across virtually all segments of the global industrial market. And looking into the first quarter, we expect sales in the industrial market be roughly at the same level as we achieved here in the fourth quarter. Our outstanding global team working in the industrial market continues to find new opportunities for growth across the many segments of this exciting market. I remain confident that our long-term strategy to expand our high technology Interconnect, Antenna and Sensor offerings, both organically and through complementary acquisitions, has positioned us to capitalize on the many revolutions happening across the industrial electronics market. To that end, the addition of CMR further strengthens our position, particularly in the important heavy equipment segment. And we look forward to realizing the benefits of this strategy for many years to come. The automotive market represented 21% of our sales, both in the fourth quarter and for the full-year and we had another great quarter in automotive sales growing by a strong 21% in U.S. dollars and 31% in local currency and organic. Our growth was broad-based, but was once again particularly robust in hybrid and electric vehicle applications. On a sequential basis, our automotive sales increased by 5%, which was above our prior expectations. For the full-year 2022, I'm very pleased that our sales increased by a strong 22% in U.S. dollars and 29% in local currency and organic, reflecting broad strength across our automotive markets, including in particular in next generation electronics, including electric and hybrid drivetrains. Looking into 2023, we expect a high single-digit sequential moderation of sales in the first quarter from these high levels, driven especially by a seasonal moderation of sales in Asia. I remain extremely proud of our team working in the automotive market. They continue to manage through a dynamic overall environment all while remaining focused on driving new design wins with customers, who are implementing a wide array of new technologies into their vehicles. In particular, our long-term efforts that expanding our range of next generation Interconnects incorporated into electric and hybrid electric vehicles has enabled Amphenol to expand our position with a broad range of customers and thereby created further potential for the future. The mobile devices market represented 12% of our sales in the quarter and 11% of our sales for the full-year 2022. Our sales in the quarter declined from prior year by 11% in U.S. dollars and 7% in local currency and organically, and this was driven by reduced sales of products incorporated into smartphones, laptops, tablets and wearables. Sequentially, our sales declined as we had expected by 10% as demand was impacted by a pull forward of demand into the third quarter as we it discussed 90-days ago. For the full-year 2022, sales in this market increased by 3% in U.S. dollars and 5% organically, as growth in smartphones and wearables was somewhat offset by a moderation in tablets coming off the higher levels of the pandemic. We are pleased with this performance amidst the market with generally muted demand in 2022. As we look into the first quarter of \u201923, we anticipate a seasonal sequential decline of approximately 35%. And while mobile devices will always remain one of our most volatile markets, our outstanding and agile team is poised as always to capture any opportunities for incremental sales that may arise in 2023 and beyond. Our leading array of Antennas, Interconnect products and mechanisms continues to enable a broad range of next generation mobile devices, which positions us well for the long-term. The mobile networks market represented 4% of our sales in the quarter and 5% for the full-year 2022. Sales in the quarter declined from prior year by 8% in U.S. dollars, 6% in local currency and 12% organically as we experienced the pause in demand from operators after a number of quarters of strong growth. Sequentially, our sales declined by a higher-than-expected 17%. For the full-year \u201922, sales grew by 8% from prior year and 3% organically as we saw increased demand for products used in next generation 5G equipment. Looking ahead, we expect a high single-digit sequential reduction in sales in the first quarter as operators continue to moderate their investments. Our team continues to work aggressively to realize the benefits of their efforts to expand our position in next generation 5G equipment and networks around the world. And as customers continue their investments in these systems, we look forward to benefiting from the increased potential that comes from our unique position with both equipment manufacturers and mobile service providers. We're also excited by the pending acquisition of the hybrid and fiber optic cable and antenna assets of RFS, which will further broaden our product offerings for this important market. The information technology and data communications market represented 19% of our sales in the quarter and 21% of sales for the full-year. Sales in the fourth quarter declined by 6% in U.S. dollars, 5% in local currency and 8% organically from prior year as many customers reduced their demand after five consecutive quarters of robust double-digit growth. Sequentially, our sales declined by 11% as we had expected coming into the quarter. For the full-year 2022, our sales in the IT datacom market grew by a strong 18% in U.S. dollars, 19% in local currency and 14% organically as we continue to benefit from our leading technology solutions and design and positions across a wide array of applications. Looking ahead, we expect a roughly 20% sequential decline in sales in the first quarter as our OEM and web service customers continue to moderate their demand levels. Regardless of this current demand pause, we remain encouraged by the company's outstanding position in the global IT datacom market. Our team has done an excellent job developing leading high speed, power and fiber optic Interconnect products that are enabling our OEM and web service provider customers to continue to drive their equipment and networks to higher levels of performance. We look forward to realizing the benefits of that leading position in this important market for many years to come. Finally, the broadband market represented 6% of our sales in the quarter and 5% of our sales for the full-year 2022. Sales increased by a very strong 79% in U.S. dollars, 82% in local currencies and 64% organically as we experienced a significant increase in demand from cable operators for a wide range of our products. On a sequential basis, sales grew by a much better-than-expected 19%. For the full-year 2022 sales grew by 62% in U.S. dollars and 38% organically, as we benefited from strong demand from broadband service operators, who are both upgrading and expanding their data networks, as well as from the Halo acquisition completed last year. Looking ahead, we expect sales to decline in the low double-digits from these levels, due to seasonal adjustments from customers. We remain encouraged by the company's expanding position in the broadband market and we look forward to continuing to support our service provider customers around the world, all of whom are working to increase their bandwidth to support the proliferation of high-speed data applications to homes and businesses. And in certain cases in furtherance of government programs to expand broadband. Now just in summary, I want to comment on our outlook. The current economic environment remains highly uncertain. In addition, as we did discuss earlier, we have seen certain customers in the communications markets reduce their demand as they normalize inventory levels. Assuming market conditions do not meaningfully worsen and also assuming constant exchange rates. For the first quarter, we expect sales in the range of $2.840 billion to $2.900 billion and adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $0.65 to $0.67. This would represent a sales decline of 2% to 4% and adjusted diluted EPS of flat to down 3%, compared to the first quarter of \u201922. I remain confident in the ability of our outstanding management team to adapt to the many opportunities and challenges in the current environment and to continue to grow our market position, while driving sustainable and robust profitability over the long-term. And finally, I'd like to take this opportunity to thank our entire team around the world for their truly outstanding efforts here in the fourth quarter and for the full-year of 2022. And with that, operator, we'd be very happy to take any questions.\nOperator: Thank you. The question-and-answer period will now begin. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Guy Hardwick with Credit Suisse. You may go ahead.\nGuy Hardwick: Hi, good afternoon.\nAdam Norwitt: Good afternoon.\nGuy Hardwick: I think I'll leave the questions on guidance to callers after me. But Adam, just when I speak to investors about Amphenol, they push back initially, if they don't know the company that well, that's why isn't this company exposed to commodity price deflation if it's selling components to the electronics industry. What was your -- what would be your pushback on that? And maybe if you could talk about some of the content drivers in connectors and other products?\nAdam Norwitt: Yes. Well, thanks so much, Guy. And I think what you're referring to is, kind of, Moore's Law, which says that over time, whether it's every 18-months or some approximation thereof, that electronics tend to get a doubling of the performance for the given price. And I think that, that is true in electronics that if you look at what we -- the devices that we use today, the networks that we use today, we get so much more out of those things given the increase or even in certain cases, not increase of what we pay for those things today. And so it comes down then to innovation. And are we, as a company, innovating, developing products that are enabling our customers' applications and allowing our customers to sell value. And so you mentioned commodity. And we don't view our products as a commodity. Actually, we view them as a very precious piece of jewelry almost that the Interconnect products that we make from connectors to value-add Interconnect, Sensors, Antennas, these are highly critical components that go into very complex systems, everything from mobile devices all the way up to fighter jets and everything in between. And they represent also a very high risk and relatively low value as a percentage of the total bill of materials. And thus, if you can embed technology, if you can embed value, if you can be there for your customers, well, then your customers will be willing to share with you some of the value that they're able to realize on the sale of the end product. And so the difference between, kind of, a standard commodity is something that you see the price trading on an exchange somewhere, and ours is just a chasm of distance between them, because our products are enabling technology. They're very much application specific. We're selling hundreds of thousands and millions of different products to tens of thousands of customers and millions of different applications around the world. And if our product doesn't work, that small little thing in the system, then ultimately, the system itself doesn't perform for its customers. And so it's up to us to develop innovative new technologies on a consistent basis to be able to execute on behalf of our customers to do that with high quality, high reliability with a breadth of products so customers can come to us all at once. And if we can do that consistently, then we're able to realize good margins while also controlling the cost on our side. And that's another piece of this, which is that at the end of the day, margin is price minus cost. And so we have to control the price by selling value to our customers. We have to control the cost by ensuring that every element of cost is controlled and treated as it was coming out of our own pockets. And that comes really from the entrepreneurial organization, the 130 general managers around the world, who all treat the company's money as if it were their own. And the fact that we don't have cost centers in the company, we have a tiny little headquarters. And so that control on cost together with selling value through technology ultimately allows us to realize robust margins on a consistent basis.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. You may go ahead.\nAmit Daryanani: Thanks for taking my question. I feel, I guess, Adam, I'm hoping you can just maybe talk a little bit more about the March quarter guide. You folks are talking about revenue being down double-digits sequentially. And I don't want you to repeat all these segments discussion, but you sort of talking about 2 times normal seasonality. Perhaps you just talk about what are the one or two segments you think that are performing worse than what you would expect them to do in the normal seasonal environment? And then to the extent this weakness that you see in March, do you think it's more demand weakness? Or is it more inventory adjustment by our customers? Thank you.\nAdam Norwitt: Thanks so much, Amit. There's a little bit of static on the line, but I think I heard the question well. Look, our guidance that we've given here, and I think I talked a lot about by each segment, but let me just put a finer point on this. If you just take two of our end markets and the guidance that I discussed and that's mobile devices and IT datacom, which are two of our largest communications markets, those represent about two-thirds collectively of the implied sequential reduction in sales from the fourth quarter to the first quarter. And I think we talked about in IT datacom that we clearly see a, sort of, reduction in orders from customers, because of elevated inventory levels. And there may be some demand layered into that, as well as our customer -- as the end customers, kind of, pause their build-outs, but we shouldn't forget one thing about IT datacom. We shouldn't forget that this is a market, first of all, that since 2019, we've grown that market by more than 70% during that time period that our customers have had to increase their output and their construction of their networks in order to satisfy a true explosion of demand for the Internet. And I think the underlying drivers of that, whether that be a video over the Internet or the use of certain tools that we didn't ever use before, the data traffic on the Internet is not dropping. I think what we are seeing is maybe a pause and a kind of realignment because these companies went real gangbusters for a number of years. But the structural increase of data traffic over the Internet in the broadest sense, that's something that we believe, and I think we're in good company believing that we'll continue for a long time to come. On mobile devices, I think we talked about the fact that during the course of the pandemic, there was a real surge in mobile device demand, as people had to detach from their offices and go home, things like tablets, things like computers, upgrades of phones and the like. Let alone the fact that everybody had a lot of disposable income to buy new things in their ears and on their wrists and otherwise. And I think there's been some relaxation of demand that's well reported, and you yourself have talked a lot about that in a variety of reports here in 2022. And regardless of that, our team did a fabulous job this year, driving 5% organic growth in 2022. But we're reacting to the demand that we hear from our customers. We're not losing share. Quite the contrary. But the demand expectations of our customers here in the first quarter really result in the guidance that we've given. So I would maybe point to those two markets, most particularly, which represent just roughly two-thirds of the sequential decline in our outlook.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Matt Sheerin with Stifel. You may go ahead.\nMatt Sheerin: Yes, thanks. Good afternoon and Happy New Year, everyone. Adam, it's just a question regarding the industrial markets. In addition to your acquisitions, you've been growing really well organically. And there was some concern that those industrial markets typically lag some of the other markets like consumer and datacom. There's also concerns about inventory build, but it sounds like you're relatively optimistic in terms of the drivers across those diversified markets. So any color you can give on your outlook there would be great?\nAdam Norwitt: Yes. Thanks so much, Matt, and Happy New Year back to you. No, look, our industrial market has a real bright spot for us over these three years. And I just mentioned how IT datacom since 2019 has grown by 70%. Our industrial business has actually grown by more than 90% during that time period. And we've added some amazing acquisitions across Interconnect and Sensors, but we've also driven really strong organic growth. And I think, last year, we grew by 13% organically. In \u201821, we grew by 27% organically and really on a wide swatch of the industrial market, which is very, very diversified inside it. This industrial lag consumer and datacom, I don't have a really good opinion about that, I think they're quite different markets. You have a lot of very different demand drivers. And if you think about what are the underlying drivers of demand in industrial, well, think about the things that are in the headlines today. Things like investments in infrastructure, things like electrification, things like decarbonization, which includes everything from infrastructure to support electrification, which includes things like alternative energy generation, which includes things like natural gas conversion and pipelines. And we've actually seen funny enough, like strong performance in both our alternative energy business, but also our oil and gas business. Both of those are really showing really strong momentum right now. And I wouldn't think that any of those correlate necessarily to a consumer or a datacom world. Is there inventory in the supply chain of industrial? I don't have good evidence to say, yes or no to that. I'm sure if you looked at a variety of publicly traded balance sheets, you may see some evidence of and some evidence of not. We do look in our distribution channel in there. I think inventories are healthy. They're not crazy. I mean, they may be up a touch or two, but not out of whack to the overall demand environment. Look, industrial is going through a true revolution. And when you think about everything from electrification, electronification, all the underlying drivers that I talked about, I think we've done a fabulous job, and our team in that area has done a fabulous job, both organically, as well as identifying and bringing to the Amphenol family great companies like CMR this quarter and many others over the last three, four years that put the company in a strong position going forward.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. You may go ahead.\nSamik Chatterjee: Hi, Adam. Hi, Craig. Thanks for taking the question and Happy New Year. I guess the question I had was more on the margins. You had pretty robust margins in the fourth quarter. But as you're sort of looking in terms of the end market outlook and some of this sub-seasonal sort of trajectory starting off the year. How should we think about the puts and takes on the margin and also in relation to some of the acquisitions that you've done recently? What sort of impact on the margin will that have? How resilient are these sort of margin levels at this point? Thank you.\nCraig Lampo: Great. Thanks, Samik, and Happy New Year to you. Yes, I think that if you think about our margin, I mean, I think I'd start off by just saying how proud we are of the margins performance that we've had in 2022. We really have, ultimately -- I mean, throughout 2022, we really done, I think, a great job of just expanding our margins, even sequentially converting, kind of, higher than our normal conversion with the cost actions, with the pricing actions we've had to take. And thus -- and really hitting our 21% in Q3, which is kind of a timing of record and really 20.9% in Q4 and then 20.7%, which matches the record of 2018. So I'm really happy with certainly achieving those. And as we guide here into the first quarter, we're guiding down, I'd say, above seasonal and then we talked about -- Adam just talked about that in response to a previous question. And I think if you, kind of, look at the markets, we've always said that our markets don't really drive kind of our margins. So we don't have significant margin differences of a significant range within our markets, except for broadband, we've talked about before, which was our old cable business. But other than that, I think the markets are similar operating margins and drive similar conversion level. So I wouldn't really talk about that as being a place where it's driving a change in the way our overall conversions would look. We talked about decrementals and kind of that close to 30% range. We're kind of seeing a little -- even slightly less than that as we're guiding here into the first quarter. And I think that just goes to the management team and how well they have done in regards to responding to some of these areas where we have seen some headwinds from a demand perspective in IT data, which is declining at above normal rate typically. And then in the first quarter, they're taking great actions that obviously are reflected in our guide and not necessarily impacting our normal conversion. And mobile devices, they're used to these types of decrementals and headwinds in terms of their first quarter and certainly, they're taking them. So I think that -- and this is really not a different story than we've had over many years where we're able to manage, you know, regardless of the demand environment, we're able to manage their operating margins and really do a great job of expanding our margins when we see demand increases, which we've done here in 2022. And then here in Q1, where we see a little bit of headwind in certain of our markets, taking the actions that really need to be taken in regards to protecting our bottom line. And I think that agility of the organization is really going to -- shining through again. And I think that's just no different from what we've seen historically. And I wouldn't expect any difference in terms of whatever comes here in 2023. And regardless, I think I feel really comfortable with how the team will perform.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs. You may go ahead.\nMark Delaney: Yes. Good afternoon and thank you very much for taking the question. Could you speak please to what Amphenol has seen in the China market, both how it's been tracking recently, given the COVID dynamics and also whether you're expecting demand in China to pick up materially over the course of this year given reopening?\nAdam Norwitt: Yes. Thanks very much, Mark. And look, I'm glad you bring off China, because I want to just give a real shout out to our team in China. Q4 in China was a funky quarter. You came in with zero COVID and you left with 100% COVID. And that created a lot of challenges operationally. And the fact that we were able not only to deliver on our commitments in the quarter, but to actually exceed our guidance in the quarter was just a real testament to our entire global organization, but in particular, to our team in China, who just manage through this well while protecting our people as best you can in a country where basically everybody got COVID, it was really phenomenal And I'm just so proud of what they were able to do during that time period. Look, our business in China, we have a great business in China. Our China business is very much a business for the local region, for the customers, who want to buy in those regions. And we've done such a great job over the years despite geopolitics and all of that of being a truly local company, and this gets to kind of our organization, which I think, I've used the term before that we have an organization that's really purpose-built for whatever the world order is going to be. And that's an organization of people who are made up of local nationals all over the world, people from India in India, people from China in China, people from France in France. And that allows us to really tailor our operations to the requirements of that region and of that country. And we've certainly done that in China over these last several very dynamic years. In terms of whether we expect a kind of a demand rebound in China, I don't know, I think it's a little early to say that. But whatever comes will come. And I think we're poised and positioned that if there is some rebound, if there is an increase in consumer spending or whatever on whatever kind of products, there's no doubt in my mind that our team will be there to capture more than our fair share if that should so occur. I mean, they demonstrated here in the fourth quarter that nothing can stop them. And I'm very confident that whatever comes along, we'll take full advantage. And if risks materialize, if some impediments should come along, I mean, this is a team that's pretty battle hardened. So I'm pretty confident they'll do a great job.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Steven Fox with Fox Advisors. You may go ahead.\nSteven Fox: Hi, good afternoon and Happy New Year. I was just wondering, Adam, if you could talk a little bit more about the business, you're acquiring from RFS. It seems like it's a bit of a game changer for you guys in terms of product and how you might be able to compete against some larger players in antennas, et cetera?\nAdam Norwitt: Yes. Well, thanks so much, Steven. Happy New Year to you as well. Look, we're really excited about this business. I mean, we have a business in fiber optics, we have a business in hybrid cable, we have a business in antennas. But no doubt about it, RFS brings us a much, much stronger position from a technology perspective, from a capacity perspective and from a channel into certain markets. And we've always been really excited about the mobile networks market. And one of the unique things about Amphenol is, I think I've said this many times, is that we sell to the OEMs. We're one of the leading interconnect suppliers to the world's leading OEMs who make mobile networks equipment, but we also sell to the service providers and to the operators. And that actually is an evolution of our long-term position with the broadband service providers where we know how to work with service providers. And today, we work with service providers in broadband, we work with them in the IT datacom market, we work with them in broadband -- I mean, in mobile networks. And anywhere where now providers are our customers and not just OEMs making equipment. And I think RFS really allows us to take a step function growth in the strength of our position there with service providers. And doing that at a time where we're still, I believe, in the early innings of the 5G investments in the network, let alone what happens when 5G exists for all of our other markets. And we're big believers on the kind of structural potential of both the build-out of the 5G networks that are happening around the world, as well as what it means to have low latency, ultra-high bandwidth ubiquitous data traffic for all of our end markets. And after 5G will come, 6G and then there will come 7G, and you and I will probably still be floating around when we're talking about 10G one day, Steve. But now, we're really excited about RFS and look forward to them. I look forward to getting to the regulatory process. And again, we expect to close it at the end of the second quarter. And thus, it's not in our guide here in the first quarter, but it is certainly in our long-term strategy.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Jim Suva with Citigroup. You may go ahead.\nJim Suva: Hi, Adam, you and your team have been through many similar cycles. And I wanted to focus a little bit on the communications commentary you gave about a little bit of inventory digestion or some pauses or things like that? Just curious, in past cycles, have you seen these last kind of one to two quarters or multiple, multiple quarters from when you sit there, it seems like this is one segment that is taking a little bit of a downshift, not that structurally you're losing share problems with it, but more of a cyclical nature if I understand your comments correctly? Thank you.\nAdam Norwitt: Well, thanks so much, Jim. I would love to be able to extrapolate from sort of past experience to today. But I would tell you that I don't know that at least in my history, which is, by the way, 25-years this year in the company, to live through a time period like we've just gone through in the last three years and what that has done to the dynamics of the market from a pandemic to a supply chain crisis, to an explosion of data traffic that came out of the pandemic and shutdowns and work-from-home and all those various things, the transformation of how people consume, entertainment and media and information. So I don't know that there is a good template for kind of the -- what has happened in the IT datacom market over the last three years. And thus, it would be hard for me to say, do I expect this to be a one quarter, two quarter or whatever kind of an adjustment? And thus, we don't run our business that way. The fact is it is what it is right now, and we adjust in real time our resources to accommodate the level of demand that we see from each of our operations. We have 131 operations around the world right now, roughly. And each of them have their own set of customers. Some of whom have demand that is growing and others of whom and that includes those who work in this market, where maybe demand is moderating somewhat. They don't make a guess and say, well, is that going to be a one, two, three quarter thing, and thus, what should I do? They just say, my customer needs this much, and I'm going to go out and adjust my resources in real time. And that real-time reactivity and agility that Craig mentioned earlier, which, by the way, was reflected in our margins in the fourth quarter and is also reflected in our margins in the first quarter, that's how we run the business. We'll react to whatever the demand environment is, and we're not going to try to trip over ourselves trying to guess how long it is. But what I know is this, long-term, the demand for data, the demand for our products, leading edge, high-speed fiber optic power products, that's going to be a very robust demand long-term. And so we will come through this adjustment that our customers are going through, and we will come out of it a stronger company than ever, and we will continue to have a very robust technology position in the future.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Luke Junk with Baird. You may go ahead.\nLuke Junk: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question and Happy New Year from me as well. Adam, your auto business is underlying production now by an extremely strong level each of the past two years. And I know it's always hard to parse up, but do you get the sense that channel inventory of your products has influenced that outgrowth at all? And maybe just more importantly, as you look forward, what do you see as the key factors plus or minus versus history that could influence your ability to grow strongly above market again in 2023? Thank you.\nAdam Norwitt: Well, thanks to you and Happy New Year as well. Look, you said it, I mean, we have definitely outperformed in the automotive market for a pretty long time period here, quite a number of quarters, and I'm just really proud of our team. There weren't always easy years, I mean, clearly, 2020 was a tough year. Even 2019 was a challenging year. But we never kind of threw in the towel during that time period. We never said let's go cut back on new product investment or let's retrench, let's reorganize, quite the contrary. In fact, we continue to work with customers around the world on next-generation applications. And those next-generation applications, everything from passenger connectivity and power applications to high-voltage applications in the car to communications around Antennas and the like. we are now really realizing the benefits of that over the last couple of years. And in terms of the channel, we don't really see the channel and the inventory in the channel as being a big driver of the demand. I think the driver of the demand has been the rapid adoption of new electronic systems, in particular, electrification of cars, but not exclusively electrification. And so when I think about the key factors that can be plus or minus in the future, well, sure, at some level, the number of cars being sold matters. But more importantly is the content of electronics and the content of new systems in those cars in the future. And if that content continues to move up and to the right and if we continue to do a pretty decent job of getting some or more than our fair share of that, then I think there's good potential for our automotive business in the long-term. I would not get out in front of my skis here and tell you that 29% organic growth is going to be our perpetuity or 41% that we achieved in 2021. But we're very confident in our -- in the strength of our position.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Will Stein with Truist Securities. You may go ahead.\nWill Stein: Great, thanks. I'd love to hear about how the backlog changed during the quarter, and in particular, the duration of the backlog and perhaps it relates to lead times somewhat, whether you're seeing customers still place orders in excess of lead times to the degree that has been a pattern? Thank you.\nAdam Norwitt: Thanks so much, Will. I mean, look, we obviously had in the fourth quarter a lower book-to-bill of 0.89. But I would just point out that over the course of this year, we still have a positive book-to-bill of 1.02. And if you look over the last two years, we've actually booked in the last two years, $25 billion in orders and we've shipped $23.5 billion in sales. So we've added $1.5 billion to our backlog during that time. And we have, today, still a very robust backlog. I think we talked about last quarter that we probably saw about a three-week expansion of our backlog. And I think we're probably still roughly in that ballpark right now, somewhere around a three-week or so beyond what maybe it was in the past. And when I say the past like 2020 and maybe year-end. And that's a really strong position. At the same time, there's no doubt about it that the kind of acute phase of the supply chain crisis and the kind of multiplicity of pressures that was put on our customers across really all of our markets, I think we're beyond the acute phase of that supply chain crisis. I'm not going to tell you like it's totally in the rearview mirror, like there's still little things that people have to deal with. But I would not be surprised if our customers, kind of, normalize a little bit more their lead times across the board. And one of the things that happened during the course of the pandemic and the supply chain crisis that came thereafter, is we were doing a great job. I mean, we supported our customers through the time. We did not meaningfully have to extend our lead times, but customers were sort of taking a one-size-fits-all approach in several of the markets. And that led, I think, them to certainly in the communications market, to maybe end up ordering a little bit more than they were going to do. I would also point out one other thing out here just in the fourth quarter, with our relatively low book-to-bill, compared to historical levels, actually, that was really concentrated in our communications markets. And we saw a book-to-bill outside of the communications market, which was basically 1:1 in the fourth quarter, which also gives us some confidence that there's still a robust demand for our products. But I don't think in terms of the normalization, I would expect some normalization. That whole cliche of just in time versus just in case, maybe customers long term will have a little bit more order windows. But I think we sit in a really good position here.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Chris Snyder with UBS. You may go ahead.\nChris Snyder: Thank you. So the company has taken a lot of share coming out of the pandemic. And there has been a heightened focus on resiliency and connectivity from the customer base, again, coming out of the pandemic. I'd just be interested to hear how you think about those two drivers as the macro seemingly will normalize here at some point? Thank you.\nAdam Norwitt: Yes. Thanks very much, Chris. I mean, look, resiliency connectivity, I think there's been a lot of things that have shifted. We've just been through a once in a several-generation pandemic. Hopefully, we are sort of at the tail end of it. I know our team in China certainly hopes that in the fourth quarter. But I think it has changed everything. It's touched everything. Let me say that, whether it's dramatically changed everything. But no doubt, resiliency and ability of a company to be there for its customers regardless of what comes along. That is definitely more in the consideration of our customers than ever before, and that plays very well into our approach. Our approach has never been to put all our eggs in one basket to build these massive campuses. We have 250 facilities around the world. Some people think we're crazy to have that many factories, but part of it is risk. Part of it is making sure that we're close to our customers, and we're not putting all of our eggs in one basket. And we have a pretty fragmented manufacturing footprint all over the world with low-cost operations in all three of the major regions in continents. And I'll tell you that, that enabled us during this time period to take share from maybe some of our competitors, who are either smaller or more concentrated and thus, we're stricken by these kind of unpredictable impediments that came along during the pandemic and the supply chain crisis. And relative to connectivity, and I'm going to sort of put a little stab on what your implication is there, I mean, communications, the Internet, the ability to stay in touch with people, that has clearly been a dramatic shift in this pandemic. And we look at our position in our communications markets and the phenomenal growth that we've had, and I mentioned the IT datacom market for us growing 70% during that time period. But also, mobile devices grew by nearly 25% over those same three years. And that's just a reflection of this kind of now demand for people to have a multitude of ways of communicating and connecting with each other. And that's something as we seek to sort of enable the electronics revolution, that's the phrase I always use, there's no doubt about it that we're living in revolutionary times. And that creates a real structural and long-term opportunity for Amphenol.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. You may go ahead.\nWamsi Mohan: Thank you. Hey, Adam, notwithstanding the comments you made on IT datacom earlier that might also apply to mobile devices. You specifically called out mobile device kind of mean reverting from abnormal COVID-driven level. So does that imply we should expect some seasonal growth for 2023? And more broadly, is visibility, maybe ex mobile devices, beginning to improve at all in your markets?\nAdam Norwitt: Yes. Thanks very much, Wamsi. I am not going to get out in front of my skis on trying to give an estimate of what mobile device demand is going to look like this year. You know, well, I'm bad at guiding it even for the 70 or so days that we try to give guidance in a quarter let alone to make some estimate of what it's going to look like in the course of the year. It's hard for me to do that. What I do know is there's a lot of new devices, they're wonderful. I'm addicted to mine, and we have a strong position. And so I don't take a position otherwise on whether mobile devices is going to have a worse or better performance seasonally going through the rest of this year. I mean, we tried to give some guidance here in the first quarter. We'll see what happens there, and then we'll try to give some guidance on the second quarter 90 days from now. Relative to visibility in general, look, it's still a fairly uncertain world. And so I don't know that there's a dramatic improvement in visibility. I mean, we're not giving full-year guidance. We don't think it's prudent at this time, because there is still a lot of dynamism, a lot of uncertainty in the world today. And so we'll see. I mean, I certainly hope that as we passed the three-year mark on the anniversary, I think -- it's actually three years from day after tomorrow that Wuhan was shut down. I remembered it very, very well. And you hope that after three years, it renormalizes. There's a saying in Chinese that a pandemic doesn't last more than three years. It's a famous old saying that, I think, a very old saying in Chinese. And hopefully, that is really the case, and there can be a little bit more normalization. But I think there's still a lot of uncertainty in the world today.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from David Kelley with Jefferies. You may go ahead.\nDavid Kelley: Hey, good afternoon, Adam and Craig. Maybe a question on the input cost environment. We've seen certain commodities pull back in certain areas. Energy and labor costs remain elevated and then maybe pricing pass-throughs might get tougher in 2023. But if we take a step back, can you just talk about the Amphenol cost opportunities in 2023?\nCraig Lampo: Yes. Thank you, David. I think that, certainly, the cost environment is, in some ways, a little bit different than it probably was as we, kind of, entered the year here. I think there are certain places where it has improved, there\u2019s other places, honestly, where it probably hasn't improved. But I mean, certainly, on certain commodities, we've seen some level of relief in certain parts of the business without a doubt. But places like energy, places like the labor, certainly, logistics has gotten a little better, but I would say energy and labor is certainly very -- sill continues to be a headwind in many places. So I'd say, on balance, it probably has made some improvements from a commodity perspective. I think that what does that mean from a cost perspective in 2023? It's tough to tell our margin perspective. I mean, there's no doubt that in a normal environment, you would expect some pricing headwinds from your customers. And whether or not they will start in certain places to try to come back to pricing, we'll certainly do our best to -- as we always do to -- as we add value to our customers to ensure that we're keeping that fair margin. But as costs come down, I would expect in some places for pricing to have some headwind. But I would expect that ultimately a balance to happen where we were able to protect our margins and continue to have strong margins. It really wouldn't -- I wouldn't think change from a profitability perspective. And in a normal environment, prior to the pandemic when inflation was kind of at a normal pace and the demand environment was normal, that's -- you did have that kind of normal balance. And I expect that, ultimately, over time, we'll see that again. And whether or not that happens in \u201823, that's a little bit too early to predict. But I think we are in a better place, both on the price and a cost perspective, than we certainly were a year ago.\nOperator: Thank you. Our last question is from Michael Anastasio with Cowen. You may go ahead.\nMichael Anastasio: Happy New Year. Thanks for taking my question. Could you just quantify the impact of price in 2022 overall? And if there's any areas that were strong in particular? And what are your expectations for the upcoming year? A - Craig Lampo Yes. I was kind of I was saying before, I mean, certainly, we did have some pricing kind of momentum in 2022. Honestly, I couldn't even tell you what exactly the impact the price was on our top line. We don't -- unfortunately, our systems aren't capable of even providing that information. I would say it's somewhere kind of in maybe low single digits, but it's a very difficult thing to even have to provide. So -- and honestly, it really wouldn't provide us with any help in regards to how we run our business. So it's not something we're necessarily focused on. But certainly, there was some pricing in 2022. We've talked about that and without a doubt there was. I mean, again, as I mentioned before, in a normal environment, pricing would be, I would say, more of a headwind than a tailwind and \u201822 was a slight tailwind, I would say. And I know it's tough to say whether we'll be in 2023 as the cost environment maybe levels off a bit. But ultimately, whatever it is, I know I'm really not so concerned. I think that the team has continued to do a great job of managing cost, managing price and ultimately ensuring at the end of the day, we're getting paid for the value we provide to our customers.\nOperator: Thank you. And there are no further questions. I'll turn the call back to Mr. Norwitt for closing remarks.\nAdam Norwitt: Well, thank you so much. And again, we'd like -- Craig and I would like to, on behalf of our entire team around the world, express our gratitude to each of you for the confidence you put in us. And we wish you all the best and look forward to speaking with you just a short 90-days from now. Thank you, everybody. Happy New Year again, and stay safe.\nCraig Lampo: Thank you. Bye-bye.\nOperator: Thank you for attending today's conference, and have a nice day.",

            "name": "Craig Lampo",
            "content": "Good afternoon, everyone. This is Craig Lampo, Amphenol's CFO, and I'm here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO. We would like to wish everyone Happy New Year and welcome you to our fourth quarter 2022 conference call. Our fourth quarter 2022 results were released this morning. I will provide some financial commentary, and then Adam will give an overview of the business and current trends, then we will take questions. As a reminder, during the call, we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures and make certain forward-looking statements. So please refer to the relevant disclosures in our press release for further information. In addition, all prior year comparative data discussed during this year is on a continuing operations basis. The company closed the fourth quarter with sales of $3.239 billion and GAAP and adjusted diluted EPS of $0.82 and $0.78, respectively. Fourth quarter sales were up 7% in U.S. dollars 11% local currencies and 8% organically, compared to the fourth quarter of 2021. Sequentially, sales were down by 2% in U.S. dollars, 1% in local currencies and 2% organically. Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes. For the full-year 2022, sales were a record $12.623 billion, which were up 16% U.S. dollars 19% in local currencies and 15% organically, compared to 2021. Orders in the quarter were $2.884 billion, which was down 12%, compared to the fourth quarter of 2021 and 8% sequentially, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 0.89:1. This was driven by lower bookings in the communications related markets. For the full-year, orders were $12.925 billion, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.02:1. GAAP and adjusted operating income were $666 million and $676 million, respectively, in fourth quarter of 2022. GAAP and adjusted operating margin were 20.6% and 20.9% respectively in the fourth quarter. On a GAAP basis, operating margin increased by 100 basis points, compared to the fourth quarter of \u201921 and decreased by 10 basis points, sequentially. GAAP operating margin for the fourth quarter included approximately $10 million of acquisition related costs. On an adjusted basis, operating margin increased by 80 basis points, compared to the fourth quarter of \u201921 and decreased by 10 basis points sequentially. The year-over-year increase in adjusted operating margin was driven by strong operating leverage on the higher sales volumes, as well as the benefit of ongoing pricing actions. On a sequential basis, the slight decrease in adjusted operating margin reflected normal downside conversion on the lower sales levels. For the year 2022, GAAP operating margin was 20.5% and adjusted operating margin was 20.7%, when compared to 2021, adjusted operating margin increased by 70 basis points, which was primarily driven by normal operating leverage on higher sales volumes, as well as the benefit of pricing actions. Given the overall cost and supply chain headwinds we experienced in 2022, we are very proud that our adjusted operating margin equals our previous full-year record operating margin set in 2018. Breaking down fourth quarter and full- year results by segment, in the harsh environment solutions segment, sales were $795 million and $3.107 billion in the fourth quarter and full-year of 2022 respectively. Compared to the prior year fourth quarter, segment sales increased 10% in U.S. dollars and 12% organically. Compared to the full-year 2021, segment sales increased by 13% in U.S. dollars and 15% organically. Segment operating margin was 25.7% and 25.8% in the fourth quarter and full-year of 2022 respectively. In the Communications Solutions segment, sales were $1.436 billion and $5.652 billion in the fourth quarter and full-year of 2022. Compared to the prior year fourth quarter segment sales increased 1% in U.S. dollars and organically, compared to the full-year 2021, segment sales increased by 17% in U.S. dollars and 13% organically. Segment operating margin was 22.2% and 22% in the fourth quarter and full-year of 2022. In the Interconnect and Sensor Systems segment, sales were $1.008 billion and $3.863 billion in the fourth quarter and full-year of 2022. Compared to the prior year fourth quarter, segment sales increased 14% in U.S. dollars and 17% organically. Compared to the full-year 2021, segment sales increased by 17% in U.S. dollars and 18% organically. Segment operating margin was 19.2% and 18.5% in the fourth quarter and full-year of 2022. The company's GAAP effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 19.2% and the adjusted effective tax rate was 24.5%, which compares to 18.8% and 23.8% in the fourth quarter of 2021 respectively. For the full-year 2022, GAAP effective tax rate was 22.3% and adjusted effective tax rate was 24.5%, which compared to 20.6% and 24.3% in 2021. In 2023, we expect our adjusted effective tax rate to be approximately 24%. GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations was $0.82 in the fourth quarter, an increase of 14%, compared to $0.72 in the prior period. Adjusted diluted EPS was $0.78, an increase of 11%, compared to the $0.70 in the fourth quarter of \u201921. This was an excellent result. For the full-year, GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations was $3.06, a 22$ increase from $2.51 in 2021. Adjusted diluted EPS was $3 in 2022, a 21% increase from $2.48 in 2021. Operating cash flow in the fourth quarter was a record $705 million or 147% of adjusted net income and net of capital spending, our free cash flow was a record $613 million or $127% of adjusted net income. We are pleased to have delivered a cash flow yield at these strong levels. For the full-year 2022, operating cash was a record $2.175 billion or 117% of adjusted net income and net of capital spending our free cash flow for 2022 was a record $1.796 billion or 96% of adjusted net income, a very strong result. From a working capital standpoint, inventory days, days sales outstanding and payable days were 86, 73 and 54 days respectively. During the quarter, the company repurchased 2.3 shares of common stock at an average price of approximately $75, bringing total repurchases during 2022 to 9.9 shares or $731 million. When combined with our normal quarterly dividend, total capital return to shareholders in 2022 was more than $1.2 billion. Total debt at December 31 was $4.6 billion and net debt was $3.1 billion. Total liquidity at the end of the quarter was a very strong $4.1 billion, which included cash and short-term investments on hand of $1.4 billion plus availability under existing credit facilities. Fourth quarter and full-year 2022 EBITDA was $798 million and $3.1 billion, respectively. And at the end of the fourth quarter of 2022, our net leverage ratio was 1 times. I also wanted to make a few comments on interest expense. As I mentioned last quarter, due to the rising interest rate environment, our interest expense had increased primarily as a result of our floating rate convertible paper, which represents approximately 14% of our total debt outstanding at the end of the year. Based on current and near-term expected interest rates and debt levels, we expect 2023 quarterly interest expense to be approximately $40 million, which is reflected in our first quarter guidance. I\u2019d now turn it over to Adam, who will provide some commentary on current market trends, as well as the recently completed acquisition this month. Great. Thanks, Samik, and Happy New Year to you. Yes, I think that if you think about our margin, I mean, I think I'd start off by just saying how proud we are of the margins performance that we've had in 2022. We really have, ultimately -- I mean, throughout 2022, we really done, I think, a great job of just expanding our margins, even sequentially converting, kind of, higher than our normal conversion with the cost actions, with the pricing actions we've had to take. And thus -- and really hitting our 21% in Q3, which is kind of a timing of record and really 20.9% in Q4 and then 20.7%, which matches the record of 2018. So I'm really happy with certainly achieving those. And as we guide here into the first quarter, we're guiding down, I'd say, above seasonal and then we talked about -- Adam just talked about that in response to a previous question. And I think if you, kind of, look at the markets, we've always said that our markets don't really drive kind of our margins. So we don't have significant margin differences of a significant range within our markets, except for broadband, we've talked about before, which was our old cable business. But other than that, I think the markets are similar operating margins and drive similar conversion level. So I wouldn't really talk about that as being a place where it's driving a change in the way our overall conversions would look. We talked about decrementals and kind of that close to 30% range. We're kind of seeing a little -- even slightly less than that as we're guiding here into the first quarter. And I think that just goes to the management team and how well they have done in regards to responding to some of these areas where we have seen some headwinds from a demand perspective in IT data, which is declining at above normal rate typically. And then in the first quarter, they're taking great actions that obviously are reflected in our guide and not necessarily impacting our normal conversion. And mobile devices, they're used to these types of decrementals and headwinds in terms of their first quarter and certainly, they're taking them. So I think that -- and this is really not a different story than we've had over many years where we're able to manage, you know, regardless of the demand environment, we're able to manage their operating margins and really do a great job of expanding our margins when we see demand increases, which we've done here in 2022. And then here in Q1, where we see a little bit of headwind in certain of our markets, taking the actions that really need to be taken in regards to protecting our bottom line. And I think that agility of the organization is really going to -- shining through again. And I think that's just no different from what we've seen historically. And I wouldn't expect any difference in terms of whatever comes here in 2023. And regardless, I think I feel really comfortable with how the team will perform. Yes. Thank you, David. I think that, certainly, the cost environment is, in some ways, a little bit different than it probably was as we, kind of, entered the year here. I think there are certain places where it has improved, there\u2019s other places, honestly, where it probably hasn't improved. But I mean, certainly, on certain commodities, we've seen some level of relief in certain parts of the business without a doubt. But places like energy, places like the labor, certainly, logistics has gotten a little better, but I would say energy and labor is certainly very -- sill continues to be a headwind in many places. So I'd say, on balance, it probably has made some improvements from a commodity perspective. I think that what does that mean from a cost perspective in 2023? It's tough to tell our margin perspective. I mean, there's no doubt that in a normal environment, you would expect some pricing headwinds from your customers. And whether or not they will start in certain places to try to come back to pricing, we'll certainly do our best to -- as we always do to -- as we add value to our customers to ensure that we're keeping that fair margin. But as costs come down, I would expect in some places for pricing to have some headwind. But I would expect that ultimately a balance to happen where we were able to protect our margins and continue to have strong margins. It really wouldn't -- I wouldn't think change from a profitability perspective. And in a normal environment, prior to the pandemic when inflation was kind of at a normal pace and the demand environment was normal, that's -- you did have that kind of normal balance. And I expect that, ultimately, over time, we'll see that again. And whether or not that happens in \u201823, that's a little bit too early to predict. But I think we are in a better place, both on the price and a cost perspective, than we certainly were a year ago. Thank you. Bye-bye."

            "name": "Adam Norwitt",
            "content": "Well, thank you very much, Craig. And welcome to all of you to our first earnings call of 2023 and I hope it's not too late to wish as well all of you a Happy New Year and to those of you celebrate the Lunar New Year, wish you all a happy year of the rabbit. As Craig mentioned, I'm going to highlight our fourth quarter and full-year 2022 achievements, including some discussion about the acquisitions that we mentioned in our press release. I\u2019ll then discuss our trends and progress in our served markets and then make some comments on our outlook for the first quarter, and of course, we'll have time for questions at the end. Looking to the fourth quarter, our results in the fourth quarter were stronger-than-expected. Exceeding the high-end of our guidance in sales and adjusted diluted earnings per share. Sales grew by 7% in U.S. dollars and 11% in local currencies, reaching $3.239 billion. On an organic basis, our sales increased by 8% and that was driven by robust growth in the broadband, commercial air, automotive and military end markets. And I'll give some more details about those markets in a few moments. The company booked $2.884 billion in orders in the fourth quarter, representing a book-to-bill of 0.89:1, and this negative book-to-bill was driven by order reductions in several of the communications related markets as certain customers adjusted demand in light of excess inventory that they had built up throughout 2022. We're especially pleased to have delivered another quarter of resilient and strong profitability with adjusted operating margins reaching 20.9% and 80 basis point increase from prior year. We achieved these results despite the continued wide range of challenges around the world. Adjusted diluted EPS, as Craig mentioned were $0.78, representing robust growth of 11% from prior year and that's another excellent reflection of our organization's continued strong execution. Finally, the company generated record operating free cash flow in the quarter of $705 million and $613 million, respectively, clear reflections of the quality of the company's earnings. I'm extremely proud of our team around the world and our results this quarter once again reflect the discipline and agility of our entrepreneurial organization as we continue to perform well amidst the challenging and dynamic environment. We're also pleased to announce that we closed the acquisition of Control Measure Regulation Group or CMR just here in January. CMR is based in France and has annual sales of approximately $75 million and they're a manufacturer of a broad array of cable assemblies and complex interconnect assemblies for the industrial market with a particular focus on heavy equipment engine applications. This acquisition further expands our offering of high technology, value-added interconnect products in the diversified industrial market. In addition, we're pleased to have signed an agreement for the acquisition of the North American hybrid and fiber optic cable and cable assembly, as well as the global infrastructure antenna business of RFS at the end of the fourth quarter. Based just down the street from us here in Meriden, Connecticut, RFS is a provider of Interconnect and Antenna products for the mobile networks market with expected sales of approximately $100 million in 2023. This acquisition, which we anticipate will close by the end of the second quarter and thus is not included in our guidance, expands Amphenol\u2019s product offering and presence with mobile network service providers, who are continuing to invest in their next generation 5G networks. As we welcome the outstanding CMR team to Amphenol and look ahead to welcome the RFS team once that transaction closes, we remain confident that our acquisition program will continue to create great value for the company. Our ability to identify and execute upon acquisitions and successfully bring these new companies into Amphenol remains a core competitive advantage for the company. I just want to make a few comments about 2022. And I would just say that 2022 was another very successful year for Amphenol. We expanded our position in the overall market, growing sales by 16% in U.S. dollars, 19% in local currencies and 15% organically reaching a new sales record of $12.623 billion. In fact, over the past three very dynamic years, we're proud to have grown our sales by more than 50% from our 2019 levels, actually 53% to be exact, a great reflection of the company's diversification and agility in these truly dynamic times. Our full-year 2022 adjusted operating margins reached 20.7% and that was an increase of 70 basis points from 2021. This strong level of profitability enabled us to achieve record adjusted diluted EPS of $3. Finally, we generated record operating and free cash flow of $2.175 billion and $1.796 billion respectively, clear confirmations of the company's superior execution and disciplined working capital management. Our acquisition program again created value this year with two new companies added to the Amphenol family in 2022 and one added here already in 2023. CMR, NPI and ICA Holdings have expanded our position across a broad array of technologies, particularly in the industrial market, while bringing outstanding and talented individuals into the Amphenol family. We're excited that these acquisitions, as well as the RFS acquisition, which we expect to close at the end of the second quarter, represent expanded platforms for the company's future performance. We also bought back in 2022 almost 10 million shares under our share buyback program and increased our quarterly dividend by 5%, representing as Craig detailed a total return of capital to shareholders of just over $1.2 billion for the year. Finally and really importantly, especially in this today's dynamic environment, we come out of 2022 in a uniquely robust financial position with the lowest leverage and highest liquidity and availability we've seen really in modern times. And while there continued to be a high level of volatility in the overall market environment in 2022, as we enter 2023, our agile entrepreneurial management team is confident that we have built further strength from which we can drive superior long-term performance. I'd like to spend a little bit of time to talk about our trends and progress across our served markets, and I would just comment that we remain very pleased that our balanced and broad end market diversification continues to create real value for the company with no single end market representing more than 25% of our sales in the year of 2022. We believe this diversification mitigates the impact of the volatility of individual end markets, while continuing to expose us to leading technologies wherever they may arise across the electronics industry. Turning first to the military market, this market represented 10% of our sales in the fourth quarter and 9% of our sales for the full-year. Sales in the quarter grew strongly from prior year, increasing by 11% in U.S. dollars and 13% in local currencies and on an organic basis sales increased by 12% with broad-based growth across virtually all applications, but particularly military vehicles, space and airframes. Sequentially, our sales increased by a better-than-expected 11%. For the full-year 2022, sales grew by 4% in U.S. dollars, 6% in local currencies and 4% organically, reflecting our operational execution, as well as strength in space related unmanned aerial vehicles, ground vehicles and avionics applications. Looking ahead, we expect sales in the first quarter to grow slightly from these fourth quarter levels and we continue to be excited by the strength of the company's position in the defense market, where we offer the industry's broadest array of high technology Interconnect products. As the geopolitical environment has become more dynamic, militaries around the world are expanding their investments in next generation technologies, thereby increasing the demand potential. We look forward to supporting this increased demand with our expanded range of Interconnect and Sensor products, as well as our significant investments in new capacity that we have made in recent years. The commercial aerospace market represented 3% of our sales in the fourth quarter, as well as for the full-year 2022. And in the quarter, our sales grew by very strong 33% in U.S. dollars and 38% in local currency and organic. As we benefited from the continued recovery in the commercial air market. Sequentially, our sales grew by 13% from the third quarter, which was well ahead of our expectations coming into the quarter. For the full-year 2022, sales increased by 36% in U. S dollars, 40% in local currency and 36% organically, reflecting our strong design in positions on a broad range of platforms, as well as the ongoing recovery in demand for aircraft. Looking into the first quarter of \u201923, we expect now a modest sequential moderation in sales. I just want to say how grateful I am to our team that's working in the commercial air market. Over the last three years, they performed really well amidst a truly volatile demand environment. And with the ongoing recovery in travel and thus in demand for jetliners, our team's efforts to strengthen our breadth of high technology Interconnect and Sensor products, while diversifying our market position, including into next generation aircraft are now paying real dividends. We look forward to realizing the benefits of this in 2023 and beyond. Industrial market represented 25percent of our sales both in the fourth quarter and for the full-year and sales in the quarter grew by 7% in U.S. dollars, 12% in local currency and 7% organically from the prior year fourth quarter. This growth was driven in particular by sales into alternative energy, battery and electric heavy vehicle, factory automation, oil and gas and medical applications. On a sequential basis, sales were down by just 1%, which was a bit better than our expectations. For the full-year 2022, sales grew by a strong 14% in U.S. dollars, 19% in local currency and 13% organically, and we really had broad-based growth across virtually all segments of the global industrial market. And looking into the first quarter, we expect sales in the industrial market be roughly at the same level as we achieved here in the fourth quarter. Our outstanding global team working in the industrial market continues to find new opportunities for growth across the many segments of this exciting market. I remain confident that our long-term strategy to expand our high technology Interconnect, Antenna and Sensor offerings, both organically and through complementary acquisitions, has positioned us to capitalize on the many revolutions happening across the industrial electronics market. To that end, the addition of CMR further strengthens our position, particularly in the important heavy equipment segment. And we look forward to realizing the benefits of this strategy for many years to come. The automotive market represented 21% of our sales, both in the fourth quarter and for the full-year and we had another great quarter in automotive sales growing by a strong 21% in U.S. dollars and 31% in local currency and organic. Our growth was broad-based, but was once again particularly robust in hybrid and electric vehicle applications. On a sequential basis, our automotive sales increased by 5%, which was above our prior expectations. For the full-year 2022, I'm very pleased that our sales increased by a strong 22% in U.S. dollars and 29% in local currency and organic, reflecting broad strength across our automotive markets, including in particular in next generation electronics, including electric and hybrid drivetrains. Looking into 2023, we expect a high single-digit sequential moderation of sales in the first quarter from these high levels, driven especially by a seasonal moderation of sales in Asia. I remain extremely proud of our team working in the automotive market. They continue to manage through a dynamic overall environment all while remaining focused on driving new design wins with customers, who are implementing a wide array of new technologies into their vehicles. In particular, our long-term efforts that expanding our range of next generation Interconnects incorporated into electric and hybrid electric vehicles has enabled Amphenol to expand our position with a broad range of customers and thereby created further potential for the future. The mobile devices market represented 12% of our sales in the quarter and 11% of our sales for the full-year 2022. Our sales in the quarter declined from prior year by 11% in U.S. dollars and 7% in local currency and organically, and this was driven by reduced sales of products incorporated into smartphones, laptops, tablets and wearables. Sequentially, our sales declined as we had expected by 10% as demand was impacted by a pull forward of demand into the third quarter as we it discussed 90-days ago. For the full-year 2022, sales in this market increased by 3% in U.S. dollars and 5% organically, as growth in smartphones and wearables was somewhat offset by a moderation in tablets coming off the higher levels of the pandemic. We are pleased with this performance amidst the market with generally muted demand in 2022. As we look into the first quarter of \u201923, we anticipate a seasonal sequential decline of approximately 35%. And while mobile devices will always remain one of our most volatile markets, our outstanding and agile team is poised as always to capture any opportunities for incremental sales that may arise in 2023 and beyond. Our leading array of Antennas, Interconnect products and mechanisms continues to enable a broad range of next generation mobile devices, which positions us well for the long-term. The mobile networks market represented 4% of our sales in the quarter and 5% for the full-year 2022. Sales in the quarter declined from prior year by 8% in U.S. dollars, 6% in local currency and 12% organically as we experienced the pause in demand from operators after a number of quarters of strong growth. Sequentially, our sales declined by a higher-than-expected 17%. For the full-year \u201922, sales grew by 8% from prior year and 3% organically as we saw increased demand for products used in next generation 5G equipment. Looking ahead, we expect a high single-digit sequential reduction in sales in the first quarter as operators continue to moderate their investments. Our team continues to work aggressively to realize the benefits of their efforts to expand our position in next generation 5G equipment and networks around the world. And as customers continue their investments in these systems, we look forward to benefiting from the increased potential that comes from our unique position with both equipment manufacturers and mobile service providers. We're also excited by the pending acquisition of the hybrid and fiber optic cable and antenna assets of RFS, which will further broaden our product offerings for this important market. The information technology and data communications market represented 19% of our sales in the quarter and 21% of sales for the full-year. Sales in the fourth quarter declined by 6% in U.S. dollars, 5% in local currency and 8% organically from prior year as many customers reduced their demand after five consecutive quarters of robust double-digit growth. Sequentially, our sales declined by 11% as we had expected coming into the quarter. For the full-year 2022, our sales in the IT datacom market grew by a strong 18% in U.S. dollars, 19% in local currency and 14% organically as we continue to benefit from our leading technology solutions and design and positions across a wide array of applications. Looking ahead, we expect a roughly 20% sequential decline in sales in the first quarter as our OEM and web service customers continue to moderate their demand levels. Regardless of this current demand pause, we remain encouraged by the company's outstanding position in the global IT datacom market. Our team has done an excellent job developing leading high speed, power and fiber optic Interconnect products that are enabling our OEM and web service provider customers to continue to drive their equipment and networks to higher levels of performance. We look forward to realizing the benefits of that leading position in this important market for many years to come. Finally, the broadband market represented 6% of our sales in the quarter and 5% of our sales for the full-year 2022. Sales increased by a very strong 79% in U.S. dollars, 82% in local currencies and 64% organically as we experienced a significant increase in demand from cable operators for a wide range of our products. On a sequential basis, sales grew by a much better-than-expected 19%. For the full-year 2022 sales grew by 62% in U.S. dollars and 38% organically, as we benefited from strong demand from broadband service operators, who are both upgrading and expanding their data networks, as well as from the Halo acquisition completed last year. Looking ahead, we expect sales to decline in the low double-digits from these levels, due to seasonal adjustments from customers. We remain encouraged by the company's expanding position in the broadband market and we look forward to continuing to support our service provider customers around the world, all of whom are working to increase their bandwidth to support the proliferation of high-speed data applications to homes and businesses. And in certain cases in furtherance of government programs to expand broadband. Now just in summary, I want to comment on our outlook. The current economic environment remains highly uncertain. In addition, as we did discuss earlier, we have seen certain customers in the communications markets reduce their demand as they normalize inventory levels. Assuming market conditions do not meaningfully worsen and also assuming constant exchange rates. For the first quarter, we expect sales in the range of $2.840 billion to $2.900 billion and adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $0.65 to $0.67. This would represent a sales decline of 2% to 4% and adjusted diluted EPS of flat to down 3%, compared to the first quarter of \u201922. I remain confident in the ability of our outstanding management team to adapt to the many opportunities and challenges in the current environment and to continue to grow our market position, while driving sustainable and robust profitability over the long-term. And finally, I'd like to take this opportunity to thank our entire team around the world for their truly outstanding efforts here in the fourth quarter and for the full-year of 2022. And with that, operator, we'd be very happy to take any questions. Good afternoon. Yes. Well, thanks so much, Guy. And I think what you're referring to is, kind of, Moore's Law, which says that over time, whether it's every 18-months or some approximation thereof, that electronics tend to get a doubling of the performance for the given price. And I think that, that is true in electronics that if you look at what we -- the devices that we use today, the networks that we use today, we get so much more out of those things given the increase or even in certain cases, not increase of what we pay for those things today. And so it comes down then to innovation. And are we, as a company, innovating, developing products that are enabling our customers' applications and allowing our customers to sell value. And so you mentioned commodity. And we don't view our products as a commodity. Actually, we view them as a very precious piece of jewelry almost that the Interconnect products that we make from connectors to value-add Interconnect, Sensors, Antennas, these are highly critical components that go into very complex systems, everything from mobile devices all the way up to fighter jets and everything in between. And they represent also a very high risk and relatively low value as a percentage of the total bill of materials. And thus, if you can embed technology, if you can embed value, if you can be there for your customers, well, then your customers will be willing to share with you some of the value that they're able to realize on the sale of the end product. And so the difference between, kind of, a standard commodity is something that you see the price trading on an exchange somewhere, and ours is just a chasm of distance between them, because our products are enabling technology. They're very much application specific. We're selling hundreds of thousands and millions of different products to tens of thousands of customers and millions of different applications around the world. And if our product doesn't work, that small little thing in the system, then ultimately, the system itself doesn't perform for its customers. And so it's up to us to develop innovative new technologies on a consistent basis to be able to execute on behalf of our customers to do that with high quality, high reliability with a breadth of products so customers can come to us all at once. And if we can do that consistently, then we're able to realize good margins while also controlling the cost on our side. And that's another piece of this, which is that at the end of the day, margin is price minus cost. And so we have to control the price by selling value to our customers. We have to control the cost by ensuring that every element of cost is controlled and treated as it was coming out of our own pockets. And that comes really from the entrepreneurial organization, the 130 general managers around the world, who all treat the company's money as if it were their own. And the fact that we don't have cost centers in the company, we have a tiny little headquarters. And so that control on cost together with selling value through technology ultimately allows us to realize robust margins on a consistent basis. Thanks so much, Amit. There's a little bit of static on the line, but I think I heard the question well. Look, our guidance that we've given here, and I think I talked a lot about by each segment, but let me just put a finer point on this. If you just take two of our end markets and the guidance that I discussed and that's mobile devices and IT datacom, which are two of our largest communications markets, those represent about two-thirds collectively of the implied sequential reduction in sales from the fourth quarter to the first quarter. And I think we talked about in IT datacom that we clearly see a, sort of, reduction in orders from customers, because of elevated inventory levels. And there may be some demand layered into that, as well as our customer -- as the end customers, kind of, pause their build-outs, but we shouldn't forget one thing about IT datacom. We shouldn't forget that this is a market, first of all, that since 2019, we've grown that market by more than 70% during that time period that our customers have had to increase their output and their construction of their networks in order to satisfy a true explosion of demand for the Internet. And I think the underlying drivers of that, whether that be a video over the Internet or the use of certain tools that we didn't ever use before, the data traffic on the Internet is not dropping. I think what we are seeing is maybe a pause and a kind of realignment because these companies went real gangbusters for a number of years. But the structural increase of data traffic over the Internet in the broadest sense, that's something that we believe, and I think we're in good company believing that we'll continue for a long time to come. On mobile devices, I think we talked about the fact that during the course of the pandemic, there was a real surge in mobile device demand, as people had to detach from their offices and go home, things like tablets, things like computers, upgrades of phones and the like. Let alone the fact that everybody had a lot of disposable income to buy new things in their ears and on their wrists and otherwise. And I think there's been some relaxation of demand that's well reported, and you yourself have talked a lot about that in a variety of reports here in 2022. And regardless of that, our team did a fabulous job this year, driving 5% organic growth in 2022. But we're reacting to the demand that we hear from our customers. We're not losing share. Quite the contrary. But the demand expectations of our customers here in the first quarter really result in the guidance that we've given. So I would maybe point to those two markets, most particularly, which represent just roughly two-thirds of the sequential decline in our outlook. Yes. Thanks so much, Matt, and Happy New Year back to you. No, look, our industrial market has a real bright spot for us over these three years. And I just mentioned how IT datacom since 2019 has grown by 70%. Our industrial business has actually grown by more than 90% during that time period. And we've added some amazing acquisitions across Interconnect and Sensors, but we've also driven really strong organic growth. And I think, last year, we grew by 13% organically. In \u201821, we grew by 27% organically and really on a wide swatch of the industrial market, which is very, very diversified inside it. This industrial lag consumer and datacom, I don't have a really good opinion about that, I think they're quite different markets. You have a lot of very different demand drivers. And if you think about what are the underlying drivers of demand in industrial, well, think about the things that are in the headlines today. Things like investments in infrastructure, things like electrification, things like decarbonization, which includes everything from infrastructure to support electrification, which includes things like alternative energy generation, which includes things like natural gas conversion and pipelines. And we've actually seen funny enough, like strong performance in both our alternative energy business, but also our oil and gas business. Both of those are really showing really strong momentum right now. And I wouldn't think that any of those correlate necessarily to a consumer or a datacom world. Is there inventory in the supply chain of industrial? I don't have good evidence to say, yes or no to that. I'm sure if you looked at a variety of publicly traded balance sheets, you may see some evidence of and some evidence of not. We do look in our distribution channel in there. I think inventories are healthy. They're not crazy. I mean, they may be up a touch or two, but not out of whack to the overall demand environment. Look, industrial is going through a true revolution. And when you think about everything from electrification, electronification, all the underlying drivers that I talked about, I think we've done a fabulous job, and our team in that area has done a fabulous job, both organically, as well as identifying and bringing to the Amphenol family great companies like CMR this quarter and many others over the last three, four years that put the company in a strong position going forward. Yes. Thanks very much, Mark. And look, I'm glad you bring off China, because I want to just give a real shout out to our team in China. Q4 in China was a funky quarter. You came in with zero COVID and you left with 100% COVID. And that created a lot of challenges operationally. And the fact that we were able not only to deliver on our commitments in the quarter, but to actually exceed our guidance in the quarter was just a real testament to our entire global organization, but in particular, to our team in China, who just manage through this well while protecting our people as best you can in a country where basically everybody got COVID, it was really phenomenal And I'm just so proud of what they were able to do during that time period. Look, our business in China, we have a great business in China. Our China business is very much a business for the local region, for the customers, who want to buy in those regions. And we've done such a great job over the years despite geopolitics and all of that of being a truly local company, and this gets to kind of our organization, which I think, I've used the term before that we have an organization that's really purpose-built for whatever the world order is going to be. And that's an organization of people who are made up of local nationals all over the world, people from India in India, people from China in China, people from France in France. And that allows us to really tailor our operations to the requirements of that region and of that country. And we've certainly done that in China over these last several very dynamic years. In terms of whether we expect a kind of a demand rebound in China, I don't know, I think it's a little early to say that. But whatever comes will come. And I think we're poised and positioned that if there is some rebound, if there is an increase in consumer spending or whatever on whatever kind of products, there's no doubt in my mind that our team will be there to capture more than our fair share if that should so occur. I mean, they demonstrated here in the fourth quarter that nothing can stop them. And I'm very confident that whatever comes along, we'll take full advantage. And if risks materialize, if some impediments should come along, I mean, this is a team that's pretty battle hardened. So I'm pretty confident they'll do a great job. Yes. Well, thanks so much, Steven. Happy New Year to you as well. Look, we're really excited about this business. I mean, we have a business in fiber optics, we have a business in hybrid cable, we have a business in antennas. But no doubt about it, RFS brings us a much, much stronger position from a technology perspective, from a capacity perspective and from a channel into certain markets. And we've always been really excited about the mobile networks market. And one of the unique things about Amphenol is, I think I've said this many times, is that we sell to the OEMs. We're one of the leading interconnect suppliers to the world's leading OEMs who make mobile networks equipment, but we also sell to the service providers and to the operators. And that actually is an evolution of our long-term position with the broadband service providers where we know how to work with service providers. And today, we work with service providers in broadband, we work with them in the IT datacom market, we work with them in broadband -- I mean, in mobile networks. And anywhere where now providers are our customers and not just OEMs making equipment. And I think RFS really allows us to take a step function growth in the strength of our position there with service providers. And doing that at a time where we're still, I believe, in the early innings of the 5G investments in the network, let alone what happens when 5G exists for all of our other markets. And we're big believers on the kind of structural potential of both the build-out of the 5G networks that are happening around the world, as well as what it means to have low latency, ultra-high bandwidth ubiquitous data traffic for all of our end markets. And after 5G will come, 6G and then there will come 7G, and you and I will probably still be floating around when we're talking about 10G one day, Steve. But now, we're really excited about RFS and look forward to them. I look forward to getting to the regulatory process. And again, we expect to close it at the end of the second quarter. And thus, it's not in our guide here in the first quarter, but it is certainly in our long-term strategy. Well, thanks so much, Jim. I would love to be able to extrapolate from sort of past experience to today. But I would tell you that I don't know that at least in my history, which is, by the way, 25-years this year in the company, to live through a time period like we've just gone through in the last three years and what that has done to the dynamics of the market from a pandemic to a supply chain crisis, to an explosion of data traffic that came out of the pandemic and shutdowns and work-from-home and all those various things, the transformation of how people consume, entertainment and media and information. So I don't know that there is a good template for kind of the -- what has happened in the IT datacom market over the last three years. And thus, it would be hard for me to say, do I expect this to be a one quarter, two quarter or whatever kind of an adjustment? And thus, we don't run our business that way. The fact is it is what it is right now, and we adjust in real time our resources to accommodate the level of demand that we see from each of our operations. We have 131 operations around the world right now, roughly. And each of them have their own set of customers. Some of whom have demand that is growing and others of whom and that includes those who work in this market, where maybe demand is moderating somewhat. They don't make a guess and say, well, is that going to be a one, two, three quarter thing, and thus, what should I do? They just say, my customer needs this much, and I'm going to go out and adjust my resources in real time. And that real-time reactivity and agility that Craig mentioned earlier, which, by the way, was reflected in our margins in the fourth quarter and is also reflected in our margins in the first quarter, that's how we run the business. We'll react to whatever the demand environment is, and we're not going to try to trip over ourselves trying to guess how long it is. But what I know is this, long-term, the demand for data, the demand for our products, leading edge, high-speed fiber optic power products, that's going to be a very robust demand long-term. And so we will come through this adjustment that our customers are going through, and we will come out of it a stronger company than ever, and we will continue to have a very robust technology position in the future. Well, thanks to you and Happy New Year as well. Look, you said it, I mean, we have definitely outperformed in the automotive market for a pretty long time period here, quite a number of quarters, and I'm just really proud of our team. There weren't always easy years, I mean, clearly, 2020 was a tough year. Even 2019 was a challenging year. But we never kind of threw in the towel during that time period. We never said let's go cut back on new product investment or let's retrench, let's reorganize, quite the contrary. In fact, we continue to work with customers around the world on next-generation applications. And those next-generation applications, everything from passenger connectivity and power applications to high-voltage applications in the car to communications around Antennas and the like. we are now really realizing the benefits of that over the last couple of years. And in terms of the channel, we don't really see the channel and the inventory in the channel as being a big driver of the demand. I think the driver of the demand has been the rapid adoption of new electronic systems, in particular, electrification of cars, but not exclusively electrification. And so when I think about the key factors that can be plus or minus in the future, well, sure, at some level, the number of cars being sold matters. But more importantly is the content of electronics and the content of new systems in those cars in the future. And if that content continues to move up and to the right and if we continue to do a pretty decent job of getting some or more than our fair share of that, then I think there's good potential for our automotive business in the long-term. I would not get out in front of my skis here and tell you that 29% organic growth is going to be our perpetuity or 41% that we achieved in 2021. But we're very confident in our -- in the strength of our position. Thanks so much, Will. I mean, look, we obviously had in the fourth quarter a lower book-to-bill of 0.89. But I would just point out that over the course of this year, we still have a positive book-to-bill of 1.02. And if you look over the last two years, we've actually booked in the last two years, $25 billion in orders and we've shipped $23.5 billion in sales. So we've added $1.5 billion to our backlog during that time. And we have, today, still a very robust backlog. I think we talked about last quarter that we probably saw about a three-week expansion of our backlog. And I think we're probably still roughly in that ballpark right now, somewhere around a three-week or so beyond what maybe it was in the past. And when I say the past like 2020 and maybe year-end. And that's a really strong position. At the same time, there's no doubt about it that the kind of acute phase of the supply chain crisis and the kind of multiplicity of pressures that was put on our customers across really all of our markets, I think we're beyond the acute phase of that supply chain crisis. I'm not going to tell you like it's totally in the rearview mirror, like there's still little things that people have to deal with. But I would not be surprised if our customers, kind of, normalize a little bit more their lead times across the board. And one of the things that happened during the course of the pandemic and the supply chain crisis that came thereafter, is we were doing a great job. I mean, we supported our customers through the time. We did not meaningfully have to extend our lead times, but customers were sort of taking a one-size-fits-all approach in several of the markets. And that led, I think, them to certainly in the communications market, to maybe end up ordering a little bit more than they were going to do. I would also point out one other thing out here just in the fourth quarter, with our relatively low book-to-bill, compared to historical levels, actually, that was really concentrated in our communications markets. And we saw a book-to-bill outside of the communications market, which was basically 1:1 in the fourth quarter, which also gives us some confidence that there's still a robust demand for our products. But I don't think in terms of the normalization, I would expect some normalization. That whole cliche of just in time versus just in case, maybe customers long term will have a little bit more order windows. But I think we sit in a really good position here. Yes. Thanks very much, Chris. I mean, look, resiliency connectivity, I think there's been a lot of things that have shifted. We've just been through a once in a several-generation pandemic. Hopefully, we are sort of at the tail end of it. I know our team in China certainly hopes that in the fourth quarter. But I think it has changed everything. It's touched everything. Let me say that, whether it's dramatically changed everything. But no doubt, resiliency and ability of a company to be there for its customers regardless of what comes along. That is definitely more in the consideration of our customers than ever before, and that plays very well into our approach. Our approach has never been to put all our eggs in one basket to build these massive campuses. We have 250 facilities around the world. Some people think we're crazy to have that many factories, but part of it is risk. Part of it is making sure that we're close to our customers, and we're not putting all of our eggs in one basket. And we have a pretty fragmented manufacturing footprint all over the world with low-cost operations in all three of the major regions in continents. And I'll tell you that, that enabled us during this time period to take share from maybe some of our competitors, who are either smaller or more concentrated and thus, we're stricken by these kind of unpredictable impediments that came along during the pandemic and the supply chain crisis. And relative to connectivity, and I'm going to sort of put a little stab on what your implication is there, I mean, communications, the Internet, the ability to stay in touch with people, that has clearly been a dramatic shift in this pandemic. And we look at our position in our communications markets and the phenomenal growth that we've had, and I mentioned the IT datacom market for us growing 70% during that time period. But also, mobile devices grew by nearly 25% over those same three years. And that's just a reflection of this kind of now demand for people to have a multitude of ways of communicating and connecting with each other. And that's something as we seek to sort of enable the electronics revolution, that's the phrase I always use, there's no doubt about it that we're living in revolutionary times. And that creates a real structural and long-term opportunity for Amphenol. Yes. Thanks very much, Wamsi. I am not going to get out in front of my skis on trying to give an estimate of what mobile device demand is going to look like this year. You know, well, I'm bad at guiding it even for the 70 or so days that we try to give guidance in a quarter let alone to make some estimate of what it's going to look like in the course of the year. It's hard for me to do that. What I do know is there's a lot of new devices, they're wonderful. I'm addicted to mine, and we have a strong position. And so I don't take a position otherwise on whether mobile devices is going to have a worse or better performance seasonally going through the rest of this year. I mean, we tried to give some guidance here in the first quarter. We'll see what happens there, and then we'll try to give some guidance on the second quarter 90 days from now. Relative to visibility in general, look, it's still a fairly uncertain world. And so I don't know that there's a dramatic improvement in visibility. I mean, we're not giving full-year guidance. We don't think it's prudent at this time, because there is still a lot of dynamism, a lot of uncertainty in the world today. And so we'll see. I mean, I certainly hope that as we passed the three-year mark on the anniversary, I think -- it's actually three years from day after tomorrow that Wuhan was shut down. I remembered it very, very well. And you hope that after three years, it renormalizes. There's a saying in Chinese that a pandemic doesn't last more than three years. It's a famous old saying that, I think, a very old saying in Chinese. And hopefully, that is really the case, and there can be a little bit more normalization. But I think there's still a lot of uncertainty in the world today. Well, thank you so much. And again, we'd like -- Craig and I would like to, on behalf of our entire team around the world, express our gratitude to each of you for the confidence you put in us. And we wish you all the best and look forward to speaking with you just a short 90-days from now. Thank you, everybody. Happy New Year again, and stay safe."

        "content": "Operator: Hello, and welcome to the Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call for Amphenol Corporation. Following the presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. Until that, you remain in a listen-only mode. At the request of the company, today's conference is being recorded today. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to introduce today's conference host, Mr. Craig Lampo. Sir, you may begin.\nCraig Lampo : Good afternoon, everyone. This is Craig Lampo, Amphenol's CFO, and I'm here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO. We would like to welcome you to our third quarter 2022 conference call. Our third quarter 2020 results were released this morning. I will provide some financial commentary, and then Adam will give an overview of the business and current trends, then we will take questions. As a reminder, during the call, we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures and make certain forward-looking statements. So please refer to the relevant disclosures in our press release for further information. In addition, all prior year comparative data discussed during this year -- during this call is on a continuing operations basis. The company closed the third quarter with record sales of $3.29 billion and record GAAP and adjusted diluted EPS of $0.80. Third quarter sales were up 17% in U.S. dollars, 21% in local currencies and 18% organically compared to the third quarter of 2021. Sequentially, sales were up by 5% in U.S. dollars, 7% in local currencies and 6% organically. Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes. Orders in the quarter were $3.151 billion, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 0.96:1. Year-to-date, our book-to-bill remains strong at 1.07 to 1, and the company continues to have a robust order backlog. GAAP and adjusted operating income were $681 million and $693 million, respectively, in the third quarter of 2022. GAAP and adjusted operating margin were 20.7% and 21%, respectively, in the third quarter. On a GAAP basis, operating margin increased by 40 basis points compared to the third quarter of '21 and was flat sequentially. GAAP operating margin for the third quarter included $12 million of acquisition-related costs. On an adjusted basis, operating margin increased by 70 basis points compared to the third quarter of '21 and 30 basis points sequentially. The year-over-year increase in adjusted operating margin was driven by strong operating leverage on the significantly higher sales volumes as well as the benefit of ongoing pricing actions. On a sequential basis, the increase in operating margin reflected strong operating leverage on the higher sales volumes. Given the continuing dynamic overall cost and supply chain environment, we are very proud of the company's operating performance. Our team's ability to effectively manage through the myriad of challenges around the world is a direct result of the company's entrepreneurial culture, which continues to foster a high-performance, action-oriented management team. Breaking down third quarter results by segment relative to the third quarter of '21. Sales in the Harsh Environment Solutions segment were $794 million and increased by 12% in U.S. dollars and 14% organically and segment operating margin was 26.1%. Sales in the Communications Solutions segment were $1.518 billion, an increase by 19% in U.S. dollars and 17% organically. Segment operating margin was 22.5%. Sales in the Interconnect and Sensor Systems segment were $983 million and increased by 17% in U.S. dollars and 23% organically. Segment operating margin was 18.8%. The company's GAAP effective tax rate for the third quarter was 23.1%, and the adjusted effective tax rate was 24.5%, which compared to 22.2% and 24.5% in the third quarter of '21, respectively. GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations was a record $0.80 in the third quarter, an increase of 19% compared to $0.67 in the prior year period. Adjusted diluted EPS was a record $0.80, an increase of 23% compared to $0.65 in the third quarter of 2021. This was an excellent result, especially considering the variety of challenges that the company continues to face during the quarter. Operating cash flow in the third quarter was a record $576 million or 116% of adjusted net income. And net of capital spending, our free cash flow was a record $457 million or 92% of adjusted net income. Given our continued strong top line growth, we are pleased to see cash flow yield remain at these strong levels in the third quarter. From a working capital standpoint, days sales outstanding and payable days were 71 and 56 days, respectively, both within our normal range. And despite the continued challenging supply chain environment, our inventory days were 83 days, which came down in the third quarter and were also within our normal range. We are very pleased with our organization's strong management of working capital. As mentioned in today's earnings release, the company's Board of Directors has approved a 5% increase in the company's quarterly dividend to $0.21 from the previous $0.20 per share, effective for payments beginning in January 2023. During the quarter, the company repurchased 2.4 million shares of common stock at an average price of approximately $72. When combined with our normal quarterly dividend, total capital returned to shareholders in the third quarter of 2022 was $289 million. Total debt at September 30 was $4.8 billion, and net debt was $3.5 billion. Total liquidity at the end of the quarter was $3.6 billion, which included a cash, cash and short-term investments on hand of $1.3 billion plus availability under our existing credit facilities. Third quarter 2022 EBITDA was $806 million, and at the end of the third quarter of '22, our net leverage ratio is 1.1 times. I also wanted to make a few comments on interest expense and currency impacts. Due to the rising interest rate environment, our interest expense has increased primarily as a result of our floating Greek commercial paper, which had a balance of $904 million and represented approximately 19% of our total debt outstanding at the end of the quarter. Due to the significant increase in interest rates over the last several months, we expect fourth quarter interest expense to be approximately $38 million, which is reflected in our fourth quarter guidance. Based on current debt balances as well as current and near-term projected rate increases, we expect quarterly 2023 interest expense to be approximately $40 million. Regarding currency and the significant continued depreciation of the U.S. dollar in the fourth quarter, we expect currency to have a negative sequential sales impact of approximately one percentage point and a year-over-year negative impact of five percentage points, assuming current rates. I will now turn the call over to Adam, who will provide some commentary on current market trends.\nAdam Norwitt: Well, thank you very much, Craig, and allow me to extend my welcome to all of you on the phone here today. And I certainly hope that all of you are having an enjoyable fall. Here we are in beautiful Wallingford, Connecticut, with the leaves turning a wonderful autumn hue. I'm going to highlight our third quarter achievements. I'll then spend a little time to discuss the trends and our progress across our served markets. And then finally, I'll comment on our outlook for the fourth quarter and the full year of 2022. And of course, we'll have time for some questions at the end. Turning to the third quarter. Our results in the third quarter were much stronger than expected and exceeded the high end of our guidance in sales and adjusted diluted earnings per share. Sales grew a very strong 17% in U.S. dollars and 21% in local currencies, reaching a new record of just under $3.3 billion.  On an organic basis, sales increased by 18%, with broad-based growth across most of our served markets as well as contributions from the company's acquisition program. The company booked orders of $3.151 billion, representing a book-to-bill, as Craig mentioned, of 0.96 to 1. I would say that despite this slightly negative book-to-bill, the company's order backlog remains very robust. We are pleased to deliver strong profitability in the quarter, with adjusted operating margins reaching 21.0%, a 70 basis point increase from prior year and a 30 basis point increase from prior quarter. We achieved these results despite the continued wide range of operational, inflationary and supply chain challenges around the world. Adjusted diluted EPS grew strongly from prior year, increasing by 23% to a new record of $0.80, and just really an excellent reflection of our organization's continued strong execution here in 2022. Finally, the company generated record operating and free cash flow of $576 million and $457 million, respectively, here in the third quarter. I just want to say how proud I am of our entire organization around the world. Our results this quarter once again reflect the discipline and agility of Amphenol's entrepreneurial team as we continue to perform well amidst what is no doubt a very dynamic and challenging environment. We're also pleased to announce that we closed the acquisition of Integrated Cable Assembly Holdings, or ICA, in September, based in North America and with annual sales of approximately $90 million. ICA manufactures a broad array of cable assemblies for a diversified range of applications, particularly in the industrial market. This acquisition further expands our offering of high-technology value-added interconnect products in the industrial market. As we welcome this outstanding new team to the company, we remain confident that our acquisition program will continue to create great value for Amphenol. In fact, our ability to identify and execute upon acquisitions and successfully bring these new companies into the Amphenol family remains a core competitive advantage for the company. Now turning to the trends and our progress across our served markets. I would just comment that we're very pleased that the company's broad and balanced end market diversification continues to create value for Amphenol. Importantly, and I've mentioned this many times before, our diversification mitigates the impact of the volatility of individual end markets, while also exposing us to leading technologies wherever they may arise across the electronics industry. And these are both very important benefits, in particular, in today's dynamic market environment. I would also just mention that in the third quarter, each of our eight end markets grew organically and some of them in double digits organically. So starting with the military market. That market represented 9% of our sales in the third quarter. Sales in this market grew 1% in U.S. dollars and 3% organically, which was a bit lower than our expectation heading into the quarter. On an organic basis, growth in space-related, ground vehicles and avionics applications was offset by moderations of sales of products used in communications, rotorcraft and engine applications. Sequentially, sales declined by just about 1%. As we look into the fourth quarter, we expect a high single-digit sequential sales increase in the military market. And for the full year 2022, we now expect a low single-digit increase in sales from last year's levels. We continue to be very pleased with the strength of the company's broad position in the defense electronics market. As militaries around the world increase their adoption of a wide array of next-generation technologies in the face of what is no question an increasingly volatile geopolitical landscape, our team managing our leading range of interconnect and sensor products continues to position the company strongly for the future. The commercial aerospace market represented 2% of our sales in the quarter. Sales grew a very strong 36% versus prior year and 42% organically, driven by broad-based strength across all aircraft applications. Compared to the second quarter, our sales declined just a slight 1%, which was actually better than our expectations coming into the quarter. As we look to the fourth quarter, we expect a modest decline in sales versus the third quarter levels. But for the full year 2022, we expect sales to increase a very strong 30% compared to prior year. Our team is justifiably proud to have now realized four consecutive quarters of strong growth in the commercial air market, a clear sign of their resilience and of the continued recovery in the global air travel industry. Going forward, we look forward to benefiting from the company's strong interconnect and sensor technology positions across a wide array of aircraft platforms and next-generation systems being integrated into those airplanes. The industrial market represented 25% of our sales in the third quarter. Sales increased by 11% in U.S. dollars and 13% organically. Our growth was broad-based across most segments of the worldwide industrial market, including battery and heavy electric vehicles, factory automation, alternative energy, heavy equipment, medical, oil and gas, and building automation. Sequentially, our sales actually increased by 2% from the second quarter, which was a bit better than our expectations coming into the quarter. Looking to the fourth quarter, we expect a modest sequential sales decline. And for the full year 2022, we expect a mid-teens increase in sales from prior year. Our results in the industrial market this quarter confirm once again that our outstanding global team working in this important market continues to find new opportunities for growth across the many segments of the exciting industrial electronics market. I remain confident that our long-term strategy to expand our high-technology interconnect antenna and sensor offering, both organically and through complementary acquisitions, has positioned us well to capitalize on the many technology revolutions happening across the industrial market. To that end, the addition of ICA further strengthens our position across a number of exciting segments within this important end market, and we look forward to realizing the benefits of this strategy for many years to come. The automotive market represented 20% of our sales in the quarter, and sales in the third quarter grew by a very strong 27% in U.S. dollars and 37% organically, driven by broad-based strength across most automotive applications and particularly strong growth once again in sales to electric and hybrid electric vehicle applications. Sequentially, our sales increased by 4% from the second quarter, which was much better than our expectations. For the fourth quarter, we expect sales to remain roughly at these levels. And for the full year 2022, we expect sales to increase by approximately 20% compared to last year, driven by our expanded position in next-generation electronics and electrical systems being integrated into cars. I remain extremely proud of our team working in the automotive market. They continue to manage well through a challenging overall environment, all while remaining focused on driving new design wins with customers, who are implementing a wide array of new technologies into their vehicles. Our continued outperformance is a direct result of their excellent efforts. The mobile devices market represented 12% of our sales in the quarter, and our sales to customers in this market increased by 13% in U.S. dollars and 15% organically. And this was driven by strong growth in sales of products incorporated into smartphones, wearables and laptops. Sequentially, our sales increased by a much stronger-than-expected 43%, driven by higher sales across virtually all product categories that we serve.  As we have seen periodically in the past, we do believe that some small portion of this robust demand in the third quarter may have been pulled forward from the fourth quarter. Accordingly, we expect a low double-digit sequential decline in sales from these strong third quarter levels. For the full year, we anticipate sales to grow modestly from our strong 2021.  I'm very proud of our team working in the mobile devices market, as they continue to execute strongly in the face of an ever dynamic demand for our leading array of antennas, interconnect products and mechanisms that are integrated into a wide range of next-generation mobile devices. And no question that this team remains poised as always, to capture any opportunities for incremental sales that may arise here in 2022 or beyond. The mobile networks market represented 5% of our sales in the quarter, and sales increased by a strong 19% versus prior year and 15% organically as growth in our sales to mobile service providers was only partially offset by a moderation of sales to equipment manufacturers. On a sequential basis, our sales increased by 9%, which was better than our expectations. For the fourth quarter, we expect a low double-digit sequential sales reduction after our very strong third quarter. And for the full year 2022, sales are expected to grow in the high single digits. We're encouraged by our strengthening performance in the mobile networks market. As operators continue to ramp up their investments in next-generation systems, our team remains focused on realizing the benefits of our long-term efforts to expand our position in next-generation 5G equipment in networks around the world. The information technology and data communications market represented 22% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in the third quarter rose from prior year by 16% in U.S. dollars and 11% organically. This was driven by increased demand for products in servers and networking applications, and that was only partially offset by some declines in storage-related products. Sequentially, our sales did decline by 3%, albeit better than our expectation coming into the quarter. We believe that this begins to reflect some of the expected inventory corrections that we've discussed in the past by our IT datacom customers. As we look towards the fourth quarter, we expect a low double-digit decline in sales from these third quarter levels as customers continue to moderate their demand and adjust their inventory levels. For the full year 2022, however, we expect very strong high-teens sales growth compared to prior year.  We remain encouraged by the company's outstanding position in the global IT datacom market. Our team has done just an outstanding job developing leading high-speed power and fiber optic interconnect products that are enabling our OEM and web service provider customers, who continue to drive their equipment and networks towards ever higher levels of performance. We look forward to realizing the benefits of that leading position in this important market for many years to come. And finally, the broadband market represented 5% of our sales in the third quarter. Sales in this market increased by a very robust 65% in U.S. dollars and 46% organic, as we experienced strong demand from cable operators for a wide range of our products. On a sequential basis, sales increased by 2%, which was better than our expectation coming into the third quarter. Looking towards the fourth quarter, we expect sales to increase moderately from these strong third quarter levels. And for the full year 2022, we expect sales to increase by more than 50% from prior year, and that includes both robust organic growth as well as the benefit of acquisitions. We look forward to continuing to support our broadband service provider customers around the world with our expanded range of high-technology products. These products have become even more critical as our customers increase the bandwidth and capacity of their networks to support the expansion of high-speed data applications to homes and businesses. And this is in certain cases, and furtherance of government-funded programs to expand broadband. Now turning to our outlook. There is no doubt that the current economic environment remains highly uncertain and increasingly dynamic. Assuming market conditions do not meaningfully worsen and also assuming constant exchange rates, for the fourth quarter, we expect sales in the range of $3.09 billion to $3.15 billion, and adjusted diluted earnings per share in the range of $0.73 to $0.75. This would represent sales growth of 2% to 4% and adjusted diluted EPS growth of 4% to 7% versus the fourth quarter of 2021. Our fourth quarter guidance represents also an expectation for full year sales of $12.474 billion to $12.534 billion and full year adjusted diluted EPS of $2.95 to $2.97. This outlook would represent full year sales and adjusted EPS growth of 15% and 19% to 20%, respectively. I remain confident in the ability of our outstanding management team to adapt to the many opportunities and challenges in the current dynamic environment, and to continue to grow our market position while driving strong profitability. In addition, I just have to say that the entire Amphenol team around the world remains committed to delivering long-term sustainable value. And I would be remiss if I did not take this opportunity here to thank each and every 1 of our Amphenolian team members around the world for their truly outstanding efforts here in the third quarter. And with that, operator, we'd be very happy to take any questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nMark Delaney : Yes. Thank you very much for taking question. In terms of the comments about a more challenging and dynamic environment that the company is expecting, is that more observing that there's the potential for business conditions to deteriorate given macroeconomic factors or is that consistent with the recent moderation in incoming orders that Amphenol has already seen in the third quarter and perhaps has continued or even accelerated in the fourth quarter to date?\nAdam Norwitt : Yeah. Thanks very much, Mark. Look, I think that we've talked before, first about orders that positive book-to-bills don't always grow to the sky. And so it was not surprising. It wasn't certainly surprising to us that our orders moderated a bit in the quarter, and we had a slightly negative book-to-bill. We still have built tremendous backlog over the recent quarters. At the same time, I think it's fairly clear that we are in a world where, economically, there are more cross currents. And those crosscurrents can always have an impact on markets that we serve. And I think some of our customers, in particular, in places like IT datacom, who are a little bit reacting to, as I talked about, the inventory position, that would be an example of a place where maybe customers have put a little more conservatism in their balance sheet. I think we saw also in industrial with our guidance, we've had very, very strong performance in industrial and maybe there's a little bit -- a few signs of some hesitation across a few customers in that area. But it's not like we're seeing anything that anybody else isn't seeing here. We're not projecting anything, but I think the world is volatile. Just look how it's reflected in the interest rate environment, the currency markets that Craig discussed earlier, and as always, in a market like that, it's not our job at Amphenol to try to guess whether there is going to be a recession 1 day or otherwise. But it is our job, and it's our track record to always be prepared regardless. And I've talked about this in the past. You've heard me say the term that we drive with 1 foot on the gas and 1 foot on the brake. And I can tell you, we're driving hard in both respects, doing everything we can to make sure that we're there for our customers, satisfying their demand, and we did that in a big way here in the third quarter, shipping nearly $3.3 billion in sales. But for those areas where we have seen real-time feedback from customers that they may need a little bit less of our product, you can bet that those 130 Amphenol general managers, the ones who may see some softening of demand, that they're rapidly adjusting their resources. They're rapidly taking all the steps that an Amphenol General Manager does take to be prepared to preserve the company's financial strength in that environment. So we're never going to try to guess when that recession is coming. We'll let lots of people, who are much more experts at that than we are, to do that. But we will always be prepared and there's no question that we are today.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. You may go ahead.\nSamik Chatterjee : Thank you for taking questions. I guess, Adam, I had a sort of a similar question, but more relative to your sort of performance here. When I go back and look at the last four quarters or so, every time you've reported a revenue number, you've guided sequentially the next quarter to be slightly slower, slightly lower in terms of revenue. And nevertheless, you've sort of executed above that number. And particularly through this year, you've continued to sort of ramp revenue sequentially as well.  What's changing now when we look into December, we're seeing a similar trend in terms of you trying to probably bake in some of the macro in terms of the guidance for the December quarter, again, being sequentially lower in terms of revenue than September? But what's changing probably relative to the first 3 quarters of the year when we've seen sort of the execution being very different or maybe the industry conservatism that you baked in hasn't really come through? Maybe help me understand that.\nAdam Norwitt : Yeah. No, thank you very much, Samik. Listen, we always come out of the quarter and we try to give our best estimate of what the next quarter is going to be on behalf of everybody here. And it's a credit to our team that we've been able to outperform that, and you can bet that we're always going to try to outperform that. But it's not -- I mean, we do our best job here of doing that. And we shouldn't -- you shouldn't just say, well, Amphenol is conservative and they're naturally going to beat it. I mean there's no doubt that the world, as we see it from a macro and market standpoint, it is more dynamic. There are pockets -- more pockets of uncertainty. There are macro dynamics that are going on now. But all that being said, the underlying electronics revolution that has for us, always been a great platform for our outperformance. This continues to go unabated. Our position, our technology position continues to be broader than ever before. We've made 20 acquisitions since the beginning of 2019, each of which have added to our company in new capabilities, in new breadth, new access to customers in new geographies. So our company is well positioned to capitalize if there are opportunities for upside. And we'll certainly seek to take advantage of any of those that do come, but in the context that it is a world today that is clearly more uncertain than it was before. And I don't have to, I think, tell everybody here on the phone that you can get that by looking just at the front page of the Wall Street Journal on a daily basis. Are we always going to try to outperform what we are, but I'm not going to tell you that this quarter is the same as every other quarter that we're always going to outperform, and we're going to beat our guidance by as much as we did last quarter. We're going to work really hard to do that all the time, and we're going to navigate whatever environment comes our way.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from Chris Snyder with UBS. You may go ahead.\nChris Snyder : Thank you. So margins have realized a pretty nice sequential improvement both over the last 2 quarters. I know at least part of that is price cost catch-up. What is the expectation on price cost into Q4 and early 2023 to the extent you have visibility on price in the backlog and where inventory costs are running at? And kind of with that, does the guided drop in Q4 operating margins really just reflect the volume deleverage into the fourth quarter? Thank you.\nCraig Lampo : Thanks, Chris. Appreciate the question. No, we're really proud actually of the performance, both obviously here in the second quarter from a profitability, but certainly in the third quarter here, reaching 21%, matching our previous record that we had in the fourth quarter of 2018 and clearly, a very different cost environment. I mean, since the fourth quarter of '18, we've kind of had a pandemic. We've had supply chain challenges. We had a lot of inflation. We have energy costs. I mean you name it. And regardless of all that, I think we've been able to navigate that very well and just capitalize also on the strong demand environment and ultimately, be able to get our margins back up to kind of this level, I think, is just a testament to the overall management team. I would say that as we finished the third quarter, and I kind of said that similar to last quarter, I think we have offset a meaningful amount of kind of this inflation and supply chain-related cost pressures. I -- we certainly -- the management team has done a great job with that in managing kind of all elements of costs while continuing to kind of adjust price commensurate to the cost inflation. When we can't offset these with other actions, clearly, that's our priority to be able to do that within the bounds and the walls of the -- of our facilities, but we can't always do that. So you have to raise prices sometimes to your customers. And I think we've done a good job of all of that. In addition, I would tell you that I'm really proud that our team has continued to manage our cost structure even in these periods of robust growth. As you can see in our operating expenses and others that we've been able to really leverage that as we continue to grow and not necessarily just add resources and add costs with that robust growth. And I think that also puts us in a very strong position regardless of what the demand environment might be, whether it be robust or not robust. As we look into the fourth quarter, I would say that the incremental or the decrementals that we see kind of coming into the fourth quarter is based on our guidance is generally normal. I'd say it's within the range of our decrementals. It isn't anything more than that. So I wouldn't read anything into kind of those decrementals at all. I think the -- we still expect strong profitability given the revenue levels here in the fourth quarter, which is reflected in our guidance. Obviously, interest expense is having a little bit of pressure from an I perspective into the fourth quarter sequentially. But ultimately, operating margins, I think, continue to be very strong. I'm not going to necessarily kind of guide here to '23 in terms of operating margins, but what I could tell you is I do feel good about, again, as I said before, the overall performance of the team in being able to ultimately drive our incrementals at that 25% plus kind of operating leverage that we talk about and then ultimately, also being able to protect the bottom line, if the case may be that demand does drop in certain areas. And -- but ultimately, I feel pretty good about the profitability and certainly very proud of the team and their ability to achieve these record levels again.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from David Kelley with Jefferies. You may go ahead.\nGavin Kennedy: Hi. This is Gavin Kennedy on for David Kelley. Your growth in the auto end market continues to be robust. Can you tell us how you're thinking about auto demand in the next 12 months? And are you seeing any signs of customers changing their buying habits? And then any insight into the inventory dynamics here would be great. Thank you.\nAdam Norwitt : Thanks very much, Gavin. Look, we're really proud of the automotive performance here. I mean, if you just look over several quarters, we've had real strong double-digit organic growth in automotive now for eight quarters in a row, which is really excellent and clearly outperforming. I think that, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we've seen strong growth being driven by, in particular, everything related to electrification, but not exclusively that.  We've also seen robust growth and everything related to passenger connectivity, to safety, new electronic systems in cars, all this sort of extraordinary array of content that's being put into this generation and next generation of cars that has created a great opportunity for Amphenol. Both together with our interconnect products, our sensors, our antennas and that entire array of what we broadly refer to as interconnect products. In terms of the behavior of the customers and the outlook over the next 12 months, I mean it's hard for me to give kind of an outlook for the next 12 months. I think others have a better sense of what -- whatever the industry outlook will be, what inventories are both at dealerships and in the supply chain. But -- and for us, what's more important is the content that we see with customers, which continues to grow. In terms of inventories, I couldn't tell you that we have a perfect sense of what the inventories are with our customers, either at the end customers or at the OEM or in the supply chain. But we haven't seen real indications of abnormalities. And so orders continue to be at a good level. We continue to have strong performance and customers seem to want really a lot of our products as we saw in the third quarter. And as would be implied in our guidance also in the fourth quarter, which would make the full year of 2022 just a really exceptional year in automotive on the back of a year in 2021, which was itself also quite strong.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. You may go ahead.\nAmit Daryanani : Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I guess -- my question is around the calendar '22 performance, the midpoint achieved in December. You would end up being about 15% top line growth, give or take organically. And I think 1 of the peers, Adam, everyone has a lot of this growth is driven by inventory build that looks like to reverse in a more pronounced manner into '23. I know you don't track this quantitatively, but maybe qualitatively, you can talk about, when you think about the growth you've achieved in '23, how does that you think in end market and share gain driven versus inventory build that might start to reverse and if you've seen any of that happen? Thank you.\nAdam Norwitt : Yes. Thanks very much, Amit. Listen, I think we've talked about inventory in the IT datacom market, and that's already having some impact here in the third and the fourth quarter. If I look at the overall interconnect market, taking really broadly our position, I mean, it's clear that we are outperforming and not just outperforming the sort of GDP or end market, but outperforming our peers.  And so when you think about the question of inventory, unless you are giving your customers a specific reason, a specific reason to build more inventory of your products then your outperformance should certainly not be a reflection of that inventory. And so I don't know what inventories we have in our -- amongst our customers. We have a sense of it in distribution. And there, I will tell you that it's relatively healthy. Nobody is ringing alarm bells in our distribution channel about inventory levels.  But if you look at our outperformance, unless we had created specifically problems that customers were trying to remedy by building buffer stock over problems, that would certainly not be a result of inventory. And I would tell you that over the course of the last 4 quarters, if not more, we have been solving problems for customers, not creating them. And so I personally think, in a qualitative fashion, as you said as the question qualitatively, that it doesn't fit with me that our outperformance would be and all related to an inventory build. Now is the overall market having some piece of inventory build, that may very well be, but I think that when you look at our overall performance at roughly 15%, as you say, organic growth expectation for the year compared to an industry and industry peers, who are quite a bit below that, you would probably come away thinking to quite a bit of that to share gains. But that's not a scientific assessment, because you didn't for one, I couldn't give you one. But I think qualitatively, I feel like we've made a lot of progress as a company.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from Steven Fox with Fox Advisors. You may go ahead.\nSteven Fox : Hi, good afternoon. I had a question on the auto queue, but I'll save that for off-line. I was wondering if you could talk about the acquisition a little bit more in terms of how it fits in with all the other cable assembly acquisitions you've done. And specifically, this one how you expect to grow it and where the margins are versus where you would like to see them. Thank you.\nAdam Norwitt : Thanks so much, Steve. I'm glad you asked about ICA. It's really a great company. And you mentioned all the cables, some of the acquisitions we've done. I mean, if I think back since 2019, we've done 20 acquisitions since that time, about five of those acquisitions were kind of diversified cable assembly acquisitions. I think we've made like three center acquisitions. We've made four fiber optics acquisitions. We've made six acquisitions of just connector companies. We've had one MilAero value-add company, one automotive, and that sort of makes up the 20. And each of those really helps us to broaden our position with customers, expanding our capability and making sure that we can cover every corner of the electronics industry on a worldwide basis. And ICA really goes towards all of those. ICA is a North America-based company, which I think is a very opportune thing right now. They have factories across the U.S. as well as in Mexico, servicing a real diversified range of applications across primarily the industrial market. Everything from electrified industrial vehicles to types of things that are used in factories, factory automation, to instrumentation, and I could go on and on and on because it's a very fragmented and diversified customer base. And what they bring us really is a real local presence close to customers where sometimes value-add interconnect proximity can be a real asset actually. Because if you're in an area where there's a lot of companies building things, designing things, and you can be their sort of neighbor and supporter and partner, that allows you to get in very early in the design cycle. And then if you have the breadth of Amphenol, if you have the access to low-cost manufacturing, low-cost sourcing of Amphenol, all of a sudden, you can turn that early involvement into a perpetuity and a strong long-term partnership. And that's something that we at Amphenol have been very successful in, in the past whenever we bought companies that maybe have a really nice proximity to a certain customer base, but a customer base who themselves is also globalizing. Not to mention the last thing, I'll say about ICA is, it's just great people. I mean, our company is made up of individuals, general managers around the world, who are entrepreneurs. And every time we bring in a company like an ICA, I'm just really amazed by the strength and the character and the entrepreneurship of the individuals that have joined as part of Amphenol. And I think at ICA, that's certainly the case. And we look forward to growing with customers where they're a little stronger than we were, to bring them into new customers, to helping them on connector technology, where we have a lot more to offer to give them a more total solution to customers and on and on. I mean there's so many levers of value that you have in these acquisitions, and we fully intend to take advantage of as many of them as possible with the team at ICA.\nOperator: The next question is from Luke Junk with Baird. You may go ahead.\nLuke Junk : Yeah. Thanks for taking question. Maybe a bit of a bigger picture structural question. Adam, just wondering, is there anything inherent in the new segment structure of the company that could help with the margin? I'm thinking versus past cycles. If we do, in fact, go into a broader macro downturn, especially anything anecdotally, I think it would be helpful to illustrate the dynamic. I'm thinking enabling shared resources, identifying growth opportunities or things similar to that.\nAdam Norwitt : Well, thanks so much, Luke. Look, I talked about this early in the year when we announced the evolution of our organization into the three divisions, which are now our reportable segments with three division presidents. And for us, it's all about the scalability of that unique entrepreneurial culture of Amphenol, whereby today, we have 130 general managers around the world. And what's really important in times of crisis, and also in good times, by the way, is those 130, they don't just operate in a vacuum. They don't -- yes, every day, you have a general manager, who's running his or her business, reacting in real time to what customers are telling them, reacting in real time to what's happening in the environment, whether it be the supply chain or how technology is evolving or whatever.  But also, they're working closely with our group general managers, who -- now we have 12 of those group general managers, who then work today with those division presidents to make sure that we're stimulating collaboration in real time to make sure that we're sharing best practices and information in real time, to make sure that we're cooperating with customers in real time, to bring to those customers the full suite of products. So in a time like this, the fact that now instead of just having one CEO doing that last year, that today, we have three division presidents, who are doing that on a much more active basis. They have three times as much time in their day by definition, as I have in my day, it means that we can have an even richer real-time reactivity to changes and dynamics that come in the marketplace. And that means opportunities, our ability to capitalize on them, our ability to migrate resources quickly towards those opportunities, it also means when there are challenges, how do we quickly react? How do we give support to those who sometimes have to do really tough things. Cutting cost is not a hard thing. It requires an enormous amount of moral support and time and discussion. And that kind of iteration and that interaction is just much more rich today with our three divisions than it was when it was just me with the seven groups that we had going into the end of this year. And so it's part of scaling the company, which has always been, as you know, one of my greatest priorities is to preserve the culture of Amphenol and then to ensure its scalability. Well, part of that scalability is making sure that when the next downturn comes along, we're just as prepared for it, and we have just the same ability to react positively as we've done in the past. And I think we've demonstrated for more than two decades that in difficult times, Amphenolians rise to the occasion immediately and deliver superior results. Whether that was in the bursting of the Internet bubble 20 years ago plus, whether that was in the global financial crisis, whether that was during the pandemic. In each of those times, the fact that our margins were down by just 300 basis points was a distinct and clear reflection of that culture, manifesting itself in that reactivity. And so the perpetuation of that culture, the scaling of that culture is really what this is all about. And so no doubt about it. I think in the big picture, that new divisions that -- those segments, as we talk about them publicly, that will clearly support the company to continue to do what we've always been known for.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. You may go ahead.\nWamsi Mohan : Yeah. Thank you so much. I was wondering, Adam, if you could elaborate maybe a little bit on the pull forward comment you made on mobile devices. You had expected, obviously, to grow sequentially at a much slower rate. You did report very strong sequential growth. Maybe talk about the cadence of orders and why do you think that happened in the quarter? And if I could, if you could just maybe give us some sense of what you're seeing in China since you have such a good view into the region? If you'd characterize it maybe as things being stable or getting worse or getting better, that would be great. Thank you.\nAdam Norwitt : Sure. Thanks so much, Wamsi. Well, it's two questions, but I will say they're a little bit related, and let me say why. Look, if you look at our mobile devices market, it's been, as always, 1 of our most volatile markets. And I think if you go back over the last decade, we've had at least two fourth quarters, which were down in the kind of mid- to high teens on a sequential basis. So our outlook for this quarter being down sequentially low double digits, it's not a foreign concept to us that once in a while, you'll have a fourth quarter that will be down. I mean what we always think about in mobile devices, the one sure thing, and that's in a market where there are very few sure things is that the second half typically is quite significantly above the first half. And here, our guidance would imply that in the second half, we're still up north of 30% in the second half compared to the first half. So very robust and relatively normal kind of feel between the first and the second semester of 2022.  I did mention that the -- we saw -- at the end of the quarter, really, a very strong demand in mobile devices pulls from customers. And why was that? You could come up with a number of different theories. I mean my own theory is that if you think about mobile devices, which are still today primarily manufactured in China, there was not only just holidays in China, but there were some other events going on over the last -- over the first few weeks of October in China. And it wouldn't surprise me if maybe some customers were preparing for both those holidays as well as the various political meetings that happened in the country, and that may have led to a little bit of pull forward, as I alluded to, and that is also reflected in this guidance. I mean, look, relative to China, I think it's a tale of two cities here. One is, if you read the papers and if you watch everything, obviously, at the highest levels of the government, there's a lot of tension. And you would be blind not to recognize that there's a lot of political tension. There's various policies being enacted by the U.S. and there's various things that are happening in China that are all interpreted in that way, that there is some tension. At the same time, on the street, on the ground, it is pretty stable and kind of business as usual. We haven't seen funny things happening that 1 would sort of fear over the last few years. Our operations are running really great, and we continue to make great progress with local customers who need our technologies. And I think it comes back to something I've talked about in the past, which is that we operate globally as a local company everywhere that we operate. If you think about it, we're in 40 or more countries around the world. And each of our operations of those countries is run by general managers, who are from that place. And they run their business as if it was a local business, albeit with the backdrop of support, the resources and the capabilities and the breadth of a global Amphenol. And nowhere is that more true than in China, where our entrepreneurial management team there has just done a phenomenal, phenomenal job of making sure that customers know that they get local support, from local teams, local engineers, local quality engineers. This is not ex patriots. This is not us taking American technology and porting it over there to support. It is all locally developed and locally supported. And thus, in their times of need, our customers come to us when we can solve their problems. And that's what they do in the world over. And so while the headlines in the papers are what they are, I can tell you that on the ground, our team continues to operate very effectively and successfully across China. The one last thing I'll say, I'm sure in your question about China is embedded a question maybe about how COVID is going there. I'm just so proud of how our team has navigated the restrictions that were associated with zero COVID over the course of this year. Those were much more acute towards the end of the first quarter and into the second quarter, in particular in Shanghai, where our team just did a fabulous job. But there are still occasionally some little restrictions that are popping up. And our team has a fabulous playbook for it. And we don't have all our eggs in one basket anywhere in the world, and that includes in China. And so we have a very diversified and broad set of facilities around the country, such that we're not susceptible to a total impact if 1 place has a shutdown or another. So I would say it's very stable. I certainly hope that the world's governments can all get along. That's something that I personally hope for all of our sakes, but for Amphenol's position in China, we remain very robust, and we're very confident of the future.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from Jim Suva with Citigroup. You may go ahead.\nJim Suva : Thank you. I have a question about strategy for either Adam or Craig. With interest rates higher and Craig gave some good details about interest expense that we should model for Q4 and going forward. I didn't know if that included any additional Fed raise next month or not. But the bigger strategy question is, does this make it so your use of capital you are looking to pay down debt a little bit more or higher returns on capital versus how you look at M&A or stock buybacks a little more, you start to balance things a little bit differently with higher interest rates, but just let us know about strategically if it impacts things at all in your decision tree. Thank you.\nCraig Lampo : Thanks, Jim. Yeah, I would say that our overall kind of capital deployment strategy, we certainly have talked about many times in the past. And certainly, over the last number of years, it's been in the lower interest rate environment, but we've had a similar capital deployment strategy over many different interest rate environments over the years. And it really has been consistent, and it's really resulted in what we believe to be a great return of investment to our shareholders. And in the strategy, kind of advise strategy before has been flexible and how it's executed over time depending on the economic and market conditions is in balance in regards to ensuring that we're deploying capital towards our M&A strategy, which really we believe provides the best return in our return of capital to shareholders, and that's both our dividend program and the return of repurchase program -- share repurchase program. And I would say, given that kind of strong free cash flow generation that we've had over the years that I can say with confidence is that really the rising interest rate environment really won't impact our overall capital deployment strategy. And I would say in any real meaningful way. I mean we continue to look to deploy that half of our free cash flow towards M&A over time, in that other half towards that return of capital to shareholders. And if opportunities that are more significant in acquisitions, we're certainly going to adjust that towards those acquisitions in a fast and flexible manner. And I think that we do generate a lot of free cash flow, and we certainly expect to continue to do so. So I wouldn't say that really the interest rate environment is going to change that. I think debt paydown is certainly something that we would do if some of those other levers just certainly M&A and otherwise, just isn't available to us. And we have been able to kind of maintain and in certain cases, pay down debt over time anyways, even giving all those different actions that we take. So I wouldn't say that the current environment has really changed the way we think about that.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Joseph Spak with RBC Capital Markets. You may go ahead.\nJoseph Spak : Thanks so much. Adam, I was wondering if you could comment just broadly given the macro and all this uncertainty, whether you're seeing any widening of the acquisition funnel or maybe any loosening of evaluations as sellers might get more skittish or it doesn't remain to, I guess, the world it was or valuation that was. And if I could sneak in just a quick housekeeping. Would the book-to-bill have still been negative without FX movements?\nAdam Norwitt : Yeah. So I think just your little housekeeping question, I think -- I don't think it would have changed the book-to-bill with FX. Look, relative to M&A and the funnel, and we have a great pipeline of acquisitions. As I mentioned, over -- since the beginning of 2019, we've closed 20 deals through quite a cycle, I will say. I mean if you think about the cycle in which we've done that, this has been quite a cycle. And I think the compelling story of joining the Amphenol organization being part of something that is really special. It's something that we continue to tell to companies around the world, and we continue to find good reception to that. Does it become a kind of a buyer's market, for example, are sellers a little more skittish and were willing to sell. I'd be a little careful about in kind of overestimating the impact of the macro on the decision-making of sellers, many of whom are making the one decision in their life to do this. So in my experience, sellers are not kind of looking at what the S&P 500 is doing. They are looking at what the 10-year treasury is doing or looking at what FX rates are doing in that moment. When they think about selling, should they sell, should they not sell, and at what value. Can it impact on the margin, the current environment, what others are willing to pay for deals, and we're a very financially strong company. Maybe that could. I would hope that there's good reason among the universe of buyers around valuations. But we don't normally see just because macro shifts, a dramatic change in the M&A landscape. We have a fabulous funnel. We have a fabulous track record. We have a fabulous organizational culture that's really attractive to companies. I think all of those things will serve us well and will ensure that over the long term, we'll continue to find great companies become part of Amphenol. And I'll continue to be completely unable to predict when that's going to happen. But we're happy to have gotten one deal done here this quarter, and I'm confident over the long term we'll have some more.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from William Stein with Truist. You may go ahead.\nWilliam Stein : Thank you for taking my question. Adam, I don't normally ask about -- I guess it doesn't normally get a ton of attention, the broadband end market, but the growth has been very strong and for a while now. I wonder if you can comment as to longer-term trends here. We've heard some other component suppliers talk about this end market looking strong for more than just a couple of quarters. We hear about cable MSOs and carriers making pretty significant spending commitments. And I wonder if you're seeing that dynamic and whether that's reflected in really substantial backlog there or if that might be overstating things. Thank you.\nAdam Norwitt : Yeah. Well, thanks for the question. And look, I'm really happy to talk about the broadband market. It's always been a core for Amphenol even if there's been a few challenging years as the sort of operators in broadband were merging and buying each other and waiting for certain technologies to come. And with all that consolidation and that kind of waiting period, there was a relatively flat kind of investment in the broadband market. And what I think we've seen this year with the real spike up of our performance in this space and can only be termed out. If you look at where we are today on a run rate basis, we're more than 50% higher than we were a year ago. And over the last kind of three-four years, it was running at a relatively stable pace on a quarterly basis, broadband, and now it's at quite a higher level. And I think it's a reflection of really one thing, the extraordinary expansion of data traffic in the world and the necessity of operators to work to support that. I mean, think about all the things that we do on a given day. And there's rarely a minute that goes by where you're not somehow using some data somewhere and creating traffic. I'm going to give a little shout out, because I have a new baby niece, who my little brother had his first child just a few days ago, and I have spent more time on face time, looking at this beautiful young thing, whose name is Chloe. I have spent more time looking at this beautiful thing on real-time video over the last six days, then I think I have face timed ever in my life. I mean it's extraordinary. And the fact that you can sit in Connecticut and you can look on an iPad, and you can be looking at a baby that was born not very few minutes before that. And you can be experiencing that with the richness. Sure, you're not there, you don't smell the baby. You don't see everything around it. But you can actually see the thing that is there in all of her beauty. I mean, that is a sign to me of a world that demands a lot of broadband. And so what is that going to be in the future? Is there some momentum in the spending? I think there is some momentum here. There's also a lot of government funding. Let's not forget, I mean, a lot of this infrastructure bill here in the U.S. and there are other countries doing the same, has focused on the fact that there's a whole subset of the world who doesn't get to do what I just described, because they live in areas that don't have access to rural broadband. I mean, broadband is a utility. It's a necessity. It's in many ways a human right. And I think governments of the world have woken up to the fact that if you don't provide that access to people regardless of if they live 10 miles from the nearest paved road in the middle of Kansas or if they live in Manhattan, then you're not really enabling people to live a full life. And that -- we're really proud of what we do in the broadband space. And we've always stuck it out even when the spending wasn't growing. And I'm just so happy for our team and proud of our team that they are there today to enable the growth and the investments that are happening with our customers.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Joe Giordano with Cowen. You may go ahead.\nJoe Giordano : Hey, thanks again here. Good afternoon, everyone. I know we all appreciate like the beauty of Amphenol is like when 1 part of your business is doing well. So 1 part is doing weaker, one is doing stronger and it kind of balances the other out. But if we were to like normalize for the size of the relative end markets you have, is there -- can you kind of like which parts are the -- have the most impact on your margins if you were to normalize for size? Like if there was something to be down, which would be the last one you'd want to be down, if you were to kind of think about it that way?\nCraig Lampo : Joe, thanks for the question. I actually wouldn't really call out any market that really has significantly lower margins. I mean some have lower gross margins, but then lower SG&A, and we talked about the structure being a little bit different depending on the market. But from an operating margin perspective, honestly, I wouldn't say that there's much of a significant difference. I mean, you see that there's some differences in our operations. Our segments have a little bit of a difference. But from a market perspective, I really wouldn't call that out. I mean broadband, which is really some -- it used to be more the cable business, and it really isn't only the cable business anymore, because some of the acquisitions we've done in that space that's really broadened our portfolio out in that market. And it's actually somewhat of the reason why we've seen some of this big growth historically was lower margin, but I wouldn't even call that out as some of this big growth has been -- having lower margins associated with it. So long-winded answer to your question is, I really wouldn't call out any particular markets.\nOperator: And our last question comes from Matt Sheerin with Stifel. You may go ahead.\nMatt Sheerin: Thank you. Thanks, Adam and Craig for all the details so far. My final question here is just on the aerospace market, where you've had some nice momentum over the last few quarters, still below where you were pre pandemic, but it looks like you've got really strong backlog. So could you talk about the momentum you're seeing there, Adam, and the content opportunity going forward?\nAdam Norwitt : For sure, Matt, and thanks so much. It's a great last question. Look, I mentioned in my prepared remarks, just how proud I am of our team working in this market. It is not easy. Let me tell you, it is not easy to be servicing a space, an end market and to have that end market drop by as much as it did in the case of broadband. And let alone to do it well, some of your fellow colleagues are in spaces that aren't dropping by that much. So you don't even have the misery less company kind of dynamic. And what is the playbook for Amphenol in times like that. It's not to run and hide, it's not to just cower and sort of drown in sorrows. You take quick action. You make sure that your resources that you have deployed are befitting the demand that you have from your customers. And then you go out and you build new basis of business and you take the opportunity of the crisis. And that's really important that you take the opportunity from that crisis to diversify your business even further, to support the customers who still need you in those difficult times. Because then when it comes back, you have a much broader, more stable, more robust and high potential business to run. And that's what our team, who works in commercial air has done. And so yes, we're not quite back to the kind of pre-pandemic levels, but the world is also not quite back to pre-pandemic levels. I mean certainly, there's more travel and airports are more crowded here. But Craig and I went to Asia recently and I can tell you, there's a lot less flights crossing the Pacific than they ever were before. So the sort of widebody, long-haul kind of part of the business travel that was a real big driver of aircraft demand, that is still yet to be fully recovered. But our team has just done a fabulous job of being there for our customers, making sure that we have the right resources and using the opportunity of the crisis such that when things do normalize and they're on the path to doing that, we'll be in a better position today than we were prior to the crisis. What we also see in aerospace and one of the areas where I'll tell you our team spends quite a bit of time because they had a little bit of extra time given the downturn with the major traditional jetliner manufacturers, is this whole world of kind of new aviation, electrified aviation, different kinds of small startups all over the place doing really innovative and exciting things. And our team is working on just dozens and dozens of programs with countless of these companies, large and small, who are trying to really change the face of aviation in a world where everybody wants to reduce the amount of carbon that's being put in the atmosphere. And we have so much going on around Amphenol that's in support of this decarbonization. And I'll tell you that our team in Comair has really stepped up there and has just a really pervasive presence designing new products that really suit the unique applications of some of these next-generation systems that may eventually make it such that we can get on a plane, and we won't be just belching carbon in the atmosphere as we're moving across the country. And I personally am really hopeful for that for me and for our next generation. And I'm really proud of what the company is doing in that respect.\nOperator: Thank you. And I'll now turn the call back over to Mr. Norwitt for any closing remarks.\nAdam Norwitt : Well, operator, thank you so much. And in particular, thank you to everybody who is on the call here today. Thanks for your great questions. And I wish that everybody enjoys a wonderful fall, and we will be back together with you here in 90 days. And by then, amazingly, it will be 2023. So have a wonderful rest of the year, and we look forward to seeing you all soon. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Thank you for attending today's conference, and have a nice day.",

            "name": "Craig Lampo",
            "content": "Good afternoon, everyone. This is Craig Lampo, Amphenol's CFO, and I'm here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO. We would like to welcome you to our third quarter 2022 conference call. Our third quarter 2020 results were released this morning. I will provide some financial commentary, and then Adam will give an overview of the business and current trends, then we will take questions. As a reminder, during the call, we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures and make certain forward-looking statements. So please refer to the relevant disclosures in our press release for further information. In addition, all prior year comparative data discussed during this year -- during this call is on a continuing operations basis. The company closed the third quarter with record sales of $3.29 billion and record GAAP and adjusted diluted EPS of $0.80. Third quarter sales were up 17% in U.S. dollars, 21% in local currencies and 18% organically compared to the third quarter of 2021. Sequentially, sales were up by 5% in U.S. dollars, 7% in local currencies and 6% organically. Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes. Orders in the quarter were $3.151 billion, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 0.96:1. Year-to-date, our book-to-bill remains strong at 1.07 to 1, and the company continues to have a robust order backlog. GAAP and adjusted operating income were $681 million and $693 million, respectively, in the third quarter of 2022. GAAP and adjusted operating margin were 20.7% and 21%, respectively, in the third quarter. On a GAAP basis, operating margin increased by 40 basis points compared to the third quarter of '21 and was flat sequentially. GAAP operating margin for the third quarter included $12 million of acquisition-related costs. On an adjusted basis, operating margin increased by 70 basis points compared to the third quarter of '21 and 30 basis points sequentially. The year-over-year increase in adjusted operating margin was driven by strong operating leverage on the significantly higher sales volumes as well as the benefit of ongoing pricing actions. On a sequential basis, the increase in operating margin reflected strong operating leverage on the higher sales volumes. Given the continuing dynamic overall cost and supply chain environment, we are very proud of the company's operating performance. Our team's ability to effectively manage through the myriad of challenges around the world is a direct result of the company's entrepreneurial culture, which continues to foster a high-performance, action-oriented management team. Breaking down third quarter results by segment relative to the third quarter of '21. Sales in the Harsh Environment Solutions segment were $794 million and increased by 12% in U.S. dollars and 14% organically and segment operating margin was 26.1%. Sales in the Communications Solutions segment were $1.518 billion, an increase by 19% in U.S. dollars and 17% organically. Segment operating margin was 22.5%. Sales in the Interconnect and Sensor Systems segment were $983 million and increased by 17% in U.S. dollars and 23% organically. Segment operating margin was 18.8%. The company's GAAP effective tax rate for the third quarter was 23.1%, and the adjusted effective tax rate was 24.5%, which compared to 22.2% and 24.5% in the third quarter of '21, respectively. GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations was a record $0.80 in the third quarter, an increase of 19% compared to $0.67 in the prior year period. Adjusted diluted EPS was a record $0.80, an increase of 23% compared to $0.65 in the third quarter of 2021. This was an excellent result, especially considering the variety of challenges that the company continues to face during the quarter. Operating cash flow in the third quarter was a record $576 million or 116% of adjusted net income. And net of capital spending, our free cash flow was a record $457 million or 92% of adjusted net income. Given our continued strong top line growth, we are pleased to see cash flow yield remain at these strong levels in the third quarter. From a working capital standpoint, days sales outstanding and payable days were 71 and 56 days, respectively, both within our normal range. And despite the continued challenging supply chain environment, our inventory days were 83 days, which came down in the third quarter and were also within our normal range. We are very pleased with our organization's strong management of working capital. As mentioned in today's earnings release, the company's Board of Directors has approved a 5% increase in the company's quarterly dividend to $0.21 from the previous $0.20 per share, effective for payments beginning in January 2023. During the quarter, the company repurchased 2.4 million shares of common stock at an average price of approximately $72. When combined with our normal quarterly dividend, total capital returned to shareholders in the third quarter of 2022 was $289 million. Total debt at September 30 was $4.8 billion, and net debt was $3.5 billion. Total liquidity at the end of the quarter was $3.6 billion, which included a cash, cash and short-term investments on hand of $1.3 billion plus availability under our existing credit facilities. Third quarter 2022 EBITDA was $806 million, and at the end of the third quarter of '22, our net leverage ratio is 1.1 times. I also wanted to make a few comments on interest expense and currency impacts. Due to the rising interest rate environment, our interest expense has increased primarily as a result of our floating Greek commercial paper, which had a balance of $904 million and represented approximately 19% of our total debt outstanding at the end of the quarter. Due to the significant increase in interest rates over the last several months, we expect fourth quarter interest expense to be approximately $38 million, which is reflected in our fourth quarter guidance. Based on current debt balances as well as current and near-term projected rate increases, we expect quarterly 2023 interest expense to be approximately $40 million. Regarding currency and the significant continued depreciation of the U.S. dollar in the fourth quarter, we expect currency to have a negative sequential sales impact of approximately one percentage point and a year-over-year negative impact of five percentage points, assuming current rates. I will now turn the call over to Adam, who will provide some commentary on current market trends. Thanks, Chris. Appreciate the question. No, we're really proud actually of the performance, both obviously here in the second quarter from a profitability, but certainly in the third quarter here, reaching 21%, matching our previous record that we had in the fourth quarter of 2018 and clearly, a very different cost environment. I mean, since the fourth quarter of '18, we've kind of had a pandemic. We've had supply chain challenges. We had a lot of inflation. We have energy costs. I mean you name it. And regardless of all that, I think we've been able to navigate that very well and just capitalize also on the strong demand environment and ultimately, be able to get our margins back up to kind of this level, I think, is just a testament to the overall management team. I would say that as we finished the third quarter, and I kind of said that similar to last quarter, I think we have offset a meaningful amount of kind of this inflation and supply chain-related cost pressures. I -- we certainly -- the management team has done a great job with that in managing kind of all elements of costs while continuing to kind of adjust price commensurate to the cost inflation. When we can't offset these with other actions, clearly, that's our priority to be able to do that within the bounds and the walls of the -- of our facilities, but we can't always do that. So you have to raise prices sometimes to your customers. And I think we've done a good job of all of that. In addition, I would tell you that I'm really proud that our team has continued to manage our cost structure even in these periods of robust growth. As you can see in our operating expenses and others that we've been able to really leverage that as we continue to grow and not necessarily just add resources and add costs with that robust growth. And I think that also puts us in a very strong position regardless of what the demand environment might be, whether it be robust or not robust. As we look into the fourth quarter, I would say that the incremental or the decrementals that we see kind of coming into the fourth quarter is based on our guidance is generally normal. I'd say it's within the range of our decrementals. It isn't anything more than that. So I wouldn't read anything into kind of those decrementals at all. I think the -- we still expect strong profitability given the revenue levels here in the fourth quarter, which is reflected in our guidance. Obviously, interest expense is having a little bit of pressure from an I perspective into the fourth quarter sequentially. But ultimately, operating margins, I think, continue to be very strong. I'm not going to necessarily kind of guide here to '23 in terms of operating margins, but what I could tell you is I do feel good about, again, as I said before, the overall performance of the team in being able to ultimately drive our incrementals at that 25% plus kind of operating leverage that we talk about and then ultimately, also being able to protect the bottom line, if the case may be that demand does drop in certain areas. And -- but ultimately, I feel pretty good about the profitability and certainly very proud of the team and their ability to achieve these record levels again. Thanks, Jim. Yeah, I would say that our overall kind of capital deployment strategy, we certainly have talked about many times in the past. And certainly, over the last number of years, it's been in the lower interest rate environment, but we've had a similar capital deployment strategy over many different interest rate environments over the years. And it really has been consistent, and it's really resulted in what we believe to be a great return of investment to our shareholders. And in the strategy, kind of advise strategy before has been flexible and how it's executed over time depending on the economic and market conditions is in balance in regards to ensuring that we're deploying capital towards our M&A strategy, which really we believe provides the best return in our return of capital to shareholders, and that's both our dividend program and the return of repurchase program -- share repurchase program. And I would say, given that kind of strong free cash flow generation that we've had over the years that I can say with confidence is that really the rising interest rate environment really won't impact our overall capital deployment strategy. And I would say in any real meaningful way. I mean we continue to look to deploy that half of our free cash flow towards M&A over time, in that other half towards that return of capital to shareholders. And if opportunities that are more significant in acquisitions, we're certainly going to adjust that towards those acquisitions in a fast and flexible manner. And I think that we do generate a lot of free cash flow, and we certainly expect to continue to do so. So I wouldn't say that really the interest rate environment is going to change that. I think debt paydown is certainly something that we would do if some of those other levers just certainly M&A and otherwise, just isn't available to us. And we have been able to kind of maintain and in certain cases, pay down debt over time anyways, even giving all those different actions that we take. So I wouldn't say that the current environment has really changed the way we think about that. Joe, thanks for the question. I actually wouldn't really call out any market that really has significantly lower margins. I mean some have lower gross margins, but then lower SG&A, and we talked about the structure being a little bit different depending on the market. But from an operating margin perspective, honestly, I wouldn't say that there's much of a significant difference. I mean, you see that there's some differences in our operations. Our segments have a little bit of a difference. But from a market perspective, I really wouldn't call that out. I mean broadband, which is really some -- it used to be more the cable business, and it really isn't only the cable business anymore, because some of the acquisitions we've done in that space that's really broadened our portfolio out in that market. And it's actually somewhat of the reason why we've seen some of this big growth historically was lower margin, but I wouldn't even call that out as some of this big growth has been -- having lower margins associated with it. So long-winded answer to your question is, I really wouldn't call out any particular markets."

            "content": "Well, thank you very much, Craig, and allow me to extend my welcome to all of you on the phone here today. And I certainly hope that all of you are having an enjoyable fall. Here we are in beautiful Wallingford, Connecticut, with the leaves turning a wonderful autumn hue. I'm going to highlight our third quarter achievements. I'll then spend a little time to discuss the trends and our progress across our served markets. And then finally, I'll comment on our outlook for the fourth quarter and the full year of 2022. And of course, we'll have time for some questions at the end. Turning to the third quarter. Our results in the third quarter were much stronger than expected and exceeded the high end of our guidance in sales and adjusted diluted earnings per share. Sales grew a very strong 17% in U.S. dollars and 21% in local currencies, reaching a new record of just under $3.3 billion.  On an organic basis, sales increased by 18%, with broad-based growth across most of our served markets as well as contributions from the company's acquisition program. The company booked orders of $3.151 billion, representing a book-to-bill, as Craig mentioned, of 0.96 to 1. I would say that despite this slightly negative book-to-bill, the company's order backlog remains very robust. We are pleased to deliver strong profitability in the quarter, with adjusted operating margins reaching 21.0%, a 70 basis point increase from prior year and a 30 basis point increase from prior quarter. We achieved these results despite the continued wide range of operational, inflationary and supply chain challenges around the world. Adjusted diluted EPS grew strongly from prior year, increasing by 23% to a new record of $0.80, and just really an excellent reflection of our organization's continued strong execution here in 2022. Finally, the company generated record operating and free cash flow of $576 million and $457 million, respectively, here in the third quarter. I just want to say how proud I am of our entire organization around the world. Our results this quarter once again reflect the discipline and agility of Amphenol's entrepreneurial team as we continue to perform well amidst what is no doubt a very dynamic and challenging environment. We're also pleased to announce that we closed the acquisition of Integrated Cable Assembly Holdings, or ICA, in September, based in North America and with annual sales of approximately $90 million. ICA manufactures a broad array of cable assemblies for a diversified range of applications, particularly in the industrial market. This acquisition further expands our offering of high-technology value-added interconnect products in the industrial market. As we welcome this outstanding new team to the company, we remain confident that our acquisition program will continue to create great value for Amphenol. In fact, our ability to identify and execute upon acquisitions and successfully bring these new companies into the Amphenol family remains a core competitive advantage for the company. Now turning to the trends and our progress across our served markets. I would just comment that we're very pleased that the company's broad and balanced end market diversification continues to create value for Amphenol. Importantly, and I've mentioned this many times before, our diversification mitigates the impact of the volatility of individual end markets, while also exposing us to leading technologies wherever they may arise across the electronics industry. And these are both very important benefits, in particular, in today's dynamic market environment. I would also just mention that in the third quarter, each of our eight end markets grew organically and some of them in double digits organically. So starting with the military market. That market represented 9% of our sales in the third quarter. Sales in this market grew 1% in U.S. dollars and 3% organically, which was a bit lower than our expectation heading into the quarter. On an organic basis, growth in space-related, ground vehicles and avionics applications was offset by moderations of sales of products used in communications, rotorcraft and engine applications. Sequentially, sales declined by just about 1%. As we look into the fourth quarter, we expect a high single-digit sequential sales increase in the military market. And for the full year 2022, we now expect a low single-digit increase in sales from last year's levels. We continue to be very pleased with the strength of the company's broad position in the defense electronics market. As militaries around the world increase their adoption of a wide array of next-generation technologies in the face of what is no question an increasingly volatile geopolitical landscape, our team managing our leading range of interconnect and sensor products continues to position the company strongly for the future. The commercial aerospace market represented 2% of our sales in the quarter. Sales grew a very strong 36% versus prior year and 42% organically, driven by broad-based strength across all aircraft applications. Compared to the second quarter, our sales declined just a slight 1%, which was actually better than our expectations coming into the quarter. As we look to the fourth quarter, we expect a modest decline in sales versus the third quarter levels. But for the full year 2022, we expect sales to increase a very strong 30% compared to prior year. Our team is justifiably proud to have now realized four consecutive quarters of strong growth in the commercial air market, a clear sign of their resilience and of the continued recovery in the global air travel industry. Going forward, we look forward to benefiting from the company's strong interconnect and sensor technology positions across a wide array of aircraft platforms and next-generation systems being integrated into those airplanes. The industrial market represented 25% of our sales in the third quarter. Sales increased by 11% in U.S. dollars and 13% organically. Our growth was broad-based across most segments of the worldwide industrial market, including battery and heavy electric vehicles, factory automation, alternative energy, heavy equipment, medical, oil and gas, and building automation. Sequentially, our sales actually increased by 2% from the second quarter, which was a bit better than our expectations coming into the quarter. Looking to the fourth quarter, we expect a modest sequential sales decline. And for the full year 2022, we expect a mid-teens increase in sales from prior year. Our results in the industrial market this quarter confirm once again that our outstanding global team working in this important market continues to find new opportunities for growth across the many segments of the exciting industrial electronics market. I remain confident that our long-term strategy to expand our high-technology interconnect antenna and sensor offering, both organically and through complementary acquisitions, has positioned us well to capitalize on the many technology revolutions happening across the industrial market. To that end, the addition of ICA further strengthens our position across a number of exciting segments within this important end market, and we look forward to realizing the benefits of this strategy for many years to come. The automotive market represented 20% of our sales in the quarter, and sales in the third quarter grew by a very strong 27% in U.S. dollars and 37% organically, driven by broad-based strength across most automotive applications and particularly strong growth once again in sales to electric and hybrid electric vehicle applications. Sequentially, our sales increased by 4% from the second quarter, which was much better than our expectations. For the fourth quarter, we expect sales to remain roughly at these levels. And for the full year 2022, we expect sales to increase by approximately 20% compared to last year, driven by our expanded position in next-generation electronics and electrical systems being integrated into cars. I remain extremely proud of our team working in the automotive market. They continue to manage well through a challenging overall environment, all while remaining focused on driving new design wins with customers, who are implementing a wide array of new technologies into their vehicles. Our continued outperformance is a direct result of their excellent efforts. The mobile devices market represented 12% of our sales in the quarter, and our sales to customers in this market increased by 13% in U.S. dollars and 15% organically. And this was driven by strong growth in sales of products incorporated into smartphones, wearables and laptops. Sequentially, our sales increased by a much stronger-than-expected 43%, driven by higher sales across virtually all product categories that we serve.  As we have seen periodically in the past, we do believe that some small portion of this robust demand in the third quarter may have been pulled forward from the fourth quarter. Accordingly, we expect a low double-digit sequential decline in sales from these strong third quarter levels. For the full year, we anticipate sales to grow modestly from our strong 2021.  I'm very proud of our team working in the mobile devices market, as they continue to execute strongly in the face of an ever dynamic demand for our leading array of antennas, interconnect products and mechanisms that are integrated into a wide range of next-generation mobile devices. And no question that this team remains poised as always, to capture any opportunities for incremental sales that may arise here in 2022 or beyond. The mobile networks market represented 5% of our sales in the quarter, and sales increased by a strong 19% versus prior year and 15% organically as growth in our sales to mobile service providers was only partially offset by a moderation of sales to equipment manufacturers. On a sequential basis, our sales increased by 9%, which was better than our expectations. For the fourth quarter, we expect a low double-digit sequential sales reduction after our very strong third quarter. And for the full year 2022, sales are expected to grow in the high single digits. We're encouraged by our strengthening performance in the mobile networks market. As operators continue to ramp up their investments in next-generation systems, our team remains focused on realizing the benefits of our long-term efforts to expand our position in next-generation 5G equipment in networks around the world. The information technology and data communications market represented 22% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in the third quarter rose from prior year by 16% in U.S. dollars and 11% organically. This was driven by increased demand for products in servers and networking applications, and that was only partially offset by some declines in storage-related products. Sequentially, our sales did decline by 3%, albeit better than our expectation coming into the quarter. We believe that this begins to reflect some of the expected inventory corrections that we've discussed in the past by our IT datacom customers. As we look towards the fourth quarter, we expect a low double-digit decline in sales from these third quarter levels as customers continue to moderate their demand and adjust their inventory levels. For the full year 2022, however, we expect very strong high-teens sales growth compared to prior year.  We remain encouraged by the company's outstanding position in the global IT datacom market. Our team has done just an outstanding job developing leading high-speed power and fiber optic interconnect products that are enabling our OEM and web service provider customers, who continue to drive their equipment and networks towards ever higher levels of performance. We look forward to realizing the benefits of that leading position in this important market for many years to come. And finally, the broadband market represented 5% of our sales in the third quarter. Sales in this market increased by a very robust 65% in U.S. dollars and 46% organic, as we experienced strong demand from cable operators for a wide range of our products. On a sequential basis, sales increased by 2%, which was better than our expectation coming into the third quarter. Looking towards the fourth quarter, we expect sales to increase moderately from these strong third quarter levels. And for the full year 2022, we expect sales to increase by more than 50% from prior year, and that includes both robust organic growth as well as the benefit of acquisitions. We look forward to continuing to support our broadband service provider customers around the world with our expanded range of high-technology products. These products have become even more critical as our customers increase the bandwidth and capacity of their networks to support the expansion of high-speed data applications to homes and businesses. And this is in certain cases, and furtherance of government-funded programs to expand broadband. Now turning to our outlook. There is no doubt that the current economic environment remains highly uncertain and increasingly dynamic. Assuming market conditions do not meaningfully worsen and also assuming constant exchange rates, for the fourth quarter, we expect sales in the range of $3.09 billion to $3.15 billion, and adjusted diluted earnings per share in the range of $0.73 to $0.75. This would represent sales growth of 2% to 4% and adjusted diluted EPS growth of 4% to 7% versus the fourth quarter of 2021. Our fourth quarter guidance represents also an expectation for full year sales of $12.474 billion to $12.534 billion and full year adjusted diluted EPS of $2.95 to $2.97. This outlook would represent full year sales and adjusted EPS growth of 15% and 19% to 20%, respectively. I remain confident in the ability of our outstanding management team to adapt to the many opportunities and challenges in the current dynamic environment, and to continue to grow our market position while driving strong profitability. In addition, I just have to say that the entire Amphenol team around the world remains committed to delivering long-term sustainable value. And I would be remiss if I did not take this opportunity here to thank each and every 1 of our Amphenolian team members around the world for their truly outstanding efforts here in the third quarter. And with that, operator, we'd be very happy to take any questions. Yeah. Thanks very much, Mark. Look, I think that we've talked before, first about orders that positive book-to-bills don't always grow to the sky. And so it was not surprising. It wasn't certainly surprising to us that our orders moderated a bit in the quarter, and we had a slightly negative book-to-bill. We still have built tremendous backlog over the recent quarters. At the same time, I think it's fairly clear that we are in a world where, economically, there are more cross currents. And those crosscurrents can always have an impact on markets that we serve. And I think some of our customers, in particular, in places like IT datacom, who are a little bit reacting to, as I talked about, the inventory position, that would be an example of a place where maybe customers have put a little more conservatism in their balance sheet. I think we saw also in industrial with our guidance, we've had very, very strong performance in industrial and maybe there's a little bit -- a few signs of some hesitation across a few customers in that area. But it's not like we're seeing anything that anybody else isn't seeing here. We're not projecting anything, but I think the world is volatile. Just look how it's reflected in the interest rate environment, the currency markets that Craig discussed earlier, and as always, in a market like that, it's not our job at Amphenol to try to guess whether there is going to be a recession 1 day or otherwise. But it is our job, and it's our track record to always be prepared regardless. And I've talked about this in the past. You've heard me say the term that we drive with 1 foot on the gas and 1 foot on the brake. And I can tell you, we're driving hard in both respects, doing everything we can to make sure that we're there for our customers, satisfying their demand, and we did that in a big way here in the third quarter, shipping nearly $3.3 billion in sales. But for those areas where we have seen real-time feedback from customers that they may need a little bit less of our product, you can bet that those 130 Amphenol general managers, the ones who may see some softening of demand, that they're rapidly adjusting their resources. They're rapidly taking all the steps that an Amphenol General Manager does take to be prepared to preserve the company's financial strength in that environment. So we're never going to try to guess when that recession is coming. We'll let lots of people, who are much more experts at that than we are, to do that. But we will always be prepared and there's no question that we are today. Yeah. No, thank you very much, Samik. Listen, we always come out of the quarter and we try to give our best estimate of what the next quarter is going to be on behalf of everybody here. And it's a credit to our team that we've been able to outperform that, and you can bet that we're always going to try to outperform that. But it's not -- I mean, we do our best job here of doing that. And we shouldn't -- you shouldn't just say, well, Amphenol is conservative and they're naturally going to beat it. I mean there's no doubt that the world, as we see it from a macro and market standpoint, it is more dynamic. There are pockets -- more pockets of uncertainty. There are macro dynamics that are going on now. But all that being said, the underlying electronics revolution that has for us, always been a great platform for our outperformance. This continues to go unabated. Our position, our technology position continues to be broader than ever before. We've made 20 acquisitions since the beginning of 2019, each of which have added to our company in new capabilities, in new breadth, new access to customers in new geographies. So our company is well positioned to capitalize if there are opportunities for upside. And we'll certainly seek to take advantage of any of those that do come, but in the context that it is a world today that is clearly more uncertain than it was before. And I don't have to, I think, tell everybody here on the phone that you can get that by looking just at the front page of the Wall Street Journal on a daily basis. Are we always going to try to outperform what we are, but I'm not going to tell you that this quarter is the same as every other quarter that we're always going to outperform, and we're going to beat our guidance by as much as we did last quarter. We're going to work really hard to do that all the time, and we're going to navigate whatever environment comes our way. Thanks very much, Gavin. Look, we're really proud of the automotive performance here. I mean, if you just look over several quarters, we've had real strong double-digit organic growth in automotive now for eight quarters in a row, which is really excellent and clearly outperforming. I think that, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we've seen strong growth being driven by, in particular, everything related to electrification, but not exclusively that.  We've also seen robust growth and everything related to passenger connectivity, to safety, new electronic systems in cars, all this sort of extraordinary array of content that's being put into this generation and next generation of cars that has created a great opportunity for Amphenol. Both together with our interconnect products, our sensors, our antennas and that entire array of what we broadly refer to as interconnect products. In terms of the behavior of the customers and the outlook over the next 12 months, I mean it's hard for me to give kind of an outlook for the next 12 months. I think others have a better sense of what -- whatever the industry outlook will be, what inventories are both at dealerships and in the supply chain. But -- and for us, what's more important is the content that we see with customers, which continues to grow. In terms of inventories, I couldn't tell you that we have a perfect sense of what the inventories are with our customers, either at the end customers or at the OEM or in the supply chain. But we haven't seen real indications of abnormalities. And so orders continue to be at a good level. We continue to have strong performance and customers seem to want really a lot of our products as we saw in the third quarter. And as would be implied in our guidance also in the fourth quarter, which would make the full year of 2022 just a really exceptional year in automotive on the back of a year in 2021, which was itself also quite strong. Yes. Thanks very much, Amit. Listen, I think we've talked about inventory in the IT datacom market, and that's already having some impact here in the third and the fourth quarter. If I look at the overall interconnect market, taking really broadly our position, I mean, it's clear that we are outperforming and not just outperforming the sort of GDP or end market, but outperforming our peers.  And so when you think about the question of inventory, unless you are giving your customers a specific reason, a specific reason to build more inventory of your products then your outperformance should certainly not be a reflection of that inventory. And so I don't know what inventories we have in our -- amongst our customers. We have a sense of it in distribution. And there, I will tell you that it's relatively healthy. Nobody is ringing alarm bells in our distribution channel about inventory levels.  But if you look at our outperformance, unless we had created specifically problems that customers were trying to remedy by building buffer stock over problems, that would certainly not be a result of inventory. And I would tell you that over the course of the last 4 quarters, if not more, we have been solving problems for customers, not creating them. And so I personally think, in a qualitative fashion, as you said as the question qualitatively, that it doesn't fit with me that our outperformance would be and all related to an inventory build. Now is the overall market having some piece of inventory build, that may very well be, but I think that when you look at our overall performance at roughly 15%, as you say, organic growth expectation for the year compared to an industry and industry peers, who are quite a bit below that, you would probably come away thinking to quite a bit of that to share gains. But that's not a scientific assessment, because you didn't for one, I couldn't give you one. But I think qualitatively, I feel like we've made a lot of progress as a company. Thanks so much, Steve. I'm glad you asked about ICA. It's really a great company. And you mentioned all the cables, some of the acquisitions we've done. I mean, if I think back since 2019, we've done 20 acquisitions since that time, about five of those acquisitions were kind of diversified cable assembly acquisitions. I think we've made like three center acquisitions. We've made four fiber optics acquisitions. We've made six acquisitions of just connector companies. We've had one MilAero value-add company, one automotive, and that sort of makes up the 20. And each of those really helps us to broaden our position with customers, expanding our capability and making sure that we can cover every corner of the electronics industry on a worldwide basis. And ICA really goes towards all of those. ICA is a North America-based company, which I think is a very opportune thing right now. They have factories across the U.S. as well as in Mexico, servicing a real diversified range of applications across primarily the industrial market. Everything from electrified industrial vehicles to types of things that are used in factories, factory automation, to instrumentation, and I could go on and on and on because it's a very fragmented and diversified customer base. And what they bring us really is a real local presence close to customers where sometimes value-add interconnect proximity can be a real asset actually. Because if you're in an area where there's a lot of companies building things, designing things, and you can be their sort of neighbor and supporter and partner, that allows you to get in very early in the design cycle. And then if you have the breadth of Amphenol, if you have the access to low-cost manufacturing, low-cost sourcing of Amphenol, all of a sudden, you can turn that early involvement into a perpetuity and a strong long-term partnership. And that's something that we at Amphenol have been very successful in, in the past whenever we bought companies that maybe have a really nice proximity to a certain customer base, but a customer base who themselves is also globalizing. Not to mention the last thing, I'll say about ICA is, it's just great people. I mean, our company is made up of individuals, general managers around the world, who are entrepreneurs. And every time we bring in a company like an ICA, I'm just really amazed by the strength and the character and the entrepreneurship of the individuals that have joined as part of Amphenol. And I think at ICA, that's certainly the case. And we look forward to growing with customers where they're a little stronger than we were, to bring them into new customers, to helping them on connector technology, where we have a lot more to offer to give them a more total solution to customers and on and on. I mean there's so many levers of value that you have in these acquisitions, and we fully intend to take advantage of as many of them as possible with the team at ICA. Well, thanks so much, Luke. Look, I talked about this early in the year when we announced the evolution of our organization into the three divisions, which are now our reportable segments with three division presidents. And for us, it's all about the scalability of that unique entrepreneurial culture of Amphenol, whereby today, we have 130 general managers around the world. And what's really important in times of crisis, and also in good times, by the way, is those 130, they don't just operate in a vacuum. They don't -- yes, every day, you have a general manager, who's running his or her business, reacting in real time to what customers are telling them, reacting in real time to what's happening in the environment, whether it be the supply chain or how technology is evolving or whatever.  But also, they're working closely with our group general managers, who -- now we have 12 of those group general managers, who then work today with those division presidents to make sure that we're stimulating collaboration in real time to make sure that we're sharing best practices and information in real time, to make sure that we're cooperating with customers in real time, to bring to those customers the full suite of products. So in a time like this, the fact that now instead of just having one CEO doing that last year, that today, we have three division presidents, who are doing that on a much more active basis. They have three times as much time in their day by definition, as I have in my day, it means that we can have an even richer real-time reactivity to changes and dynamics that come in the marketplace. And that means opportunities, our ability to capitalize on them, our ability to migrate resources quickly towards those opportunities, it also means when there are challenges, how do we quickly react? How do we give support to those who sometimes have to do really tough things. Cutting cost is not a hard thing. It requires an enormous amount of moral support and time and discussion. And that kind of iteration and that interaction is just much more rich today with our three divisions than it was when it was just me with the seven groups that we had going into the end of this year. And so it's part of scaling the company, which has always been, as you know, one of my greatest priorities is to preserve the culture of Amphenol and then to ensure its scalability. Well, part of that scalability is making sure that when the next downturn comes along, we're just as prepared for it, and we have just the same ability to react positively as we've done in the past. And I think we've demonstrated for more than two decades that in difficult times, Amphenolians rise to the occasion immediately and deliver superior results. Whether that was in the bursting of the Internet bubble 20 years ago plus, whether that was in the global financial crisis, whether that was during the pandemic. In each of those times, the fact that our margins were down by just 300 basis points was a distinct and clear reflection of that culture, manifesting itself in that reactivity. And so the perpetuation of that culture, the scaling of that culture is really what this is all about. And so no doubt about it. I think in the big picture, that new divisions that -- those segments, as we talk about them publicly, that will clearly support the company to continue to do what we've always been known for. Sure. Thanks so much, Wamsi. Well, it's two questions, but I will say they're a little bit related, and let me say why. Look, if you look at our mobile devices market, it's been, as always, 1 of our most volatile markets. And I think if you go back over the last decade, we've had at least two fourth quarters, which were down in the kind of mid- to high teens on a sequential basis. So our outlook for this quarter being down sequentially low double digits, it's not a foreign concept to us that once in a while, you'll have a fourth quarter that will be down. I mean what we always think about in mobile devices, the one sure thing, and that's in a market where there are very few sure things is that the second half typically is quite significantly above the first half. And here, our guidance would imply that in the second half, we're still up north of 30% in the second half compared to the first half. So very robust and relatively normal kind of feel between the first and the second semester of 2022.  I did mention that the -- we saw -- at the end of the quarter, really, a very strong demand in mobile devices pulls from customers. And why was that? You could come up with a number of different theories. I mean my own theory is that if you think about mobile devices, which are still today primarily manufactured in China, there was not only just holidays in China, but there were some other events going on over the last -- over the first few weeks of October in China. And it wouldn't surprise me if maybe some customers were preparing for both those holidays as well as the various political meetings that happened in the country, and that may have led to a little bit of pull forward, as I alluded to, and that is also reflected in this guidance. I mean, look, relative to China, I think it's a tale of two cities here. One is, if you read the papers and if you watch everything, obviously, at the highest levels of the government, there's a lot of tension. And you would be blind not to recognize that there's a lot of political tension. There's various policies being enacted by the U.S. and there's various things that are happening in China that are all interpreted in that way, that there is some tension. At the same time, on the street, on the ground, it is pretty stable and kind of business as usual. We haven't seen funny things happening that 1 would sort of fear over the last few years. Our operations are running really great, and we continue to make great progress with local customers who need our technologies. And I think it comes back to something I've talked about in the past, which is that we operate globally as a local company everywhere that we operate. If you think about it, we're in 40 or more countries around the world. And each of our operations of those countries is run by general managers, who are from that place. And they run their business as if it was a local business, albeit with the backdrop of support, the resources and the capabilities and the breadth of a global Amphenol. And nowhere is that more true than in China, where our entrepreneurial management team there has just done a phenomenal, phenomenal job of making sure that customers know that they get local support, from local teams, local engineers, local quality engineers. This is not ex patriots. This is not us taking American technology and porting it over there to support. It is all locally developed and locally supported. And thus, in their times of need, our customers come to us when we can solve their problems. And that's what they do in the world over. And so while the headlines in the papers are what they are, I can tell you that on the ground, our team continues to operate very effectively and successfully across China. The one last thing I'll say, I'm sure in your question about China is embedded a question maybe about how COVID is going there. I'm just so proud of how our team has navigated the restrictions that were associated with zero COVID over the course of this year. Those were much more acute towards the end of the first quarter and into the second quarter, in particular in Shanghai, where our team just did a fabulous job. But there are still occasionally some little restrictions that are popping up. And our team has a fabulous playbook for it. And we don't have all our eggs in one basket anywhere in the world, and that includes in China. And so we have a very diversified and broad set of facilities around the country, such that we're not susceptible to a total impact if 1 place has a shutdown or another. So I would say it's very stable. I certainly hope that the world's governments can all get along. That's something that I personally hope for all of our sakes, but for Amphenol's position in China, we remain very robust, and we're very confident of the future. Yeah. So I think just your little housekeeping question, I think -- I don't think it would have changed the book-to-bill with FX. Look, relative to M&A and the funnel, and we have a great pipeline of acquisitions. As I mentioned, over -- since the beginning of 2019, we've closed 20 deals through quite a cycle, I will say. I mean if you think about the cycle in which we've done that, this has been quite a cycle. And I think the compelling story of joining the Amphenol organization being part of something that is really special. It's something that we continue to tell to companies around the world, and we continue to find good reception to that. Does it become a kind of a buyer's market, for example, are sellers a little more skittish and were willing to sell. I'd be a little careful about in kind of overestimating the impact of the macro on the decision-making of sellers, many of whom are making the one decision in their life to do this. So in my experience, sellers are not kind of looking at what the S&P 500 is doing. They are looking at what the 10-year treasury is doing or looking at what FX rates are doing in that moment. When they think about selling, should they sell, should they not sell, and at what value. Can it impact on the margin, the current environment, what others are willing to pay for deals, and we're a very financially strong company. Maybe that could. I would hope that there's good reason among the universe of buyers around valuations. But we don't normally see just because macro shifts, a dramatic change in the M&A landscape. We have a fabulous funnel. We have a fabulous track record. We have a fabulous organizational culture that's really attractive to companies. I think all of those things will serve us well and will ensure that over the long term, we'll continue to find great companies become part of Amphenol. And I'll continue to be completely unable to predict when that's going to happen. But we're happy to have gotten one deal done here this quarter, and I'm confident over the long term we'll have some more. Yeah. Well, thanks for the question. And look, I'm really happy to talk about the broadband market. It's always been a core for Amphenol even if there's been a few challenging years as the sort of operators in broadband were merging and buying each other and waiting for certain technologies to come. And with all that consolidation and that kind of waiting period, there was a relatively flat kind of investment in the broadband market. And what I think we've seen this year with the real spike up of our performance in this space and can only be termed out. If you look at where we are today on a run rate basis, we're more than 50% higher than we were a year ago. And over the last kind of three-four years, it was running at a relatively stable pace on a quarterly basis, broadband, and now it's at quite a higher level. And I think it's a reflection of really one thing, the extraordinary expansion of data traffic in the world and the necessity of operators to work to support that. I mean, think about all the things that we do on a given day. And there's rarely a minute that goes by where you're not somehow using some data somewhere and creating traffic. I'm going to give a little shout out, because I have a new baby niece, who my little brother had his first child just a few days ago, and I have spent more time on face time, looking at this beautiful young thing, whose name is Chloe. I have spent more time looking at this beautiful thing on real-time video over the last six days, then I think I have face timed ever in my life. I mean it's extraordinary. And the fact that you can sit in Connecticut and you can look on an iPad, and you can be looking at a baby that was born not very few minutes before that. And you can be experiencing that with the richness. Sure, you're not there, you don't smell the baby. You don't see everything around it. But you can actually see the thing that is there in all of her beauty. I mean, that is a sign to me of a world that demands a lot of broadband. And so what is that going to be in the future? Is there some momentum in the spending? I think there is some momentum here. There's also a lot of government funding. Let's not forget, I mean, a lot of this infrastructure bill here in the U.S. and there are other countries doing the same, has focused on the fact that there's a whole subset of the world who doesn't get to do what I just described, because they live in areas that don't have access to rural broadband. I mean, broadband is a utility. It's a necessity. It's in many ways a human right. And I think governments of the world have woken up to the fact that if you don't provide that access to people regardless of if they live 10 miles from the nearest paved road in the middle of Kansas or if they live in Manhattan, then you're not really enabling people to live a full life. And that -- we're really proud of what we do in the broadband space. And we've always stuck it out even when the spending wasn't growing. And I'm just so happy for our team and proud of our team that they are there today to enable the growth and the investments that are happening with our customers. For sure, Matt, and thanks so much. It's a great last question. Look, I mentioned in my prepared remarks, just how proud I am of our team working in this market. It is not easy. Let me tell you, it is not easy to be servicing a space, an end market and to have that end market drop by as much as it did in the case of broadband. And let alone to do it well, some of your fellow colleagues are in spaces that aren't dropping by that much. So you don't even have the misery less company kind of dynamic. And what is the playbook for Amphenol in times like that. It's not to run and hide, it's not to just cower and sort of drown in sorrows. You take quick action. You make sure that your resources that you have deployed are befitting the demand that you have from your customers. And then you go out and you build new basis of business and you take the opportunity of the crisis. And that's really important that you take the opportunity from that crisis to diversify your business even further, to support the customers who still need you in those difficult times. Because then when it comes back, you have a much broader, more stable, more robust and high potential business to run. And that's what our team, who works in commercial air has done. And so yes, we're not quite back to the kind of pre-pandemic levels, but the world is also not quite back to pre-pandemic levels. I mean certainly, there's more travel and airports are more crowded here. But Craig and I went to Asia recently and I can tell you, there's a lot less flights crossing the Pacific than they ever were before. So the sort of widebody, long-haul kind of part of the business travel that was a real big driver of aircraft demand, that is still yet to be fully recovered. But our team has just done a fabulous job of being there for our customers, making sure that we have the right resources and using the opportunity of the crisis such that when things do normalize and they're on the path to doing that, we'll be in a better position today than we were prior to the crisis. What we also see in aerospace and one of the areas where I'll tell you our team spends quite a bit of time because they had a little bit of extra time given the downturn with the major traditional jetliner manufacturers, is this whole world of kind of new aviation, electrified aviation, different kinds of small startups all over the place doing really innovative and exciting things. And our team is working on just dozens and dozens of programs with countless of these companies, large and small, who are trying to really change the face of aviation in a world where everybody wants to reduce the amount of carbon that's being put in the atmosphere. And we have so much going on around Amphenol that's in support of this decarbonization. And I'll tell you that our team in Comair has really stepped up there and has just a really pervasive presence designing new products that really suit the unique applications of some of these next-generation systems that may eventually make it such that we can get on a plane, and we won't be just belching carbon in the atmosphere as we're moving across the country. And I personally am really hopeful for that for me and for our next generation. And I'm really proud of what the company is doing in that respect. Well, operator, thank you so much. And in particular, thank you to everybody who is on the call here today. Thanks for your great questions. And I wish that everybody enjoys a wonderful fall, and we will be back together with you here in 90 days. And by then, amazingly, it will be 2023. So have a wonderful rest of the year, and we look forward to seeing you all soon. Thanks so much."

        "content": "Operator: Hello, and welcome to the second quarter earnings conference call for Amphenol Corporation. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to introduce today's conference host, Mr. Craig Lampo. Sir, you may begin.\nCraig Lampo: Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. This is Craig Lampo, Amphenol's CFO, and I'm here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO. We would like to welcome you to our Second Quarter 2022 Conference Call. Our second quarter 2022 results were released this morning, and I will provide some financial commentary, and then Adam will give an overview of the business and current trends. Then we will take questions.  As a reminder, during the call, we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures and make certain forward-looking statements. So please refer to the relevant disclosures in our press release for further information. In addition, all data discussed during this call is on a continuing operations basis, including prior year comparative information.  The company closed the second quarter with record sales of $3.137 billion and record GAAP and adjusted diluted EPS of $0.76 and $0.75, respectively. Second quarter sales were up 18% in U.S. dollars, 21% in local currencies and 18% organically compared to the second quarter of 2021. Sequentially, sales were up 6% in U.S. dollars, 8% in local currencies and 8% organically. Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes. Orders in the quarter were a record $3.449 billion, which was up 11% compared to the second quarter of 2021, and relatively flat sequentially, resulting in a strong book-to-bill ratio of 1.1:1. Both GAAP and adjusted operating income were $649 million in the second quarter of this year, and GAAP and adjusted operating margin were both 20.7% in the second quarter. On a GAAP basis, operating margin increased by 280 basis points compared to the second quarter of 2021, and 70 basis points sequentially. As a reminder, GAAP operating margin for the prior year quarter included $55 million of acquisition-related costs as a result of the MTS acquisition.  On an adjusted basis, operating margin increased by 70 basis points, both year-over-year and sequentially. The year-over-year increase in adjusted operating margin was driven by operating leverage on the significantly higher sales volume as well as the benefit of ongoing pricing actions, which we believe have offset a meaningful amount of the inflation-related cost increases.  On a sequential basis, the increase in operating margin reflected operating leverage on the higher sales volumes as well as the benefit of ongoing pricing actions. Given the dynamic overall cost and supply chain environment, we are very proud of the company's operating performance. Our team's ability to effectively manage through the myriad of operational and supply chain challenges around the world is a direct result of the company's entrepreneurial culture, which continues to foster a high-performance, action-oriented management team.  Breaking down second quarter results by segment. Relative to the second quarter of 2021, sales in the Harsh Environment Solutions segment were $790 million and increased by 14% in U.S. dollars and 16% organically. Segment operating margin was 26.1%. Sales in the Communications Solutions segment was $1.378 billion, an increase by 24% in U.S. dollars and 19% organically. Segment operating margin was 22%. Sales in Interconnect and Sensor Systems segment were $968 million, an increase by 15% in U.S. dollars and 19% organically, and segment operating margin was 18.3%.  The company's GAAP effective tax rate for the second quarter of 23 -- was 23.3%, and the adjusted effective tax rate was 24.5%, which compared to 17.5% and 24.5% in the second quarter of '21, respectively. GAAP diluted EPS was a record $0.76 in the second quarter, an increase of 29% compared to $0.59 in the prior year period, and adjusted diluted EPS was a record $0.75, an increase of 23% compared to $0.61 in the second quarter of 2021.  This was an excellent result, especially considering the significant cost, supply chain and other operational challenges that the company continued to face during the quarter, including certain COVID-related shutdowns in China. Operating cash flow in the second quarter was a record $543 million or 117% of adjusted net income. And net of capital spending, our free cash flow was a record $452 million or 97% of adjusted net income.  Given the continued supply chain challenges, we were pleased to see cash flow yield recover back to normal levels in the second quarter. From a working capital standpoint, days sales outstanding and payable days were 72 and 58 days, respectively, both within our normal range. And inventory days were 86, which was slightly elevated due to the challenging supply chain environment that continued in the second quarter. During the quarter, the company repurchased 2.7 million shares of common stock at an average price of approximately $70. And when combined with our normal quarterly dividend, total capital returned to shareholders in the second quarter of 2022 was $305 million. Total debt at June 30 was $4.9 billion and net debt was $3.5 billion. Total liquidity at end of the quarter was $3.7 billion, which included cash and short-term investments on hand of $1.3 billion, plus availability under our existing credit facilities. Second quarter 2022 EBITDA was $759 million. And at the end of the second quarter, our net leverage ratio was 1.2x.  I will now turn the call over to Adam, who will provide some commentary on current market trends.\nRichard Norwitt: Well, Craig, thank you very much, and I hope that all of you on the call here today are enjoying the summer so far, and most importantly, your family, your friends and your colleagues are all still managing to stay safe and healthy. As Craig mentioned, I'm going to highlight some of our achievements in the second quarter. And then I'm going to discuss our trends and progress across our served markets. I'll then make a few comments on our outlook for the third quarter. And then finally, we'll, of course, have time for questions.  As Craig just went over, our results in the second quarter were much better than expected. We exceeded the high end of our guidance in sales and adjusted diluted earnings per share. Sales grew a very strong 18% in U.S. dollars and 21% in local currencies, reaching a new record of $3.137 billion. On an organic basis, our sales increased by 18%, supported by robust growth across nearly all of our end markets as well as contributions from our acquisition program, which was partially offset by the strengthening U.S. dollar.  Company booked record orders of nearly $3.450 billion, and that represented a continued positive book-to-bill of 1.1:1. We're especially pleased to deliver strong profitability in the quarter with operating margins reaching 20.7%, and that's 70 basis point increase from both prior year and prior quarter, and we achieved these operating results despite facing a wide range of operational, inflationary and supply chain challenges as well as the COVID shutdowns in China that Craig mentioned. Adjusted diluted EPS grew a strong 23% from prior year to a new record of $0.75, another excellent reflection of our continued strong execution. And then finally, we're very pleased that the company generated record operating and free cash flow in the quarter of $543 million and $452 million respectively.  I just want to say how proud I am of our team around the world. Our results this quarter once again reflect the strength of Amphenol's entrepreneurial organization, who has continued to perform very well amidst a highly dynamic and challenging environment.  We're very pleased to have announced in the quarter that we closed on the acquisition of NPI Solutions based in Morgan Hill, California, and with annual sales of approximately $65 million. NPI is a manufacturer of cable assemblies and complex interconnect assemblies for the industrial market with a particular focus on customers in the semiconductor equipment and test and measurement markets. The addition of NPI expands our already broad position in value-add interconnect for these important and high potential markets. As we welcome this outstanding new team to Amphenol, I remain confident that our acquisition program will continue to create great value for the company. In fact, our ability to identify and execute upon acquisitions and successfully bring those companies into Amphenol remains a core competitive advantage for the company.  Now turning to our progress across our served markets. I would just note once again how pleased we are that our end market exposure remains highly diversified, balanced and broad. No doubt about it, during these very dynamic times, that market diversification continues to create great value for the company.  The military market represented 9% of our sales in the quarter. Sales declined by 2% from prior year but were flat organically, with moderations in our sales into naval and military vehicle applications, offset by growth in space, avionics and UAVs. Sequentially, our sales increased by 3%, which was in line with our expectations coming into the quarter. As we look into the third quarter, we expect sales to increase modestly from these second quarter levels, and we continue to be very pleased with the strength of the company's broad position across the military market.  As militaries around the world continue to adopt a wide array of next-generation defense technologies, our industry-leading breadth of high-technology interconnect and sensor products positions the company strongly across all major defense programs. This gives us great confidence for our long-term performance.  The commercial aerospace market represented 3% of our sales in the quarter, and our sales increased by a very strong 32% from prior year and 36% organically as we benefited from the continued recovery in global aircraft production. Sequentially, our sales grew 11% from the first quarter, which was actually much better than the expectations that we had coming into the quarter.  Looking into the third quarter, while we do expect a seasonal low double-digit sequential decline in sales, we anticipate continued and substantial growth from prior year. We're very encouraged to have driven another quarter of strength in the commercial air market, which is quite a welcome development after 2 extremely challenging years in the air travel industry. As personal and business travel continues to recover, we look forward to benefiting from the company's strong interconnect and sensor technology position across a wide array of aircraft platforms and next-generation systems integrated into those planes. I'm particularly proud of our team working in commercial air, who really have persevered throughout the downturn, and we are now once again realizing the fruits of their long-term labors.  Industrial market represented 26% of our sales in the second quarter. Sales in the quarter grew 13% in U.S. dollars and 15% organically, and this was driven by broad-based strength across most of our industrial end markets, including especially the battery and electric heavy vehicle applications, oil and gas, medical and rail mass transit. On a sequential basis, our sales increased by a better-than-expected 8% from the first quarter.  Looking into the third quarter, we expect sales to roughly remain at these very robust second quarter levels. I have to say that our results this quarter confirm once again that our outstanding global team working in the industrial market continues to find new opportunities for growth across the many segments of this exciting market. I remain confident that our long-term strategy to expand our high-technology interconnect, antenna and sensor offering, both organically and through complementary acquisitions, has positioned us well to capitalize on the many revolutions happening across the industrial electronics market.  To that end, the addition of NPI Solutions further strengthens our position in the important semiconductor and test and measurement equipment interconnect markets. We look forward to realizing the benefits of this long-term strategy for many years to come. The automotive market represented 20% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in the second quarter grew 23% in U.S. dollars and 29% organically, and this was driven by broad-based strength across most automotive applications, with particular strength once again in sales into electric and hybrid electric vehicle applications.  Sequentially, our sales increased by 6%, which was much better than our expectations coming into the quarter when we had anticipated a modest sequential decline. For the third quarter, we now expect a moderate sequential decline in sales as customers continue to manage through a wide array of supply chain challenges in the global automotive market. I remain extremely proud of our team working in the important and dynamic automotive market. They continue to manage through a difficult supply chain environment, all while remaining focused on driving new design wins with customers who are implementing a wide array of new technologies into their vehicles. Our continued outperformance is a direct result of their excellent efforts.  The mobile devices market represented 9% of our sales in the quarter. Our sales increased by 7% in the second quarter as strength in smartphones and laptops were somewhat offset by a moderation of sales of products incorporated into tablets. Sequentially, our sales declined by a better-than-expected 6% versus the first quarter.  Looking now into the third quarter, we anticipate sales to increase by more than 20% compared to the second quarter levels on typical seasonal strength. I remain very proud of our team working in the mobile devices market. In particular, amidst the COVID-related disruptions in China that occurred early in the quarter, our outstanding and agile team once again delivered strong results. Most importantly, they continue to design our leading array of antennas, interconnect products and mechanisms into a wide range of next-generation mobile devices. And they remain, as always, poised to capture any opportunities for incremental sales that may arise this year and beyond.  The mobile networks market represented 5% of our sales in the quarter, and sales grew from prior year by 9% in U.S. dollars and 6% organically as strength from products sold to network operators, together with the benefit of acquisitions, more than offset a moderation of our sales to wireless equipment manufacturers.  Sequentially, our sales in the second quarter grew by a slight 1%, but that was better than our expectations coming into the quarter. Looking to the third quarter, we now expect to grow moderately from the second quarter levels. We're encouraged by the company's continued strength in our sales into the mobile networks market. As operators ramp up their investments in next-generation systems, our team remains focused on realizing the benefits of our long-term efforts to expand our position in next-generation 5G equipment and networks around the world.  The information technology and data communications market represented 23% of our sales in the quarter. Sales were stronger than expected, rising by a very robust 31% in U.S. dollars and 26% organically from prior year. Our team really just executed well in fulfilling broad-based strength across server and networking applications, including with web service providers. Sequentially, our sales increased by 11% in the second quarter, which was better than our expectations.  Looking to the third quarter, we expect sales to moderate from these very strong second quarter levels. Nevertheless, we remain encouraged by the company's outstanding position in the global IT datacom market. Both our OEM and web service provider customers continue to drive their equipment and networks to ever higher levels of performance really in order to manage the dramatic increases in demand for bandwidth and processor power. We look forward to realizing the benefits of that leading position in this important market for many years to come.  Finally, the broadband market represented 5% of our sales in the quarter. Sales grew by a very strong 57% in U.S. dollars and 28% organically as broadband spending levels increased and as we benefited from our recent acquisitions. Our growth in broadband was particularly strong in North America. On a sequential basis, sales increased by a much better-than-expected 14% from the first quarter. As we head into the third quarter, we do expect sales to the broadband market to decline moderately from these levels. But we look forward to continuing to support our broadband service provider customers around the world with our expanded range of high-technology products. As our customers increase the bandwidth and capacity of their networks to support the expansion of high-speed data applications to even more homes and businesses, these products have become even more critical.  Now turning to the company's outlook. There's no doubt that the current market environment remains highly uncertain with ongoing supply chain and inflationary challenges as well as some continued disruptions from the COVID-19 pandemic. Assuming those conditions do not meaningfully worsen and also assuming constant exchange rates, for the third quarter, We Expect Sales In The Range Of $3.040 billion to $3.100 billion, and adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $0.73 to $0.75. This would represent strong sales growth of 8% to 10% and adjusted diluted EPS growth of 12% to 15% compared to the third quarter of 2021.  I just want to say that I remain confident in the ability of our outstanding Amphenol management team to adapt to the many opportunities and challenges in the marketplace and to continue to grow our market position while expanding the company's profitability. In addition, our entire organization remains fully committed to delivering long-term sustainable value, all while prioritizing the continued well-being of each of our employees around the world. And finally, and most importantly, I would like to take this opportunity to thank that entire Amphenol team for their truly outstanding efforts here in the second quarter.  And with that, operator, we'd be very happy to take any questions that there may be.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first caller is Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs.\nMark Delaney: Congratulations on the strong results. I just wanted to better understand the guidance. I think 3Q revenue is typically up sequentially, and the company guided it down just a touch at the midpoint of guidance. I'm hoping to better understand are you seeing any slowdown in customer demand perhaps because of some of the macroeconomic conditions? Or is this more about sales coming off of a very high base and still being at a very good overall level?\nRichard Norwitt: Yes. Thanks so much, Mark. I mean, look, this is a very unique year. There's no doubt about it. There's a lot of things going on. I talked about the uncertainty that is in the market. And I won't go through each of the end markets. I think I just went pretty fulsomely through our expectations. I think we have a really strong outlook here given the real strength that we saw in the second quarter, given the continued momentum that we have across the company.  We see growth in a number of our end markets. And a number of our end markets, we view as having, at this point at least, the potential that they may moderate slightly. But I feel that this is a very strong guidance from a top line perspective. We have great momentum, both order momentum as well as continued strong positions with our customers. And I think that, overall, given the environment, given all what is happening in the global economy, I think this is a very strong guidance.\nOperator: Our next question is from Amit Daryanani with Evercore.\nAmit Daryanani: Congrats on a great quarter from my end as well. I guess, Adam, the question is for you. I'd love to get your perspective, there seems to be a lot of concern around the macro headwinds impacting end demand. You have talked a little bit about that as well. You tend to have a very broad perspective. You talk to a lot of customers. Are you seeing signs of softness of customers holding back orders and demand at this point given what you see in the macro side? Just anything you can talk about from your discussion with customers and anything you're seeing different in the channel versus OEM would be really helpful.\nRichard Norwitt: Thanks so much, Amit. Look, I think we read the papers and what's the news like everybody does. But what we really listen to is our customers. And I think you saw in the second quarter, our customers gave us still very robust orders, and we executed on the orders that we had. And thereby, we were able to deliver the upside that we did here in the second quarter. I think if I look across the end markets, if any market has some customers who are saying maybe there's a little bit of a breathing -- a little -- taking a breath, for example, and we have very strong demand in the IT datacom market. I talked about the fact that IT datacom, we expect to see a little moderation in the third quarter. And I think that's a bit of a reflection of some customers taking some breathing, so to speak, after really, really strong demand.  But have we seen broadly across areas like industrial, automotive, aerospace, impacts of the macroeconomic? I mean we really haven't at this stage. I will say this, the Amphenol team, we're not in the business, and we don't view it as our business, to try to guess where the economy is going.  Can there be one day a recession? I mean there's lots of people who are much more expert than I am who are probably going to make prognosis about that, and we won't get in the business of doing so. But what we are doing always inside our company is making sure that we're prepared either way. And I've used that term before in this forum of driving with one foot on the gas and one foot on the brake. And that's just the Amphenolian way. We are going to have our foot heavy on the accelerator, capitalizing on this great backlog that we have, capitalizing on the wonderful position we've built with customers, capitalizing on the new technologies that we're enabling next-generation applications with our customers.  But we're always going to have a foot covering the brake in case we see something different coming our way. And then our general managers, 130 of them around the world, will quickly take action to adjust our resources to react to whatever dislocations can come in the marketplace and, thereby, to both preserve the financial strength of the company while ensuring that we can continue to grow our market position in any economic environment.  And that's where we stand today. Is there going to be, because of the Fed or because of whatever geopolitics or because of whatever reason, some macroeconomic slowdown or some shock? We don't know. And in all honesty, we don't try to spend a lot of time wondering about that. We talk to our customers. And when we see something change, we'll react with the type of speed that everybody has been accustomed to from the Amphenolian organization.\nOperator: Our next question is from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America.\nWamsi Mohan: Adam, I was wondering if you might be able to comment on what you're seeing on the ground in China. Clearly, in the second quarter, there were lockdowns for a couple of months and then a recovery from there. But just from a demand perspective, can you maybe share any color on how those months transpired from a demand, and if you're seeing any real snapback in demand, especially in light of the view that there are some stimulus programs underway? And maybe if you can share some context on what you've seen in the past from such initiatives, how that might have benefited Amphenol?\nRichard Norwitt: Sure. Thanks so much, Wamsi. I mean, look, first and foremost, I just have to credit our team in China, I mean, in particular, those who work in and around Shanghai. Now as you know, Wamsi, we have facilities all over. We don't concentrate them in one or another city. And I have to say that, that manufacturing strategy that we have of having it be quite fragmented has been a very, very big asset for the company as these COVID lockdowns have occurred because it never happens that we're impacted in our totality or in any material sense.  But we do have several operations that operate around Shanghai. And some of our team members there, I mean, we had several of our general managers who were locked in their apartment for the better part of 3 months. And we had to operate factories in bubbles and things like that. And it was just an extraordinary, extraordinary effort and drive and, ultimately, success by our team. And I'm just so grateful to each and every one of them for making the sacrifices that they did and continuing to have the commitment to the company and to our customers. That was clearly reflected in this quarter.  All that being said, I think that, ultimately, the impact of those shutdowns on our business in the second quarter was very modest, if anything, because our team was able to execute through the shutdowns. And then to the extent that any catch-up was necessary, they were able to do that over the course of the quarter as some of the more severe shutdowns abated.  We have seen strong demand, especially in areas like automotive, in the mobile market, some of the other communications markets in China and also in industrial, where we have a very strong position. And in particular, we see strength in China in anything that's being electrified. And that's been a great progress for the company. And I think we have seen some pickup in demand coming out of those shutdowns in certain of the areas.  With respect to the stimulus, I can tell you that I still remember my very first quarter as CEO, and this is taking us all back in time now because I've been CEO since January of 2009, but that was a really tough time period. Everybody will recall, I became CEO in January of 2009 at the depth of the beginning of the financial crisis. And that was when China decided to build the 3G network, and it was effectively a stimulus program that accomplished also the goal of expanding the ability of people to have mobile broadband.  And I think as they talk about stimuli today in today's economy, a lot of that also does revolve around new technologies, things like electrification of vehicles, of heavy vehicles, the build-out of other infrastructure. And so to the extent that those kind of stimulus do, in fact, come, our position across all those end markets is a very strong one. And I would expect our local team to be well poised to take advantage.\nOperator: And our next question is from Matt Sheerin with Stifel.\nMatthew Sheerin: Adam, I wanted to just ask -- get a little bit more color on that really strong margin expansion that you saw, 70 basis points quarter-on-quarter. You talked about pricing. You also talked about leverage. Where do we stand on pricing right now in terms of continuing to increase ASPs as your input costs go up? Or should we just expect sort of the normal margin contribution that you typically see in the business?\nCraig Lampo: Matt, this is Craig. Thanks for the question. Yes. No, it's a great question. I mean we're really proud of the achievement we had here in the second quarter. 20.7%, really strong operating margins. And obviously, we capitalized on the strong demand environment, but the team really did an outstanding job really navigating, I think, the environment around cost and inflation, supply chain, all of these things that clearly have put pressure on margins.  And we talked about coming into the year how we started -- have been starting to see some impact of the pricing actions that we have been taking. We had strong margins in the first quarter. We talked about coming into the second quarter here, expecting some additional traction related to pricing.  And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, I think, at this point, coming into the second quarter, we really have, we believe, had a meaningful progress on really offsetting a good portion of the inflation and supply chain and other costs that we've seen over the past year. We do expect actually some additional progress here in the third quarter. And I think our guidance does reflect that on -- our guidance at the revenue line and being a little bit lower sequentially and our EPS being kind of basically flat, which would represent an implied continued progress on margin, which is partially due to continued pricing actions that we continue to take.  Well, where we are in that journey in terms of will we be at the end of it at the end of the third quarter? I don't necessarily know that I would say that. But I'm not sure what's going to happen with inflation. I mean that continues to be a big question mark. I mean, the cost environment continues to be very dynamic. So I think as we have done, as we will continue to do, our general managers have done an outstanding job just raising prices commensurate with the cost environment, and we'll continue to do that. And I'm really proud of the team for the progress we've already made.\nOperator: Next question is from Steven Fox with Fox Advisors.\nSteven Fox: Could you talk a little bit more about the wireless device markets? I know you mentioned it's looking seasonal. It sounded like it's on the low end of seasonal, so from an end market standpoint. And also, can you touch on how you're looking at content this year versus maybe last year, where maybe you're doing better or different types of technologies that you're leveraging into new phones or in tablets, et cetera?\nRichard Norwitt: Thanks so much, Steve. Yes. Look, I think we've guided it to be up at least 20% here in the third quarter. The mobile devices market, it's a very hard market to predict, as you know, with any certainty 1 quarter out, let alone a month out or sometimes even a week out. There's no doubt about it, it's our most volatile of markets. And I think that's a strong guidance given the inherent volatility in the market.  I think, relative to our content, this continues to be a market where there's a lot of different devices, where every one of those devices is a bit of a jump ball, and we win -- we try to win more than we lose of the content on these devices. And I think, over time, we've successfully broadened the range of products that we sell into mobile devices to be not just antennas and interconnect but also a wide range of mechanisms and the like.  And we've also broadened the range of products that we sell into. So today, when we think about mobile devices, you talk not just about smartphones and mobile computing devices like laptops and tablets but wearables and hearables and all these various things and lots of just new devices that are technically mobile devices. And it's unbelievable, actually, the continued spread of these devices. And hopefully, we can have next year a kind of a normal consumer electronics show. And we can go to something and just see the extraordinary array of things that are there. It's actually just a really exciting market.  And so I think from a content perspective, I'd say that our team continues to accomplish their goal of maximizing their content while never being able to win everything on every platform. And I think we remain in a very strong position. And the team remains just so agile and reactive to the inherent volatility that's in that market, which gives me confidence that whatever comes along, if there's an uptick in demand or vice versa, that our organization who works in mobile devices is going to be prepared for it.\nOperator: Our next question is from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan.\nSamik Chatterjee: I guess I wanted to dig into the industrial segment a bit, Adam, if you can. I know you have a collection of different end markets in there, and you had strong growth. If you can just dig into sort of the different end markets there and if you're seeing sort of broad-based strength? Or are there any pockets where you still sort of see a recovery where it might be below sort of prepandemic levels? And just curious now that this segment is tracking more than 25% of your revenue mix on a more consistent basis, is there any change in thinking relative to sort of acquisitions, particularly if it adds exposure to the industrial -- broader industrial market further?\nRichard Norwitt: Thank you very much, Samik. Look, industrial has been a really strong market for us here for quite some time period. I'm just so proud of our team in industrial. If I look back, I mean, this is, I think, something like our ninth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in industrial, and that has included some really wonderful acquisitions that we've made, both on interconnect and sensors and antennas. And today, the breadth of where we sell industrial products per se is broader than it's ever been before.  I mean if you think about where kind of industrial is, it can be everything from a high-speed train to an offshore oil platform to an alternative energy, solar farm or wind mill. It can be in heavy equipment. It can be in building architecture and HVAC systems. It can be sensing for a wide variety of things. I mean, you can imagine where you can put like a sensor and an antenna and a connector to like to check the weather, you can put these things on tall buildings all the way down to tiny bird houses. I mean you name it, there's going to be so many different places where industrial products can go.  And all along, what ties them together is this unique, harsh environment packaging of the products, be they interconnect, be they sensors, be they antennas. We think it's a great place to make acquisitions. And the fact that industrial is today something like 26-or-so percent of our sales doesn't at all give us pause because it's also our broadest, most diversified market of all of our end markets in terms of the applications and the variability of those applications. So far from it. I mean, we just completed the acquisition of NPI this last quarter.  NPI sells harsh environment, complex interconnect assemblies that are used in a very specific part of the industrial market in particular, which is the semiconductor capital equipment and the test and measurement equipment market. This is a great space to be for the long term. I mean just look at some of the legislative priorities in our country and in many others and the trends for many years into the future, that seems like a very good place to be, but so does electrification of heavy equipment. So does something like alternative energy, and all with that is entailed. And so we're very committed to the industrial market. If we see great acquisitions that come along that expand both our product technology and our position across some of these segments, we're not going to shy away from them.\nOperator: Our next question is from Luke Junk with Baird.\nLuke Junk: Another question, broader business but more of a company-specific standpoint. So although you're not seeing in the business, yet there are, of course, these broader signs of rising economic risks overall, other callers have highlighted. What I'm wondering, Adam, is if you could comment on your conversations with your general managers right now given the backdrop, and specifically, any contingency planning they might be doing at present for their businesses to find growth and protect earnings in what could be a more challenging environment from here? In other words, the brake side of the gas and brake dynamic that you spoke to earlier?\nRichard Norwitt: Yes. Well, thank you very much. I mean, look, we have a lot of conversations with our management team, including directly with our general managers and all of the people in the organization. And you can bet, we are always talking about this concept of one foot on the gas and one foot on the brake. I mean even just this morning, we have always a discussion with our whole team at the time of our earnings. That's, by the way, why we do this call in the afternoon. It's because we have all of our management team together a date in the morning, and that's a better time for people around the globe. And you can bet that we're always reinforcing that idea that we have a strong momentum right now. Our customers want a lot of product from us. Let's execute on that. But let's keep the windshield clear so that you see ahead of you if there is a problem. And if a problem comes, I can tell you, nobody is faster to react than the Amphenolian general managers.  I mean, I use this analogy like a racecar. You have a foot on the gas and a foot on the brake and you've got your eyes staring out the windshield just in case something pops along. And when that thing comes, whatever it may be, it's not for us to guess what it is, it's not for us to do something differently because of our guesswork. It's to be ready regardless. And I can tell you that all of our 130 general managers, this is second nature to the Amphenolian culture. And all of them are prepared for whatever may come along.  But at the same time, we are not sitting here saying, hey, the Fed is raising interest rates, the world is going to end. That's just not how we run the company. We don't sit back and just reflect on macro things and just say to them, well, the macro says this, so we better do that. We listen to our customers, and then we take action. And that's what our team is going to do.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Nick Todorov with Longbow Research.\nNikolay Todorov: And congrats from me as well on the strong results. Adam, a question on bookings and maybe bookings linearity. If I look at your bookings, they're stronger than your peers. I wonder if you can comment if you're seeing broad-based trend or maybe there are certain markets that are driving such a strong bookings at this point? And any color there would be helpful.\nRichard Norwitt: Yes. Well, look, I think our peers are doing very well, too, I think relative to our bookings. Actually, bookings across the quarter were fairly linear. It wasn't that we saw a big spike early and it tailed off later, vice versa. Actually, orders were pretty consistent across the 3 months of the quarter, which was encouraging to see actually. And relative to our end markets and the booking trends of the end markets without going sort of one by one, again, I would say that we had good strength across virtually all of our markets, especially our kind of what I refer to as our longer-cycle markets where we saw still great bookings, military, commercial air, industrial, automotive.  We saw really strong bookings in broadband as well. And I think that's a great reflection of some of the planning of broadband customers right now. We're really working on expanding the capacity and also the breadth of the networks. There's a lot going on around opening up the opportunities in rural America, for example, with broadband access. And our team is really on the front lines of supporting our customers in those initiatives.  I think the one market where, again, bookings were still strong but where maybe we started to see towards the end of the quarter a slight moderation is IT datacom. And I talked about that earlier. I think we are seeing some -- maybe in the third quarter, a little bit of digestion of the strong consumption that some of our customers have had there. We hear a little bit about touches of inventory in that space as well, which is not surprising given the extremely strong demand that we've seen in that space, but nothing of any cataclysmic variety here. I mean the IT datacom market remains very, very strong. But as we've said in our guidance, we would anticipate in the third quarter to see a little bit of a moderation there.  So overall, I think there's really strong bookings. And I got to give a call out to our salespeople around the world, they do the toughest job there is there. And it's just amazing how they continue to support customers and ultimately generate the bookings that we've seen.\nOperator: Our next question is from Jim Suva with Citigroup.\nJames Suva: Adam, on your prepared comments, you mentioned the auto sector, how it outperformed this quarter, which is great. But then you mentioned that you expect it to decline, I think you said moderately for the Q3 outlook. Has something changed there? Because the supply constraints have kind of been ongoing for a long time and you think that maybe we've stabilized or gotten a little bit better with those. But I'm just kind of wondering about the outperformance was fantastic, but kind of why kind of a little bit of a downtick for the outlook.\nRichard Norwitt: Well, thanks very much, Jim. I mean one thing I would just clarify, we -- I talked about the fact that we see in the second quarter some moderation on a sequential basis, that would still reflect very strong year-over-year growth in the auto market on a year-over-year basis. I think it'd be still very strong double-digit organic growth at the levels that we've guided to. So I don't think that represents at all a slowdown in our momentum in automotive.  There's some seasonality sometimes that we'll see in the automotive market. I think there are still supply chain constraints that customers are seeing. I think there were some announcements in recent days from some of the OEMs that I think reflected that. And you add all that together and it ultimately results in the outlook that we have. And if there's better opportunities, you can bet that our team is going to try to exceed that outlook.\nOperator: Our next question is from William Stein with Truist Securities.\nWilliam Stein: Congrats on the great results and outlook. And I want to address one aspect of the P&L. There was at least one question about it already. But the conversion margins were very strong in the quarter, which is pretty surprising given we'd expect some headwinds from FX and input cost inflation, which continues. And I understand that Amphenol's kind of constantly in the process of responding to these market dynamics. But did the company somehow get more ahead of these changes in the current quarter than it typically does? Or maybe the converse of that is, if you haven't and we see FX and material input costs stabilize, shouldn't we expect a somewhat elevated level of contribution margin in the next couple of quarters?\nCraig Lampo: Yes. Thanks, Will. I appreciate the question. Listen, as I mentioned before, we're certainly super proud of the results here in the second quarter in regards to the profitability. In regards to -- I'll parse this question now into a couple of different pieces. In regards to FX, although clearly there's translation impacts on both the top and bottom line in regards to currency, it typically doesn't have a meaningful impact on our margins. So certainly, there could be some small impacts here or there, but nothing that would call out as being a meaningful impact. So I would say, currency hasn't really impacted -- doesn't really impact our conversion as you think about it in any meaningful way.  As it relates to our pricing and input cost inflation, we've been -- we certainly had pressure. Last year, as you remember, Q1 of '21, that was kind of stepped down a bit, certainly a larger negative conversion in the first quarter of '21. And as the year progressed, as we kind of were chasing that with pricing, we were able to neutralize the incremental worsening of the inflationary environment, but I wouldn't tell you that we ever kind of got back to neutral from a Q1 '21 perspective. And I think what we're seeing is that we're seeing in the first half of this year a bit of a catch-up from the first half of last year. And that's why when I said I think that at this point we've been able to kind of offset a meaningful amount of that inflation, I mean a meaningful amount kind of that's happened over the last 12 months.  So the conversion, the strong sequential conversion you see here in the second quarter is really kind of catch up, I would say, for pricing -- for inflation that we've seen over the course of the last year, and that will continue to hopefully catch up on as we expect to here in the third quarter. So it's kind of been a journey, and pricing typically is behind cost a bit. And that's what we've seen here into '21 and coming in here into '22. But I think at this point, pricing is starting to catch up to cost, and that's really reflective of the strong conversions that you see.  Now we're not guiding here in the fourth quarter and full year. I mean we don't know what inflation is going to do and all that. But you can guarantee that our general managers are close to their costs, and they're continuing to have conversations with the customers. And if the environment continues to either level out or, ultimately, the inflation continues to increase, we're going to take the appropriate action, both on the cost and on the top line.\nOperator: And our next question is from David Kelley with Jefferies.\nDavid Kelley: You noted touches of inventory build in IT datacom. Just curious if you're seeing any signs of build in any of the pockets of industrials land. Or is the demand appetite there still strong enough to absorb the incremental order strength you're seeing?\nRichard Norwitt: Yes. Thanks very much, David. Honestly, if I look at industrial, it's very hard to get great visibility because the range of customers is just so broad. Where we do have some visibility, and obviously some portion of our industrial business is through distribution. And there, I would tell you that inventory levels are not really excessive. In fact, we've continued to see good strength, good pull-through from our distributors and healthy inventory levels across our distributors who have a little bit higher percent of industrial than they would, for example, of like IT datacom or mobile networks or automotive.  And so from that perspective, I would say we see it as healthy. But I can't tell you that we have perfect visibility to the thousands and thousands of customers that we ultimately sell to across the industrial market. What we do see in industrial is just really continued strong demand as well as in many pockets, the inability of some of our competitors to satisfy that demand and, thus, our ability to get a little bit more than our fair share of the business.  And so I think our team working in industrial across all those segments, and we talked about those earlier, I think they've done a great job of executing when demand is really strong, and we continue to do so. And that doesn't really give me a feeling that there is a lot of inventory buildup or excessive inventory buildup given that customers continue to want to take product from us.  What we're always on the lookout for is order cancellations or pushouts and things like this. We just haven't seen that in any real meaningful way, if at all. And so I think right now, we feel very good about the prospects and continued momentum in industrial.\nOperator: Our next question is from Joseph Spak with RBC Capital Markets.\nJoseph Spak: Adam, you've used the racecar analogy a couple of times and how you keep an ear to the customer to react. So I'm curious if you could just give us a little bit of color about what some of your customers and your industrial, machinery, auto and markets you're saying about the energy issues in Europe. One of the things we've sort of started to hear ironically is that they may try to sort of produce as much as they can or as much as the supply chain will allow them to near term in advance of maybe some potentially larger issues in the winter. Are you seeing any evidence of that? Or what are they telling you?\nRichard Norwitt: Yes. Thanks so much, Joe. Look, we're very sensitive to the -- all the geopolitical issues around, that includes the potential energy issues that are coming in Europe. And no doubt about it, we're putting a lot of real-time thought into what that means for ourselves and also what it means for our customers and for the end demand. We have not heard a lot of direct evidence of the behavior that you're talking about.  I mean we've heard people sort of third hand, fourth hand, like you've just said here. But I can't tell you that we've had a big flood of customers coming up and saying, \"Hey, we're going to try to produce everything while it's still warm outside.\" Could that happen? Would it surprise me? I guess it wouldn't totally surprise me. And I think there's going to be a lot of creative efforts that people are going to have to take here as we head into the winter months in Europe to offset what may very well be a very challenging energy availability and cost situation.  And I know that if I look at what our teams are doing today while it's still hot outside, there's a lot of efforts ongoing to prepare ourselves and to make sure that we are not caught kind of cold, so to speak, this winter in Europe. And that's in Germany, that's in Eastern Europe, that's to some extent in France and, to some extent, in even the U.K., Scandinavia, where maybe there will be availability, but it might be very, very expensive.  And so what are we doing right now? And you can do a lot of things actually, it turns out. Maybe there were some projects that you had to increase insulation and the ceiling of your buildings. Maybe you had some things on the shelf to put in heat exchangers in factories and things like that. Maybe you had already started construction of solar panels on certain rooftops in certain countries. All things that we've been doing and have been doing and maybe would even accelerate a little bit as we come into this year. So there's a whole host of solutions to this. Inside our company, those are going to be very, very site-specific under the purview of our general managers. It's not that we're going to make some big, dramatic kind of corporate decision about how are we going to offset the potential risk of energy availability in Europe. But you can bet that there's a lot of activities going on.  And so I can extrapolate from that, that probably our customers are doing the same. And does that mean putting inventory in place? Or does that mean taking a lot of the steps internally that one can take to insulate oneself literally and metaphorically, from the challenges? I guess that customers are going to be looking at all those options.\nOperator: Next question is from Joe Giordano with Cowen.\nJoseph Giordano: So I just want to touch again on price. I mean, so you had -- obviously very strong in the quarter, driving the leverage there. And next quarter guide is for down revenues a little bit sequentially but up margins. So I guess that keeps reading out. Just curious as to like the runway of the ability to keep driving price. And if we start seeing orders start to kind of like normalize or maybe directionally moderate a bit, lead times start to normalize, like historically, when you look back, how long have you been able to drive price positive? And like what are the conditions that make that harder to do?\nRichard Norwitt: Joe, look, I think Craig talked a lot about this already. And what I would just add is this, I mean, we are being very thoughtful about pricing with our customers. This is a tough environment for everybody. And our first and foremost thing that we do when there's inflation is we try to offset it with cost. And I mean that's our duty as a partner to our customers around the world. And only one we can't do that do we then have to pass it on in price, and we do that in a very reasonable fashion.  So what the runway, to use your term, is I mean, it just depends on how the environment goes. We're not going to take advantage of our customers. We're not trying -- we're certainly not in the business of doing excessive measures on price. We're strong supporters of our customers, but we're also making sure that we're protecting our company and protecting the company's bottom line and taking reasonable measures, and we'll continue to do that to the extent that that's what the environment requires.\nOperator: And our last question is from Chris Snyder with UBS.\nChristopher Snyder: So the business is nearly 50% bigger than it was back in 2019 before the pandemic. Just given the suddenness and magnitude of the acceleration coming out of COVID, has this led to any capacity constraints for you guys as you try to realize all of the demand that is out there in the market?\nRichard Norwitt: Thanks so much, Chris. And look, it's a great question to squeeze in. I mean you pointed out, I mean we are, over just a very short time period, nearly 50% bigger. And it's just an outstanding testament to the organization that they've been able to flex the company in such a difficult environment. I mean let's not forget, we're 50% bigger, which, in a normal environment, would be a challenge to increase our capacity, to expand our footprint, to hire the people, to put in place whatever equipment is necessary, to do all of that.  But to do it in a pandemic, to do it in a supply chain crisis, to do it in an inflationary environment, I think, is just the best testament to the Amphenolian entrepreneurs around the world that have made this company special. So do we see capacity constraints today? I think we've battled through them all. I mean have there been challenges over the course of these couple of years? Like you cannot imagine. I mean, really, like you cannot imagine personal, professional for everybody through the pandemic. I mean it's not for the faint of heart, but it is right down the pipe for what Amphenol general managers do every day.  I mean, every single day, every one of those 130 general managers, they're fighting so many different challenges, so many different barriers that pop in front of them. And they're not bemoaning it. They're not hiring consultants to help them manage it. They're not going to some corporate bureaucracy to sort of find the answer. They're looking at their own window and they're making it happen with their teams. And then when they need help, they come to us. We collaborate across the company. We deal with it. We work the problem.  And I think the result speaks, in my mind, for itself. Through those challenges, through all the tribulations here of these recent years to expand the company by 50% -- or close to 50% is something that I think our team is really justified to be proud of. And I appreciate you bringing that up here at the end.  Well, I think that is our last question. And so with that, I'd really like to wish everybody a great finish to the summer. I hope all of you get a little bit of chance to spend some time with your family and, hopefully, enjoying some of this wonderful weather that we've been having here in Connecticut. And we look forward, Craig and I, to speaking with all of you here in just another 90 days. Thanks so much.\nCraig Lampo: Thanks, everybody. Bye, bye.\nOperator: Thank you for attending today's conference, and have a nice day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Craig Lampo",
            "content": "Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. This is Craig Lampo, Amphenol's CFO, and I'm here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO. We would like to welcome you to our Second Quarter 2022 Conference Call. Our second quarter 2022 results were released this morning, and I will provide some financial commentary, and then Adam will give an overview of the business and current trends. Then we will take questions.  As a reminder, during the call, we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures and make certain forward-looking statements. So please refer to the relevant disclosures in our press release for further information. In addition, all data discussed during this call is on a continuing operations basis, including prior year comparative information.  The company closed the second quarter with record sales of $3.137 billion and record GAAP and adjusted diluted EPS of $0.76 and $0.75, respectively. Second quarter sales were up 18% in U.S. dollars, 21% in local currencies and 18% organically compared to the second quarter of 2021. Sequentially, sales were up 6% in U.S. dollars, 8% in local currencies and 8% organically. Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes. Orders in the quarter were a record $3.449 billion, which was up 11% compared to the second quarter of 2021, and relatively flat sequentially, resulting in a strong book-to-bill ratio of 1.1:1. Both GAAP and adjusted operating income were $649 million in the second quarter of this year, and GAAP and adjusted operating margin were both 20.7% in the second quarter. On a GAAP basis, operating margin increased by 280 basis points compared to the second quarter of 2021, and 70 basis points sequentially. As a reminder, GAAP operating margin for the prior year quarter included $55 million of acquisition-related costs as a result of the MTS acquisition.  On an adjusted basis, operating margin increased by 70 basis points, both year-over-year and sequentially. The year-over-year increase in adjusted operating margin was driven by operating leverage on the significantly higher sales volume as well as the benefit of ongoing pricing actions, which we believe have offset a meaningful amount of the inflation-related cost increases.  On a sequential basis, the increase in operating margin reflected operating leverage on the higher sales volumes as well as the benefit of ongoing pricing actions. Given the dynamic overall cost and supply chain environment, we are very proud of the company's operating performance. Our team's ability to effectively manage through the myriad of operational and supply chain challenges around the world is a direct result of the company's entrepreneurial culture, which continues to foster a high-performance, action-oriented management team.  Breaking down second quarter results by segment. Relative to the second quarter of 2021, sales in the Harsh Environment Solutions segment were $790 million and increased by 14% in U.S. dollars and 16% organically. Segment operating margin was 26.1%. Sales in the Communications Solutions segment was $1.378 billion, an increase by 24% in U.S. dollars and 19% organically. Segment operating margin was 22%. Sales in Interconnect and Sensor Systems segment were $968 million, an increase by 15% in U.S. dollars and 19% organically, and segment operating margin was 18.3%.  The company's GAAP effective tax rate for the second quarter of 23 -- was 23.3%, and the adjusted effective tax rate was 24.5%, which compared to 17.5% and 24.5% in the second quarter of '21, respectively. GAAP diluted EPS was a record $0.76 in the second quarter, an increase of 29% compared to $0.59 in the prior year period, and adjusted diluted EPS was a record $0.75, an increase of 23% compared to $0.61 in the second quarter of 2021.  This was an excellent result, especially considering the significant cost, supply chain and other operational challenges that the company continued to face during the quarter, including certain COVID-related shutdowns in China. Operating cash flow in the second quarter was a record $543 million or 117% of adjusted net income. And net of capital spending, our free cash flow was a record $452 million or 97% of adjusted net income.  Given the continued supply chain challenges, we were pleased to see cash flow yield recover back to normal levels in the second quarter. From a working capital standpoint, days sales outstanding and payable days were 72 and 58 days, respectively, both within our normal range. And inventory days were 86, which was slightly elevated due to the challenging supply chain environment that continued in the second quarter. During the quarter, the company repurchased 2.7 million shares of common stock at an average price of approximately $70. And when combined with our normal quarterly dividend, total capital returned to shareholders in the second quarter of 2022 was $305 million. Total debt at June 30 was $4.9 billion and net debt was $3.5 billion. Total liquidity at end of the quarter was $3.7 billion, which included cash and short-term investments on hand of $1.3 billion, plus availability under our existing credit facilities. Second quarter 2022 EBITDA was $759 million. And at the end of the second quarter, our net leverage ratio was 1.2x.  I will now turn the call over to Adam, who will provide some commentary on current market trends. Matt, this is Craig. Thanks for the question. Yes. No, it's a great question. I mean we're really proud of the achievement we had here in the second quarter. 20.7%, really strong operating margins. And obviously, we capitalized on the strong demand environment, but the team really did an outstanding job really navigating, I think, the environment around cost and inflation, supply chain, all of these things that clearly have put pressure on margins.  And we talked about coming into the year how we started -- have been starting to see some impact of the pricing actions that we have been taking. We had strong margins in the first quarter. We talked about coming into the second quarter here, expecting some additional traction related to pricing.  And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, I think, at this point, coming into the second quarter, we really have, we believe, had a meaningful progress on really offsetting a good portion of the inflation and supply chain and other costs that we've seen over the past year. We do expect actually some additional progress here in the third quarter. And I think our guidance does reflect that on -- our guidance at the revenue line and being a little bit lower sequentially and our EPS being kind of basically flat, which would represent an implied continued progress on margin, which is partially due to continued pricing actions that we continue to take.  Well, where we are in that journey in terms of will we be at the end of it at the end of the third quarter? I don't necessarily know that I would say that. But I'm not sure what's going to happen with inflation. I mean that continues to be a big question mark. I mean, the cost environment continues to be very dynamic. So I think as we have done, as we will continue to do, our general managers have done an outstanding job just raising prices commensurate with the cost environment, and we'll continue to do that. And I'm really proud of the team for the progress we've already made. Yes. Thanks, Will. I appreciate the question. Listen, as I mentioned before, we're certainly super proud of the results here in the second quarter in regards to the profitability. In regards to -- I'll parse this question now into a couple of different pieces. In regards to FX, although clearly there's translation impacts on both the top and bottom line in regards to currency, it typically doesn't have a meaningful impact on our margins. So certainly, there could be some small impacts here or there, but nothing that would call out as being a meaningful impact. So I would say, currency hasn't really impacted -- doesn't really impact our conversion as you think about it in any meaningful way.  As it relates to our pricing and input cost inflation, we've been -- we certainly had pressure. Last year, as you remember, Q1 of '21, that was kind of stepped down a bit, certainly a larger negative conversion in the first quarter of '21. And as the year progressed, as we kind of were chasing that with pricing, we were able to neutralize the incremental worsening of the inflationary environment, but I wouldn't tell you that we ever kind of got back to neutral from a Q1 '21 perspective. And I think what we're seeing is that we're seeing in the first half of this year a bit of a catch-up from the first half of last year. And that's why when I said I think that at this point we've been able to kind of offset a meaningful amount of that inflation, I mean a meaningful amount kind of that's happened over the last 12 months.  So the conversion, the strong sequential conversion you see here in the second quarter is really kind of catch up, I would say, for pricing -- for inflation that we've seen over the course of the last year, and that will continue to hopefully catch up on as we expect to here in the third quarter. So it's kind of been a journey, and pricing typically is behind cost a bit. And that's what we've seen here into '21 and coming in here into '22. But I think at this point, pricing is starting to catch up to cost, and that's really reflective of the strong conversions that you see.  Now we're not guiding here in the fourth quarter and full year. I mean we don't know what inflation is going to do and all that. But you can guarantee that our general managers are close to their costs, and they're continuing to have conversations with the customers. And if the environment continues to either level out or, ultimately, the inflation continues to increase, we're going to take the appropriate action, both on the cost and on the top line. Thanks, everybody. Bye, bye."

            "name": "Richard Norwitt",
            "content": "Well, Craig, thank you very much, and I hope that all of you on the call here today are enjoying the summer so far, and most importantly, your family, your friends and your colleagues are all still managing to stay safe and healthy. As Craig mentioned, I'm going to highlight some of our achievements in the second quarter. And then I'm going to discuss our trends and progress across our served markets. I'll then make a few comments on our outlook for the third quarter. And then finally, we'll, of course, have time for questions.  As Craig just went over, our results in the second quarter were much better than expected. We exceeded the high end of our guidance in sales and adjusted diluted earnings per share. Sales grew a very strong 18% in U.S. dollars and 21% in local currencies, reaching a new record of $3.137 billion. On an organic basis, our sales increased by 18%, supported by robust growth across nearly all of our end markets as well as contributions from our acquisition program, which was partially offset by the strengthening U.S. dollar.  Company booked record orders of nearly $3.450 billion, and that represented a continued positive book-to-bill of 1.1:1. We're especially pleased to deliver strong profitability in the quarter with operating margins reaching 20.7%, and that's 70 basis point increase from both prior year and prior quarter, and we achieved these operating results despite facing a wide range of operational, inflationary and supply chain challenges as well as the COVID shutdowns in China that Craig mentioned. Adjusted diluted EPS grew a strong 23% from prior year to a new record of $0.75, another excellent reflection of our continued strong execution. And then finally, we're very pleased that the company generated record operating and free cash flow in the quarter of $543 million and $452 million respectively.  I just want to say how proud I am of our team around the world. Our results this quarter once again reflect the strength of Amphenol's entrepreneurial organization, who has continued to perform very well amidst a highly dynamic and challenging environment.  We're very pleased to have announced in the quarter that we closed on the acquisition of NPI Solutions based in Morgan Hill, California, and with annual sales of approximately $65 million. NPI is a manufacturer of cable assemblies and complex interconnect assemblies for the industrial market with a particular focus on customers in the semiconductor equipment and test and measurement markets. The addition of NPI expands our already broad position in value-add interconnect for these important and high potential markets. As we welcome this outstanding new team to Amphenol, I remain confident that our acquisition program will continue to create great value for the company. In fact, our ability to identify and execute upon acquisitions and successfully bring those companies into Amphenol remains a core competitive advantage for the company.  Now turning to our progress across our served markets. I would just note once again how pleased we are that our end market exposure remains highly diversified, balanced and broad. No doubt about it, during these very dynamic times, that market diversification continues to create great value for the company.  The military market represented 9% of our sales in the quarter. Sales declined by 2% from prior year but were flat organically, with moderations in our sales into naval and military vehicle applications, offset by growth in space, avionics and UAVs. Sequentially, our sales increased by 3%, which was in line with our expectations coming into the quarter. As we look into the third quarter, we expect sales to increase modestly from these second quarter levels, and we continue to be very pleased with the strength of the company's broad position across the military market.  As militaries around the world continue to adopt a wide array of next-generation defense technologies, our industry-leading breadth of high-technology interconnect and sensor products positions the company strongly across all major defense programs. This gives us great confidence for our long-term performance.  The commercial aerospace market represented 3% of our sales in the quarter, and our sales increased by a very strong 32% from prior year and 36% organically as we benefited from the continued recovery in global aircraft production. Sequentially, our sales grew 11% from the first quarter, which was actually much better than the expectations that we had coming into the quarter.  Looking into the third quarter, while we do expect a seasonal low double-digit sequential decline in sales, we anticipate continued and substantial growth from prior year. We're very encouraged to have driven another quarter of strength in the commercial air market, which is quite a welcome development after 2 extremely challenging years in the air travel industry. As personal and business travel continues to recover, we look forward to benefiting from the company's strong interconnect and sensor technology position across a wide array of aircraft platforms and next-generation systems integrated into those planes. I'm particularly proud of our team working in commercial air, who really have persevered throughout the downturn, and we are now once again realizing the fruits of their long-term labors.  Industrial market represented 26% of our sales in the second quarter. Sales in the quarter grew 13% in U.S. dollars and 15% organically, and this was driven by broad-based strength across most of our industrial end markets, including especially the battery and electric heavy vehicle applications, oil and gas, medical and rail mass transit. On a sequential basis, our sales increased by a better-than-expected 8% from the first quarter.  Looking into the third quarter, we expect sales to roughly remain at these very robust second quarter levels. I have to say that our results this quarter confirm once again that our outstanding global team working in the industrial market continues to find new opportunities for growth across the many segments of this exciting market. I remain confident that our long-term strategy to expand our high-technology interconnect, antenna and sensor offering, both organically and through complementary acquisitions, has positioned us well to capitalize on the many revolutions happening across the industrial electronics market.  To that end, the addition of NPI Solutions further strengthens our position in the important semiconductor and test and measurement equipment interconnect markets. We look forward to realizing the benefits of this long-term strategy for many years to come. The automotive market represented 20% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in the second quarter grew 23% in U.S. dollars and 29% organically, and this was driven by broad-based strength across most automotive applications, with particular strength once again in sales into electric and hybrid electric vehicle applications.  Sequentially, our sales increased by 6%, which was much better than our expectations coming into the quarter when we had anticipated a modest sequential decline. For the third quarter, we now expect a moderate sequential decline in sales as customers continue to manage through a wide array of supply chain challenges in the global automotive market. I remain extremely proud of our team working in the important and dynamic automotive market. They continue to manage through a difficult supply chain environment, all while remaining focused on driving new design wins with customers who are implementing a wide array of new technologies into their vehicles. Our continued outperformance is a direct result of their excellent efforts.  The mobile devices market represented 9% of our sales in the quarter. Our sales increased by 7% in the second quarter as strength in smartphones and laptops were somewhat offset by a moderation of sales of products incorporated into tablets. Sequentially, our sales declined by a better-than-expected 6% versus the first quarter.  Looking now into the third quarter, we anticipate sales to increase by more than 20% compared to the second quarter levels on typical seasonal strength. I remain very proud of our team working in the mobile devices market. In particular, amidst the COVID-related disruptions in China that occurred early in the quarter, our outstanding and agile team once again delivered strong results. Most importantly, they continue to design our leading array of antennas, interconnect products and mechanisms into a wide range of next-generation mobile devices. And they remain, as always, poised to capture any opportunities for incremental sales that may arise this year and beyond.  The mobile networks market represented 5% of our sales in the quarter, and sales grew from prior year by 9% in U.S. dollars and 6% organically as strength from products sold to network operators, together with the benefit of acquisitions, more than offset a moderation of our sales to wireless equipment manufacturers.  Sequentially, our sales in the second quarter grew by a slight 1%, but that was better than our expectations coming into the quarter. Looking to the third quarter, we now expect to grow moderately from the second quarter levels. We're encouraged by the company's continued strength in our sales into the mobile networks market. As operators ramp up their investments in next-generation systems, our team remains focused on realizing the benefits of our long-term efforts to expand our position in next-generation 5G equipment and networks around the world.  The information technology and data communications market represented 23% of our sales in the quarter. Sales were stronger than expected, rising by a very robust 31% in U.S. dollars and 26% organically from prior year. Our team really just executed well in fulfilling broad-based strength across server and networking applications, including with web service providers. Sequentially, our sales increased by 11% in the second quarter, which was better than our expectations.  Looking to the third quarter, we expect sales to moderate from these very strong second quarter levels. Nevertheless, we remain encouraged by the company's outstanding position in the global IT datacom market. Both our OEM and web service provider customers continue to drive their equipment and networks to ever higher levels of performance really in order to manage the dramatic increases in demand for bandwidth and processor power. We look forward to realizing the benefits of that leading position in this important market for many years to come.  Finally, the broadband market represented 5% of our sales in the quarter. Sales grew by a very strong 57% in U.S. dollars and 28% organically as broadband spending levels increased and as we benefited from our recent acquisitions. Our growth in broadband was particularly strong in North America. On a sequential basis, sales increased by a much better-than-expected 14% from the first quarter. As we head into the third quarter, we do expect sales to the broadband market to decline moderately from these levels. But we look forward to continuing to support our broadband service provider customers around the world with our expanded range of high-technology products. As our customers increase the bandwidth and capacity of their networks to support the expansion of high-speed data applications to even more homes and businesses, these products have become even more critical.  Now turning to the company's outlook. There's no doubt that the current market environment remains highly uncertain with ongoing supply chain and inflationary challenges as well as some continued disruptions from the COVID-19 pandemic. Assuming those conditions do not meaningfully worsen and also assuming constant exchange rates, for the third quarter, We Expect Sales In The Range Of $3.040 billion to $3.100 billion, and adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $0.73 to $0.75. This would represent strong sales growth of 8% to 10% and adjusted diluted EPS growth of 12% to 15% compared to the third quarter of 2021.  I just want to say that I remain confident in the ability of our outstanding Amphenol management team to adapt to the many opportunities and challenges in the marketplace and to continue to grow our market position while expanding the company's profitability. In addition, our entire organization remains fully committed to delivering long-term sustainable value, all while prioritizing the continued well-being of each of our employees around the world. And finally, and most importantly, I would like to take this opportunity to thank that entire Amphenol team for their truly outstanding efforts here in the second quarter.  And with that, operator, we'd be very happy to take any questions that there may be. Yes. Thanks so much, Mark. I mean, look, this is a very unique year. There's no doubt about it. There's a lot of things going on. I talked about the uncertainty that is in the market. And I won't go through each of the end markets. I think I just went pretty fulsomely through our expectations. I think we have a really strong outlook here given the real strength that we saw in the second quarter, given the continued momentum that we have across the company.  We see growth in a number of our end markets. And a number of our end markets, we view as having, at this point at least, the potential that they may moderate slightly. But I feel that this is a very strong guidance from a top line perspective. We have great momentum, both order momentum as well as continued strong positions with our customers. And I think that, overall, given the environment, given all what is happening in the global economy, I think this is a very strong guidance. Thanks so much, Amit. Look, I think we read the papers and what's the news like everybody does. But what we really listen to is our customers. And I think you saw in the second quarter, our customers gave us still very robust orders, and we executed on the orders that we had. And thereby, we were able to deliver the upside that we did here in the second quarter. I think if I look across the end markets, if any market has some customers who are saying maybe there's a little bit of a breathing -- a little -- taking a breath, for example, and we have very strong demand in the IT datacom market. I talked about the fact that IT datacom, we expect to see a little moderation in the third quarter. And I think that's a bit of a reflection of some customers taking some breathing, so to speak, after really, really strong demand.  But have we seen broadly across areas like industrial, automotive, aerospace, impacts of the macroeconomic? I mean we really haven't at this stage. I will say this, the Amphenol team, we're not in the business, and we don't view it as our business, to try to guess where the economy is going.  Can there be one day a recession? I mean there's lots of people who are much more expert than I am who are probably going to make prognosis about that, and we won't get in the business of doing so. But what we are doing always inside our company is making sure that we're prepared either way. And I've used that term before in this forum of driving with one foot on the gas and one foot on the brake. And that's just the Amphenolian way. We are going to have our foot heavy on the accelerator, capitalizing on this great backlog that we have, capitalizing on the wonderful position we've built with customers, capitalizing on the new technologies that we're enabling next-generation applications with our customers.  But we're always going to have a foot covering the brake in case we see something different coming our way. And then our general managers, 130 of them around the world, will quickly take action to adjust our resources to react to whatever dislocations can come in the marketplace and, thereby, to both preserve the financial strength of the company while ensuring that we can continue to grow our market position in any economic environment.  And that's where we stand today. Is there going to be, because of the Fed or because of whatever geopolitics or because of whatever reason, some macroeconomic slowdown or some shock? We don't know. And in all honesty, we don't try to spend a lot of time wondering about that. We talk to our customers. And when we see something change, we'll react with the type of speed that everybody has been accustomed to from the Amphenolian organization. Sure. Thanks so much, Wamsi. I mean, look, first and foremost, I just have to credit our team in China, I mean, in particular, those who work in and around Shanghai. Now as you know, Wamsi, we have facilities all over. We don't concentrate them in one or another city. And I have to say that, that manufacturing strategy that we have of having it be quite fragmented has been a very, very big asset for the company as these COVID lockdowns have occurred because it never happens that we're impacted in our totality or in any material sense.  But we do have several operations that operate around Shanghai. And some of our team members there, I mean, we had several of our general managers who were locked in their apartment for the better part of 3 months. And we had to operate factories in bubbles and things like that. And it was just an extraordinary, extraordinary effort and drive and, ultimately, success by our team. And I'm just so grateful to each and every one of them for making the sacrifices that they did and continuing to have the commitment to the company and to our customers. That was clearly reflected in this quarter.  All that being said, I think that, ultimately, the impact of those shutdowns on our business in the second quarter was very modest, if anything, because our team was able to execute through the shutdowns. And then to the extent that any catch-up was necessary, they were able to do that over the course of the quarter as some of the more severe shutdowns abated.  We have seen strong demand, especially in areas like automotive, in the mobile market, some of the other communications markets in China and also in industrial, where we have a very strong position. And in particular, we see strength in China in anything that's being electrified. And that's been a great progress for the company. And I think we have seen some pickup in demand coming out of those shutdowns in certain of the areas.  With respect to the stimulus, I can tell you that I still remember my very first quarter as CEO, and this is taking us all back in time now because I've been CEO since January of 2009, but that was a really tough time period. Everybody will recall, I became CEO in January of 2009 at the depth of the beginning of the financial crisis. And that was when China decided to build the 3G network, and it was effectively a stimulus program that accomplished also the goal of expanding the ability of people to have mobile broadband.  And I think as they talk about stimuli today in today's economy, a lot of that also does revolve around new technologies, things like electrification of vehicles, of heavy vehicles, the build-out of other infrastructure. And so to the extent that those kind of stimulus do, in fact, come, our position across all those end markets is a very strong one. And I would expect our local team to be well poised to take advantage. Thanks so much, Steve. Yes. Look, I think we've guided it to be up at least 20% here in the third quarter. The mobile devices market, it's a very hard market to predict, as you know, with any certainty 1 quarter out, let alone a month out or sometimes even a week out. There's no doubt about it, it's our most volatile of markets. And I think that's a strong guidance given the inherent volatility in the market.  I think, relative to our content, this continues to be a market where there's a lot of different devices, where every one of those devices is a bit of a jump ball, and we win -- we try to win more than we lose of the content on these devices. And I think, over time, we've successfully broadened the range of products that we sell into mobile devices to be not just antennas and interconnect but also a wide range of mechanisms and the like.  And we've also broadened the range of products that we sell into. So today, when we think about mobile devices, you talk not just about smartphones and mobile computing devices like laptops and tablets but wearables and hearables and all these various things and lots of just new devices that are technically mobile devices. And it's unbelievable, actually, the continued spread of these devices. And hopefully, we can have next year a kind of a normal consumer electronics show. And we can go to something and just see the extraordinary array of things that are there. It's actually just a really exciting market.  And so I think from a content perspective, I'd say that our team continues to accomplish their goal of maximizing their content while never being able to win everything on every platform. And I think we remain in a very strong position. And the team remains just so agile and reactive to the inherent volatility that's in that market, which gives me confidence that whatever comes along, if there's an uptick in demand or vice versa, that our organization who works in mobile devices is going to be prepared for it. Thank you very much, Samik. Look, industrial has been a really strong market for us here for quite some time period. I'm just so proud of our team in industrial. If I look back, I mean, this is, I think, something like our ninth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in industrial, and that has included some really wonderful acquisitions that we've made, both on interconnect and sensors and antennas. And today, the breadth of where we sell industrial products per se is broader than it's ever been before.  I mean if you think about where kind of industrial is, it can be everything from a high-speed train to an offshore oil platform to an alternative energy, solar farm or wind mill. It can be in heavy equipment. It can be in building architecture and HVAC systems. It can be sensing for a wide variety of things. I mean, you can imagine where you can put like a sensor and an antenna and a connector to like to check the weather, you can put these things on tall buildings all the way down to tiny bird houses. I mean you name it, there's going to be so many different places where industrial products can go.  And all along, what ties them together is this unique, harsh environment packaging of the products, be they interconnect, be they sensors, be they antennas. We think it's a great place to make acquisitions. And the fact that industrial is today something like 26-or-so percent of our sales doesn't at all give us pause because it's also our broadest, most diversified market of all of our end markets in terms of the applications and the variability of those applications. So far from it. I mean, we just completed the acquisition of NPI this last quarter.  NPI sells harsh environment, complex interconnect assemblies that are used in a very specific part of the industrial market in particular, which is the semiconductor capital equipment and the test and measurement equipment market. This is a great space to be for the long term. I mean just look at some of the legislative priorities in our country and in many others and the trends for many years into the future, that seems like a very good place to be, but so does electrification of heavy equipment. So does something like alternative energy, and all with that is entailed. And so we're very committed to the industrial market. If we see great acquisitions that come along that expand both our product technology and our position across some of these segments, we're not going to shy away from them. Yes. Well, thank you very much. I mean, look, we have a lot of conversations with our management team, including directly with our general managers and all of the people in the organization. And you can bet, we are always talking about this concept of one foot on the gas and one foot on the brake. I mean even just this morning, we have always a discussion with our whole team at the time of our earnings. That's, by the way, why we do this call in the afternoon. It's because we have all of our management team together a date in the morning, and that's a better time for people around the globe. And you can bet that we're always reinforcing that idea that we have a strong momentum right now. Our customers want a lot of product from us. Let's execute on that. But let's keep the windshield clear so that you see ahead of you if there is a problem. And if a problem comes, I can tell you, nobody is faster to react than the Amphenolian general managers.  I mean, I use this analogy like a racecar. You have a foot on the gas and a foot on the brake and you've got your eyes staring out the windshield just in case something pops along. And when that thing comes, whatever it may be, it's not for us to guess what it is, it's not for us to do something differently because of our guesswork. It's to be ready regardless. And I can tell you that all of our 130 general managers, this is second nature to the Amphenolian culture. And all of them are prepared for whatever may come along.  But at the same time, we are not sitting here saying, hey, the Fed is raising interest rates, the world is going to end. That's just not how we run the company. We don't sit back and just reflect on macro things and just say to them, well, the macro says this, so we better do that. We listen to our customers, and then we take action. And that's what our team is going to do. Yes. Well, look, I think our peers are doing very well, too, I think relative to our bookings. Actually, bookings across the quarter were fairly linear. It wasn't that we saw a big spike early and it tailed off later, vice versa. Actually, orders were pretty consistent across the 3 months of the quarter, which was encouraging to see actually. And relative to our end markets and the booking trends of the end markets without going sort of one by one, again, I would say that we had good strength across virtually all of our markets, especially our kind of what I refer to as our longer-cycle markets where we saw still great bookings, military, commercial air, industrial, automotive.  We saw really strong bookings in broadband as well. And I think that's a great reflection of some of the planning of broadband customers right now. We're really working on expanding the capacity and also the breadth of the networks. There's a lot going on around opening up the opportunities in rural America, for example, with broadband access. And our team is really on the front lines of supporting our customers in those initiatives.  I think the one market where, again, bookings were still strong but where maybe we started to see towards the end of the quarter a slight moderation is IT datacom. And I talked about that earlier. I think we are seeing some -- maybe in the third quarter, a little bit of digestion of the strong consumption that some of our customers have had there. We hear a little bit about touches of inventory in that space as well, which is not surprising given the extremely strong demand that we've seen in that space, but nothing of any cataclysmic variety here. I mean the IT datacom market remains very, very strong. But as we've said in our guidance, we would anticipate in the third quarter to see a little bit of a moderation there.  So overall, I think there's really strong bookings. And I got to give a call out to our salespeople around the world, they do the toughest job there is there. And it's just amazing how they continue to support customers and ultimately generate the bookings that we've seen. Well, thanks very much, Jim. I mean one thing I would just clarify, we -- I talked about the fact that we see in the second quarter some moderation on a sequential basis, that would still reflect very strong year-over-year growth in the auto market on a year-over-year basis. I think it'd be still very strong double-digit organic growth at the levels that we've guided to. So I don't think that represents at all a slowdown in our momentum in automotive.  There's some seasonality sometimes that we'll see in the automotive market. I think there are still supply chain constraints that customers are seeing. I think there were some announcements in recent days from some of the OEMs that I think reflected that. And you add all that together and it ultimately results in the outlook that we have. And if there's better opportunities, you can bet that our team is going to try to exceed that outlook. Yes. Thanks very much, David. Honestly, if I look at industrial, it's very hard to get great visibility because the range of customers is just so broad. Where we do have some visibility, and obviously some portion of our industrial business is through distribution. And there, I would tell you that inventory levels are not really excessive. In fact, we've continued to see good strength, good pull-through from our distributors and healthy inventory levels across our distributors who have a little bit higher percent of industrial than they would, for example, of like IT datacom or mobile networks or automotive.  And so from that perspective, I would say we see it as healthy. But I can't tell you that we have perfect visibility to the thousands and thousands of customers that we ultimately sell to across the industrial market. What we do see in industrial is just really continued strong demand as well as in many pockets, the inability of some of our competitors to satisfy that demand and, thus, our ability to get a little bit more than our fair share of the business.  And so I think our team working in industrial across all those segments, and we talked about those earlier, I think they've done a great job of executing when demand is really strong, and we continue to do so. And that doesn't really give me a feeling that there is a lot of inventory buildup or excessive inventory buildup given that customers continue to want to take product from us.  What we're always on the lookout for is order cancellations or pushouts and things like this. We just haven't seen that in any real meaningful way, if at all. And so I think right now, we feel very good about the prospects and continued momentum in industrial. Yes. Thanks so much, Joe. Look, we're very sensitive to the -- all the geopolitical issues around, that includes the potential energy issues that are coming in Europe. And no doubt about it, we're putting a lot of real-time thought into what that means for ourselves and also what it means for our customers and for the end demand. We have not heard a lot of direct evidence of the behavior that you're talking about.  I mean we've heard people sort of third hand, fourth hand, like you've just said here. But I can't tell you that we've had a big flood of customers coming up and saying, \"Hey, we're going to try to produce everything while it's still warm outside.\" Could that happen? Would it surprise me? I guess it wouldn't totally surprise me. And I think there's going to be a lot of creative efforts that people are going to have to take here as we head into the winter months in Europe to offset what may very well be a very challenging energy availability and cost situation.  And I know that if I look at what our teams are doing today while it's still hot outside, there's a lot of efforts ongoing to prepare ourselves and to make sure that we are not caught kind of cold, so to speak, this winter in Europe. And that's in Germany, that's in Eastern Europe, that's to some extent in France and, to some extent, in even the U.K., Scandinavia, where maybe there will be availability, but it might be very, very expensive.  And so what are we doing right now? And you can do a lot of things actually, it turns out. Maybe there were some projects that you had to increase insulation and the ceiling of your buildings. Maybe you had some things on the shelf to put in heat exchangers in factories and things like that. Maybe you had already started construction of solar panels on certain rooftops in certain countries. All things that we've been doing and have been doing and maybe would even accelerate a little bit as we come into this year. So there's a whole host of solutions to this. Inside our company, those are going to be very, very site-specific under the purview of our general managers. It's not that we're going to make some big, dramatic kind of corporate decision about how are we going to offset the potential risk of energy availability in Europe. But you can bet that there's a lot of activities going on.  And so I can extrapolate from that, that probably our customers are doing the same. And does that mean putting inventory in place? Or does that mean taking a lot of the steps internally that one can take to insulate oneself literally and metaphorically, from the challenges? I guess that customers are going to be looking at all those options. Joe, look, I think Craig talked a lot about this already. And what I would just add is this, I mean, we are being very thoughtful about pricing with our customers. This is a tough environment for everybody. And our first and foremost thing that we do when there's inflation is we try to offset it with cost. And I mean that's our duty as a partner to our customers around the world. And only one we can't do that do we then have to pass it on in price, and we do that in a very reasonable fashion.  So what the runway, to use your term, is I mean, it just depends on how the environment goes. We're not going to take advantage of our customers. We're not trying -- we're certainly not in the business of doing excessive measures on price. We're strong supporters of our customers, but we're also making sure that we're protecting our company and protecting the company's bottom line and taking reasonable measures, and we'll continue to do that to the extent that that's what the environment requires. Thanks so much, Chris. And look, it's a great question to squeeze in. I mean you pointed out, I mean we are, over just a very short time period, nearly 50% bigger. And it's just an outstanding testament to the organization that they've been able to flex the company in such a difficult environment. I mean let's not forget, we're 50% bigger, which, in a normal environment, would be a challenge to increase our capacity, to expand our footprint, to hire the people, to put in place whatever equipment is necessary, to do all of that.  But to do it in a pandemic, to do it in a supply chain crisis, to do it in an inflationary environment, I think, is just the best testament to the Amphenolian entrepreneurs around the world that have made this company special. So do we see capacity constraints today? I think we've battled through them all. I mean have there been challenges over the course of these couple of years? Like you cannot imagine. I mean, really, like you cannot imagine personal, professional for everybody through the pandemic. I mean it's not for the faint of heart, but it is right down the pipe for what Amphenol general managers do every day.  I mean, every single day, every one of those 130 general managers, they're fighting so many different challenges, so many different barriers that pop in front of them. And they're not bemoaning it. They're not hiring consultants to help them manage it. They're not going to some corporate bureaucracy to sort of find the answer. They're looking at their own window and they're making it happen with their teams. And then when they need help, they come to us. We collaborate across the company. We deal with it. We work the problem.  And I think the result speaks, in my mind, for itself. Through those challenges, through all the tribulations here of these recent years to expand the company by 50% -- or close to 50% is something that I think our team is really justified to be proud of. And I appreciate you bringing that up here at the end.  Well, I think that is our last question. And so with that, I'd really like to wish everybody a great finish to the summer. I hope all of you get a little bit of chance to spend some time with your family and, hopefully, enjoying some of this wonderful weather that we've been having here in Connecticut. And we look forward, Craig and I, to speaking with all of you here in just another 90 days. Thanks so much."

        "content": "Operator: Hello, and welcome to the First Quarter Earnings Conference Call for Amphenol Corporation [Operator Instructions]. At the request of the company, today's conference is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, you may disconnect at this time.  I would now like to introduce today's conference host, Mr. Craig Lampo. Sir, you may begin.\nCraig Lampo: Good afternoon, everyone. This is Craig Lampo, Amphenol's CFO, and I'm here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO. We would like to welcome you to our first quarter 2022 conference call. Our first quarter results were released this morning. I will provide some financial commentary and then Adam will give an overview of the business and current strategies, then we will take questions. As a reminder, during the call, we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures and make certain forward-looking statements, so please refer to the relevant disclosures in our press release for further information. In addition, as previously announced, effective January 1, 2022, we aligned our businesses into three new reportable segments. Effective for the first quarter of 2022, we are reporting results for these new segments as well as the relevant comparable historical financial data. The company closed the first quarter with sales of $2.95 billion and GAAP and adjusted diluted EPS of $0.68 and $0.67, respectively. First quarter sales were up 24% in US dollars, 25% in local currencies and 17% organically compared to the first quarter of 2021. The significant sales increase was driven by double digit organic growth in the IT data communications, commercial air, industrial, automotive and broadband markets as well as contributions from the company's acquisition program. Sequentially, sales were down by just 2% in US dollars and in local currencies and down 4% organically. Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes. Orders for the quarter were a record $3.441 billion, which is up 26% compared to the first quarter of 2021 and up 5% sequentially, resulting in a strong book-to-bill ratio of 1.17:1. GAAP and adjusted operating income was $590 million in the first quarter and operating margin was a strong 20% in the first quarter of 2022, which increased by 40 basis points compared to the prior year quarter. Sequentially, adjusted operating margins declined by only 10 basis points, which is significantly better than we typically see in the first quarter. The year-over-year increase in operating margin was primarily driven by normal operating leverage on higher sales volumes as well as the benefit of ongoing pricing actions. These benefits were partially offset by the impact of the more challenging commodity and supply chain environment, together with the slight margin dilution of acquisitions completed over the past year. On a sequential basis, the slight decrease in adjusted operating margin reflected normal conversion on the lower sales volumes, slightly offset by the benefit of ongoing pricing actions, which became effective in the quarter. Given the dynamic overall cost and supply chain environment, we are very proud of the company's operating performance. Our team's ability to effectively manage through the myriad of challenges around the world is a direct result of the strength of the company's entrepreneurial culture, which continues to foster a high performance, action oriented management team. GAAP diluted EPS was $0.68 in the first quarter, an increase of 28% compared to $0.53 in the prior year period, and adjusted diluted EPS was $0.67, an increase of 29% compared to the $0.52 in the first quarter of 2021. This was an excellent result, especially considering the significant cost, supply chain and other operational challenges the company continued to face during the quarter. The company's GAAP effective tax rate for the first quarter was 23.8% and the adjusted effective tax rate was 24.5%, which compared to 23.9% and 24.5% in the first quarter of 2021, respectively. Bringing down first quarter results into our three new segments. Relative to the first quarter of 2021, sales in the Harsh Environment Solutions segment were $728 million and increased 16% in US dollars and organically. Operating margins in the quarter for the segment was 25.2%. Sales in the Communications Solutions segment was $1.320 billion and increased 28% in US dollars and 21% organically. Operating margin in the quarter for the segment was 21.4%. Sales in the Interconnect & Sensor Systems segment were $904 million and increased 25% in US dollars and 13% organically and operating margin in the quarter for the segment was 17.7%. Operating cash flow in the first quarter was $351 million or 83% of adjusted net income. Net of capital spending, our free cash flow was $274 million or 65% of adjusted net income. Cash flow in the quarter was a bit lower than we would normally expect even in a typically weaker first quarter, primarily due to a higher than normal increase in inventory levels, driven by the continued challenging supply chain environment. From a working capital standpoint, days sales outstanding and payable days were 74 and 57 days, respectively, both within a normal range. Inventory days were 88, which are slightly elevated due to the normal Q1 seasonality as well as the challenging supply chain reasons just mentioned. Our management teams are focused on reducing these inventory levels, although given the challenging environment, this may take a couple of quarters. During the quarter, the company repurchased 2.6 million shares of common stock at an average price of $78. And when combined with our normal quarterly dividend, total capital returned to shareholders in the first quarter of 2022 was more than $320 million. Total debt at March 31st was $4.9 billion and net debt was $3.6 billion. And total liquidity at the end of the quarter was $2.9 billion, which included cash and short-term investments on hand of $1.3 billion plus availability under existing credit facilities. First quarter 2022 GAAP EBITDA was $699 million. And at the end of the first quarter of 2020, our net leverage ratio is 1.3 times. I will now turn the call over to Adam, who will provide some commentary on current market trends.\nAdam Norwitt: Well, thank you very much, Craig, and it's my pleasure also to welcome everybody here for our first quarter earnings call. And first and foremost, I hope that everybody here today, together with your family, friends and colleagues are managing to stay safe and healthy as the world comes to some degree of normalcy. Again, I also wanted to just offer our thoughts to the people of Ukraine, who are obviously going through this very difficult time period with the unfortunate war. While we don't have operations in the Ukraine, we do have many employees of Ukrainian descent and our hearts are clearly with them together with their families and friends. As Craig mentioned, we wanted to highlight or I'm going to highlight some of our first quarter achievements. I'll then spend a few moments to discuss our trends and our progress across our served markets. And then finally, I'm going to comment on our outlook for the second quarter. And of course, we'll then have time for questions at the end. As Craig mentioned, we drove results in the first quarter that were substantially beyond our original expectations, exceeding the high end of our guidance in sales as well as adjusted diluted earnings per share. Sales grew a very strong 24% in US dollars and 25% in local currencies, reaching $2.952 billion. And on an organic basis, our sales increased by 17% with growth across nearly all of our end markets and that was driven particularly by double digit growth in the IT datacom, commercial air, industrial, automotive and broadband markets, and I'll talk about each of those in a few moments. The company booked a record $3.441 billion in orders in the first quarter, and this represented another very strong book-to-bill this time 1.17:1. And despite continuing to face substantial inflationary pressures and supply chain disruptions, our operating margins reached 20.0% in the quarter, which was a 40 basis point increase from last year's levels. We're very encouraged by the strong profitability performance for the company, and we see that as a clear sign that our local management teams are successfully managing through this challenging cost environment. Diluted EPS in the quarter grew a robust 29% from prior year to $0.67, again, an excellent reflection of our continued strong execution. The company also generated strong operating and free cash flow in the quarter of $351 million and $274 million, and that's despite all of the challenges that Craig alluded to. And again, another clear reflection of the high quality of the company's earnings. I'm just very proud of our team this quarter. These results once again reflect the discipline and agility of our entrepreneurial organization as we continue to perform well in a very dynamic and challenging environment. Now turning to our end markets. I would just comment that we continue to be very pleased that our end market exposure remains highly diversified, balanced and broad. And in particular, amidst these very dynamic times, this market diversification continues to create great value for Amphenol. Now starting with our military market represented 10% of our sales in the quarter. Sales grew by 7% from prior year and were up 1% organically with growth in space and avionics applications somewhat offset by moderations in our sales on to UAVs, naval and military vehicles. Sequentially, our sales decreased by 2%, which was just a hair below our expectations coming into the quarter. And looking now into the second quarter, we expect sales in the defense market to increase modestly from these first quarter levels. We continue to be very pleased with the strength of the company's position in the defense market, a market that has renewed importance given the current geopolitical environment. As militaries around the world continue to accelerate their adoption of next generation technologies, our industry leading breadth of high technology interconnect and sensor products positions the company strongly across essentially all major military programs. This gives us great confidence for our long term performance. The commercial air market represented 3% of our sales in the quarter. And sales in commercial air increased by a strong 42% from prior year and 28% organically as we benefited from the continued recovery in global aircraft production. Sequentially, our sales grew by a better-than-expected 8% from the fourth quarter. And as we look into the second quarter, while we do expect a sequential moderation of sales compared to these first quarter levels, we anticipate another quarter of year-over-year growth in commercial air. After two very challenging years in the air travel industry, we're encouraged by the strengthening of our ComAir business. As personal and business travel continues to recover, we look forward to benefiting from the company's strong interconnect and sensor technology position across a wide array of aircraft platforms as well as the next generation systems that are integrated into those planes. The industrial market represented 25% of our sales in the quarter, and we drove another quarter of excellent performance in the industrial market. Sales grew 31% in US dollars and 20% organically, and this was driven by robust growth across most of the segments within the industrial market. But we did see particular strength in battery and electric heavy vehicle applications, factory automation and oil and gas, as well as the benefits of several of the acquisitions that we've done over the last year. On a sequential basis, sales were down just 1% from the fourth quarter, which was better than our expectations coming into this quarter. Looking into the second quarter, we expect sales in the industrial market to increase moderately from current levels. So this first quarter confirmed once again that our outstanding global team working in the industrial market continues to find new opportunities for growth across the many segments of this exciting market. I remain confident that our long term strategy to expand our high technology interconnect antenna and sensor offering, both organically and through complementary acquisitions, has positioned us well to capitalize on the many revolutions happening across the industrial electronics market. We look forward to realizing the benefits of this strategy for many years to come. The automotive market represented 20% of our sales in the quarter, and sales grew by 17% in US dollars and organically with our growth, driven once again by the strength of our sales into electric and hybrid electric vehicle applications. Sequentially, sales increased by 5% from the fourth quarter which is actually much better than our expectations of a high single digit decline. And this just reflected strong execution by our team working in the automotive market. For the second quarter, we expect a modest sequential decline in sales as customers manage through a wide array of supply chain challenges in the global automotive market. I remain extremely proud of our team working across the automotive market. They continue to manage through a difficult supply chain environment all while remaining laser focused on driving new design wins with customers who are implementing a wide array of new technologies into their vehicle platforms. Our continued outperformance is a direct result of that team's excellent efforts. The mobile devices market represented 10% of our sales in the quarter. Sales increased by 7% from prior year, with strength in tablets, smartphones, wearables as well as laptops. Sequentially, our sales decline was less than we had expected, declining 27% from the fourth quarter. As we look into the second quarter, we now anticipate a low double digit sequential sales decline from these levels, driven by typical seasonality, as well as by some impact from the recent COVID-related shutdowns that have been occurring and continue to occur in China. There's no question that mobile devices remains our most volatile of end markets. Nevertheless, our outstanding and agile team is poised as always to capture any opportunities for incremental sales that may arise in 2022 and beyond. Our leading array of antennas, interconnect products and mechanisms continues to enable a broad range of next generation mobile devices, positioning us well for the long term. The mobile networks market represented 5% of our sales in the first quarter and sales in this market grew from prior year by a stronger-than-expected 14% in U.S. dollars and 5% organically as strength from products sold directly to network operators, together with the benefit of acquisitions more than offset a moderation of our sales to equipment OEMs. Sequentially, our sales in the first quarter were flat to the levels that we achieved in the fourth quarter. As we look into the second quarter, we expect a modest decline from these first quarter levels. Nevertheless, we're encouraged to see continued strength in our sales to the mobile networks market. As operators continue to ramp up their investments in next-generation systems, our team remains focused on realizing the benefits of our efforts to expand our position in next-generation 5G equipment and networks around the world. We look forward, especially to benefiting from the increased potential that comes from our unique position with both equipment manufacturers and mobile service providers. The information technology and data communications market represented 22% of our sales in the quarter. Sales were stronger than expected in IT datacom, rising by a very robust 41% in US dollars and 35% organically from prior year as our teams capitalized on broad based strength across server and networking applications. And in particular, we saw continued robust growth of our sales to web service provider and data center operator customers. We were pleased that sales moderated by just 2% sequentially in the first quarter, which was better than our expectations coming into Q1. Looking to the second quarter, we expect sales to increase in the mid-single digits from these first quarter levels as customer demand continues to grow in IT datacom. We remain encouraged by the company's outstanding position in this important market. Our OEM and web service provider customers continue to drive their equipment and networks to ever higher levels of performance in order to manage the dramatic increases in demand for bandwidth and processor power. We look forward to realizing the benefits of our leading position for many years to come. The broadband market represented 5% of our sales in the quarter. And sales in this market also grew by a very strong 47% from prior year and 12% organically, as broadband spending levels increased and as we benefited from our recent acquisitions. On a sequential basis, sales increased by a much better-than-expected 30% from the fourth quarter. And we're pleased, in particular, to start to see some progress in pricing actions across this market. In the second quarter, we expect sales to the broadband market to increase modestly from these levels. And we look forward to continuing to support our broadband service provider customers around the world with our expanded range of high technology products. As our customers increase the bandwidth and capacity of their networks to support the expansion of high speed data applications to both homes and businesses, our products have become even more critical. Now turning to our outlook for the second quarter. The current market environment remains highly uncertain with ongoing supply chain and inflationary challenges being in many ways exacerbated by both the war in Ukraine, as well as the continued impact of the pandemic, which is causing shutdowns in certain geographies, most notably in China. Assuming conditions do not meaningfully worsen and also assuming, of course, constant exchange rates, for the second quarter, we expect sales in the range of $2.890 billion to $2.950 billion and adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $0.66 to $0.68. These expectations would represent strong sales growth of 9% to 11% and adjusted diluted EPS growth of 8% to 11% versus the second quarter of last year. I just have to say that I remain confident in the ability of our outstanding management team to adapt to the many opportunities and challenges that are still present in the marketplace and to continue to grow our market position while expanding the company's profitability. In addition, our organization remains committed to delivering long term sustainable value, all while prioritizing the continued safety and health of each of our employees around the world. And I'd just like to take this opportunity at the end here to thank all of those employees, more than 90,000 of them around the world, the entire Amphenol team, for their truly outstanding efforts here in the first quarter. And with that, operator, we'd be very happy to take any questions that there may be.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Amit Daryanani with Evercore.\nAmit Daryanani: My question is really around -- and I'm hoping, Adam, you would just elaborate on what are the impacts you're seeing out of the China lockdown maybe on two fronts. So one is, how are you thinking about that impacting your supply, your demand environment coming out of China? And secondly, do you think this is really resulting in customers perhaps deciding to hold on to more inventory for longer versus trying to get back to just-in-time models if that's the discussion as being happen with your customers?\nAdam Norwitt: I mean, look, relative to our own supply and demand, there's no doubt about it that our team is navigating lots of things in China. And I just have to take a moment to really reflect on how extraordinary they have managed through the first quarter, because some of these disruptions, they already have started well into the first quarter. And the fact that our team was able to drive the results that they did across the board and including in China is a real testament to the reactivity, the agility, the fortitude of our team there because these lockdowns are really quite something. We have employees who are sort of locked in their apartment in Shanghai for four or five weeks. We have factories that have had to operate in bubbles and things like this. And it's just extraordinary how the team has managed through this. But no doubt about it. I mean we see some impact. It's not a massive impact here in the quarter, but there is some impact here in the quarter. And I specifically talked about the impact that we see in mobile devices which is the one market that has the highest exposure to China. So it shouldn't be surprising that, that's one where there's maybe a little more magnitude of impact, both with customers and their demand and the supply chain and our own abilities to reach really full levels of production. But our team is doing a fabulous job and I think that they will manage through this. And I'm very confident that China as a country is going to manage through this. No question in my mind. Relative to customers holding more inventory, I think that whole concept of just in time has in many ways over the last two years been a little bit replaced by to find a cliche, just in case. And no doubt, we have customers who are looking at lots of ways to balance risk in their supply chain. I think their first choice is not just to put inventory on the shelves, but rather to look to their supplier partners, companies like us and say, what can we do to create diversification in the supply base, such that they don't have all their eggs in one basket. And no doubt, we've done a lot of work over these couple of years through the pandemic, through the supply chain crisis, through the logistics crisis, whatever that may be, to demonstrate to our customers and ultimately to deliver to our customers a kind of multiplicity of options of supply that thereby minimize their risk. But beyond that, are customers kind of opening up their order window a little more, I think we would say, yes, are customers putting a little more inventory on the shelf. There, I can only speak with anecdotal evidence, because we don't have great visibility into the warehouses and the inventory levels of our OEM or service provider customers. The one where we do have visibility, which is our distribution channel, I would actually say that inventory levels there are even a little low in many of the relationships that we have and certainly not at levels that one would think are reflective of some sort of risk aversion. So I think customers are doing a lot of things here. Is the odd customer carrying a little bit more inventory, it wouldn't surprise me if that were the case.\nOperator: The next question is from Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs.\nMark Delaney: Thank you very much for taking the question, which is about the M&A landscape. I'm curious to what extent you're seeing any increased willingness of companies to be acquired, financial markets are at good absolute levels, but you've seen some pullback recently in valuations. So curious if more companies are perhaps willing to be open to an acquisition? And could you also speak to Amphenol's willingness to do larger acquisitions? You've done a few larger ones of late, including Halo and MTS and I'm wondering, do you think you need to time digesting those, or would you be willing to do a larger acquisition if the opportunity presented itself?\nAdam Norwitt: I mean, look, I don't know that we've seen any meaningful difference in the M&A environment. I would tell you the M&A environment is very robust. Our pipeline is as strong as ever. As you know, over the last two and half years, we closed on a large number of deals, including last year, just the extraordinary progress that we made in our M&A program with very significant deals like MTS and at the end of the year, Halo, as well as the number of wonderful tuck-in companies, tuck-in deals that then ultimately strengthen our position across a wide array of our end markets. And I think that we continue to see among companies that we talk to, I don\u2019t know if it's a general willingness -- increased willingness, but our reputation is a wonderful home for their companies, that continues to strengthen over time. And so there's no doubt about it that our phone continues to ring. We continue to to create that sort of organic pipeline of acquisitions. And not a week goes by where Craig and I don't hear of some new company that we had never heard of. At the same time, we have very high standards. And so to the point that if companies are kind of coming out of the wood work, we're not just saying yes to every one of these. We hold very, very high standards around our acquisition program. And that includes looking for great people with great products who have complementary market position. And that is never going to be something that we compromise and nor do we ever compromise on valuation because at the end of the day, whether the stock market is higher or the stock market is low, we pay fair value for great companies. And we pay a value that\u2019s really based on what they have delivered and not what the company can become as part of Amphenol. In terms of our willingness to do larger deals, I would just let our history speak almost for itself here. I mean, for sure, we have the wherewithal to do an enormous number of deals, and that includes deals large and small. I would say that the evolution of our organization, one of the benefits of that is really also opening up the bandwidth across the company so that we have capacity to either do more deals or bigger deals, both of which we kind of arithmetically need to do if we want acquisitions to continue to represent roughly a third of our growth over the long term, which is what we continue to target. So I think the M&A landscape remains a very positive driver for Amphenol. And I think the strategy of complementing our superior organic growth with adding excellent companies is something that has created enormous value for the company past and we'll continue to do so going forward.\nOperator: The next question is from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is Manmohan on for Samik Chatterjee. I just wanted to ask like the way we were thinking and where some of the investors you were talking to, like we were expecting you to have a higher than -- higher headwinds in terms of margins compared to your peers, but you have -- but the results were a little contrary to that with better operating margins than peers, both for current quarter as well as for the next quarter. So is there like the expectations were there due to the decentralized way of functioning the centralized hedging activity was lesser. So what exactly is things that we are missing here? Is this entirely due to better success with price increases or some other dynamics here at work?\nCraig Lampo: I mean, we talked about this a little bit coming into the quarter in January. We certainly saw some pressures from the cost environment as everybody has. And I think we did a great job in 2021 really protecting against that through pricing and then certainly other actions as well. And we talked about in the fourth quarter where our margins were a bit lower than we did expect coming into the first quarter. Some improvement in profitability as we kind of reflected in our guidance and our implied guidance that our profitability improved from pricing actions starting to take hold, and that's exactly what we saw. I think the team has done a fabulous job of ensuring that they were taking the actions they needed to. There's no doubt we're in an inflationary environment. And there's a lot of difficult conversations that we're having with customers on a frequent basis. This isn't something that's happening just on annually anymore. This is something that's happening on probably a monthly basis or maybe even sometimes more frequent than that as we continue to see costs rise. And I think the team has done a great job with that. We don't do any hedging. We don't talk -- hedging is something that we typically don't do other than maybe FX hedging or things of that nature. But certainly, as it relates to commodity costs, we don't do any of that. So that certainly has no impact on our margins. But certainly, the pricing actions we've taken with our customers are starting to take hold here in the first quarter. We're expecting that to continue into the second quarter in our implied guidance of our margins continuing to improve a bit here into the second quarter. And I'm certainly real proud of the team. I mean the inflationary environment has gotten worse here in the first quarter and we certainly don't expect it to get any better in the second quarter. So the ability of our team to continue to protect them not only protect the margins, but starting to expand the margins a bit and starting to basically offset -- more than offset some of the cost environment is certainly great to see and we're going to continue to work hard to do the same thing as the inflationary environment continues.\nOperator: Next question is from Steven Fox with Fox Advisors.\nSteven Fox: I was wondering if you could drill down a little more into the IT datacom segment. As I mentioned before, it keeps surprising for the upside for you guys. I'm curious like when you -- what you're seeing during the quarter from both a market standpoint and then a content standpoint, whether we're missing the boat maybe on market shares or just better content on certain interconnect products? Or is it all related to spending coming in better than you think? Any color there would be helpful.\nAdam Norwitt: And Steve, you're never missing any boats. So I wouldn't say that. Look, we're just -- our IT datacom business and the operations within Amphenol who are serving that end market have just done a phenomenal job over the last two years on several fronts. Number one, it's developing the products that our customers need. And I think the innovation in this market is so critical because our customers are under enormous pressure, enormous pressure to satisfy this kind of unquenchable thirst among consumers for bandwidth, and at the other side, the kind of unquenchable thirst for power that these data centers create. And so where we've seen the real innovations is happening around high speed interconnect across the board, as well as in the power interconnect that goes to drive the efficiency of these systems in a way that ultimately these data centers don't become such [positive] of energy. And I think on both of those fronts, we just continue to see this immutable march forward and drive for customers to really push the limits of technology, and that's something where our engineers are just really excelling. Whether it's designing the latest high speed interconnects such that we can stretch the ability of copper interconnect far beyond what people ever thought was possible and thereby saving both cost as well as power consumption and the design resources of our customers to designing really complex power interconnects that ultimately reduce the power consumption of these data centers and make them more efficient. There's a lot of work going on there. At the same time, coupled with those great products, has been our consistent, and I will say, really consistent through this whole cycle of the pandemic, ability to satisfy the needs of our customers even when those needs change dramatically in a moment's notice. And that responsiveness and the fact that we never let our customers down, while others were consistently letting them down, has meant that our customers come to us more and more and give to us maybe a disproportionate share of their needs because they know that we're there for them when they need us the most. I remember so clearly, in the second quarter of 2020 going all the way back to kind of the beginning of the pandemic, when everybody started going on to video calls and video meetings and the bandwidth just kind of exploded and people were watching over-the-top video at home, Netflix and other things like that. And our customers came to us with not just marginal increases in demand but multiples of increase of demand, and we just figured out a way to make it happen. And that's the entrepreneurial reactivity of Amphenol that we talk about so often. And I think the customers in IT datacom have been real beneficiaries of that. And we've been recognized by our customers, not just with more share but with more supplier awards than I can remember in my entire career, over this time period, recognition from those customers, both OEMs and service providers that Amphenol really differentiated ourselves in terms of our reactivity and our reactions. What's that market going to be going forward? I think the demand for bandwidth does not seem to abate. Are we always going to grow by 35% organically in the quarter? I don't know that I would go out and commit to that. But I think our team has done a great job positioning us to outperform for a long time to come.\nOperator: Next question is from Nick Todorov with Longbow Research.\nNick Todorov: Adam, I think you mentioned that you're starting to see some progress on pricing in the broadband market. I know that has been one of the most difficult ones to get the pricing through. Can you please help us unpack there a little bit? What is causing that change? And what are you able to do in terms of offsetting the impact of inflation that you're seeing there and maybe generally across the business?\nAdam Norwitt: I did make that mention, and we think some portion of our organic growth, certainly not the totality, but some portion is a credit to our teams, long term and very challenging efforts on pricing. I mean the thing about our traditional broadband business, as you know, is it has a very high material content but it hasn't always had a very rational competitive landscape. And so I think what we're starting to see now is the severity of the inflation has really woken up the other participants in the market that there needs to be some reasonable sharing of that inflation with customers, and we've always been at the forefront of that. I've said for many, many years that we don't let the sun set on a pricing action from our peers in order to match that and to keep up with these inflationary pressures. And I think we've taken maybe even more of a leadership position over the course of the last year or so. And we're pleased to see some signs of maybe a little bit more discipline in that market that didn't traditionally have as much discipline. And it is a market where the inflation has a disproportionate impact because of the higher material content, the raw material content, things like plastics and metals and the like. And so we're hopeful, it's certainly not a kind of fully told story here but we're encouraged to start to see a little bit more progress in pricing in that market.\nOperator: Next question is from Jim Suva with Citigroup.\nJames Suva: While it's very sad about the world conflict that's happening in Russia and Europe and such. Taking a step back, I wonder, are you seeing and having discussions with defense companies that are maybe doing, say, electronic radars, surveillance, smart warfare, defense items, a material pickup, because with the supply chain issues, it'd be tough to simply put in an order and expect it pretty quickly. So I'm wondering if this is kind of a sector that all of a sudden unexpectedly and for sad situations start to see a pretty sharp increase in demand for the defense.\nAdam Norwitt: And I would use the same adjectives as you that it is a sad situation what is happening in Ukraine, tragic in many respects. But I would also tell you that we're proud of the role that our company has played, both in supporting refugees coming from the Ukraine and some of the neighboring countries where we have operations. Not only supporting them monetarily but also providing jobs to some. I mean, this has been a real initiative by our team to support these people who have really had their livelihoods crushed. And at the same time, I think we've all witnessed the power of defense and that some of these new technologies that we have talked about for so many years have real importance in people's lives to keep a country safe in the face of what I think many would consider unreasonable aggression. So I wouldn't want to comment on specific conversations that we have in the defense industry. You can imagine that that's not something that we would want to do. But I think we're encouraged for the long term to see that many countries are waking up to the fact that maybe the defense budgets should be calibrated a little bit better to the level of threat that may very well exist in the world in order to keep the peace loving people of the world more secure. And that can translate into overall spending and it can translate long term into an acceleration of adoption of technologies. I've talked for a long time about the kind of difference in the defense industry between the more tactical defense spending and the more strategic defense spending. And I think, Jim, you've covered us probably as long as anyone and you've heard that theme before. And I think what we're seeing here is, no doubt about it, a shift of market and relatively rapid shift in the focus of countries, especially those countries in NATO towards an emphasis of strategic defense. And whenever you start talking about strategic defense, you immediately start to talk about technology. You talk about radar, you talk about missile defense. You talk about all of the things that electronics can do to protect people in their homes and in their sovereign nations. And I think Amphenol has played a leading role over the years in being an enabler of those kind of next-generation electronic defense systems. And so to the extent that this tragic and unfortunate conflict does drive an even greater focus among NATO countries. We certainly sit as the leader in the military interconnect market in a position to really help those countries to help the companies that are supporting that initiative in really adopting next-generation technology to protect all of the citizens of these sovereign countries.\nOperator: Next question is from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America.\nWamsi Mohan: Appreciate the new segment disclosures. It seems like the operating margins here are ranging from 17% to 26% based on the segment. Can you talk about what is driving the dispersion there? Because in your 10-K, you do report most of these -- all three of these segments more or less cover all of your end markets. And you gave some color about the products too, but would love to hear from you, Adam. But maybe what is it that's driving that delta in margins? And as you think about M&A, is there a propensity to lean towards one versus another segment?\nCraig Lampo: I'll take this one, at least the first part of it. Yes, certainly, you're right. We have -- there's a range in margins of our segments. I mean I don't think that's so surprising. I mean we have 130 businesses. And you can't imagine that some of them are above the company average and some of them are certainly below the company average. And our businesses are typically based on product technologies that have application across many different markets. I mean we're very diversified from a market perspective. And one of the things we try to do for all of our businesses to apply our products amongst those -- proliferate our products amongst all the markets in which they have the -- they can add value. And that, I think, has been the strength of the company and certainly has driven growth over the years. So that's the same as our segments. We didn't -- our segments aren't a market focused segments. Our segments are product focused segments for the most part that does serve many different markets. So certainly, there's no correlation from a market perspective. I guess mention is that there is -- in our communication solutions market, there is the broadband and mobile device markets are typically -- or the vast majority of those markets are served by that segment. But other than those, the rest of the six segments effectively are broad based amongst all of our segments. And as it relates to margin, as I mentioned, that some operations are above and some of it are below. I don't think there's really much to draw from in terms of the the profitability from -- again, from a market or necessarily from a specific business perspective. I think that when I think about the segments, clearly, over time, we spend a lot of time on the businesses that have the lower profitability, including certainly acquisitions. The Interconnect and Sensor Systems segment has a couple more acquisitions, recent acquisitions in it, specifically MTS, which did drive actually the year-over-year reduction kind of in the margin in that particular business. So as you can imagine, we're working, as we talked about with those businesses to drive up the profitability over time. But I think that we don't have margin or conversion margin targets by segment, but we certainly do an overall company level, that hasn't changed and we talked about the 25% conversion margin. As you can imagine, the higher profitability businesses are going to convert possibly a little bit higher than the lower profitability businesses. But ultimately, our goal is to drive profitability up in all of our businesses and ultimately, all of our segments over time. But I wouldn't necessarily point out anything specific that's driving that significant margin differences other than that's kind of how the businesses ultimately were segmented for management reporting purposes.\nAdam Norwitt: And relative to your question on M&A, Wamsi, no question, we have a propensity to look for acquisitions across every one of our markets and across all of our 3 now segments as we call them. We're not at all going to kind of direct our resources strategically towards one or another. They all have -- it's an equal opportunity resource for all of them. And to the extent that we find strong acquisitions with the criteria that I alluded to earlier, we're very aggressive and happy to make those acquisitions regardless of which segment it's in.\nOperator: The next question is from Luke Junk with Baird.\nLuke Junk: I have maybe what's a part backward and forward-looking question. And specifically, Adam, I'm wondering if there's any color on bookings or orders in your auto business specifically you could share after obviously a very big increase in that business in 2021 and here in the first quarter as well. I looked back a couple of months ago to the 10-K, you included some language on the overall business is stating that the increase in the company's backlog was with the significant sales increase given the significant sales increase in auto specifically. How should we think about that backlog and orders relative to that end market?\nAdam Norwitt: I mean it's interesting. When we look across all of our end markets in terms of our book-to-bill, we had pretty strong books-to-bill across really all of our end markets with the exception of mobile devices where it's always kind of one-to-one, and I think broadband was also relatively flat book-to-bill. But all the other markets had pretty robust books to bill. And I would say maybe automotive was even a little below the average, but still a strong, more than one book-to-bill. And I don't know that I would draw any conclusions about automotive and the past performance or the trajectory based on those bookings. I think what I would just highlight again is that our performance in automotive has been really consistently outperforming the end market, whatever the end market is. Lots of people take lots of different cuts at what is end market performance units or whatever it is. But for sure our growth in this quarter where we achieved 17% growth that was on the heels of last quarter where we grew 18%, the quarter before, 31%. The quarter before that was even this kind of crazy number of more than 100%. And I just think that it's a reflection of the dynamics that I have talked about earlier and before, which is the higher content that we see on next-generation platforms. In particular, we've seen a market increase in the adoption of electrification, electrified drivetrains, and our team has done a fabulous job to position themselves in that area. And we're doing that really across the globe, really broadly from a geographical perspective. And then all the other new electronic systems that are coming into cars where we're not necessarily taking share from out of one pocket, but we are maybe getting a little more than our fair share of these new things because of our reactivity to the customers and the appropriateness and the breadth of the technology that we can offer from the interconnect products, connectors, value-add interconnect products, sensors and antennas. And so I think our position in automotive, while certainly we're not the biggest in the automotive interconnect space far from it, but I think our performance has really been differentiated because of our ability to really capture a little bit more than our fair share of these new things.\nOperator: The next question is from William Stein with Truist Securities.\nWilliam Stein: First, you may have quantified it, if you had, I apologize for asking, but the impact of the COVID-related shutdowns in China that you're seeing. If you've already answered that, perhaps you can talk about linearity of bookings and whether you've seen any perturbations from what's going on in either Ukraine or China and any erosion into April.\nAdam Norwitt: I don't think we put an exact number on the COVID shutdowns, and we don't plan to I think we -- it's not like a massive impact. It's also hard to count it. I mean every day it's changing a little bit, but there's certainly some impact, And I think I mentioned earlier, we see it most in the mobile devices, but we see it in a few other markets as well, like automotive and IT datacom and industrial. In terms of the linearity of bookings, our first quarter, we saw pretty good strength through the quarter. I mean, February is a short month of sort of Chinese New Year, but we finished the quarter really strong and bookings in March were really strong indeed. And April, we're still three days away from the end, so I couldn't even give you a number if I wanted to, but we'll see how it goes here in April. I mean would I expect a 1.17:1 book-to-bill here in the second quarter? I don't think I would expect that. I didn't expect it coming into the first quarter and we had very strong bookings. But I don't expect that here in the second quarter, but we'll see. I think customers still have quite a propensity to give us business new and existing, and that's translating into very robust orders for quite a number of quarters here.\nOperator: The next question is from Chris Snyder with UBS.\nChris Snyder: I wanted to follow up on the prior commentary around customers more so valuing diversification in their supply chain, which certainly screens positive for a global leader like Amphenol. But my question is where is this dynamic filling up and where would you expect to show up? Is it just the rate of share gains maybe helping with some of these pricing negotiations? Or could you even help facilitate M&A for maybe some of your smaller competitors who might be on the opposite side of that equation?\nAdam Norwitt: Look, it's hard to sort of pinpoint it because at the end of the day, why does the customer give us an order in any given moment? I mean, there's an enormous number of factors that go into that all along the spectrum, from the technology that we offer, the reliability of our delivery to that customer, our quality, our support, the breadth of our relationship, obviously, the price that\u2019s something that no customer wants to ever forget about. And so as you build over a long term a sustainable advantage with customers, it's all about continuing to just add to each of those factors further reason for customers to place an order to you and not to your competitor. And I think over the last two years -- look, over a long time, that's always our focus. How do we have a little bit better product? How do we have a little bit better quality? How do we have a little bit better credibility of delivery? How do we have a more competitive cost by going to low-cost countries and the like? But what has changed over these two years is there's a new factor that customers are considering and that is risk. And I will tell you that over many years, I've been -- now I'm in my 24th year in this company and my 14th year as CEO, I think customers underaccounted for risk in many cases because it was just easy to say, well, here's the price and the quality is good and it's the right product. And we don't really need to think about all these kind of black swan events that may or may not happen. And by the way, that was true through earthquakes and tsunamis, that was true through volcanos in Iceland and floods in Thailand and all these things. But something about the last two years has caused them really to wake up to think about the real risk of their supply chain. And when they do that and they look at the landscape of competitors, they look at a small company and they see risk. They look at a centralized company, and they see risk. But when they look at Amphenol and they look at our decentralized, very fragmented, very global, we have more than, what, something like 250 factories around the world, which is a lot more than most companies of our size. There, they see not risk, but actually opportunity. And I think that, that change has been just another factor that didn't exist in the past. And where does it manifest? I mean I think it does manifest to some degree in our outperformance and then the continuation of our outperformance. As it relates to M&A, I think there is actually also an advantage because if you're a small company, and you've been through this kind of rubicon of challenges that we've all faced over these couple of years, being part of a bigger company that gives you more options of where you can make stuff and where you can source stuff and where you can sell stuff, so that starts to be a pretty compelling thing to think about, if you really truly care about the company that you as an entrepreneur have built. And so I think that can also have an advantage. I think there's advantages that sort of go throughout the business. And it's, again, why we're so religious about our adherence to the culture of Amphenol, that unique entrepreneurial culture, which has served us in good times and bad. And I think the value of it has been more enhanced over these last couple of years than really ever before.\nOperator: Next question is from David Kelley with Jefferies.\nDavid Kelley: I was hoping to drill down on industrials. You posted another really strong quarter there. And just given your broad exposure, can you walk us through how you're thinking about the industrials market growth visibility? And what feels like a strong CapEx cycle but also an uncertain near-term global macro. And then just curious as your thoughts on the potential magnitude of content outgrowth given what, again, feels like I would argue unprecedented pace of technology transformation currently undergoing in industrials?\nAdam Norwitt: No doubt about it. Our team working and industrial market has just been consistently outstanding in their performance. I mean, since the kind of acute phase of COVID in Q1 of 2020, at least in Asia, we've posted consistently strong double-digit year-over-year growth every quarter since then. So we just did our eighth straight quarter in industrial of strong double-digit growth, and it's really a testament to their efforts. And as you pointed out, it's a very broad market. It's everything from advanced medical equipment to next-generation agricultural equipment, to high-speed rail, to semiconductor manufacturing equipment, to heavy equipment, to electrification of heavy vehicles and battery technology, battery storage, where we see just a lot of opportunities to enable a real myriad of customers who are developing next-generation energy storage systems and they want our sensors, they want our connectors. They want everything. I mean these applications are really all over the place. And they all go on somewhat different cycles, I should say. But at the end of the day, they have one thing in common, which is it is the adoption of electronics into harsh environments, into areas where those electronics otherwise should not really be able to operate. And that is a legacy that we have of many, many decades of building up the capability of packaging interconnect and sensors for harsh environments, which now means putting highly computerized autonomous driving systems on tractors, and now means putting next-generation sensor technologies and alternative energy devices and monitoring of wind mills and things like this. I mean, I could go on and on and on. And amidst the uncertain global macro, you have the certainty of the continued onward and upward march of the adoption of electronics. So I'm not going to say that we're going to grow every quarter here in perpetuity by these outstanding amounts. No, I mean, I wouldn't expect that we're going to grow by 31% every quarter going forward. But I do believe that the opportunity to outperform here remains very strong and that the breadth of our industrial product technologies is really second to none, and I think that positions us well for the future.\nOperator: Next question is from Joe Spak with RBC Capital Markets.\nJoe Spak: Maybe just to go back to one of the other questions about in the end markets and sort of being pretty well split across all the new segments. Is the implication also that the growth you've laid out for the entire company organic and second quarter, like is that also evenly split by the new reporting segments? Is there any sort of color in terms of how we should think about the segment performance would be helpful?\nAdam Norwitt: I mean we're not guiding necessarily to growth by segment. I think we gave a lot of details by each of our end markets. But as you saw this quarter, I mean, the growth was pretty balanced across those segments. Now we had really broad growth across the company. So I wouldn't necessarily say that what we would expect by each segment going into here in the second quarter.\nOperator: Our last question comes from Joe Giordano with Cowen.\nJoe Giordano: Just wanted to -- on auto, obviously, the performance has been really good for a long time relative to peers, relative to the market, however you want to cut it. I'm just curious like if you were to break down the outperformance in like large buckets as to what's driving it. Maybe I can leave it open ended there. But I'm also curious as to how much maybe is -- with production being constrained here and focused on SUVs, high-end EVs, like kind of the things that are probably best for you, how much of that is driving some of this as well?\nAdam Norwitt: I mean I don't know that there's a significant impact, Joe, from kind of the hot potato of people crossing semiconductors back and forth and deciding where they should put their -- which vehicles they should put them in and thereby which they should sell and prioritize. I mean, look, if our customers are building higher content cars, is that a good thing? Yes, I guess that would certainly be a good thing. But that should be a good thing for everybody in the market. And I think would that drive specifically our outperformance? I don't know that, that would necessarily be the case. I think really what we see, and I'll just reiterate it again, is we see just an acceleration of the adoption of next-generation systems across all vehicles, and that includes the electrified drivetrains that we mentioned, but not exclusively that. It's next-generation infotainment, next-generation communication, it's next-generation comfort, passenger comfort, it's next-generation connectivity in the cars, it's everything from sensors that keep the HVAC systems running better and being safer for the people inside. I mean, you think about like going through a respiratory-borne illness pandemic and all of a sudden, car companies want to have better HVAC filtration and sensing inside their cars. And that's a great new application that may not have existed kind of in the past. And so I think that's the bigger driver here than just that some car companies are making more tactical decisions about which models to produce based on constrained availability of certain components. Well, thank you very much to everybody. I think that's our last question. And I do want to take this opportunity, once again, to thank you all for spending a few of your precious time -- a few of your precious minutes with us today and wish you all the best, and we look forward to seeing everybody again either over the course of this quarter or at the latest 90 days from now. Thanks so much, everybody.\nOperator: Thank you for attending today's conference, and have a nice day.",

            "name": "Craig Lampo",
            "content": "Good afternoon, everyone. This is Craig Lampo, Amphenol's CFO, and I'm here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO. We would like to welcome you to our first quarter 2022 conference call. Our first quarter results were released this morning. I will provide some financial commentary and then Adam will give an overview of the business and current strategies, then we will take questions. As a reminder, during the call, we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures and make certain forward-looking statements, so please refer to the relevant disclosures in our press release for further information. In addition, as previously announced, effective January 1, 2022, we aligned our businesses into three new reportable segments. Effective for the first quarter of 2022, we are reporting results for these new segments as well as the relevant comparable historical financial data. The company closed the first quarter with sales of $2.95 billion and GAAP and adjusted diluted EPS of $0.68 and $0.67, respectively. First quarter sales were up 24% in US dollars, 25% in local currencies and 17% organically compared to the first quarter of 2021. The significant sales increase was driven by double digit organic growth in the IT data communications, commercial air, industrial, automotive and broadband markets as well as contributions from the company's acquisition program. Sequentially, sales were down by just 2% in US dollars and in local currencies and down 4% organically. Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes. Orders for the quarter were a record $3.441 billion, which is up 26% compared to the first quarter of 2021 and up 5% sequentially, resulting in a strong book-to-bill ratio of 1.17:1. GAAP and adjusted operating income was $590 million in the first quarter and operating margin was a strong 20% in the first quarter of 2022, which increased by 40 basis points compared to the prior year quarter. Sequentially, adjusted operating margins declined by only 10 basis points, which is significantly better than we typically see in the first quarter. The year-over-year increase in operating margin was primarily driven by normal operating leverage on higher sales volumes as well as the benefit of ongoing pricing actions. These benefits were partially offset by the impact of the more challenging commodity and supply chain environment, together with the slight margin dilution of acquisitions completed over the past year. On a sequential basis, the slight decrease in adjusted operating margin reflected normal conversion on the lower sales volumes, slightly offset by the benefit of ongoing pricing actions, which became effective in the quarter. Given the dynamic overall cost and supply chain environment, we are very proud of the company's operating performance. Our team's ability to effectively manage through the myriad of challenges around the world is a direct result of the strength of the company's entrepreneurial culture, which continues to foster a high performance, action oriented management team. GAAP diluted EPS was $0.68 in the first quarter, an increase of 28% compared to $0.53 in the prior year period, and adjusted diluted EPS was $0.67, an increase of 29% compared to the $0.52 in the first quarter of 2021. This was an excellent result, especially considering the significant cost, supply chain and other operational challenges the company continued to face during the quarter. The company's GAAP effective tax rate for the first quarter was 23.8% and the adjusted effective tax rate was 24.5%, which compared to 23.9% and 24.5% in the first quarter of 2021, respectively. Bringing down first quarter results into our three new segments. Relative to the first quarter of 2021, sales in the Harsh Environment Solutions segment were $728 million and increased 16% in US dollars and organically. Operating margins in the quarter for the segment was 25.2%. Sales in the Communications Solutions segment was $1.320 billion and increased 28% in US dollars and 21% organically. Operating margin in the quarter for the segment was 21.4%. Sales in the Interconnect & Sensor Systems segment were $904 million and increased 25% in US dollars and 13% organically and operating margin in the quarter for the segment was 17.7%. Operating cash flow in the first quarter was $351 million or 83% of adjusted net income. Net of capital spending, our free cash flow was $274 million or 65% of adjusted net income. Cash flow in the quarter was a bit lower than we would normally expect even in a typically weaker first quarter, primarily due to a higher than normal increase in inventory levels, driven by the continued challenging supply chain environment. From a working capital standpoint, days sales outstanding and payable days were 74 and 57 days, respectively, both within a normal range. Inventory days were 88, which are slightly elevated due to the normal Q1 seasonality as well as the challenging supply chain reasons just mentioned. Our management teams are focused on reducing these inventory levels, although given the challenging environment, this may take a couple of quarters. During the quarter, the company repurchased 2.6 million shares of common stock at an average price of $78. And when combined with our normal quarterly dividend, total capital returned to shareholders in the first quarter of 2022 was more than $320 million. Total debt at March 31st was $4.9 billion and net debt was $3.6 billion. And total liquidity at the end of the quarter was $2.9 billion, which included cash and short-term investments on hand of $1.3 billion plus availability under existing credit facilities. First quarter 2022 GAAP EBITDA was $699 million. And at the end of the first quarter of 2020, our net leverage ratio is 1.3 times. I will now turn the call over to Adam, who will provide some commentary on current market trends. I mean, we talked about this a little bit coming into the quarter in January. We certainly saw some pressures from the cost environment as everybody has. And I think we did a great job in 2021 really protecting against that through pricing and then certainly other actions as well. And we talked about in the fourth quarter where our margins were a bit lower than we did expect coming into the first quarter. Some improvement in profitability as we kind of reflected in our guidance and our implied guidance that our profitability improved from pricing actions starting to take hold, and that's exactly what we saw. I think the team has done a fabulous job of ensuring that they were taking the actions they needed to. There's no doubt we're in an inflationary environment. And there's a lot of difficult conversations that we're having with customers on a frequent basis. This isn't something that's happening just on annually anymore. This is something that's happening on probably a monthly basis or maybe even sometimes more frequent than that as we continue to see costs rise. And I think the team has done a great job with that. We don't do any hedging. We don't talk -- hedging is something that we typically don't do other than maybe FX hedging or things of that nature. But certainly, as it relates to commodity costs, we don't do any of that. So that certainly has no impact on our margins. But certainly, the pricing actions we've taken with our customers are starting to take hold here in the first quarter. We're expecting that to continue into the second quarter in our implied guidance of our margins continuing to improve a bit here into the second quarter. And I'm certainly real proud of the team. I mean the inflationary environment has gotten worse here in the first quarter and we certainly don't expect it to get any better in the second quarter. So the ability of our team to continue to protect them not only protect the margins, but starting to expand the margins a bit and starting to basically offset -- more than offset some of the cost environment is certainly great to see and we're going to continue to work hard to do the same thing as the inflationary environment continues. I'll take this one, at least the first part of it. Yes, certainly, you're right. We have -- there's a range in margins of our segments. I mean I don't think that's so surprising. I mean we have 130 businesses. And you can't imagine that some of them are above the company average and some of them are certainly below the company average. And our businesses are typically based on product technologies that have application across many different markets. I mean we're very diversified from a market perspective. And one of the things we try to do for all of our businesses to apply our products amongst those -- proliferate our products amongst all the markets in which they have the -- they can add value. And that, I think, has been the strength of the company and certainly has driven growth over the years. So that's the same as our segments. We didn't -- our segments aren't a market focused segments. Our segments are product focused segments for the most part that does serve many different markets. So certainly, there's no correlation from a market perspective. I guess mention is that there is -- in our communication solutions market, there is the broadband and mobile device markets are typically -- or the vast majority of those markets are served by that segment. But other than those, the rest of the six segments effectively are broad based amongst all of our segments. And as it relates to margin, as I mentioned, that some operations are above and some of it are below. I don't think there's really much to draw from in terms of the the profitability from -- again, from a market or necessarily from a specific business perspective. I think that when I think about the segments, clearly, over time, we spend a lot of time on the businesses that have the lower profitability, including certainly acquisitions. The Interconnect and Sensor Systems segment has a couple more acquisitions, recent acquisitions in it, specifically MTS, which did drive actually the year-over-year reduction kind of in the margin in that particular business. So as you can imagine, we're working, as we talked about with those businesses to drive up the profitability over time. But I think that we don't have margin or conversion margin targets by segment, but we certainly do an overall company level, that hasn't changed and we talked about the 25% conversion margin. As you can imagine, the higher profitability businesses are going to convert possibly a little bit higher than the lower profitability businesses. But ultimately, our goal is to drive profitability up in all of our businesses and ultimately, all of our segments over time. But I wouldn't necessarily point out anything specific that's driving that significant margin differences other than that's kind of how the businesses ultimately were segmented for management reporting purposes."

            "name": "Adam Norwitt",
            "content": "Well, thank you very much, Craig, and it's my pleasure also to welcome everybody here for our first quarter earnings call. And first and foremost, I hope that everybody here today, together with your family, friends and colleagues are managing to stay safe and healthy as the world comes to some degree of normalcy. Again, I also wanted to just offer our thoughts to the people of Ukraine, who are obviously going through this very difficult time period with the unfortunate war. While we don't have operations in the Ukraine, we do have many employees of Ukrainian descent and our hearts are clearly with them together with their families and friends. As Craig mentioned, we wanted to highlight or I'm going to highlight some of our first quarter achievements. I'll then spend a few moments to discuss our trends and our progress across our served markets. And then finally, I'm going to comment on our outlook for the second quarter. And of course, we'll then have time for questions at the end. As Craig mentioned, we drove results in the first quarter that were substantially beyond our original expectations, exceeding the high end of our guidance in sales as well as adjusted diluted earnings per share. Sales grew a very strong 24% in US dollars and 25% in local currencies, reaching $2.952 billion. And on an organic basis, our sales increased by 17% with growth across nearly all of our end markets and that was driven particularly by double digit growth in the IT datacom, commercial air, industrial, automotive and broadband markets, and I'll talk about each of those in a few moments. The company booked a record $3.441 billion in orders in the first quarter, and this represented another very strong book-to-bill this time 1.17:1. And despite continuing to face substantial inflationary pressures and supply chain disruptions, our operating margins reached 20.0% in the quarter, which was a 40 basis point increase from last year's levels. We're very encouraged by the strong profitability performance for the company, and we see that as a clear sign that our local management teams are successfully managing through this challenging cost environment. Diluted EPS in the quarter grew a robust 29% from prior year to $0.67, again, an excellent reflection of our continued strong execution. The company also generated strong operating and free cash flow in the quarter of $351 million and $274 million, and that's despite all of the challenges that Craig alluded to. And again, another clear reflection of the high quality of the company's earnings. I'm just very proud of our team this quarter. These results once again reflect the discipline and agility of our entrepreneurial organization as we continue to perform well in a very dynamic and challenging environment. Now turning to our end markets. I would just comment that we continue to be very pleased that our end market exposure remains highly diversified, balanced and broad. And in particular, amidst these very dynamic times, this market diversification continues to create great value for Amphenol. Now starting with our military market represented 10% of our sales in the quarter. Sales grew by 7% from prior year and were up 1% organically with growth in space and avionics applications somewhat offset by moderations in our sales on to UAVs, naval and military vehicles. Sequentially, our sales decreased by 2%, which was just a hair below our expectations coming into the quarter. And looking now into the second quarter, we expect sales in the defense market to increase modestly from these first quarter levels. We continue to be very pleased with the strength of the company's position in the defense market, a market that has renewed importance given the current geopolitical environment. As militaries around the world continue to accelerate their adoption of next generation technologies, our industry leading breadth of high technology interconnect and sensor products positions the company strongly across essentially all major military programs. This gives us great confidence for our long term performance. The commercial air market represented 3% of our sales in the quarter. And sales in commercial air increased by a strong 42% from prior year and 28% organically as we benefited from the continued recovery in global aircraft production. Sequentially, our sales grew by a better-than-expected 8% from the fourth quarter. And as we look into the second quarter, while we do expect a sequential moderation of sales compared to these first quarter levels, we anticipate another quarter of year-over-year growth in commercial air. After two very challenging years in the air travel industry, we're encouraged by the strengthening of our ComAir business. As personal and business travel continues to recover, we look forward to benefiting from the company's strong interconnect and sensor technology position across a wide array of aircraft platforms as well as the next generation systems that are integrated into those planes. The industrial market represented 25% of our sales in the quarter, and we drove another quarter of excellent performance in the industrial market. Sales grew 31% in US dollars and 20% organically, and this was driven by robust growth across most of the segments within the industrial market. But we did see particular strength in battery and electric heavy vehicle applications, factory automation and oil and gas, as well as the benefits of several of the acquisitions that we've done over the last year. On a sequential basis, sales were down just 1% from the fourth quarter, which was better than our expectations coming into this quarter. Looking into the second quarter, we expect sales in the industrial market to increase moderately from current levels. So this first quarter confirmed once again that our outstanding global team working in the industrial market continues to find new opportunities for growth across the many segments of this exciting market. I remain confident that our long term strategy to expand our high technology interconnect antenna and sensor offering, both organically and through complementary acquisitions, has positioned us well to capitalize on the many revolutions happening across the industrial electronics market. We look forward to realizing the benefits of this strategy for many years to come. The automotive market represented 20% of our sales in the quarter, and sales grew by 17% in US dollars and organically with our growth, driven once again by the strength of our sales into electric and hybrid electric vehicle applications. Sequentially, sales increased by 5% from the fourth quarter which is actually much better than our expectations of a high single digit decline. And this just reflected strong execution by our team working in the automotive market. For the second quarter, we expect a modest sequential decline in sales as customers manage through a wide array of supply chain challenges in the global automotive market. I remain extremely proud of our team working across the automotive market. They continue to manage through a difficult supply chain environment all while remaining laser focused on driving new design wins with customers who are implementing a wide array of new technologies into their vehicle platforms. Our continued outperformance is a direct result of that team's excellent efforts. The mobile devices market represented 10% of our sales in the quarter. Sales increased by 7% from prior year, with strength in tablets, smartphones, wearables as well as laptops. Sequentially, our sales decline was less than we had expected, declining 27% from the fourth quarter. As we look into the second quarter, we now anticipate a low double digit sequential sales decline from these levels, driven by typical seasonality, as well as by some impact from the recent COVID-related shutdowns that have been occurring and continue to occur in China. There's no question that mobile devices remains our most volatile of end markets. Nevertheless, our outstanding and agile team is poised as always to capture any opportunities for incremental sales that may arise in 2022 and beyond. Our leading array of antennas, interconnect products and mechanisms continues to enable a broad range of next generation mobile devices, positioning us well for the long term. The mobile networks market represented 5% of our sales in the first quarter and sales in this market grew from prior year by a stronger-than-expected 14% in U.S. dollars and 5% organically as strength from products sold directly to network operators, together with the benefit of acquisitions more than offset a moderation of our sales to equipment OEMs. Sequentially, our sales in the first quarter were flat to the levels that we achieved in the fourth quarter. As we look into the second quarter, we expect a modest decline from these first quarter levels. Nevertheless, we're encouraged to see continued strength in our sales to the mobile networks market. As operators continue to ramp up their investments in next-generation systems, our team remains focused on realizing the benefits of our efforts to expand our position in next-generation 5G equipment and networks around the world. We look forward, especially to benefiting from the increased potential that comes from our unique position with both equipment manufacturers and mobile service providers. The information technology and data communications market represented 22% of our sales in the quarter. Sales were stronger than expected in IT datacom, rising by a very robust 41% in US dollars and 35% organically from prior year as our teams capitalized on broad based strength across server and networking applications. And in particular, we saw continued robust growth of our sales to web service provider and data center operator customers. We were pleased that sales moderated by just 2% sequentially in the first quarter, which was better than our expectations coming into Q1. Looking to the second quarter, we expect sales to increase in the mid-single digits from these first quarter levels as customer demand continues to grow in IT datacom. We remain encouraged by the company's outstanding position in this important market. Our OEM and web service provider customers continue to drive their equipment and networks to ever higher levels of performance in order to manage the dramatic increases in demand for bandwidth and processor power. We look forward to realizing the benefits of our leading position for many years to come. The broadband market represented 5% of our sales in the quarter. And sales in this market also grew by a very strong 47% from prior year and 12% organically, as broadband spending levels increased and as we benefited from our recent acquisitions. On a sequential basis, sales increased by a much better-than-expected 30% from the fourth quarter. And we're pleased, in particular, to start to see some progress in pricing actions across this market. In the second quarter, we expect sales to the broadband market to increase modestly from these levels. And we look forward to continuing to support our broadband service provider customers around the world with our expanded range of high technology products. As our customers increase the bandwidth and capacity of their networks to support the expansion of high speed data applications to both homes and businesses, our products have become even more critical. Now turning to our outlook for the second quarter. The current market environment remains highly uncertain with ongoing supply chain and inflationary challenges being in many ways exacerbated by both the war in Ukraine, as well as the continued impact of the pandemic, which is causing shutdowns in certain geographies, most notably in China. Assuming conditions do not meaningfully worsen and also assuming, of course, constant exchange rates, for the second quarter, we expect sales in the range of $2.890 billion to $2.950 billion and adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $0.66 to $0.68. These expectations would represent strong sales growth of 9% to 11% and adjusted diluted EPS growth of 8% to 11% versus the second quarter of last year. I just have to say that I remain confident in the ability of our outstanding management team to adapt to the many opportunities and challenges that are still present in the marketplace and to continue to grow our market position while expanding the company's profitability. In addition, our organization remains committed to delivering long term sustainable value, all while prioritizing the continued safety and health of each of our employees around the world. And I'd just like to take this opportunity at the end here to thank all of those employees, more than 90,000 of them around the world, the entire Amphenol team, for their truly outstanding efforts here in the first quarter. And with that, operator, we'd be very happy to take any questions that there may be. I mean, look, relative to our own supply and demand, there's no doubt about it that our team is navigating lots of things in China. And I just have to take a moment to really reflect on how extraordinary they have managed through the first quarter, because some of these disruptions, they already have started well into the first quarter. And the fact that our team was able to drive the results that they did across the board and including in China is a real testament to the reactivity, the agility, the fortitude of our team there because these lockdowns are really quite something. We have employees who are sort of locked in their apartment in Shanghai for four or five weeks. We have factories that have had to operate in bubbles and things like this. And it's just extraordinary how the team has managed through this. But no doubt about it. I mean we see some impact. It's not a massive impact here in the quarter, but there is some impact here in the quarter. And I specifically talked about the impact that we see in mobile devices which is the one market that has the highest exposure to China. So it shouldn't be surprising that, that's one where there's maybe a little more magnitude of impact, both with customers and their demand and the supply chain and our own abilities to reach really full levels of production. But our team is doing a fabulous job and I think that they will manage through this. And I'm very confident that China as a country is going to manage through this. No question in my mind. Relative to customers holding more inventory, I think that whole concept of just in time has in many ways over the last two years been a little bit replaced by to find a cliche, just in case. And no doubt, we have customers who are looking at lots of ways to balance risk in their supply chain. I think their first choice is not just to put inventory on the shelves, but rather to look to their supplier partners, companies like us and say, what can we do to create diversification in the supply base, such that they don't have all their eggs in one basket. And no doubt, we've done a lot of work over these couple of years through the pandemic, through the supply chain crisis, through the logistics crisis, whatever that may be, to demonstrate to our customers and ultimately to deliver to our customers a kind of multiplicity of options of supply that thereby minimize their risk. But beyond that, are customers kind of opening up their order window a little more, I think we would say, yes, are customers putting a little more inventory on the shelf. There, I can only speak with anecdotal evidence, because we don't have great visibility into the warehouses and the inventory levels of our OEM or service provider customers. The one where we do have visibility, which is our distribution channel, I would actually say that inventory levels there are even a little low in many of the relationships that we have and certainly not at levels that one would think are reflective of some sort of risk aversion. So I think customers are doing a lot of things here. Is the odd customer carrying a little bit more inventory, it wouldn't surprise me if that were the case. I mean, look, I don't know that we've seen any meaningful difference in the M&A environment. I would tell you the M&A environment is very robust. Our pipeline is as strong as ever. As you know, over the last two and half years, we closed on a large number of deals, including last year, just the extraordinary progress that we made in our M&A program with very significant deals like MTS and at the end of the year, Halo, as well as the number of wonderful tuck-in companies, tuck-in deals that then ultimately strengthen our position across a wide array of our end markets. And I think that we continue to see among companies that we talk to, I don\u2019t know if it's a general willingness -- increased willingness, but our reputation is a wonderful home for their companies, that continues to strengthen over time. And so there's no doubt about it that our phone continues to ring. We continue to to create that sort of organic pipeline of acquisitions. And not a week goes by where Craig and I don't hear of some new company that we had never heard of. At the same time, we have very high standards. And so to the point that if companies are kind of coming out of the wood work, we're not just saying yes to every one of these. We hold very, very high standards around our acquisition program. And that includes looking for great people with great products who have complementary market position. And that is never going to be something that we compromise and nor do we ever compromise on valuation because at the end of the day, whether the stock market is higher or the stock market is low, we pay fair value for great companies. And we pay a value that\u2019s really based on what they have delivered and not what the company can become as part of Amphenol. In terms of our willingness to do larger deals, I would just let our history speak almost for itself here. I mean, for sure, we have the wherewithal to do an enormous number of deals, and that includes deals large and small. I would say that the evolution of our organization, one of the benefits of that is really also opening up the bandwidth across the company so that we have capacity to either do more deals or bigger deals, both of which we kind of arithmetically need to do if we want acquisitions to continue to represent roughly a third of our growth over the long term, which is what we continue to target. So I think the M&A landscape remains a very positive driver for Amphenol. And I think the strategy of complementing our superior organic growth with adding excellent companies is something that has created enormous value for the company past and we'll continue to do so going forward. And Steve, you're never missing any boats. So I wouldn't say that. Look, we're just -- our IT datacom business and the operations within Amphenol who are serving that end market have just done a phenomenal job over the last two years on several fronts. Number one, it's developing the products that our customers need. And I think the innovation in this market is so critical because our customers are under enormous pressure, enormous pressure to satisfy this kind of unquenchable thirst among consumers for bandwidth, and at the other side, the kind of unquenchable thirst for power that these data centers create. And so where we've seen the real innovations is happening around high speed interconnect across the board, as well as in the power interconnect that goes to drive the efficiency of these systems in a way that ultimately these data centers don't become such [positive] of energy. And I think on both of those fronts, we just continue to see this immutable march forward and drive for customers to really push the limits of technology, and that's something where our engineers are just really excelling. Whether it's designing the latest high speed interconnects such that we can stretch the ability of copper interconnect far beyond what people ever thought was possible and thereby saving both cost as well as power consumption and the design resources of our customers to designing really complex power interconnects that ultimately reduce the power consumption of these data centers and make them more efficient. There's a lot of work going on there. At the same time, coupled with those great products, has been our consistent, and I will say, really consistent through this whole cycle of the pandemic, ability to satisfy the needs of our customers even when those needs change dramatically in a moment's notice. And that responsiveness and the fact that we never let our customers down, while others were consistently letting them down, has meant that our customers come to us more and more and give to us maybe a disproportionate share of their needs because they know that we're there for them when they need us the most. I remember so clearly, in the second quarter of 2020 going all the way back to kind of the beginning of the pandemic, when everybody started going on to video calls and video meetings and the bandwidth just kind of exploded and people were watching over-the-top video at home, Netflix and other things like that. And our customers came to us with not just marginal increases in demand but multiples of increase of demand, and we just figured out a way to make it happen. And that's the entrepreneurial reactivity of Amphenol that we talk about so often. And I think the customers in IT datacom have been real beneficiaries of that. And we've been recognized by our customers, not just with more share but with more supplier awards than I can remember in my entire career, over this time period, recognition from those customers, both OEMs and service providers that Amphenol really differentiated ourselves in terms of our reactivity and our reactions. What's that market going to be going forward? I think the demand for bandwidth does not seem to abate. Are we always going to grow by 35% organically in the quarter? I don't know that I would go out and commit to that. But I think our team has done a great job positioning us to outperform for a long time to come. I did make that mention, and we think some portion of our organic growth, certainly not the totality, but some portion is a credit to our teams, long term and very challenging efforts on pricing. I mean the thing about our traditional broadband business, as you know, is it has a very high material content but it hasn't always had a very rational competitive landscape. And so I think what we're starting to see now is the severity of the inflation has really woken up the other participants in the market that there needs to be some reasonable sharing of that inflation with customers, and we've always been at the forefront of that. I've said for many, many years that we don't let the sun set on a pricing action from our peers in order to match that and to keep up with these inflationary pressures. And I think we've taken maybe even more of a leadership position over the course of the last year or so. And we're pleased to see some signs of maybe a little bit more discipline in that market that didn't traditionally have as much discipline. And it is a market where the inflation has a disproportionate impact because of the higher material content, the raw material content, things like plastics and metals and the like. And so we're hopeful, it's certainly not a kind of fully told story here but we're encouraged to start to see a little bit more progress in pricing in that market. And I would use the same adjectives as you that it is a sad situation what is happening in Ukraine, tragic in many respects. But I would also tell you that we're proud of the role that our company has played, both in supporting refugees coming from the Ukraine and some of the neighboring countries where we have operations. Not only supporting them monetarily but also providing jobs to some. I mean, this has been a real initiative by our team to support these people who have really had their livelihoods crushed. And at the same time, I think we've all witnessed the power of defense and that some of these new technologies that we have talked about for so many years have real importance in people's lives to keep a country safe in the face of what I think many would consider unreasonable aggression. So I wouldn't want to comment on specific conversations that we have in the defense industry. You can imagine that that's not something that we would want to do. But I think we're encouraged for the long term to see that many countries are waking up to the fact that maybe the defense budgets should be calibrated a little bit better to the level of threat that may very well exist in the world in order to keep the peace loving people of the world more secure. And that can translate into overall spending and it can translate long term into an acceleration of adoption of technologies. I've talked for a long time about the kind of difference in the defense industry between the more tactical defense spending and the more strategic defense spending. And I think, Jim, you've covered us probably as long as anyone and you've heard that theme before. And I think what we're seeing here is, no doubt about it, a shift of market and relatively rapid shift in the focus of countries, especially those countries in NATO towards an emphasis of strategic defense. And whenever you start talking about strategic defense, you immediately start to talk about technology. You talk about radar, you talk about missile defense. You talk about all of the things that electronics can do to protect people in their homes and in their sovereign nations. And I think Amphenol has played a leading role over the years in being an enabler of those kind of next-generation electronic defense systems. And so to the extent that this tragic and unfortunate conflict does drive an even greater focus among NATO countries. We certainly sit as the leader in the military interconnect market in a position to really help those countries to help the companies that are supporting that initiative in really adopting next-generation technology to protect all of the citizens of these sovereign countries. And relative to your question on M&A, Wamsi, no question, we have a propensity to look for acquisitions across every one of our markets and across all of our 3 now segments as we call them. We're not at all going to kind of direct our resources strategically towards one or another. They all have -- it's an equal opportunity resource for all of them. And to the extent that we find strong acquisitions with the criteria that I alluded to earlier, we're very aggressive and happy to make those acquisitions regardless of which segment it's in. I mean it's interesting. When we look across all of our end markets in terms of our book-to-bill, we had pretty strong books-to-bill across really all of our end markets with the exception of mobile devices where it's always kind of one-to-one, and I think broadband was also relatively flat book-to-bill. But all the other markets had pretty robust books to bill. And I would say maybe automotive was even a little below the average, but still a strong, more than one book-to-bill. And I don't know that I would draw any conclusions about automotive and the past performance or the trajectory based on those bookings. I think what I would just highlight again is that our performance in automotive has been really consistently outperforming the end market, whatever the end market is. Lots of people take lots of different cuts at what is end market performance units or whatever it is. But for sure our growth in this quarter where we achieved 17% growth that was on the heels of last quarter where we grew 18%, the quarter before, 31%. The quarter before that was even this kind of crazy number of more than 100%. And I just think that it's a reflection of the dynamics that I have talked about earlier and before, which is the higher content that we see on next-generation platforms. In particular, we've seen a market increase in the adoption of electrification, electrified drivetrains, and our team has done a fabulous job to position themselves in that area. And we're doing that really across the globe, really broadly from a geographical perspective. And then all the other new electronic systems that are coming into cars where we're not necessarily taking share from out of one pocket, but we are maybe getting a little more than our fair share of these new things because of our reactivity to the customers and the appropriateness and the breadth of the technology that we can offer from the interconnect products, connectors, value-add interconnect products, sensors and antennas. And so I think our position in automotive, while certainly we're not the biggest in the automotive interconnect space far from it, but I think our performance has really been differentiated because of our ability to really capture a little bit more than our fair share of these new things. I don't think we put an exact number on the COVID shutdowns, and we don't plan to I think we -- it's not like a massive impact. It's also hard to count it. I mean every day it's changing a little bit, but there's certainly some impact, And I think I mentioned earlier, we see it most in the mobile devices, but we see it in a few other markets as well, like automotive and IT datacom and industrial. In terms of the linearity of bookings, our first quarter, we saw pretty good strength through the quarter. I mean, February is a short month of sort of Chinese New Year, but we finished the quarter really strong and bookings in March were really strong indeed. And April, we're still three days away from the end, so I couldn't even give you a number if I wanted to, but we'll see how it goes here in April. I mean would I expect a 1.17:1 book-to-bill here in the second quarter? I don't think I would expect that. I didn't expect it coming into the first quarter and we had very strong bookings. But I don't expect that here in the second quarter, but we'll see. I think customers still have quite a propensity to give us business new and existing, and that's translating into very robust orders for quite a number of quarters here. Look, it's hard to sort of pinpoint it because at the end of the day, why does the customer give us an order in any given moment? I mean, there's an enormous number of factors that go into that all along the spectrum, from the technology that we offer, the reliability of our delivery to that customer, our quality, our support, the breadth of our relationship, obviously, the price that\u2019s something that no customer wants to ever forget about. And so as you build over a long term a sustainable advantage with customers, it's all about continuing to just add to each of those factors further reason for customers to place an order to you and not to your competitor. And I think over the last two years -- look, over a long time, that's always our focus. How do we have a little bit better product? How do we have a little bit better quality? How do we have a little bit better credibility of delivery? How do we have a more competitive cost by going to low-cost countries and the like? But what has changed over these two years is there's a new factor that customers are considering and that is risk. And I will tell you that over many years, I've been -- now I'm in my 24th year in this company and my 14th year as CEO, I think customers underaccounted for risk in many cases because it was just easy to say, well, here's the price and the quality is good and it's the right product. And we don't really need to think about all these kind of black swan events that may or may not happen. And by the way, that was true through earthquakes and tsunamis, that was true through volcanos in Iceland and floods in Thailand and all these things. But something about the last two years has caused them really to wake up to think about the real risk of their supply chain. And when they do that and they look at the landscape of competitors, they look at a small company and they see risk. They look at a centralized company, and they see risk. But when they look at Amphenol and they look at our decentralized, very fragmented, very global, we have more than, what, something like 250 factories around the world, which is a lot more than most companies of our size. There, they see not risk, but actually opportunity. And I think that, that change has been just another factor that didn't exist in the past. And where does it manifest? I mean I think it does manifest to some degree in our outperformance and then the continuation of our outperformance. As it relates to M&A, I think there is actually also an advantage because if you're a small company, and you've been through this kind of rubicon of challenges that we've all faced over these couple of years, being part of a bigger company that gives you more options of where you can make stuff and where you can source stuff and where you can sell stuff, so that starts to be a pretty compelling thing to think about, if you really truly care about the company that you as an entrepreneur have built. And so I think that can also have an advantage. I think there's advantages that sort of go throughout the business. And it's, again, why we're so religious about our adherence to the culture of Amphenol, that unique entrepreneurial culture, which has served us in good times and bad. And I think the value of it has been more enhanced over these last couple of years than really ever before. No doubt about it. Our team working and industrial market has just been consistently outstanding in their performance. I mean, since the kind of acute phase of COVID in Q1 of 2020, at least in Asia, we've posted consistently strong double-digit year-over-year growth every quarter since then. So we just did our eighth straight quarter in industrial of strong double-digit growth, and it's really a testament to their efforts. And as you pointed out, it's a very broad market. It's everything from advanced medical equipment to next-generation agricultural equipment, to high-speed rail, to semiconductor manufacturing equipment, to heavy equipment, to electrification of heavy vehicles and battery technology, battery storage, where we see just a lot of opportunities to enable a real myriad of customers who are developing next-generation energy storage systems and they want our sensors, they want our connectors. They want everything. I mean these applications are really all over the place. And they all go on somewhat different cycles, I should say. But at the end of the day, they have one thing in common, which is it is the adoption of electronics into harsh environments, into areas where those electronics otherwise should not really be able to operate. And that is a legacy that we have of many, many decades of building up the capability of packaging interconnect and sensors for harsh environments, which now means putting highly computerized autonomous driving systems on tractors, and now means putting next-generation sensor technologies and alternative energy devices and monitoring of wind mills and things like this. I mean, I could go on and on and on. And amidst the uncertain global macro, you have the certainty of the continued onward and upward march of the adoption of electronics. So I'm not going to say that we're going to grow every quarter here in perpetuity by these outstanding amounts. No, I mean, I wouldn't expect that we're going to grow by 31% every quarter going forward. But I do believe that the opportunity to outperform here remains very strong and that the breadth of our industrial product technologies is really second to none, and I think that positions us well for the future. I mean we're not guiding necessarily to growth by segment. I think we gave a lot of details by each of our end markets. But as you saw this quarter, I mean, the growth was pretty balanced across those segments. Now we had really broad growth across the company. So I wouldn't necessarily say that what we would expect by each segment going into here in the second quarter. I mean I don't know that there's a significant impact, Joe, from kind of the hot potato of people crossing semiconductors back and forth and deciding where they should put their -- which vehicles they should put them in and thereby which they should sell and prioritize. I mean, look, if our customers are building higher content cars, is that a good thing? Yes, I guess that would certainly be a good thing. But that should be a good thing for everybody in the market. And I think would that drive specifically our outperformance? I don't know that, that would necessarily be the case. I think really what we see, and I'll just reiterate it again, is we see just an acceleration of the adoption of next-generation systems across all vehicles, and that includes the electrified drivetrains that we mentioned, but not exclusively that. It's next-generation infotainment, next-generation communication, it's next-generation comfort, passenger comfort, it's next-generation connectivity in the cars, it's everything from sensors that keep the HVAC systems running better and being safer for the people inside. I mean, you think about like going through a respiratory-borne illness pandemic and all of a sudden, car companies want to have better HVAC filtration and sensing inside their cars. And that's a great new application that may not have existed kind of in the past. And so I think that's the bigger driver here than just that some car companies are making more tactical decisions about which models to produce based on constrained availability of certain components. Well, thank you very much to everybody. I think that's our last question. And I do want to take this opportunity, once again, to thank you all for spending a few of your precious time -- a few of your precious minutes with us today and wish you all the best, and we look forward to seeing everybody again either over the course of this quarter or at the latest 90 days from now. Thanks so much, everybody."

Following today's presentation, there will be a formal question-and-answer session. Until then, all lines will remain in a listen-only mode. At the request of the company, today's conference is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now introduce your conference host, Mr. Craig Lampo, you may begin.\nCraig Lampo: Thank you very much. Good afternoon, everyone. This is Craig Lampo, Amphenol's CFO, and I'm here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO. We would like to wish everyone a Happy New Year, and welcome you to our fourth quarter of 2023 conference call. Our fourth quarter and full year 2023 results were released this morning. I will provide some financial commentary, and then Adam will give an overview of the business and current trends. Then we will take questions. As a reminder, during the call, we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures and make certain forward-looking statements. So please refer to the relevant disclosures in our press release for further information. The company closed the fourth quarter with sales of $3,327 million and record adjusted diluted EPS of $0.82. Fourth quarter sales were up 3% in U.S. dollars, 2% in local currencies and down 1% organically compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. Sequentially, sales were up 4% in U.S. dollars, 4% in local currencies and 2% organically. Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes. For the full year of 2023, sales were $12,555,000,000 down 50 basis points in U.S. dollars, flat in local currencies and down 3% organically compared to 2022. Orders in the quarter were $3,164,000,000, up 10% compared to the fourth quarter of 2022 and flat sequentially, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 0.95:1. For the full year, orders were $12,267,000,000, down 5% compared to 2022, resulting in a book-to-bill of 0.98:1. GAAP operating income and operating margin was $690 million and 20.7%, respectively, in the fourth quarter of 2023 which increased 10 basis points compared to both the fourth quarter of 2022 and the third quarter of 2023. Adjusted operating income was $706 million, which excluded $16 million in acquisition-related costs. Adjusted operating margin was 21.2% during the fourth quarter and a new quarterly record for the company. On an adjusted basis, operating margin increased by 30 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of 2022 and increased by 40 basis points sequentially. The year-over-year increase in adjusted operating margin was primarily driven by strong operating leverage on slightly higher sales levels as well as the benefit of pricing actions. These benefits were partially offset by the dilutive impact of recent acquisitions, most of which are currently operating below the corporate average. For the full year of 2023, GAAP operating income was $2.56 billion, which included $35 million of acquisition-related costs and excluding these costs, adjusted operating income was $2.594 million. For the full year of 2023, GAAP operating margin was 20.4% and adjusted operating margin was a strong 20.7%, consistent with our previous annual record margins achieved in 2022 and 2018. On a GAAP basis, operating margin decreased 10 basis points compared to 2022. Compared to 2022, adjusted operating margin was flat, which primarily was driven by strong operational performance as well as the benefit of pricing actions, partially offset by the dilutive impact of acquisitions. This was an impressive margin performance given the slight sales decline we experienced in 2023. Our team continued to execute well in the quarter, and we are proud to have sustained these healthy levels of profitability, despite the continued range of challenges around the world. Breaking down fourth quarter results by segment. Relative to the fourth quarter of 2022, sales in the Harsh Environment Solutions segment were $900 million and increased by 13% in U.S. dollars and 6% organically. Segment operating margin was 26.5%. Sales in the Communications Solutions segment were $1.345 billion and declined by 6% in U.S. dollars and 7% organically. Segment operating margin was 23.1%. Sales in Interconnect and Sensor Systems segment were $1.082 billion and increased by 7% in U.S. dollars and 2% organically. Segment operating margin was 18.5%. Breaking down full year results by segment relative to 2022, sales in the Harsh Environment Solutions segment were $3.531 billion, an increase by 14% in U.S. dollars and 9% organically, and segment operating margin was 26.7%. Sales in the Communications Solutions segment were $4.913 billion and declined by 13% in U.S. dollars and organically and segment operating margin was 21.6%. Sales in Interconnect and System \u2013 Sensor Systems segment were $4.111 billion, an increase by 6% in U.S. dollars and 3% organically and segment operating margin was 18.3%. The company's GAAP effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 22% and the adjusted effective tax rate was 24%, which compared to 19.2% and 24.5% in the fourth quarter of 2022, respectively. And for the full year of 2023, the company's GAAP effective tax rate was 20.7% and the adjusted effective tax rate was 24%, which compared to 22.3% and 24.5% in 2022, respectively. In 2024, we expect our adjusted effective tax rate to be approximately 24%. GAAP diluted EPS was $0.83 in the fourth quarter, up 1% compared to the prior year period, and on an adjusted basis, diluted EPS increased 5% to a record $0.82 compared to $0.78 in the fourth quarter of 2022. This was an excellent result. For the full year, GAAP diluted EPS was a record $3.11, a 2% increase from $3.06 in 2022. And adjusted diluted EPS was a record $3.01 in 2023, an increase from $3 in 2022. Operating cash flow in the fourth quarter was a record $842 million or 162% of adjusted net income. And net of capital spending, our free cash flow was a record $739 million or 142% of adjusted net income. We are pleased to have continued to deliver such a strong cash flow yield in the quarter and for the full year. In the full year, 2023 operating cash flow was a record $2.529 billion or 130% of adjusted net income. Net of capital spending, our free cash flow for 2023 was a record $2.160 billion or 111% of adjusted net income, a very strong result. From a working capital standpoint, inventory days, days sales outstanding and payable days were 85, 70 and 55 days, respectively, all within our normal levels. And during the quarter, the company repurchased 1.3 million shares of common stock at an average price of approximately $86 bringing total repurchases during 2023 to 7.2 million shares or $585 million. When combined with our normal quarterly dividend, total capital returned to shareholders in 2023 was $1.86 billion. Total debt on December 31 was $4.3 billion, and net debt was $2.7 billion. Total liquidity at the end of the quarter was $4.9 billion, which included cash and short-term investments on hand of $1.7 billion, plus availability under our existing credit facilities. Fourth quarter and full year 2023 EBITDA was $830 million and $3.1 billion, respectively. And at the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, our net leverage was 0.9 times. We are very pleased that the company's financial condition remains strong by any measure. I will now turn the call over to Adam, who will provide some commentary on current market trends.\nAdam Norwitt: Well, Craig, thank you very much and I'd like to extend my welcome to everybody on the phone here today. And I hope it's not too late to wish all of you a happy New Year here from Wallingford, Connecticut. As Craig mentioned, I'm going to highlight some of our achievements in the fourth quarter and also for the full year of 2023. I'll then discuss our trends and progress across our served markets. I'll make some comments on our outlook for the first quarter, and then, of course, we'll have time for questions. Our results in the fourth quarter were stronger than expected, exceeding the high end of our guidance in sales and adjusted diluted earnings per share. Sales grew by 3% in U.S. dollars, 2% in local currencies, reaching $3.327 billion. On an organic basis, our sales did decline by just 1%, with growth in commercial air, defense, automotive and IT Datacom markets offset by declines across our other end markets. The company booked $3.164 billion in orders in the fourth quarter. This was a 10% growth versus prior year and flat to last quarter, but did represent a book-to-bill of 0.98:1. We're very pleased to have delivered record adjusted operating margins of 21.2% in the quarter, a clear reflection of our team's outstanding execution and these margins increased 30 basis points from prior year and 40 basis points sequentially. Adjusted diluted EPS reached $0.82 in the quarter, representing a growth of 5% from prior year. I have to say that we were especially pleased that the company generated record operating and free cash flow of $842 million and $739 million, respectively, in the fourth quarter both just really clear reflections of the quality of the company's earnings. I come out of the fourth quarter, extremely proud of the Amphenol team. Our results this quarter once again reflect the discipline and agility of our entrepreneurial organization as we continue to perform well amidst the challenging and dynamic environment. We're also pleased that we announced this morning that we closed four acquisitions in the quarter, really in November and December. Based in Ohio, TPC Wire & Cable is a value-added provider of harsh environment, cable and cable assemblies for applications across the industrial market and this includes particularly factory automation and heavy equipment and TPC has annual sales of roughly $110 million. On headquartered in New Hampshire and with annual sales of approximately $90 million, Airmar is a leading provider of sensors for the recreational marine, commercial fishing and industrial markets. LID technologies based in Toulouse France has annual sales of approximately $40 million and LID is a high-technology supplier of sensor products to the industrial and automotive markets with a focus on tire pressure monitoring and the telematics associated with that. We also closed on the previously announced acquisition of PCTEL, a leading global provider of antennas for a broad array of markets, including in particularly the Internet of Things or industrial IoT market. PCTEL generated in 2023, approximately $85 million in sales. As we welcome these outstanding new teams to Amphenol, I remain confident that our acquisition program will continue to create great value for the company. In fact, our acquisition program was very successful in 2023 and our pipeline of prospective deals remain strong as we enter the new year. Indeed, we continue to see interesting near-term potential opportunities to bring outstanding and complementary organizations into the Amphenol family. Our ability to identify and execute upon acquisitions and then to successfully bring these companies into the Amphenol family remains a core competitive advantage for the company. As our organization has evolved and scaled, so too has our ability to effectively manage a greater number of acquisitions of all sizes. Now turning to the full year of 2023, despite the demand challenges that we did experience in certain end markets in the year, I have to say that the Amphenol team delivered another successful year of performance. Amidst significant organic declines in the communications end markets due to inventory builds in 2022 as well as the more recent moderations in demand in the industrial market. Our team was able to deliver overall sales that were only slightly down from prior year. This was a testament to the breadth and diversification of the company as well as our team's ability to capitalize in real time on opportunities for incremental sales across the entirety of our markets. Our full year 2023 adjusted operating margin of 20.7% was flat with our last year record levels in 2022 despite the organic sales decline. This excellent performance by our team allowed us to deliver adjusted diluted EPS of $3.01 which was just slightly above prior year levels. We also generated record operating and free cash flow of $2.529 billion and $2.160 billion, respectively, both confirmations of the company's superior execution and disciplined working capital management. Our acquisition program, which I just discussed really created a great value throughout the year with 10 new companies contributing annualized sales of more than $600 million joining Amphenol in 2023. These new acquisitions enhanced our position across a broad array of technologies while bringing outstanding and talented individuals into the Amphenol organization. We're excited that these companies represent expanded platforms for the company's future performance and have deepened our already strong bench of leaders around the world. In addition, in 2023, we bought back over 7 million shares under our share buyback program, and increased our quarterly dividend by 5%, and that represented a total return of capital to shareholders of nearly $1.1 billion. So while there continues to be a high level of volatility across the overall market environment in 2023, as we enter 2024, our agile entrepreneurial management team is confident that we have built further strength from which we can drive superior long-term performance. Now turning to the trends and our progress across our served markets. I would just comment that we remain very pleased that the company's end market exposure is still highly diversified, balanced and broad with no end market representing more than 25% of our sales in 2023. This market diversity helps to insulate us from the effect of any given market volatility, while also exposing us to the exciting revolutions happening across the electronics industry. Turning first to the defense market. Our sales represented 12% of our total in the fourth quarter and 11% for the full year 2023. Fourth quarter sales once again grew strongly from prior year, increasing by 18% in U.S. dollars and 17% in local currency. On an organic basis, sales in the defense market increased by 15%, with broad-based growth across virtually all defense applications, particularly strong in naval, helicopters, communications and airframe applications. Sequentially, our sales increased by a better-than-expected 4% from the third quarter. For the full year 2023, sales in the defense market grew by 20% in U.S. dollars in local currency and by 18% organically. This reflected our operational execution, as well as broad strength across most segments of the defense market, and that particularly related to naval, aircraft engine, helicopter, communications and space-related applications. Looking ahead, we expect sales in the first quarter to decline in the mid-single digits sequentially, and we remain very encouraged by the company's strengthened position in the defense market, where we continue to offer the industry's widest range of high-technology interconnect products. Amidst today's dynamic geopolitical environment, countries around the world are expanding their investments in both current and next-generation defense technologies, thereby increasing the long-term demand potential for Amphenol. We are well positioned to accelerate our new product development and increase our capacity to support this demand long into the future. The commercial air market represented 3% of our sales in the quarter and 4% of our sales for the full year 2023. In the fourth quarter, our sales grew by a very strong 25% in U.S. dollars and 23% in local currency and organically, and this was driven by broad-based strength across all aircraft applications. Sequentially, our sales grew by 1% from the third quarter, which was actually ahead of our expectations for a modest seasonal decline. For the full year 2023, sales increased by a very robust 36% in U.S. dollar local currency and organically, reflecting our strong design-in positions on a broad range of platforms, as well as broad-based demand across all aircraft applications. Looking into the first quarter, we expect sales to remain at these lofty fourth quarter levels. I'm truly proud of our team working in the commercial air market. With the ongoing recovery in travel and thus demand for jetliners, our efforts to strengthen our breadth of high-technology interconnect products, while diversifying our market position into next-generation aircraft are paying real dividends. We continue to see great long-term opportunities for expansion of our technology offering to this important market and look forward to realizing the benefits of those growth initiatives for many years to come. The industrial market represented 23% of our sales in the quarter and 25% of our sales for the full year. Our sales in the fourth quarter did decline by 4% in U.S. dollars, 5% in local currencies and 12% organically as growth that we realized in oil and gas, rail mass transit and marine applications was more than offset by moderations in demand in other segments, including battery and electric heavy vehicles, building automation, transportation and heavy equipment. In addition, our sales into the industrial distribution channel continued to be more muted than they were a year ago. On a sequential basis, sales grew by 1%, but that was driven primarily by acquisitions that we did close in the quarter. For the full year 2023, sales were flat in U.S. dollars in local currency and declined by 7% organically as the contribution from acquisitions was offset by weakness in instrumentation, battery and EV, and electric heavy vehicles, factory automation and heavy equipment applications in particular. Looking into the first quarter, we expect sales to remain at these levels as the benefit of recent acquisitions offset the modest organic sequential decline. Despite this near-term demand pause driven in particular by elevated inventory levels, both in the distribution channel as well as in certain end markets, I remain proud of our outstanding global team working in the industrial market. We are very excited by the additions of TPC, Airmar, LID and PCTEL, each of which adds complementary new interconnect sensor and antenna technologies to our industrial product offering. And I'm confident that our long-term strategy to expand our high-technology interconnect antenna sensor offering, both organically and through complementary acquisitions has positioned us to capitalize on the many revolutions that will no doubt continue to occur across the industrial electronics market. The automotive market represented 24% of our sales in the quarter and 23% of our sales for the full year. Sales in the fourth quarter grew by a robust 16% in U.S. dollars and 15% in local currency, and on an organic basis, our sales to the automotive market increased by 12%. That was really driven by broad-based strength across most automotive applications, including electric and hybrid electric vehicles. Sequentially, our automotive sales increased by 8%, which was better than our expectations coming into the quarter. For the full year 2023, I'm pleased that our sales increased by a strong 12% in U.S. dollars, 13% in local currency and 12% organically, and that reflected broad strength across the automotive market, including, in particular, next-generation electronics, for example, electric and hybrid drivetrains. Looking into 2024, we expect a high single-digit sequential seasonal moderation in sales in the first quarter from these levels. I'm truly proud of our team working in the automotive market. Their performance in 2023 is yet another confirmation of the benefits of their focus on driving new design wins with customers who are implementing a wide array of new technologies into their vehicles. It's really a multitude of applications, including electrified drivetrains, but not just that, many other applications. We look forward to benefiting from that strong position for many years to come. The mobile devices market represented 11% of our sales in the quarter and 10% of our sales for the full year 2023. Our fourth quarter sales moderated by 3% in U.S. dollars, local currency and organic as robust growth in smartphones was once again more than offset by declining sales into tablets, laptops and wearables. Sequentially, our sales increased by 9%, which was much better than our expectation coming into the quarter for a high single-digit decline. For the full year 2023, sales in the mobile devices market declined by 12% in U.S. dollars and 10% organically as strong growth in smartphones was more than offset by declines in other mobile device applications. Looking into the first quarter, we do anticipate a typical seasonal sequential decline of approximately 35%. While mobile devices will always remain one of our most volatile of markets, our outstanding and agile team is poised as always to capture any opportunities for incremental sales that may arise in 2024 and beyond. Our leading array of antennas, interconnect products and mechanisms continues to enable a broad range of next-generation mobile devices, which positions us well for the long term. The mobile networks market represented 3% of our sales in the quarter and 4% of our sales for the full year. Sales in this market declined from prior year by 26% in U.S. dollars, 27% in local currency and 34% organically, as we continue to manage through a broad-based reduction in spending by network operators and wireless equipment manufacturers. Sequentially, our sales decreased by 6%, which was in line with our expectations. For the full year, sales declined by 26% from prior year and 32% organically driven by the spending reductions that we've discussed throughout the year. Looking ahead, we expect a modest increase in sales from these fourth quarter levels. And despite this more challenging short-term wireless investment environment, our team continues to work aggressively to realize the benefits of our efforts, to expand our position in next-generation 5G equipment and networks around the world. When customers once again drive renewed wireless investments, we look forward to benefiting from the increased potential that comes from our position with both equipment manufacturers and mobile service providers. The information technology and data communications market represented 20% of our sales in the quarter and 19% of our sales for the full year. We're very pleased that our sales in the fourth quarter returned to growth compared to prior year, with sales in U.S. dollars and local currency increasing by 6% and organically by 5%. Sequentially, our sales increased by a much better-than-expected 6%. As we continue to benefit from our strong presence with AI data center customers as well as some overall improved demand. For the full year 2023, our sales in the IT Datacom market declined 13% in U.S. dollars and organically as strong demand for AI-related applications was more than offset by inventory adjustments that we saw amongst our traditional IT Datacom applications. Looking ahead, we do expect in the first quarter a mid single-digit sequential seasonal decline in sales. I have to say coming out of what was a challenging year in the overall IT Datacom market that we're more encouraged than ever by the company's position in this space. Our team continues to do an outstanding job securing future business on next-generation IT systems, particularly those enabling artificial intelligence. Indeed, the revolution in AI has created a unique opportunity for Amphenol given our leading high-speed power and fiber optic interconnect products. With machine learning driving a more intensive usage of these highest technology interconnect products, we are very well positioned for the future. This creates a continued long-term growth opportunity for Amphenol. The broadband communications market represented 4% of our sales in the quarter and 4% for the year. Sales in the fourth quarter were down 31%, in U.S. dollars and 32% organically, as broadband operators continued to moderate their procurement levels. On a sequential basis, sales did decline by 12%, which was worse than our expectations coming into the quarter when we anticipated more of a modest increase. For the full year 2023, sales were down by 7% in U.S. dollars and organically, driven by the continued pause in broadband operator spending. Looking ahead, we expect sales in the first quarter to increase modestly from these levels. Regardless of the current demand dynamics, we do remain encouraged by the company's strengthened position in the broadband market. We look forward to continuing to support our service provider customers around the world, all of whom are working to increase their network coverage and bandwidth to support the proliferation of high-speed data applications to homes and businesses. And finally, turning to our outlook. There's no doubt that the current economic environment remains somewhat uncertain. Assuming the continuation of these current market conditions and also assuming constant exchange rates, for the first quarter, we expect sales in the range of $3.4 billion to $3.1 billion and adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $0.71 to $0.73. This would represent sales growth of 2% to 4% and adjusted diluted EPS growth of 3% to 6% compared to the first quarter of 2023. I remain confident in the ability of our outstanding management team to adapt to the many opportunities and challenges in the current environment and to continue to grow Amphenol's market position, while driving sustainable and strong profitability over the long term. And finally, I just want to take this opportunity to thank our entire global team around the world, including all of those who work across our factories, touch our products, and ultimately deliver to our customers what they need. I'm just truly grateful for all of their outstanding efforts both here in the fourth quarter, but moreover, for the entirety of 2023, without them, we wouldn't be able to make it happen like we do. And with that, operator, we'd be very happy to take any questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first call is to Amit Daryanani with Evercore. You may go ahead.\nAmit Daryanani: Thanks. Good afternoon everyone. One question for me would be, can you sense on the weakness on the industrial market space you talked about seeing softness there, a little bit of inventory sell, I'm curious, is that stable versus what you saw like do you feel like it's getting worse as you head into 2024? And then you can talk about it, do you see the [technical difficulty]\nAdam Norwitt: Yes, Amit, I didn't perfectly hear the second part of your question. There's a little bit of a connection issue. But I think relative to your question, which was, is industrial stable versus 90 days ago. I mean, look, I think we came into the quarter with an expectation of kind of a modest reduction in sales, our sales -- we're essentially in the line with that. So I think it was kind of what we expected it to be. I would say that the book-to-bill in industrial was a bit weaker. I mean, if we think about why our book-to-bill was 0.95:1. I mean, the real driver for that was industrial on 1 side. And we did see in the IT Datacom market a little bit of a softer book-to-bill. But that that is really just a little bit more of an equalization from very high books to build that we've seen over the prior couple of quarters. So I don't think the IT data come book-to-bill is at all representative of the demand environment. But I think -- in the industrial market, we did see bookings a little softer than we had anticipated. I'm going to assume that your second question is how do we see that going forward? And where do we see that kind of cycle in industrial. And I think it's early to tell. I mean the beauty of our industrial business is it so broad. And so we're not levered on to one or another of the individual segments. And you know there are so many segments across the industrial market that we participate in. And we don't have any of those that are really disproportionate to our overall business. And we continue to see some of those segments areas like marine and oil and gas, rail mass transit, medical during the course of this year. They still had very robust demand. But no doubt about it, areas like factory automation, instrumentation, those are areas where we've seen more market reductions in demand and also more impact from the distribution channel. When is that going to be worked out in the distribution channel, the inventory, when does some of that demand return in some of those segments. I think it's a little too early to tell. And as we go through the course of this year, we'll try to give you a really good read on that. I mean as we look into here now in the first quarter, as I said in my prepared remarks, we do anticipate in the first quarter, a kind of a modest level, but really supported by the acquisitions that we've made. And on an organic basis, we see the first quarter, again, modestly down from our current levels. \nOperator: Next question comes from Asiya Merchant from Citigroup. You may go ahead.\nAsiya Merchant: Great. Hopefully, you can hear me clearly, and I don't have an echo, I will try. On IT Datacom market, if you guys on share some insight? Looks like this market is ramping up quite nicely for you guys. If you could elaborate a little bit on how you think about your wins in the AI segment and how you're able to ramp that into revenues going forward, especially given constraints on supply on the GPU side, how do you guys think you can ramp for AI for the remainder of the year? Thank you.\nAdam Norwitt: Yes. Well, thank you very much, and welcome to our call. I look forward to getting to meet you in person. We're really excited about the progress that the company has made in AI. And I just want to reflect on one aspect, which is that AI is not new to us. While the world over the course of the last year has sort of woken up to AI with the advent a year ago, November of ChatGPT and the sort of revolution of generative AI. Our team has been working on the interconnect architecture surrounding AI for a long, long time. And so it is only now that maybe there is this acceleration almost, you could call it even a kind of revolution or a goldrush around AI, but we've been building the capability, building the product capability, building the manufacturing capability and capacity to support that for a long time. And I think this year, one of the ways that we were able to maybe even get a disproportionate share of some of the more urgent demand was that we were very quick to flex our capacity in favor of customers who needed products and when they needed it. And I think our team has always showed the ability to have that agility in reacting to upticks of demand. And I think that this AI is no different. I'm really proud of our team and how they've done that. Looking forward, it's still too early to say, what does that, look like over the long-term. But there's no question in my mind that AI seems like something that is not such a small deal. It seems like something where there are real economics behind it, where large companies are making significant investments into AI and where ultimately our architecture, our interconnect architecture is a very critical component together with the chips that you alluded to. Now relative to shortages of chips, that's -- I mean, we hope that there are significant investments in chip manufacturing, because in our industrial business, we do supply a lot of interconnect products that go into the industry for semiconductor manufacturing. I don't think that we've necessarily seen that as a governor on our output or on our customers' demand right now. But we'll see. It's not something that would directly impact except that maybe customers, if they couldn't get enough chips, they would moderate their overall construction. But we haven't seen that yet. And I think our team is just doing a fabulous job dealing with the surge in demand that we saw this year. And it came at a time when overall IT demand was down. But in fact, some of the products were very different products. So it wasn't just that we were able to reallocate capacity from IT products that were not being consumed as much into these. There was a lot of new stuff that we had to do. And I think we did a really great job executing on that.\nOperator: Our next caller comes from Luke Junk with Baird. You may go ahead.\nLuke Junk: Great. Thanks for taking the question. Adam, just hoping you could comment on pricing dynamics into 2024, especially in which parts of the portfolio might look at as more normal with respect to price downs this year versus areas of the business that could be a laggard in that respect? And then the related question would just be, how you're feeling about delivering productivity of your supply chain and your operations to offset any price downs you might face this year. Thanks Adam.\nCraig Lampo: Hi Luke, its Craig. I'll take that one for Adam. I think as we think about pricing, 2023, certainly, we talked about the fact that we didn't necessarily -- we saw pricing coming back to normal. I mean, 2022 we talked a lot about pricing adjustments we are making to try to catch-up to inflation -- inflationary increases on costs that we saw. And I think that as we came into 2023, sequentially, we did a great job on the profitability, but that wasn't necessarily the pricing dynamics. That was more really just operational execution. And I think the pricing in 2023 and as we look into 2024 is, certainly a more normalized and that the price and cost environment is more balanced. I wouldn't say that the cost environment necessarily has decrease at all. I think there is certainly an elevated level of cost, but they're just not increasing at the pace that we saw a year ago. So from that perspective, I think the pricing environment is in more of a normal situation. And as we move into 2024, I don't necessarily think we're going to get necessarily the benefit of price. And historically, that's not something that we would see anyways. And typically, if you have a normal cost environment and normal price environment, I think you'll see kind of typical kind of margins and margin increases from a profitability perspective, we talk about 25% as being a typical target that we have in a normal environment. And I think as we move into 2024, I would expect that to be the case kind of sequentially as we move into it. So really happy with where we actually ended the year here at record operating levels. So we're really well positioned, I think, as we move into 2024. I mean if you look at our -- our margin improvements, I think that that's something that I'm really proud of the team to be able to actually execute so well during the year to get to these profitability levels. So, as we move into 2024, I expect that overall environment to be the same, and I certainly expect the team to be able to execute at a similar level.\nOperator: Next question comes from Wamsi Mohan from Bank of America. You may go ahead.\nWamsi Mohan: Yes. Thank you. Adam, you called out the weakness in 2023 in the communication-related markets, but you did exceed your expectations in the fourth quarter. Do you see a greater than normal organic growth rate over the next two years in these markets given the historically easier compares here? And if you could also just talk about the environment in China, that would be really helpful? Thank you.\nAdam Norwitt: Well, thank you very much, Wamsi. Well, you're asking me to do a tough thing, which is to talk about the next two years, in a very volatile space, which is communication. I think that's hard to say what will be the overall growth across communications. I would tell you, we see great opportunities across each of those areas with different things going on because remember, communications, not just IT datacom, it includes mobile networks. It includes mobile devices and obviously, broadband and I think there's different stuff going on in each of those areas. If you talk just about IT datacom, which is the biggest part of our communications business, I mean there is no doubt that, as I mentioned earlier, these investments in AI, I think we're in early days on this. I think that there are going to be more and more developments around the real kind of creation of new economic models around AI and then the investments to support that. That's already been broadly talked about. You've heard folks talking about pretty significant investments in these next-generation systems. And again, the interconnect products are a really integral part of those systems. So, I think on that front, I'm not getting out too ahead of my skis to say that I think at least specific to AI in IT datacom, I would expect over the coming couple of years. to see some great opportunities. I don't know about the base of IT Datacom over the next two years. I couldn't -- I can barely give you a 90-day kind of a very inaccurate guidance for mobile devices. I think that on wireless, we're going through a cycle, which is a typical cycle where they invest in a new type of a standard they wait to see and by day, I mean the service providers, the operators, they wait to see how does that settle out, how do customers take it? Are customers willing to pay more for the functionality that's delivered by that? And then there starts usually another round of the investments around that. And I think we're in that low period right now. I couldn't tell you when that low period will inflect and become more investment. But I can tell you, for sure, that in the coming years, there will need to be more investments around 5G and ultimately 6G and all the wireless networks because the vast majority of people connecting to the Internet are doing it not on a connection like a Cat 5 cable or in an office, they're doing it on a wireless basis, while they're moving around the world. And so that network is going to have to keep up with the data traffic that continues to expand kind of on an unabated basis. And then finally, broadband. Broadband is an area where I think there is a lot of push in countries like ours and others to ensure that there is both the capacity and the coverage for broadband access because it's viewed not as a luxury, but rather as a necessity that folks can have broadband access. And so I think long term, there's good opportunities there as well. Relative to China, I think I'm very happy to see that the sort of geopolitics of China and the U.S. seems to be the pendulum is swinging towards a more moderate phase. There's more people talking and all of that. And we're encouraged by that. I think the world is a better place when countries are talking rather than arguing, and I think that's a good thing. I think there's a lot written about the Chinese macro environment, and I'm not the expert to sort of go off on that. But what I will say is that in those areas of the electronics industries, where we support in China, places like the automotive industry, places like the industrial market, we continue to see great opportunities, and our team continues to do a fabulous job of capitalizing on those opportunities for the domestic market. And we feel really good about the position that we have as a company who is, of course, a global company but who operates through our unique organizational approach as a local company in that environment. And being the best of both worlds at a time like this when the world is somewhat uncertain, is a really good advantage for Amphenol.\nOperator: And our next caller is Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. You may go ahead.\nSamik Chatterjee: Hi. Happy New Year, and thanks for taking my question. I guess, Adam, I wanted to see if you can share your thoughts around organic growth opportunities for the company in 2024 related to inorganic growth. You have a strong pipeline of revenue from the acquisitions you've closed that you're on boarding, maybe share your thoughts about how you think about the rest of the business growing, whether they are more positive related to negatives in 2024. And what is the average sort of growth average expected of the acquisitions that you closed more recently for 2024? Thank you.\nAdam Norwitt: Yes. Thank you very much. Again, there seems to be a little bit of a cut out of the sound there. But I think your question is, how do I see the organic growth prospects as opposed to just the acquisitions. And I think we feel good about the organic prospects of the company, given all what I talked about each of our individual markets, and I'm not going to go through each of them once again. But I will just tell you that the investments that we've made in next-generation technologies, the work that we've done to support customers when they need us the most over the last two, three, four years, has positioned us very, very strongly organically to have a strong, robust performance in the years to come. And the other thing I would say as well is we think about acquisitions and obviously, in the first year that you own a company that's considered acquired growth. But we're focused much more on what happens thereafter. And are we acquiring companies that become platforms of future organic growth for the company. And I would tell you, all these 10 companies that we acquired this year, the nearly 30 companies that we've acquired since 2019. To me, these companies all represent expanded platforms for future organic growth for the company which makes me feel confident that over time, we will have subject to all of the market dynamics that, for sure, we are not immune to that the company is positioned to have really great organic growth potential.\nOperator: And our next caller is Andrew Buscaglia with BNP. You may go ahead.\nAndrew Buscaglia: Hi, guys. I just wanted to ask on IT datacom, again, with AI, the past couple of quarters, you called out sequential -- attributed sequential improvements to AI. What would you say the same thing took place in Q4? And then that plus your guidance, would you imply -- is this -- because we can't see that AI piece in that business. Would you say it's continuing to accelerate on a sequential basis?\nAdam Norwitt: Thank you very much, Andrew. Yes, I think what I said in my remarks is that we saw growth in AI, and we saw also growth in the underlying business. So I think over the last couple of quarters, I've described that are all of our upside, all of our sequential growth really did come from AI. I think that this quarter, it's some of each, which is actually really encouraging for us that we've seen maybe what 1 could call a bottoming of the underlying IT demand. Are we continuing to make progress in AI? Do we see continued acceleration opportunities? Yes, I wouldn't say that every quarter, it's going to accelerate in lockstep like it did over the course of Q2 and Q3 but for sure, we see opportunities long-term to be generating sales related to AI that are greater than we are today.\nOperator: And our next caller is Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs. You may go ahead.\nMark Delaney: Yes. Good afternoon. Thanks very much for taking my question and Happy New Year to all of you as well. Automotive has been a fast-growing market for the company. However, several auto OEMs have been seen EV sales and they said they're going to rethink how fast they want to shift their production towards EVs. And so I'm hoping to better understand if you think that will create any meaningful near to intermediate-term challenges for Amphenol that could limit the company's growth of market or perhaps lead to some inventory destocking? Thanks.\nAdam Norwitt: Well, thank you very much, Mark, and Happy New Year to you as well. Look, we read all the same papers, and we hear about the sort of discussions about slowdowns in EV sales. And I think we shouldn't forget that this is a fairly western dynamic. I don't think we hear, for example, in Asia and specifically in the largest car market in the world, China, about folks turning their back on EVs and going back to internal combustion engine. But we do hear a little bit about that, I think, here and in Europe. And as I've described, I mean, we don't care if a car has an EV drivetrain or not. What we care about, does a car have a lot of electronics in it and new electronic systems. Among those systems are certainly electrified drivetrains or hybrid electric drivetrains. And I think that what we've seen in Asia, what we've seen in Europe, what we've seen in North America is that there is a real acceleration of the adoption of electronics in cars period. And some of that may actually be related to the fact that EVs tend to be a little more fancy electronically. And I think car companies are seeing that and upgrading their standard companies to incorporate more electronic functionality. And whenever you have electronic functionality in a car, regardless of the drivetrain, you're going to have new interconnect solutions. You're going to have new sensor solutions. You're going to have new antenna solutions. And those are the three areas of our participation in the automotive market. For sure, if I go to like the largest EV market, China, for example, I mean, there continues to be unabated a real adoption. And I would almost say that EVs in that market have kind of reached a sort of escape velocity, where they're just really normal. I mean you see them all over the place. And I think our team there just did a fabulous job of getting a breadth of penetration across both domestic and international EV manufacturers, whereby we really are able to enjoy the benefits of that. And I think in Europe and in North America, we've done a great job, but we've also done a really great job on capitalizing upon some of these new electronics. And so, I wouldn't put any dynamic here in the category of something that we view as a real near or medium-term challenge. I think quite the contrary, as car companies struggle to figure out how they can sell their products and make more money from doing it, they're always going to fall back on electronics as the way to do that. And that's a good thing for Amphenol.\nOperator: Our next caller is William Stein with Truist Securities. You may go ahead.\nWilliam Stein: Great. Thanks. Adam, I'm hoping you can comment on the aperture for M&A and products within it. I think historically, you've talked about not wanting to acquire system-level solutions. And I think at least one of the acquisitions you've done recently has such products. And I wonder if that could potentially be something you'll grow into and expand or if we should see you perhaps shy way of that business going forward? Thank you.\nAdam Norwitt: Well, thank you so much. I think what you're alluding to is PCTEL and the fact that they have a very small test and measurement business and really wonderful people, wonderful products, but that's not why we bought PCTEL. And just -- you'll recall, we've acquired companies in the past, some of which are not purely the things that we were looking to acquire. And we're always very sensitive that we're never going to put ourselves in a competitive situation with our customers. And really PCTEL is known for their antenna technologies, which are fabulous. Not to say a bad word about their team that works in test and measurement, but we're not adopting a strategy to go after system-level products. In terms of our aperture for M&A, I mean we just see fabulous opportunities. I mentioned it in my prepared remarks. I think we have demonstrated an ability to acquire companies really across the board from a size perspective. We've demonstrated the ability to acquire a lot of companies and to process those effectively. And our small little headquarters team here, they may have been a little bit busier than normal over the last year with these 10 acquisitions. But the beauty is because of our organizational structure now having 14 groups across three global divisions, we have the wherewithal to make sure that those acquisitions get really their due attention when they become part of Amphenol. And I think the near-term pipeline remains a very robust pipeline, and we look forward to taking advantage of that. We will always remain a very disciplined buyer as we have forever. I am willing to walk away at the very last moment, if I have to, if something we find is not to our liking. We'll always pay a reasonable price, a fair price for great companies. We may not always be the highest priced buyer, but I think we are often the best buyer because of our effectiveness, our willingness to work aggressively to get things done. And the fact is our organizational structure allows those newly acquired companies to become part of Amphenol in a very unobtrusive fashion. They joined seamlessly. They come in and on day one. They just keep operating like they were doing on all the days before. And that is a relatively low-risk approach to acquisition, because we're not going in and just over -- just sort of having these kind of convulsive restructurings of the company, where you run the risk of destroying what you didn't even know you had. So we look forward to continuing to have great acquisitions in the future, but we're not going to be a kind of a system-level company. We know what we are. We're an interconnect company. There are wonderful opportunities for interconnect products to be expanded, both organically and through acquisition going forward, lots of really attractive companies out there, and we'll continue to position ourselves so the ones that match with us, the ones that go through our really rigorous kind of Rubicon of deciding whether or not to buy them, we'll be in a good position to execute on those over the near, medium and long term.\nOperator: And our next call is Chris Snyder with UBS. You may go ahead.\nChris Snyder: Thank you. I wanted to follow up on some of the earlier conversation on AI. So it sounds like book-to-bill for AI moderated sequentially, maybe after some early outsized orders just given the company's foundation in that market. So I guess the question is, do you think that this moderation is a single quarter phenomenon? Or would you expect that to persist for multiple quarters? Because it does seem like the top line is still continuing to grow sequentially? Thank you.\nAdam Norwitt: Thanks very much, Chris. Yes. I mean, look, I don't usually talk about book-to-bill by submarkets. But I will tell you that, for sure, I mean, we had very strong bookings in AI-related applications in Q2 and Q3. And so it's not surprising that here in Q4, our IT Datacom book-to-bill was a bit below zero and -- sorry, a bit below one and because of those significant orders that we received, which customers wanted to place because they need the product and then we're executing upon those orders. And yes, I think that our IT Datacom business is in a good position looking forward. I mean our guidance for the first quarter is to have a little moderation, which is not abnormal this time of year, actually quite normal. Let me say that. And layered on top of that, I think the AI is a good thing to have. So no, I think you characterized it quite well. \nOperator: Our next call is Joseph Giordano with TD Cowen. You may go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, guys. This is Michael on for Joe. So earlier, you had mentioned commentary regarding orders and specific markets. Can you just provide like a high level, maybe book-to-bill on a consolidated basis for the quarter? Or any color there? \nCraig Lampo: About earlier that our book-to-bill was 0.95:1 for the quarter. Operator do we have another question. \nOperator: Our next caller is Steven Fox with Fox Advisors. You may go ahead.\nSteven Fox: Hi, good afternoon. I guess broadly speaking, the latest round of acquisitions were around sensors, antennas and assemblies I was just curious, like, Adam, your updated thoughts on your M&A focus by technology, especially in the context of what looks like gross margins that are now at the 33% level. I guess some of these products have lower gross margins, some have higher. I don't know if there's a mix impact that's influencing the gross margin now with the M&A. But just broadly speaking, when you -- the general buckets of technology that you look at, what is your thinking of what you've done and where you need to go now? Thanks.\nAdam Norwitt: Well, thanks very much, Steve. Yes. I mean, look, in the quarter, we acquired companies who make sensors, antennas, cable and cable assemblies and really high-technology cable actually that has really great value for its customers. And we continue to see acquisition opportunities across really all of our interconnect products from discrete connectors to cable assembly, value-add, complex value-add interconnect products sensors, complex sensor interconnect assemblies, antennas and the like. And we're really pleased to continue to find companies across all of those products. I wouldn't tell you that we think so much about gross margin by product. We see great margin opportunities as you know. And Craig has said it so many times, we're very much focused on operating margins. And yes, I mean, some of these companies do operate below our corporate average, not all of them, by the way, but some of them do. And I think we -- that doesn't relate at all to their product type. We don't believe that there is a correlation between whether someone makes a connector, a sensor and antenna a cable or a cable assembly that, that is necessarily going to put them in a certain bucket of profit potential. We actually see great profit potential for all companies. And that's one of the ways we screen for acquisitions. I mean we're not going to buy a company if we don't see the long-term potential for that company to elevate its profitability to at or above our corporate average. Now, we do have industry-leading margins and so most of the companies that we do acquire tend to be lower than we are. And then it's our job and their job becoming part of the Amphenol family to bring those margins up over time. But it's really not at all correlated to the type of products that they sell.\nOperator: And our last question comes from Matt Sheerin with Stifel. You may go ahead.\nMatt Sheerin: Yes. Thank you. Good afternoon. Adam, in your commentary on mobile devices, you mentioned that tablets and notebook PCs continue to be weak. But we are hearing some chatter about expectations for a potential refresh PC refresh cycle playing out in the next year or two. So wondering if you have any visibility into that? And can you give us a sense of the content opportunity for Amphenol within notebooks, particularly in the next-generation so-called AI-enabled PCs?\nAdam Norwitt: Great. Thanks so much, Matt. Look, I hope what you say is the case. We certainly hope that there is a refresh. Look, I think we've talked about this year and even a little bit last year, that the strength that we've seen in phones this year, which was more than offset, in particular, by things like laptops and tablets. It had to do with the clear fact that during the pandemic and when everybody went to work from home and study from home, there was an enormous rush to buy new devices, which caused a surge and really kind of upset the normal replacement cycle of those products. And so I guess that one could expect that if everybody bought a bunch of stuff in 2020 and 2021 and if those things tend to last three, four, five years, that eventually you would hope to see a little bit of a refresh. I don't know -- I can't tell you I have any information to support that. I'm sure you're getting your information from even wiser sources than I would have. Relative to the content, we do see great content opportunities in these devices as they get more complex, as they get more different wireless standards that they have to support as they have higher speeds, as they have more fine pitch and more precision inside of them, all of these create opportunities for Amphenol long term. We've always said about the mobile device market, and that includes tablets and laptops and the like, that to the extent that there is a premium on the hardware of the product, that can create opportunities for Amphenol over the long-term. And I think that will. Whether that's related to AI or not, that I can't necessarily connect those dots, but for sure, people are going to need new devices in the future, and we'll be happy to enable the interconnect products across those devices. Well, operator, if that was our last question, I guess I'd like to take this opportunity to thank everybody here today for spending a little bit of your time with us. I wish that you all have a good continuation of your winter wherever you may be. And we look forward to talking to all of you just 90 days from now. Thanks so much.\nCraig Lampo: Thanks, everybody.\nOperator: And this concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may disconnect at this time, and have a great rest of your day.",

            "name": "Craig Lampo",
            "content": "Thank you very much. Good afternoon, everyone. This is Craig Lampo, Amphenol's CFO, and I'm here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO. We would like to wish everyone a Happy New Year, and welcome you to our fourth quarter of 2023 conference call. Our fourth quarter and full year 2023 results were released this morning. I will provide some financial commentary, and then Adam will give an overview of the business and current trends. Then we will take questions. As a reminder, during the call, we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures and make certain forward-looking statements. So please refer to the relevant disclosures in our press release for further information. The company closed the fourth quarter with sales of $3,327 million and record adjusted diluted EPS of $0.82. Fourth quarter sales were up 3% in U.S. dollars, 2% in local currencies and down 1% organically compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. Sequentially, sales were up 4% in U.S. dollars, 4% in local currencies and 2% organically. Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes. For the full year of 2023, sales were $12,555,000,000 down 50 basis points in U.S. dollars, flat in local currencies and down 3% organically compared to 2022. Orders in the quarter were $3,164,000,000, up 10% compared to the fourth quarter of 2022 and flat sequentially, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 0.95:1. For the full year, orders were $12,267,000,000, down 5% compared to 2022, resulting in a book-to-bill of 0.98:1. GAAP operating income and operating margin was $690 million and 20.7%, respectively, in the fourth quarter of 2023 which increased 10 basis points compared to both the fourth quarter of 2022 and the third quarter of 2023. Adjusted operating income was $706 million, which excluded $16 million in acquisition-related costs. Adjusted operating margin was 21.2% during the fourth quarter and a new quarterly record for the company. On an adjusted basis, operating margin increased by 30 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of 2022 and increased by 40 basis points sequentially. The year-over-year increase in adjusted operating margin was primarily driven by strong operating leverage on slightly higher sales levels as well as the benefit of pricing actions. These benefits were partially offset by the dilutive impact of recent acquisitions, most of which are currently operating below the corporate average. For the full year of 2023, GAAP operating income was $2.56 billion, which included $35 million of acquisition-related costs and excluding these costs, adjusted operating income was $2.594 million. For the full year of 2023, GAAP operating margin was 20.4% and adjusted operating margin was a strong 20.7%, consistent with our previous annual record margins achieved in 2022 and 2018. On a GAAP basis, operating margin decreased 10 basis points compared to 2022. Compared to 2022, adjusted operating margin was flat, which primarily was driven by strong operational performance as well as the benefit of pricing actions, partially offset by the dilutive impact of acquisitions. This was an impressive margin performance given the slight sales decline we experienced in 2023. Our team continued to execute well in the quarter, and we are proud to have sustained these healthy levels of profitability, despite the continued range of challenges around the world. Breaking down fourth quarter results by segment. Relative to the fourth quarter of 2022, sales in the Harsh Environment Solutions segment were $900 million and increased by 13% in U.S. dollars and 6% organically. Segment operating margin was 26.5%. Sales in the Communications Solutions segment were $1.345 billion and declined by 6% in U.S. dollars and 7% organically. Segment operating margin was 23.1%. Sales in Interconnect and Sensor Systems segment were $1.082 billion and increased by 7% in U.S. dollars and 2% organically. Segment operating margin was 18.5%. Breaking down full year results by segment relative to 2022, sales in the Harsh Environment Solutions segment were $3.531 billion, an increase by 14% in U.S. dollars and 9% organically, and segment operating margin was 26.7%. Sales in the Communications Solutions segment were $4.913 billion and declined by 13% in U.S. dollars and organically and segment operating margin was 21.6%. Sales in Interconnect and System \u2013 Sensor Systems segment were $4.111 billion, an increase by 6% in U.S. dollars and 3% organically and segment operating margin was 18.3%. The company's GAAP effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 22% and the adjusted effective tax rate was 24%, which compared to 19.2% and 24.5% in the fourth quarter of 2022, respectively. And for the full year of 2023, the company's GAAP effective tax rate was 20.7% and the adjusted effective tax rate was 24%, which compared to 22.3% and 24.5% in 2022, respectively. In 2024, we expect our adjusted effective tax rate to be approximately 24%. GAAP diluted EPS was $0.83 in the fourth quarter, up 1% compared to the prior year period, and on an adjusted basis, diluted EPS increased 5% to a record $0.82 compared to $0.78 in the fourth quarter of 2022. This was an excellent result. For the full year, GAAP diluted EPS was a record $3.11, a 2% increase from $3.06 in 2022. And adjusted diluted EPS was a record $3.01 in 2023, an increase from $3 in 2022. Operating cash flow in the fourth quarter was a record $842 million or 162% of adjusted net income. And net of capital spending, our free cash flow was a record $739 million or 142% of adjusted net income. We are pleased to have continued to deliver such a strong cash flow yield in the quarter and for the full year. In the full year, 2023 operating cash flow was a record $2.529 billion or 130% of adjusted net income. Net of capital spending, our free cash flow for 2023 was a record $2.160 billion or 111% of adjusted net income, a very strong result. From a working capital standpoint, inventory days, days sales outstanding and payable days were 85, 70 and 55 days, respectively, all within our normal levels. And during the quarter, the company repurchased 1.3 million shares of common stock at an average price of approximately $86 bringing total repurchases during 2023 to 7.2 million shares or $585 million. When combined with our normal quarterly dividend, total capital returned to shareholders in 2023 was $1.86 billion. Total debt on December 31 was $4.3 billion, and net debt was $2.7 billion. Total liquidity at the end of the quarter was $4.9 billion, which included cash and short-term investments on hand of $1.7 billion, plus availability under our existing credit facilities. Fourth quarter and full year 2023 EBITDA was $830 million and $3.1 billion, respectively. And at the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, our net leverage was 0.9 times. We are very pleased that the company's financial condition remains strong by any measure. I will now turn the call over to Adam, who will provide some commentary on current market trends. Hi Luke, its Craig. I'll take that one for Adam. I think as we think about pricing, 2023, certainly, we talked about the fact that we didn't necessarily -- we saw pricing coming back to normal. I mean, 2022 we talked a lot about pricing adjustments we are making to try to catch-up to inflation -- inflationary increases on costs that we saw. And I think that as we came into 2023, sequentially, we did a great job on the profitability, but that wasn't necessarily the pricing dynamics. That was more really just operational execution. And I think the pricing in 2023 and as we look into 2024 is, certainly a more normalized and that the price and cost environment is more balanced. I wouldn't say that the cost environment necessarily has decrease at all. I think there is certainly an elevated level of cost, but they're just not increasing at the pace that we saw a year ago. So from that perspective, I think the pricing environment is in more of a normal situation. And as we move into 2024, I don't necessarily think we're going to get necessarily the benefit of price. And historically, that's not something that we would see anyways. And typically, if you have a normal cost environment and normal price environment, I think you'll see kind of typical kind of margins and margin increases from a profitability perspective, we talk about 25% as being a typical target that we have in a normal environment. And I think as we move into 2024, I would expect that to be the case kind of sequentially as we move into it. So really happy with where we actually ended the year here at record operating levels. So we're really well positioned, I think, as we move into 2024. I mean if you look at our -- our margin improvements, I think that that's something that I'm really proud of the team to be able to actually execute so well during the year to get to these profitability levels. So, as we move into 2024, I expect that overall environment to be the same, and I certainly expect the team to be able to execute at a similar level. About earlier that our book-to-bill was 0.95:1 for the quarter. Operator do we have another question. Thanks, everybody."

            "name": "Adam Norwitt",
            "content": "Well, Craig, thank you very much and I'd like to extend my welcome to everybody on the phone here today. And I hope it's not too late to wish all of you a happy New Year here from Wallingford, Connecticut. As Craig mentioned, I'm going to highlight some of our achievements in the fourth quarter and also for the full year of 2023. I'll then discuss our trends and progress across our served markets. I'll make some comments on our outlook for the first quarter, and then, of course, we'll have time for questions. Our results in the fourth quarter were stronger than expected, exceeding the high end of our guidance in sales and adjusted diluted earnings per share. Sales grew by 3% in U.S. dollars, 2% in local currencies, reaching $3.327 billion. On an organic basis, our sales did decline by just 1%, with growth in commercial air, defense, automotive and IT Datacom markets offset by declines across our other end markets. The company booked $3.164 billion in orders in the fourth quarter. This was a 10% growth versus prior year and flat to last quarter, but did represent a book-to-bill of 0.98:1. We're very pleased to have delivered record adjusted operating margins of 21.2% in the quarter, a clear reflection of our team's outstanding execution and these margins increased 30 basis points from prior year and 40 basis points sequentially. Adjusted diluted EPS reached $0.82 in the quarter, representing a growth of 5% from prior year. I have to say that we were especially pleased that the company generated record operating and free cash flow of $842 million and $739 million, respectively, in the fourth quarter both just really clear reflections of the quality of the company's earnings. I come out of the fourth quarter, extremely proud of the Amphenol team. Our results this quarter once again reflect the discipline and agility of our entrepreneurial organization as we continue to perform well amidst the challenging and dynamic environment. We're also pleased that we announced this morning that we closed four acquisitions in the quarter, really in November and December. Based in Ohio, TPC Wire & Cable is a value-added provider of harsh environment, cable and cable assemblies for applications across the industrial market and this includes particularly factory automation and heavy equipment and TPC has annual sales of roughly $110 million. On headquartered in New Hampshire and with annual sales of approximately $90 million, Airmar is a leading provider of sensors for the recreational marine, commercial fishing and industrial markets. LID technologies based in Toulouse France has annual sales of approximately $40 million and LID is a high-technology supplier of sensor products to the industrial and automotive markets with a focus on tire pressure monitoring and the telematics associated with that. We also closed on the previously announced acquisition of PCTEL, a leading global provider of antennas for a broad array of markets, including in particularly the Internet of Things or industrial IoT market. PCTEL generated in 2023, approximately $85 million in sales. As we welcome these outstanding new teams to Amphenol, I remain confident that our acquisition program will continue to create great value for the company. In fact, our acquisition program was very successful in 2023 and our pipeline of prospective deals remain strong as we enter the new year. Indeed, we continue to see interesting near-term potential opportunities to bring outstanding and complementary organizations into the Amphenol family. Our ability to identify and execute upon acquisitions and then to successfully bring these companies into the Amphenol family remains a core competitive advantage for the company. As our organization has evolved and scaled, so too has our ability to effectively manage a greater number of acquisitions of all sizes. Now turning to the full year of 2023, despite the demand challenges that we did experience in certain end markets in the year, I have to say that the Amphenol team delivered another successful year of performance. Amidst significant organic declines in the communications end markets due to inventory builds in 2022 as well as the more recent moderations in demand in the industrial market. Our team was able to deliver overall sales that were only slightly down from prior year. This was a testament to the breadth and diversification of the company as well as our team's ability to capitalize in real time on opportunities for incremental sales across the entirety of our markets. Our full year 2023 adjusted operating margin of 20.7% was flat with our last year record levels in 2022 despite the organic sales decline. This excellent performance by our team allowed us to deliver adjusted diluted EPS of $3.01 which was just slightly above prior year levels. We also generated record operating and free cash flow of $2.529 billion and $2.160 billion, respectively, both confirmations of the company's superior execution and disciplined working capital management. Our acquisition program, which I just discussed really created a great value throughout the year with 10 new companies contributing annualized sales of more than $600 million joining Amphenol in 2023. These new acquisitions enhanced our position across a broad array of technologies while bringing outstanding and talented individuals into the Amphenol organization. We're excited that these companies represent expanded platforms for the company's future performance and have deepened our already strong bench of leaders around the world. In addition, in 2023, we bought back over 7 million shares under our share buyback program, and increased our quarterly dividend by 5%, and that represented a total return of capital to shareholders of nearly $1.1 billion. So while there continues to be a high level of volatility across the overall market environment in 2023, as we enter 2024, our agile entrepreneurial management team is confident that we have built further strength from which we can drive superior long-term performance. Now turning to the trends and our progress across our served markets. I would just comment that we remain very pleased that the company's end market exposure is still highly diversified, balanced and broad with no end market representing more than 25% of our sales in 2023. This market diversity helps to insulate us from the effect of any given market volatility, while also exposing us to the exciting revolutions happening across the electronics industry. Turning first to the defense market. Our sales represented 12% of our total in the fourth quarter and 11% for the full year 2023. Fourth quarter sales once again grew strongly from prior year, increasing by 18% in U.S. dollars and 17% in local currency. On an organic basis, sales in the defense market increased by 15%, with broad-based growth across virtually all defense applications, particularly strong in naval, helicopters, communications and airframe applications. Sequentially, our sales increased by a better-than-expected 4% from the third quarter. For the full year 2023, sales in the defense market grew by 20% in U.S. dollars in local currency and by 18% organically. This reflected our operational execution, as well as broad strength across most segments of the defense market, and that particularly related to naval, aircraft engine, helicopter, communications and space-related applications. Looking ahead, we expect sales in the first quarter to decline in the mid-single digits sequentially, and we remain very encouraged by the company's strengthened position in the defense market, where we continue to offer the industry's widest range of high-technology interconnect products. Amidst today's dynamic geopolitical environment, countries around the world are expanding their investments in both current and next-generation defense technologies, thereby increasing the long-term demand potential for Amphenol. We are well positioned to accelerate our new product development and increase our capacity to support this demand long into the future. The commercial air market represented 3% of our sales in the quarter and 4% of our sales for the full year 2023. In the fourth quarter, our sales grew by a very strong 25% in U.S. dollars and 23% in local currency and organically, and this was driven by broad-based strength across all aircraft applications. Sequentially, our sales grew by 1% from the third quarter, which was actually ahead of our expectations for a modest seasonal decline. For the full year 2023, sales increased by a very robust 36% in U.S. dollar local currency and organically, reflecting our strong design-in positions on a broad range of platforms, as well as broad-based demand across all aircraft applications. Looking into the first quarter, we expect sales to remain at these lofty fourth quarter levels. I'm truly proud of our team working in the commercial air market. With the ongoing recovery in travel and thus demand for jetliners, our efforts to strengthen our breadth of high-technology interconnect products, while diversifying our market position into next-generation aircraft are paying real dividends. We continue to see great long-term opportunities for expansion of our technology offering to this important market and look forward to realizing the benefits of those growth initiatives for many years to come. The industrial market represented 23% of our sales in the quarter and 25% of our sales for the full year. Our sales in the fourth quarter did decline by 4% in U.S. dollars, 5% in local currencies and 12% organically as growth that we realized in oil and gas, rail mass transit and marine applications was more than offset by moderations in demand in other segments, including battery and electric heavy vehicles, building automation, transportation and heavy equipment. In addition, our sales into the industrial distribution channel continued to be more muted than they were a year ago. On a sequential basis, sales grew by 1%, but that was driven primarily by acquisitions that we did close in the quarter. For the full year 2023, sales were flat in U.S. dollars in local currency and declined by 7% organically as the contribution from acquisitions was offset by weakness in instrumentation, battery and EV, and electric heavy vehicles, factory automation and heavy equipment applications in particular. Looking into the first quarter, we expect sales to remain at these levels as the benefit of recent acquisitions offset the modest organic sequential decline. Despite this near-term demand pause driven in particular by elevated inventory levels, both in the distribution channel as well as in certain end markets, I remain proud of our outstanding global team working in the industrial market. We are very excited by the additions of TPC, Airmar, LID and PCTEL, each of which adds complementary new interconnect sensor and antenna technologies to our industrial product offering. And I'm confident that our long-term strategy to expand our high-technology interconnect antenna sensor offering, both organically and through complementary acquisitions has positioned us to capitalize on the many revolutions that will no doubt continue to occur across the industrial electronics market. The automotive market represented 24% of our sales in the quarter and 23% of our sales for the full year. Sales in the fourth quarter grew by a robust 16% in U.S. dollars and 15% in local currency, and on an organic basis, our sales to the automotive market increased by 12%. That was really driven by broad-based strength across most automotive applications, including electric and hybrid electric vehicles. Sequentially, our automotive sales increased by 8%, which was better than our expectations coming into the quarter. For the full year 2023, I'm pleased that our sales increased by a strong 12% in U.S. dollars, 13% in local currency and 12% organically, and that reflected broad strength across the automotive market, including, in particular, next-generation electronics, for example, electric and hybrid drivetrains. Looking into 2024, we expect a high single-digit sequential seasonal moderation in sales in the first quarter from these levels. I'm truly proud of our team working in the automotive market. Their performance in 2023 is yet another confirmation of the benefits of their focus on driving new design wins with customers who are implementing a wide array of new technologies into their vehicles. It's really a multitude of applications, including electrified drivetrains, but not just that, many other applications. We look forward to benefiting from that strong position for many years to come. The mobile devices market represented 11% of our sales in the quarter and 10% of our sales for the full year 2023. Our fourth quarter sales moderated by 3% in U.S. dollars, local currency and organic as robust growth in smartphones was once again more than offset by declining sales into tablets, laptops and wearables. Sequentially, our sales increased by 9%, which was much better than our expectation coming into the quarter for a high single-digit decline. For the full year 2023, sales in the mobile devices market declined by 12% in U.S. dollars and 10% organically as strong growth in smartphones was more than offset by declines in other mobile device applications. Looking into the first quarter, we do anticipate a typical seasonal sequential decline of approximately 35%. While mobile devices will always remain one of our most volatile of markets, our outstanding and agile team is poised as always to capture any opportunities for incremental sales that may arise in 2024 and beyond. Our leading array of antennas, interconnect products and mechanisms continues to enable a broad range of next-generation mobile devices, which positions us well for the long term. The mobile networks market represented 3% of our sales in the quarter and 4% of our sales for the full year. Sales in this market declined from prior year by 26% in U.S. dollars, 27% in local currency and 34% organically, as we continue to manage through a broad-based reduction in spending by network operators and wireless equipment manufacturers. Sequentially, our sales decreased by 6%, which was in line with our expectations. For the full year, sales declined by 26% from prior year and 32% organically driven by the spending reductions that we've discussed throughout the year. Looking ahead, we expect a modest increase in sales from these fourth quarter levels. And despite this more challenging short-term wireless investment environment, our team continues to work aggressively to realize the benefits of our efforts, to expand our position in next-generation 5G equipment and networks around the world. When customers once again drive renewed wireless investments, we look forward to benefiting from the increased potential that comes from our position with both equipment manufacturers and mobile service providers. The information technology and data communications market represented 20% of our sales in the quarter and 19% of our sales for the full year. We're very pleased that our sales in the fourth quarter returned to growth compared to prior year, with sales in U.S. dollars and local currency increasing by 6% and organically by 5%. Sequentially, our sales increased by a much better-than-expected 6%. As we continue to benefit from our strong presence with AI data center customers as well as some overall improved demand. For the full year 2023, our sales in the IT Datacom market declined 13% in U.S. dollars and organically as strong demand for AI-related applications was more than offset by inventory adjustments that we saw amongst our traditional IT Datacom applications. Looking ahead, we do expect in the first quarter a mid single-digit sequential seasonal decline in sales. I have to say coming out of what was a challenging year in the overall IT Datacom market that we're more encouraged than ever by the company's position in this space. Our team continues to do an outstanding job securing future business on next-generation IT systems, particularly those enabling artificial intelligence. Indeed, the revolution in AI has created a unique opportunity for Amphenol given our leading high-speed power and fiber optic interconnect products. With machine learning driving a more intensive usage of these highest technology interconnect products, we are very well positioned for the future. This creates a continued long-term growth opportunity for Amphenol. The broadband communications market represented 4% of our sales in the quarter and 4% for the year. Sales in the fourth quarter were down 31%, in U.S. dollars and 32% organically, as broadband operators continued to moderate their procurement levels. On a sequential basis, sales did decline by 12%, which was worse than our expectations coming into the quarter when we anticipated more of a modest increase. For the full year 2023, sales were down by 7% in U.S. dollars and organically, driven by the continued pause in broadband operator spending. Looking ahead, we expect sales in the first quarter to increase modestly from these levels. Regardless of the current demand dynamics, we do remain encouraged by the company's strengthened position in the broadband market. We look forward to continuing to support our service provider customers around the world, all of whom are working to increase their network coverage and bandwidth to support the proliferation of high-speed data applications to homes and businesses. And finally, turning to our outlook. There's no doubt that the current economic environment remains somewhat uncertain. Assuming the continuation of these current market conditions and also assuming constant exchange rates, for the first quarter, we expect sales in the range of $3.4 billion to $3.1 billion and adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $0.71 to $0.73. This would represent sales growth of 2% to 4% and adjusted diluted EPS growth of 3% to 6% compared to the first quarter of 2023. I remain confident in the ability of our outstanding management team to adapt to the many opportunities and challenges in the current environment and to continue to grow Amphenol's market position, while driving sustainable and strong profitability over the long term. And finally, I just want to take this opportunity to thank our entire global team around the world, including all of those who work across our factories, touch our products, and ultimately deliver to our customers what they need. I'm just truly grateful for all of their outstanding efforts both here in the fourth quarter, but moreover, for the entirety of 2023, without them, we wouldn't be able to make it happen like we do. And with that, operator, we'd be very happy to take any questions. Yes, Amit, I didn't perfectly hear the second part of your question. There's a little bit of a connection issue. But I think relative to your question, which was, is industrial stable versus 90 days ago. I mean, look, I think we came into the quarter with an expectation of kind of a modest reduction in sales, our sales -- we're essentially in the line with that. So I think it was kind of what we expected it to be. I would say that the book-to-bill in industrial was a bit weaker. I mean, if we think about why our book-to-bill was 0.95:1. I mean, the real driver for that was industrial on 1 side. And we did see in the IT Datacom market a little bit of a softer book-to-bill. But that that is really just a little bit more of an equalization from very high books to build that we've seen over the prior couple of quarters. So I don't think the IT data come book-to-bill is at all representative of the demand environment. But I think -- in the industrial market, we did see bookings a little softer than we had anticipated. I'm going to assume that your second question is how do we see that going forward? And where do we see that kind of cycle in industrial. And I think it's early to tell. I mean the beauty of our industrial business is it so broad. And so we're not levered on to one or another of the individual segments. And you know there are so many segments across the industrial market that we participate in. And we don't have any of those that are really disproportionate to our overall business. And we continue to see some of those segments areas like marine and oil and gas, rail mass transit, medical during the course of this year. They still had very robust demand. But no doubt about it, areas like factory automation, instrumentation, those are areas where we've seen more market reductions in demand and also more impact from the distribution channel. When is that going to be worked out in the distribution channel, the inventory, when does some of that demand return in some of those segments. I think it's a little too early to tell. And as we go through the course of this year, we'll try to give you a really good read on that. I mean as we look into here now in the first quarter, as I said in my prepared remarks, we do anticipate in the first quarter, a kind of a modest level, but really supported by the acquisitions that we've made. And on an organic basis, we see the first quarter, again, modestly down from our current levels. Yes. Well, thank you very much, and welcome to our call. I look forward to getting to meet you in person. We're really excited about the progress that the company has made in AI. And I just want to reflect on one aspect, which is that AI is not new to us. While the world over the course of the last year has sort of woken up to AI with the advent a year ago, November of ChatGPT and the sort of revolution of generative AI. Our team has been working on the interconnect architecture surrounding AI for a long, long time. And so it is only now that maybe there is this acceleration almost, you could call it even a kind of revolution or a goldrush around AI, but we've been building the capability, building the product capability, building the manufacturing capability and capacity to support that for a long time. And I think this year, one of the ways that we were able to maybe even get a disproportionate share of some of the more urgent demand was that we were very quick to flex our capacity in favor of customers who needed products and when they needed it. And I think our team has always showed the ability to have that agility in reacting to upticks of demand. And I think that this AI is no different. I'm really proud of our team and how they've done that. Looking forward, it's still too early to say, what does that, look like over the long-term. But there's no question in my mind that AI seems like something that is not such a small deal. It seems like something where there are real economics behind it, where large companies are making significant investments into AI and where ultimately our architecture, our interconnect architecture is a very critical component together with the chips that you alluded to. Now relative to shortages of chips, that's -- I mean, we hope that there are significant investments in chip manufacturing, because in our industrial business, we do supply a lot of interconnect products that go into the industry for semiconductor manufacturing. I don't think that we've necessarily seen that as a governor on our output or on our customers' demand right now. But we'll see. It's not something that would directly impact except that maybe customers, if they couldn't get enough chips, they would moderate their overall construction. But we haven't seen that yet. And I think our team is just doing a fabulous job dealing with the surge in demand that we saw this year. And it came at a time when overall IT demand was down. But in fact, some of the products were very different products. So it wasn't just that we were able to reallocate capacity from IT products that were not being consumed as much into these. There was a lot of new stuff that we had to do. And I think we did a really great job executing on that. Well, thank you very much, Wamsi. Well, you're asking me to do a tough thing, which is to talk about the next two years, in a very volatile space, which is communication. I think that's hard to say what will be the overall growth across communications. I would tell you, we see great opportunities across each of those areas with different things going on because remember, communications, not just IT datacom, it includes mobile networks. It includes mobile devices and obviously, broadband and I think there's different stuff going on in each of those areas. If you talk just about IT datacom, which is the biggest part of our communications business, I mean there is no doubt that, as I mentioned earlier, these investments in AI, I think we're in early days on this. I think that there are going to be more and more developments around the real kind of creation of new economic models around AI and then the investments to support that. That's already been broadly talked about. You've heard folks talking about pretty significant investments in these next-generation systems. And again, the interconnect products are a really integral part of those systems. So, I think on that front, I'm not getting out too ahead of my skis to say that I think at least specific to AI in IT datacom, I would expect over the coming couple of years. to see some great opportunities. I don't know about the base of IT Datacom over the next two years. I couldn't -- I can barely give you a 90-day kind of a very inaccurate guidance for mobile devices. I think that on wireless, we're going through a cycle, which is a typical cycle where they invest in a new type of a standard they wait to see and by day, I mean the service providers, the operators, they wait to see how does that settle out, how do customers take it? Are customers willing to pay more for the functionality that's delivered by that? And then there starts usually another round of the investments around that. And I think we're in that low period right now. I couldn't tell you when that low period will inflect and become more investment. But I can tell you, for sure, that in the coming years, there will need to be more investments around 5G and ultimately 6G and all the wireless networks because the vast majority of people connecting to the Internet are doing it not on a connection like a Cat 5 cable or in an office, they're doing it on a wireless basis, while they're moving around the world. And so that network is going to have to keep up with the data traffic that continues to expand kind of on an unabated basis. And then finally, broadband. Broadband is an area where I think there is a lot of push in countries like ours and others to ensure that there is both the capacity and the coverage for broadband access because it's viewed not as a luxury, but rather as a necessity that folks can have broadband access. And so I think long term, there's good opportunities there as well. Relative to China, I think I'm very happy to see that the sort of geopolitics of China and the U.S. seems to be the pendulum is swinging towards a more moderate phase. There's more people talking and all of that. And we're encouraged by that. I think the world is a better place when countries are talking rather than arguing, and I think that's a good thing. I think there's a lot written about the Chinese macro environment, and I'm not the expert to sort of go off on that. But what I will say is that in those areas of the electronics industries, where we support in China, places like the automotive industry, places like the industrial market, we continue to see great opportunities, and our team continues to do a fabulous job of capitalizing on those opportunities for the domestic market. And we feel really good about the position that we have as a company who is, of course, a global company but who operates through our unique organizational approach as a local company in that environment. And being the best of both worlds at a time like this when the world is somewhat uncertain, is a really good advantage for Amphenol. Yes. Thank you very much. Again, there seems to be a little bit of a cut out of the sound there. But I think your question is, how do I see the organic growth prospects as opposed to just the acquisitions. And I think we feel good about the organic prospects of the company, given all what I talked about each of our individual markets, and I'm not going to go through each of them once again. But I will just tell you that the investments that we've made in next-generation technologies, the work that we've done to support customers when they need us the most over the last two, three, four years, has positioned us very, very strongly organically to have a strong, robust performance in the years to come. And the other thing I would say as well is we think about acquisitions and obviously, in the first year that you own a company that's considered acquired growth. But we're focused much more on what happens thereafter. And are we acquiring companies that become platforms of future organic growth for the company. And I would tell you, all these 10 companies that we acquired this year, the nearly 30 companies that we've acquired since 2019. To me, these companies all represent expanded platforms for future organic growth for the company which makes me feel confident that over time, we will have subject to all of the market dynamics that, for sure, we are not immune to that the company is positioned to have really great organic growth potential. Thank you very much, Andrew. Yes, I think what I said in my remarks is that we saw growth in AI, and we saw also growth in the underlying business. So I think over the last couple of quarters, I've described that are all of our upside, all of our sequential growth really did come from AI. I think that this quarter, it's some of each, which is actually really encouraging for us that we've seen maybe what 1 could call a bottoming of the underlying IT demand. Are we continuing to make progress in AI? Do we see continued acceleration opportunities? Yes, I wouldn't say that every quarter, it's going to accelerate in lockstep like it did over the course of Q2 and Q3 but for sure, we see opportunities long-term to be generating sales related to AI that are greater than we are today. Well, thank you very much, Mark, and Happy New Year to you as well. Look, we read all the same papers, and we hear about the sort of discussions about slowdowns in EV sales. And I think we shouldn't forget that this is a fairly western dynamic. I don't think we hear, for example, in Asia and specifically in the largest car market in the world, China, about folks turning their back on EVs and going back to internal combustion engine. But we do hear a little bit about that, I think, here and in Europe. And as I've described, I mean, we don't care if a car has an EV drivetrain or not. What we care about, does a car have a lot of electronics in it and new electronic systems. Among those systems are certainly electrified drivetrains or hybrid electric drivetrains. And I think that what we've seen in Asia, what we've seen in Europe, what we've seen in North America is that there is a real acceleration of the adoption of electronics in cars period. And some of that may actually be related to the fact that EVs tend to be a little more fancy electronically. And I think car companies are seeing that and upgrading their standard companies to incorporate more electronic functionality. And whenever you have electronic functionality in a car, regardless of the drivetrain, you're going to have new interconnect solutions. You're going to have new sensor solutions. You're going to have new antenna solutions. And those are the three areas of our participation in the automotive market. For sure, if I go to like the largest EV market, China, for example, I mean, there continues to be unabated a real adoption. And I would almost say that EVs in that market have kind of reached a sort of escape velocity, where they're just really normal. I mean you see them all over the place. And I think our team there just did a fabulous job of getting a breadth of penetration across both domestic and international EV manufacturers, whereby we really are able to enjoy the benefits of that. And I think in Europe and in North America, we've done a great job, but we've also done a really great job on capitalizing upon some of these new electronics. And so, I wouldn't put any dynamic here in the category of something that we view as a real near or medium-term challenge. I think quite the contrary, as car companies struggle to figure out how they can sell their products and make more money from doing it, they're always going to fall back on electronics as the way to do that. And that's a good thing for Amphenol. Well, thank you so much. I think what you're alluding to is PCTEL and the fact that they have a very small test and measurement business and really wonderful people, wonderful products, but that's not why we bought PCTEL. And just -- you'll recall, we've acquired companies in the past, some of which are not purely the things that we were looking to acquire. And we're always very sensitive that we're never going to put ourselves in a competitive situation with our customers. And really PCTEL is known for their antenna technologies, which are fabulous. Not to say a bad word about their team that works in test and measurement, but we're not adopting a strategy to go after system-level products. In terms of our aperture for M&A, I mean we just see fabulous opportunities. I mentioned it in my prepared remarks. I think we have demonstrated an ability to acquire companies really across the board from a size perspective. We've demonstrated the ability to acquire a lot of companies and to process those effectively. And our small little headquarters team here, they may have been a little bit busier than normal over the last year with these 10 acquisitions. But the beauty is because of our organizational structure now having 14 groups across three global divisions, we have the wherewithal to make sure that those acquisitions get really their due attention when they become part of Amphenol. And I think the near-term pipeline remains a very robust pipeline, and we look forward to taking advantage of that. We will always remain a very disciplined buyer as we have forever. I am willing to walk away at the very last moment, if I have to, if something we find is not to our liking. We'll always pay a reasonable price, a fair price for great companies. We may not always be the highest priced buyer, but I think we are often the best buyer because of our effectiveness, our willingness to work aggressively to get things done. And the fact is our organizational structure allows those newly acquired companies to become part of Amphenol in a very unobtrusive fashion. They joined seamlessly. They come in and on day one. They just keep operating like they were doing on all the days before. And that is a relatively low-risk approach to acquisition, because we're not going in and just over -- just sort of having these kind of convulsive restructurings of the company, where you run the risk of destroying what you didn't even know you had. So we look forward to continuing to have great acquisitions in the future, but we're not going to be a kind of a system-level company. We know what we are. We're an interconnect company. There are wonderful opportunities for interconnect products to be expanded, both organically and through acquisition going forward, lots of really attractive companies out there, and we'll continue to position ourselves so the ones that match with us, the ones that go through our really rigorous kind of Rubicon of deciding whether or not to buy them, we'll be in a good position to execute on those over the near, medium and long term. Thanks very much, Chris. Yes. I mean, look, I don't usually talk about book-to-bill by submarkets. But I will tell you that, for sure, I mean, we had very strong bookings in AI-related applications in Q2 and Q3. And so it's not surprising that here in Q4, our IT Datacom book-to-bill was a bit below zero and -- sorry, a bit below one and because of those significant orders that we received, which customers wanted to place because they need the product and then we're executing upon those orders. And yes, I think that our IT Datacom business is in a good position looking forward. I mean our guidance for the first quarter is to have a little moderation, which is not abnormal this time of year, actually quite normal. Let me say that. And layered on top of that, I think the AI is a good thing to have. So no, I think you characterized it quite well. Well, thanks very much, Steve. Yes. I mean, look, in the quarter, we acquired companies who make sensors, antennas, cable and cable assemblies and really high-technology cable actually that has really great value for its customers. And we continue to see acquisition opportunities across really all of our interconnect products from discrete connectors to cable assembly, value-add, complex value-add interconnect products sensors, complex sensor interconnect assemblies, antennas and the like. And we're really pleased to continue to find companies across all of those products. I wouldn't tell you that we think so much about gross margin by product. We see great margin opportunities as you know. And Craig has said it so many times, we're very much focused on operating margins. And yes, I mean, some of these companies do operate below our corporate average, not all of them, by the way, but some of them do. And I think we -- that doesn't relate at all to their product type. We don't believe that there is a correlation between whether someone makes a connector, a sensor and antenna a cable or a cable assembly that, that is necessarily going to put them in a certain bucket of profit potential. We actually see great profit potential for all companies. And that's one of the ways we screen for acquisitions. I mean we're not going to buy a company if we don't see the long-term potential for that company to elevate its profitability to at or above our corporate average. Now, we do have industry-leading margins and so most of the companies that we do acquire tend to be lower than we are. And then it's our job and their job becoming part of the Amphenol family to bring those margins up over time. But it's really not at all correlated to the type of products that they sell. Great. Thanks so much, Matt. Look, I hope what you say is the case. We certainly hope that there is a refresh. Look, I think we've talked about this year and even a little bit last year, that the strength that we've seen in phones this year, which was more than offset, in particular, by things like laptops and tablets. It had to do with the clear fact that during the pandemic and when everybody went to work from home and study from home, there was an enormous rush to buy new devices, which caused a surge and really kind of upset the normal replacement cycle of those products. And so I guess that one could expect that if everybody bought a bunch of stuff in 2020 and 2021 and if those things tend to last three, four, five years, that eventually you would hope to see a little bit of a refresh. I don't know -- I can't tell you I have any information to support that. I'm sure you're getting your information from even wiser sources than I would have. Relative to the content, we do see great content opportunities in these devices as they get more complex, as they get more different wireless standards that they have to support as they have higher speeds, as they have more fine pitch and more precision inside of them, all of these create opportunities for Amphenol long term. We've always said about the mobile device market, and that includes tablets and laptops and the like, that to the extent that there is a premium on the hardware of the product, that can create opportunities for Amphenol over the long-term. And I think that will. Whether that's related to AI or not, that I can't necessarily connect those dots, but for sure, people are going to need new devices in the future, and we'll be happy to enable the interconnect products across those devices. Well, operator, if that was our last question, I guess I'd like to take this opportunity to thank everybody here today for spending a little bit of your time with us. I wish that you all have a good continuation of your winter wherever you may be. And we look forward to talking to all of you just 90 days from now. Thanks so much."

        "content": "Operator: Hello. And welcome to the third quarter Earnings Conference Call for Amphenol Corporation. Following today\u2019s presentation, there will be a formal question-and-answer session. Until then, all lines will remain in a listen-only mode. At the request of the company, today\u2019s conference is being recorded. If anyone has any objection, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to introduce today\u2019s conference host, Mr. Craig Lampo. Sir, you may begin.\nCraig Lampo: Thank you very much. Good afternoon, everyone. This is Craig Lampo, Amphenol\u2019s CFO, and I am here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO. We would like to welcome you to our third quarter 2023 conference call. Our third quarter 2023 results were released this morning. I will provide some financial commentary and then Adam will give an overview of the business and current trends, and then we will take questions. As a reminder, during the call, we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures and make certain forward-looking statements. So please refer to the relevant disclosures in our press release for further information. The company closed the third quarter with sales of $3.199 billion in GAAP and adjusted diluted EPS of $0.83 and $0.78, respectively. Third quarter sales were down 3% in U.S. dollars and low-income currencies and 5% organically compared to the third quarter of 2022. Sequentially sales were up 5% in U.S. dollars, local currencies, and organically. Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes. Orders in the quarter were $3.164 billion, which was flat compared to the third quarter of 2022, and up 4% sequentially, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 0.99 to 1. GAAP operating income was $658 million in the third quarter of 2023, which included $9 million of acquisition-related transaction costs. Excluding these costs, adjusted operating income was $667 million. GAAP and adjusted operating margins were 20.6% and 20.8% respectively in the third quarter. On a GAAP basis, operating margin was down 10 basis points compared to the third quarter of 2022 and increased by 30 basis points sequentially. On an adjusted basis, operating margin decreased by just 20 basis points compared to the third quarter of 2022, but increased by 40 basis points sequentially. This modest year-over-year decreased and adjusted operating margin was primarily due to the dilutive impact of recent acquisitions, which are currently operating well below the corporate average. On an organic basis, we were very pleased with our operating margin performance, which represented a smaller than typical downside conversion on the lower organic sales levels. This strong organic performance reflected the agility of our team in adjusting costs, as well as the continued benefit of pricing actions taken in the prior year. On a sequential basis, the increase in adjusted operating margin reflected strong conversion on the higher sales levels. Our team continued to execute well on the quarter, and we are proud to have sustained these healthy levels of profitability despite the continued range of challenges around the world. Breaking down third quarter results by segment relative to the third quarter of 2022, sales in the harsh environment solution segment were $887 million, an increased by 12% in U.S. dollars and 7% organically. Segment operating margin was 26.9%. Sales in the Communication Solutions segment were $1.279 billion and declined by 16% in the U.S. dollars and organically. Segment operating margin was 22.1%. Sales in the interconnect and sensor system segment were $1.033 billion and increased by 5% in U.S. dollars and 1% organically. Segment operating margin was 18.3%. The company's GAAP effective tax rate for the third quarter was 18.2%, and the adjusted effective tax rate was 24.0%, which compared to 23.1% and 24.5% in the third quarter of 2022 respectively. GAAP diluted EPS was up 4% at $0.83 compared to $0.80 in the prior year period, and on an adjusted basis diluted EPS decreased 3% to $0.78 compared to $0.80 in the third quarter of 2022. This was an excellent result, especially considering the variety of challenges that the company continued to face during the quarter. Operating cash flow in the third quarter was $618 million or 128% of adjusted net income, and net of capital spending, our free cash flow, was $544 million or 112% of adjusted net income. We are pleased to continue to deliver such a strong cash flow yield. From a working capital standpoint, inventory days, day sales outstanding, and payable days were 87, 70, and 52 days respectively, all within the normal levels. As mentioned in today's earnings release, the company's Board of Directors has approved a 5% increase in the company's quarterly dividend to $0.22, effective for payments beginning in January of 2024. During the quarter, the company's repurchased 1.7 million shares of common stock at an average price of approximately $86, and when combined with our normal quarterly dividend, total capital return to shareholders during the third quarter of 2023 was approximately $275 million. Total debt on September 30th was $4.3 billion, and net debt was $2.6 billion. Total liquidity at the end of the quarter was $5 billion, which included cash and short-term investments on hand of $1.7 billion, plus availability under existing credit facilities. Third quarter of 2023 EBITDA was $784 million, and at the end of the third quarter of 2023, our net leverage ratio was 0.8 times. We are very pleased that the company's financial condition remains extremely strong by any measure. I will now turn the call over to Adam, who will provide some commentary on current market trends.\nAdam Norwitt: Well, Craig, thank you very much, and I'd like to extend my welcome to everybody on the phone here today, and I hope that you're all having an enjoyable fall so far. It's a pleasure here in Wallingford to see the beautiful orange and red hues out of our windows. As Craig mentioned, I'm going to highlight our third quarter achievements, then discuss our trends and progress across our diversified end markets, and then I'll comment on our outlook for the fourth quarter and for the full year of 2023. Turning to the third quarter, our results in the third quarter were better than expected. As we exceeded the high end of our guidance in sales and adjusted diluted earnings per share, sales declined by 3% in U.S. dollars and local currencies, reaching just under $3.2 billion, with growth in the commercial air, military, and automotive end markets, as well as contributions from our acquisitions, which were more than offset by moderations in the mobile networks, mobile devices, IT Datacom, broadband, and industrial end markets. On an organic basis, sales declined by 5%, but sales did increase sequentially by 5% from second quarter levels. We're pleased that the company booked orders of $3.164 billion, and that represented a book-to-bill of 0.99 to 1. I'm especially encouraged that our orders in the third quarter did exceed prior year levels, and that's an encouraging sign going forward. Profitability was very strong in the quarter. We generated adjusted operating margins of 20.8%, and that was down just 20 basis points from prior year. Sequentially our margins improved by 40 basis points, and as Craig already mentioned, these operating margins in the third quarter reflected just outstanding execution by our global management team, who continued to manage dynamically and effectively, even in the face of moderating sales. Adjusted diluted EPS in the quarter was $0.78, and that declined just 3% from prior year, and increased by a strong 8% on a sequential basis. Then finally, we're very pleased with the company's cash flow generation in the quarter with operating and free cash flow of $618 million and $544 million respectively in the third quarter, clear demonstrations of the high quality of Amphenol's earnings. I come out of this quarter extremely proud of the Amphenol's team, and I'll just say that our results this quarter once again reflect the discipline and agility of our entrepreneurial organization as we continue to perform well amidst the dynamic and challenging environment. Our acquisition team has been extremely busy this year so far, and I'm really pleased that since our last earnings call, we've closed on three acquisitions, Connor Manufacturing, Q Microwave, and XMA Corporation. In addition, we've signed an agreement to acquire PCTEL. Since its headquarters in Illinois, Connor is a global manufacturer of power interconnect products, including especially high voltage bus bars for the automotive and industrial markets with annual sales of approximately $100 million. Based in California, Q Microwave is a designer and manufacturer of mission critical radio frequency components utilized in military platforms with annual sales of approximately $20 million. And based in New Hampshire, XMA is also a provider of RF components for the military as well as the IT Datacom market with annual sales of approximately $15 million. We're very pleased that we signed a definitive agreement to acquire PCTEL. PCTEL is a leading global provider of antennas for a broad array of markets, as well as purpose-built industrial IoT products and testing measurement solutions. We expect the PCTEL transaction to close by early 2024. I'm very excited to welcome the Conner, Q Microwave, and XMA teams to Amphenol, and I certainly look forward to welcoming the PCTEL team once that deal closes. Most importantly, I remain confident that our acquisition program will continue to create great value for the company. In fact, our ability to identify and execute upon acquisitions and then to successfully bring these companies into our entrepreneurial organization, this remains a core competitive advantage for Amphenol. Now, turning to our serve markets, we're very pleased that the company's end-market exposure remains highly diversified, balanced, and broad, and that creates great value for the company, particularly amidst these dynamic times. So, turning to each of our serve markets, the military market represented 11% of our sales in the quarter. Sales grew from prior year by a very strong 26% in U.S. dollars and 22% organically, and this was really driven by broad base strength across virtually every segment of the military market. Sequentially, our sales grew by 3%, which was better than our expectations coming into the quarter. And as we look into the fourth quarter, we expect sales to remain roughly at these robust third quarter levels, and for the full year 2023, we expect a high-teens increase in sales from prior year. With the acquisition last quarter of both Q Microwave and XMA, we further broadened our industry leading RF product offering into this important defense market. And in general, we remain encouraged by the company's strengthened position across the defense industry, where we continue to offer the market's widest range of high technology interconnect products. Amidst today's dynamic geopolitical environment, countries around the world are expanding their investments in both current and next generation defense technologies, thereby increasing the long-term demand potential for Amphenol. We're going to continue to accelerate our new product development while also increasing our capacity, and thus are well-positioned to support this increased demand long into the future. The commercial aerospace market represented 4% of our sales in the quarter, had another really strong quarter with sales increasing by a very robust 40% from prior year and 37% organically. And this was driven by broad-based strength across all aircraft applications. On a sequential basis, sales did decline by just 1%, and that was a bit better than our expectations coming into the quarter. As we look into the fourth quarter, we now expect a modest seasonal sequential decline in sales. And for the full year 2023, we expect sales to increase in the mid 30% range compared to 2022. I'm truly proud of our team working in the commercial air market. With the ongoing recovery and travel and thus demand for jetliners, our efforts to strengthen our breadth of high technology interconnect products while diversifying our market position into next generation aircraft are paying real dividends. We look forward to realizing the benefits of these initiatives for many years to come. The industrial market represented 24% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in the quarter did decline by 6% in U.S. dollars and 13% organically as growth in medical, oil and gas and rail mass transit applications was more than offset by declines in other segments of the industrial market. I did want to highlight that our sales into the distribution channel were particularly soft in the third quarter as many distributors have taken steps to reduce their inventory positions in the industrial market. Sequentially sales declined by 4% from the second quarter, which was somewhat worse than our expectations coming into the quarter. Looking into the fourth quarter, we expect sales to moderate slightly from these third quarter levels. And for the full year 2023, we expect sales to be roughly flat versus prior year as some organic moderations are offset by the benefit of our acquisitions. Despite this near-term demand pause in the industrial market, I continue to remain so proud of our outstanding global team working in this important area. They continue to pursue growth opportunities across the many exciting segments of this truly diverse market. And I remain confident that our long-term strategy to expand our high technology interconnect, antenna and sensor offering, both organically and through complementary acquisitions, has positioned us to capitalize on the many revolutions that will no doubt continue to occur across the industrial electronics market. The automotive market represented 23% of our sales in the quarter, and sales grew by a very robust 13% in U.S. dollars and 12% organically. This was driven by broad-based strength across most automotive applications, including electric and hybrid electric vehicle platforms. Sequentially, our sales increase by 7% from the second quarter, and this was much better than our expectations that we had coming into 3Q. For the fourth quarter, we expect sales to remain roughly at these levels, and for the full year 2023, we expect sales to increase by approximately 10% compared to prior year. I'm really proud of our team working in the automotive market. Their performance so far this year is yet another confirmation of the benefits of their focus on driving new design wins with customers who are implementing a wide array of new technologies into their vehicles, including electrified drivetrains, as well as a multitude of other exciting new applications. With the addition of Connor to the Amphenol family, we now have an even broader array of products for global electric vehicle manufacturers, and we look forward to benefiting from this position for many years to come. The mobile device market represented 10% of our sales in the quarter and our sales moderated by 20% in U.S. dollars and 18% organically, as strong growth in smartphones was more than offset by declining sales of products that are incorporated into laptops, tablets, and wearables. On a sequential basis, our sales increased by a much stronger than expected 25%, and that was really driven by higher than expected sales in smartphones and wearables. Looking to the fourth quarter, we expect sales to moderate in the high single digits sequentially. As strong growth in smartphones, we expect to be more than offset by continued declines in laptops and wearables. For the full year, we anticipate sales to decline in the mid-teens compared to 2022. While there's no question that mobile devices remains our most volatile and market, our team once again in the third quarter did an outstanding job of capitalizing on opportunities to realize incremental sales. Their agility and ability to adjust resources in real time with the changing levels of demand continues to create value for Amphenol. As we head into the end of 2023, our team stands poised as always to leverage their leading array of antennas, interconnect products, and mechanisms to capture any opportunities for incremental sales that may arise this year and beyond. The mobile networks market represented 3% of our sales in the quarter. Sales declined by 35% in U.S. dollars and 43% organically as we continued to manage through a broad base reduction in spending by network operators and wireless equipment manufacturers. On a sequential basis, our sales declined by 6%, which was a bit worse than our expectations coming into the quarter. For the fourth quarter, we expect sales to decline in the mid to high single digits sequentially, and for the full year, we anticipate moderation sales in the sort of mid 20% range versus 2022. Despite this more challenging short-term wireless investment environment, our team continues to work aggressively to realize the benefits of our efforts to expand our position in next generation 5G equipment and networks around the world. When customers once again drive renewed investments in these next generation systems, we look forward to benefiting from the increased potential that comes from Amphenol's unique position with both equipment manufacturers and mobile service providers. The IT datacom market represented 20% of our sales in the quarter, and while sales did decline by 12% in U.S. dollars and organically from prior year, our performance in the quarter was actually much better than we'd expected 90 days ago. In fact, on a sequential basis, our sales increased by a strong 13% in the third quarter, much better than previous expectations. The growth in our sales from the second quarter was driven by an accelerating surge in demand from customers who are making significant investments in AI data centers. We also continued to see robust orders for AI related applications, a confirmation of our team's success in positioning Amphenol as a leader in the complex interconnect systems that support alternative intelligence or artificial intelligence. As we look towards the fourth quarter, we expect sales to remain at these third quarter levels, and for the full year 2023, we expect the mid-teens decline in sales compared to prior year. While we've certainly had to manage through the inventory adjustments in the broader IT market, I am more encouraged than ever by the company's position in the global IT datacom industry. This revolution in AI is creating a true and unique opportunity for Amphenol, given our leading high-speed and power interconnect products. With machine learning applications driving a more intensive usage of our highest technology interconnect products, we're very well-positioned for the future. In addition, our team just continued to do an outstanding job developing leading high-speed power and fiber optic interconnect products that are enabling our OEM and web service provider customers to continue to drive their equipment and networks to higher levels of performance. This creates a continued long-term opportunity for the company. Finally, the broadband market represented 5% of our sales in the quarter, and sales were down 8% in U.S. dollars and organically as broadband operators continued to moderate their procurement levels. On a sequential basis, sales were down by 6% in line with our expectations coming into the quarter. For the fourth quarter, we expect the modest sequential increase in sales, and for the full year 2023, we expect sales to decline in the mid-single digits from prior year. Regardless of the current demand dynamics, we remain encouraged by the company's position in the broadband market. We look forward to continuing to support our service provider customers around the world, all of whom are working to increase their network coverage and bandwidth to support the proliferation of high-speed data applications to homes and businesses. In addition, we're very well-positioned to benefit from the broad array of government-funded initiatives, particularly in North America, thereby giving us confidence for the future. Now, turning to our outlook, there's no question that the current economic environment remains uncertain, and assuming market conditions do not meaningfully worsen, and also assuming constant exchange rates. For the fourth quarter, we expect sales in the range of $3.090 billion to $3.150 billion, and adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $0.75 to $0.77. This would represent a sales decline of 3% to 5%, and an adjusted diluted EPS decline of 1% to 4% compared to prior year. Our fourth quarter guidance also represents an expectation for full-year sales of $12.317 billion to $12.377 billion, and full-year adjusted diluted EPS of $2.94 to $2.96. This outlook represents full-year sales and adjusted EPS declines of 2% and 1% to 2%, respectively. I'm very confident in the ability of our outstanding management team to adapt to the many opportunities and challenges in the current dynamic environment, and to continue to grow Amphenol's market position while also driving strong profitability. In addition, I just want to reiterate that our entire Amphenol team around the world remains committed to delivering long-term sustainable value. And I would like to finally take this opportunity to thank each and every one of our 90,000 employees around the world for their truly outstanding efforts here in the third quarter. And with that operator, we'd be very happy to take any questions.\nOperator: The question-and-answer period will now begin. Please limit to one question per follower. Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Your line is open.\nAmit Daryanani: Thanks a lot. I guess, Adam, maybe for you, I hope you can just talk a little bit about, what are you hearing from your customers broadly? And really on the industrial side, given the ongoing macro-voluntary, I hope you talk about the distributors side is somewhat weaker, but what are you hearing from the OEM or the trend that OEM is much different than what you're seeing in the channel? And how do you see that kind of pan out maybe into December quarter and beyond that, especially if you think about the inventory normalization?\nAdam Norwitt: Amit, thank you very much. Yes, I think when we look at the industrial market, I mean, the beauty of our industrial business is we have a very broad presence across, really every segment of the industrial market. And we did see some of those segments actually performing very strongly. I highlighted that we saw a very robust growth in oil and gas and rail mass transit, so strong growth in medical applications, heavy equipment, another one. But then there's other segments of the market where, which were down. And I think some of those have been pretty widely reported areas like factory automation, alternative energy, which seems to be having a little bit of a pause in the investment cycle for a variety of reasons. But by and large, our OEM business was only modestly down. And it was really the bigger impact here was the impact from the distribution channel, who it turns out, feels that they have a little bit too much inventory right now. And we started to see some signs of that maybe coming into the quarter. And I think it maybe accelerated a little bit through the quarter. And our guidance as we look out into the fourth quarter certainly incorporates a continued adjustment by our distributors in particular, as well as some on the OEM side as well. And that's what's envisioned in our sort of modest sequential moderation that is implied in our guidance. How long will that last? We certainly, 90 days from now, we'll try to give a good sense of what it looks like at least in the first quarter of next year. I would expect that it's hard to predict. But the underlying electrification and electrification of the industrial market broadly, that has not slowed down. I think, yes, there are certain things like Semicap and others where there's a bit of a digestion period right now. But we continue to see an enormous array of new innovations, new programs, new applications across the breadth of our industrial market. And I think we've built such a broad offering of interconnect products, sensors, antennas, that wherever those next revolutions are going to be in industrial, there's no doubt that Amphenol is going to be well represented there. So, I view this as a bit of a pause. I don't take an overly macro view of what's happening right now. I understand that some may look at industrial as sort of a macro proxy. And maybe there are certain areas like the German industrial market, which is really where more of the factory automation that could have a little bit more linkage between that. But the general trend of more electronics, more content being driven across all these areas of the industrial market is something that we don't see slowing down. And so, as we get into next year, we'll certainly try to give a good read on where that looks like 90 days from now. But we feel really good about our overall position in the industrial market despite this pause today.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Chris Snyder with UBS. You may go ahead.\nChris Snyder: Thank you. I wanted to ask on the IT datacom market. It came in much better than what you guys were expecting three months ago. It sounds like a big part of that is the AI demand search that you referenced, Adam. So, can we maybe just talk about how the AI business is ramping? If there's anything you could provide to us around the size of the business today and any sort of outlook that we could think about into next year, because it does sound like the orders remain quite robust. And then, just kind of staying on IT datacom, any update on the broader, the non AI part of the business. Do you feel like that piece is kind of gotten through the inventory correction that's been going on since really, I guess, the back half of last year? Thank you.\nAdam Norwitt: Thanks very much, Chris. Appreciate it. Look, I think we're really excited about where we are with our customers in AI. And I'll just put some historical perspective on this. I mean, we've been working on the innovation of products that ultimately support AI for many, many years. This is not like, all of a sudden, something like ChatGPT shows up in the newspaper and we started frantically developing products. We've been working with customers for a long time on the type of products that uniquely are required for an AI processing system. And we talked a little bit about this 90 days ago, but the nature of an AI system, the fact that it is a neural network based system, where you have these very high power chips that all have to talk to each other across a fabric like architecture, just means that there's a uniquely larger component of interconnect to allow those shifts to ultimately talk to each other. And the requirements of that, those interconnect products, both from a speed, a latency perspective, not even to mention the significant power requirements that go into these AI data centers, which consume dramatically higher levels of power, and thereby require higher technology, higher efficiency types of power interconnect to ensure that these AI data centers aren't just chewing up all the electricity in America, for example. These are really challenging and exciting opportunities where we've been investing in new product development for many, many years. It's clearly ramping. I talked about the fact that really, I would say all of our sequential growth from Q2 to Q3 came from AI. And as you recall, we had already a decent amount of AI business in the second quarter. And we don't split that out. We already talked about end markets, and we don't necessarily talk about every little sub component of that. But I would just tell you that it's a very significant opportunity for the company long-term, medium-term, and short-term as it's really driving that sequential growth that we've seen both in the second quarter and then the follow on sequential growth that we got here in the third quarter. What is the long-term of AI going to be? I don't think anybody knows the answer to that. But I think we all know that it's going to change a lot of things. And there's no doubt that the investments that are being put into these AI data centers, which are not -- these are not amounts that are for the faint of heart. They're going to really have dramatic impact on a lot of the ways that we interface and interact with and use data networks and data systems. And we're just really excited to be able to play our portion of that to enable these next generation systems. As it relates to the kind of non-AI and the inventory correction that we certainly have talked about for nearly four quarters, I would tell you that as we look into the fourth quarter, I think we feel that it's largely behind us, that inventory correction. Now, you could also say that some of the AI investments are \u201ccannibalizing\u201d some of the non-AI investments. I think there's plenty of people discussing from that vein. But I think the inventory positions have become much healthier today. And now it's all about investing in this exciting new revolution of AI and figuring out how to do that in effective fashion. And from an interconnect perspective, we're really standing right there in the front of the line, making sure that our customers have what they need.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from Luke Junk with Baird. You may go ahead.\nLuke Junk: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Adam, you've done what I would consider to be a few higher degree of difficulty deals in the past couple of years, namely a public company and MTS and heavier cost work with RFS. And now another public company in your agreement to acquire PCTEL. Just wondering how much new muscle, if you will, the organization has grown, in terms of integrating deals like this, especially public companies. And just what it might mean for the acquisition funnel going forward in terms of the prospects that you're looking at? Thank you.\nAdam Norwitt: Yes, Luke. Thanks. It's actually a really great question. I mean, if I go back, everybody on the phone will recall that it was the beginning of 2022 when we evolved our organization and created now three global divisions, which are reportable segments. And then under those global divisions, initially 12 and now 13 operating groups. And each of those operating groups is run by just an outstanding group general manager. I think in my career, I was a general manager, then I was a group general manager myself before I came here to headquarters nearly 17 years ago. And those group general managers run very significant businesses. They're deeply involved in the operations of the company and they're deeply involved in the identification, the assessment and ultimately the welcoming of these new companies to Amphenol. And we now have just a broader platform of extraordinarily capable individuals. I've talked many times about how I view kind of my priorities as a CEO of this company. And I view them really twofold. One is to be the protector of our culture, that unique entrepreneurial culture that I believe is really second to none in its value and its impact on our results. And the second is to ensure the scalability of that culture so that we can grow as a company really in perpetuity. And, I joined a quarter of a century ago, we were less than a billion dollars in sales, but the culture was identical. It was general managers around the world who have full authority to run their businesses and ultimately can be held accountable. Therefore, today we've gone from when I joined the company less than 20 to today around 130 of those general managers and we've scaled the organization in support of that. And that's why today we have the three global divisions and the 13 groups. And that has included as well our acquisition program. Because if you go back in time and look back, we always used to talk about M&A representing roughly a third of our growth over the long-term. And we would always get questions, well, as you grow, that means you either have to do more acquisitions or bigger acquisitions. And I think I've consistently said, well, that's right, arithmetically, and we will do and we have done both of those things, both more deals and bigger ones. And we've acquired 26 companies so far since the beginning of 2019. That has included our first ever public company that has now -- we have now announced the signing of our second public company. RFS is one that maybe requires a little more, but you go back even 10 years when we acquired the sensor company from GE, which has been a fabulously successful acquisition and will celebrate just in a couple of months here, the 10th anniversary of that acquisition. We acquired, you'll recall, FCI, which requires, a little bit more work to align FCI into the Amphenol approach of entrepreneurial general managers. So I tell you that our muscle has grown commensurate with the scale of the company and our ability to do acquisitions, large, small, private, public, whatever you may say, all of that ability has remained very strong. And then the last thing I'll say is if you look at our balance sheet, I mean, we came out of this quarter with leverage of only .8 times. We have enormous availability of capital. We have cash flow that is really at, close to historical levels. I mean, free cash flow that is 17% of our sales in the quarter. And all of the financial means of doing the acquisitions together with the organizational means are all there. But I'll say one thing, we will always stay disciplined. We are a company that is always true to our principles. We're not just going to become a little private equity company. We're not going to be a holding company. We're not going to go out and buy bad companies, run by bad people. We're always going to look for the same criteria for acquisitions that I've talked about for many years. Number one, we want great people. Number two, we want great product technology. And number three, an outstanding market position. We got all three of those with the acquisitions of Conner, Q Microwave, and XMA. And I'm sure we'll do the same with PCTEL. And we'll continue to be very disciplined as we go forward at the same time as we have a real larger aperture of capabilities to continue to do M&A at the levels that we'd like to.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from Andrew Buscaglia with BNP Paribas. You may go ahead.\nAndrew Buscaglia: Hey, guys. Nice to meet you and thanks for taking my question.\nAdam Norwitt: Yes. Nice to meet you too, Andrew.\nAndrew Buscaglia: So, yes, So, I want to start off with the automotive market, just given the size of it, you definitely some skittishness with investors heading into the quarter into year-end. On two areas, within North America, you got the worker strike, what's the ripple effect on that? And then, just weakness in China, China auto too. But you guys continue to outperform. So, I'm just -- my question is, when peaking around the corner, do you have concerns that you guys can maintain, your out-performance relative to the overall market? And can you kind of dig into some of the details around what you're hearing from customers in each of the markets?\nAdam Norwitt: Yes. Well, Andrew, thanks again and welcome to the, welcome to the call here. Not so often we get a new analyst. So, it's a pleasure to have you here. Look, the automotive market is a really exciting one for the company. I'm just so proud of our team working in the automotive market, results that they've driven in what has not been an easy environment, quite the contrary. Growing last quarter by 12% organically, I mean, you will recall that last year we grew by 29% organically in a market that was essentially flat to down in units. And if you look at the long-term performance of our automotive company over the nearly 15 years that I've been CEO, I still remember very well, my first quarter is CEO. And, by the way, this is my 60th of these earnings calls as CEO. In my first one of those, we had an automotive business that was 5% and our overall sales were $660 million that quarter. So, that's $33 million, $35 million, and here we are this quarter at close to $3.2 billion in our automotive market, 23% of sales. And I think we've just done a fabulous job over those years, not of taking market share out of the hands of incumbents, but of enabling new electronic systems as they were adopted in cars over that decade and a half. And I think you've just seen a collection of revolutions in the automotive industry, the most prominent and most recent of which being the electrification of vehicles. But that's not the only thing. I mean, there's so many new systems being put into these cars. And each time there's an opportunity for us to intersect those with high technology interconnect sensors and antennas. And I think our team's done a great job of that. How is that going to go into 2024? Again, I think I said this already on the call, nine days from now we'll try to give everybody a decent sense of where we think at least the beginning of 2024 is headed. But I say no reason to say that we will not continue to maintain our outperformance that we have been so consistently delivering really over a decade and a half during this time period. I'm just really proud of our team working on automotive and I'm really pleased with the broad array of technologies for all these exciting new applications in the car.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. You may go ahead.\nWamsi Mohan: Yes. Thank you so much. Adam or Craig, I was wondering if you could talk about some of the puts and takes on operating margins as we look out over the next quarter. At the midpoint of the revenue guide, you would be absorbing almost $24 million of decremental margins of operating profit and you're also absorbing impact of M&A from three new deals and three prior deals. So when we look at your guide, it's clearly reflecting a much better outlook than that. So A, is the assumption around decremental margins, still the same as historical or have you made changes in the business that's creating less lower decremental margins? And B, as we think about sort of that operating guide, which is so resilient, what are some of the other drivers that are enabling you to do that? Thank you.\nCraig Lampo: Thanks, Wamsi. I appreciate the question. I think if you look at our profitability in 2023 and certainly here in the third quarter and I'll talk about the fourth quarter in a minute or two. I wouldn't say there's certainly no changes in regards to how we think about decremental margins in the long-term, but 2023, a few things have happened and certainly we've done a great job of. Number one, we're benefiting a bit from pricing and no particular order here, but we're certainly benefiting a bit from pricing that we did last year in 2022 and we did a call, we talked a bit about the work we did last year, the catch up with the inflationary environment that kind of by the third quarter into the fourth quarter of last year, the majority of the work we were pretty much back to kind of where we wanted to be and expected to be from a balance between price and cost perspective. So, we're certainly still benefiting on a year-over-year basis from that. In addition, I think we've just executed very well, certainly some of the markets that we've seen a reduction from and certainly communications markets, ID datacom being the biggest of them. We certainly have done a really great job of kind of offsetting some of those declines just from just great execution. And if you actually look at the over year-over-year margins and you take out some of the acquisitions impacts, we actually are well under those decremental margins that we typically would target. But I'd say, those are one of the two kind of bigger things that really are impacting it. I mean, 20.8% here in the third quarter is not quite a record, but certainly given the market mix in terms of the challenges that we've had from the ups and downs of a growth price perspective, not mix of margin from a market, because we don't have a significant margin range from a market, but just the mix of the growth that we've had, the ups and downs, it really has -- really been a, I think, great execution on the team's part to be able to manage that. So, as we look forward into the fourth quarter, I think our implied guidance would be that we continue to have these strong margins into the fourth quarter and that are offsetting some of the acquisitions that do clearly have lower than average margin levels and that we're working to get up to the company average over time, but no doubt we're really proud of it. I think the longer term kind of decremental margins haven't changed from this 30%, but I think this year, given a few of the factors I mentioned, I think has really benefited us and certainly we're proud of it. And these are the margins we should be at these revenue levels and we're going to continue to strive to do better.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. You may go ahead.\nSamik Chatterjee: Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I guess on a more broader level, Adam, you have a fairly diversified business and there are many puts and takes in terms of where the different markets are. Some are recovering, some are still at a lower level, but you've managed to grow orders year-over-year, as you pointed out, despite that dynamic here. I'm just wondering like how should we translate that into thinking about the order growth translating into revenue growth in the near term. More curious, because your revenue numbers for the last couple of quarters have been above the order number, but the guide seems to be more in line with what you reported for orders. So, how should we think about the opportunity to return to revenue growth since orders are already higher year-over-year? Thank you.\nAdam Norwitt: Yes, well, thank you very much, Samik. I mean, look, I think we just talked about the auto market and we've been consistently outperforming the overall auto, whatever you want to call it, unit volumes or whatever markets that you want to talk about. I guess when we talk about orders from year-over-year perspective, more broadly in the company, yes, we were this quarter on a year-over-year basis higher in our orders than last year, and that was the first time in four quarters. And I think that that should translate eventually to year-over-year growth. I think we've guided for next quarter in a certain way, and we're going to keep fighting for that and we'll guide for the first quarter at the same time when we come to that 90 days from now, and you can imagine that our team is very focused on returning to growth, and we don't love having it be down this quarter. We don't like having it be down next quarter, and we don't like having it be down last quarter either, and there's a whole Amphenol team around us that's fighting for that. When you look across our end markets, one of the beauties of the diversification of the company is that we have end markets which are growing substantially already, and we have others though which are down because of the various reasons that we've talked about. And so, when you think about, for example, IT datacom which was down quite significantly last quarter, I think it was something like 20%, 24% or so, and then this quarter down 12%, I think at our current guidance, that would be pretty close to prior year, plus or minus. And so that's a sign, I think, of that returning to the growth trajectory that we would for sure look forward to seeing across the company.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs. You may go ahead.\nMark Delaney: Yes. Good afternoon and thank you very much for taking my question. I have one on mobile networks. Do you think 6G is needed for that business to reaccelerate, or can other opportunities like Open RAN, Industrial 5G, and Wireless 5 Band to be enough for the catalyst, and perhaps some combination of those along with the inventory reductions?\nCraig Lampo: Hey, Mark, Good to hear your voice. Look, I think 6G will come one day, but we still haven't even invested totally in 5G. So, when I think about how the mobile networks market tends to go. And I've been around long enough working in the wireless market, long enough that I've seen 1G, 2G, 3G, 4G, and now 5G, and I have a decent sense of how that works. Generally what happen is there's an initial investment of that new generation. And then the operators digest and figure out the economics of it, because these are significant investments that they make. And if they can't figure out how to monetize that incremental investment, that's a challenge. I think the 5G, there's a lot of work going on to figure out how to monetize that. But I think there's a separate question. And that is, yes, this is a tough period for the wireless market. You've seen all the releases over the last several days, and the capital spending of the big operators here in the U.S, which is all down in the kind of 20% to 30% range, the equipment manufacturers in some cases down even more in this region at least, and certainly our business down on an organic basis as it was by 43%,. And I think we're in that digestion period of that new technology, but there's still a very modest proportion of the build out that has become truly 5G. And I don't know what the number is, is it 15%, is it 20%, but it's certainly not 50%, it's certainly not 60%, 70%, 80%. I mean, we're still, I believe, in the early innings of the 5G, and I think people are just taking kind of a third inning stretch on this right now to figure out how to make more money from the system. But if you think about what's going on in data more broadly, think about AI, think about video, think about all the extraordinarily bandwidth, hungry applications that continue to proliferate, accelerate, and be used everywhere you go. I mean, it's actually unbelievable when you see how data is being consumed and where it's being consumed. I watch my kids, who used to -- my son is a gamer, and he used to only game on his computer at home. Well, now he can be moving around, and he can be in the car, and he can be gaming and playing with all these strange creatures that they play with, I mean, really strange names, things like J\u00f6rmungandr [ph] and things like this, and weird things like that. And like, all these crazy, crazy things that you can do that are not connected to a cable, not connected to a desktop. And so when you think about the mobile internet and mobility of data long-term, I see no doubt that there's going to be continued acceleration and drive for next generation ways for people to do this. And when we look at our company's position here, we have a very unique position. We're one of the only companies who operate directly with the operators, as well as directly with the OEMs. And that puts us in a very unique position as they go about driving their systems to next generation capabilities. And I think the acquisition that we made of RFS earlier this year, other acquisitions that we've made put us in a really strong position. And yes, it's a tough quarter or two, and a pause of a year, but no doubt in my mind that long-term, the mobile networks market is going to be great.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from Will Stein with Truist Securities. You may go ahead.\nWill Stein: Great. Thanks for taking my questions, and congrats on the strong results and good outlook. Adam, I'm wondering if you can comment on the test and measurement part of PCTEL. You had this situation with a prior acquisition where there was a test and measurement equipment business bundled into it, which at the time you said did not fit in the portfolio. I wonder if it fits in this case?\nAdam Norwitt: Yes, well, thanks very much, and look, we're really excited about the PCTEL acquisition, and PCTEL, we've known them for many, many years as a really broad and very successful antenna company, probably a little too small to be a public company, and that's certainly one thing I would say. And yes, they have a small test and measurement business, but we're really excited about this company, and we look forward to working to bring it to its closure, and I probably wouldn't say more about it given that we've just signed the deal.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from Steven Fox with Fox Advisors. You may go ahead.\nSteven Fox: Hi, good afternoon. I was wondering if I could get a little bit more color on the smaller M&A deals that you did during the course of the series on RF, it seems Adam, you already have such a great position in RF. I can't imagine what else you need to acquire. And then secondly, on busbars, which it seems like busbars, it's a sleepy technology that's getting more attention lately. Can you talk about why you did those deals? Thanks.\nAdam Norwitt: Yes, thanks, Steve. I really appreciate the question. Yes, I mean, look, XMA and Q Microwave are fabulous companies. They're certainly at a smaller scale for now you can imagine that we have high expectations for them over the long-term. And you correctly stated, we have really the broadest position in RF interconnect technology. And these companies bring us, just as we've gone a little bit into active optics, these companies bring us a little bit extra in RF that we can offer to our customers, a little bit more conditioning capabilities in the RF interconnect products. And that's something, especially in the mil aero market that we see as being a really important part of our interconnect offering to our customers in mil aero, and I think that's really exciting. Busbars is an area that we've been in for gosh, almost the whole of my career. I remember 23 years ago or so when I was a general manager, and we were making one of our first busbars at the time, and we've been involved in busbars in the telecom industry. We've been involved in bus bars in IT. We've made great acquisitions. You'll recall the acquisition of OXCEL [ph] several years ago, which brought us more into the industrial market. And what we really like about Conner, is Conner brings us really solidly into the busbar market in the automotive market in particular around EVs. And while we have today an outstanding offering of high voltage interconnect products that are used in EVs. There's no doubt that a compliment to that is the busbar systems that are used also to move the energy around the car. And Conner just does a fabulous job there. We're just really excited to have them. And it's a continued expansion of the reach of the interconnect system, making sure that our core technologies that we have, we have them in every one of the end markets where those find favor. And I think Conner is a wonderful piece of that puzzle.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Matt Sheerin with Stifel. You may go ahead.\nMatt Sheerin: Yes. Thank you and good afternoon, everyone. Adam, I'm hoping you can comment a little further on mobile device business. You called out relative strength in smartphones and wearables, but continued weakness on PCs and notebooks. And we're hearing from some other suppliers and part of the supply chain that things are bottoming there and some of the players in Taiwan are starting to see some signs of a recovery there. Do you have any visibility in terms of your customers as you get into next year in terms of the refresh cycle and other things?\nAdam Norwitt: Yes. Thanks very much, Matt. I think you correctly stated the case here, which is, we've actually had a pretty good year in smartphones and our team's done a fabulous job there. But no doubt there's been a digestion period in the other devices in particular, the devices like tablets and laptops and the like. And I think what we've seen over this pandemic impacted kind of last four years is there was an unusual surge and a kind of disruption of the normal buying patterns of these devices, because when everybody got sent home either to work or to study or however they wanted to interact, they had to get new devices to do that. And there was just a massive surge in the consumption of those devices at the end of the day. And I think there's still a digestion from that. What is it going to be next year? I mean, look, I have a hard time guiding this market 90 days out. I'm generally wrong when I do that, and I certainly wouldn't get ahead of my speed and try to guide it for next year. But of course, at some point, that digestion of that surge of demand for those kind of devices, you would hope would normalize and I would expect that it would normalize that. I mean, I know for sure my own devices, I'm probably getting them. I run them a little longer than most, because we're pretty cost conscious here at Amphenol. But even a couple of my devices, I'm starting to think about whether I need to get a new one.\nOperator: Thank you. Our last question comes from Joe Giordano with TD Cowen. You may go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hey, good afternoon. This is Michael on for Joe.\nAdam Norwitt: Good afternoon, Michael.\nUnidentified Analyst: So recently, there's been a few like noteworthy EV and like semi-plant construction or equipment delays. So we're just curious on how like the cadence of these projects influence internal decision making or guidance, whatnot?\nCraig Lampo: Yes. I mean, look, we read all the same papers, and I think, individual plants may be accelerated or delayed at a given time. And I wouldn't think that, an individual announcement doesn't really have a dramatic impact on our overall business. But look, I did talk about in particular one area, which is the semiconductor capital equipment market, which I think if you asked everybody a year ago, and I\u2019d say everybody except for maybe the two of us sitting here, they would have said, oh, this will never, ever have a cycle ever again. And sure enough, here we are this year, and there is a bit of a cycle in semi-cap equipment. We have a really strong position there. We've done a great job to position ourselves long-term as really an interconnect supplier of choice to that market. And clearly, I mentioned earlier that we did see a moderation of our sales into semi-cap equipment as part of our industrial market. I don't think that's because of any individual plant. But I'd say that that is more related to I think a bit of a pause in the capital spending of some of the larger semiconductor manufacturers. EV related, I think we still see that market is pretty strong. We had a really strong performance in our automotive market last quarter. And again, 90 days from now, we'll see what that looks like next year. But I wouldn't necessarily point to any specific things related to EV factories being built or not being built.\nAdam Norwitt: Well, operator, I think that's our last question. And once again, on behalf of Craig and I and our whole 90,000 team around the world, we'd like to just thank everybody for your time today. We wish you all the best and wish that you and your families all stay safe. Thanks so much.\nCraig Lampo: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you for attending today's conference. And have a nice day.",

            "name": "Craig Lampo",
            "content": "Thank you very much. Good afternoon, everyone. This is Craig Lampo, Amphenol\u2019s CFO, and I am here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO. We would like to welcome you to our third quarter 2023 conference call. Our third quarter 2023 results were released this morning. I will provide some financial commentary and then Adam will give an overview of the business and current trends, and then we will take questions. As a reminder, during the call, we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures and make certain forward-looking statements. So please refer to the relevant disclosures in our press release for further information. The company closed the third quarter with sales of $3.199 billion in GAAP and adjusted diluted EPS of $0.83 and $0.78, respectively. Third quarter sales were down 3% in U.S. dollars and low-income currencies and 5% organically compared to the third quarter of 2022. Sequentially sales were up 5% in U.S. dollars, local currencies, and organically. Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes. Orders in the quarter were $3.164 billion, which was flat compared to the third quarter of 2022, and up 4% sequentially, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 0.99 to 1. GAAP operating income was $658 million in the third quarter of 2023, which included $9 million of acquisition-related transaction costs. Excluding these costs, adjusted operating income was $667 million. GAAP and adjusted operating margins were 20.6% and 20.8% respectively in the third quarter. On a GAAP basis, operating margin was down 10 basis points compared to the third quarter of 2022 and increased by 30 basis points sequentially. On an adjusted basis, operating margin decreased by just 20 basis points compared to the third quarter of 2022, but increased by 40 basis points sequentially. This modest year-over-year decreased and adjusted operating margin was primarily due to the dilutive impact of recent acquisitions, which are currently operating well below the corporate average. On an organic basis, we were very pleased with our operating margin performance, which represented a smaller than typical downside conversion on the lower organic sales levels. This strong organic performance reflected the agility of our team in adjusting costs, as well as the continued benefit of pricing actions taken in the prior year. On a sequential basis, the increase in adjusted operating margin reflected strong conversion on the higher sales levels. Our team continued to execute well on the quarter, and we are proud to have sustained these healthy levels of profitability despite the continued range of challenges around the world. Breaking down third quarter results by segment relative to the third quarter of 2022, sales in the harsh environment solution segment were $887 million, an increased by 12% in U.S. dollars and 7% organically. Segment operating margin was 26.9%. Sales in the Communication Solutions segment were $1.279 billion and declined by 16% in the U.S. dollars and organically. Segment operating margin was 22.1%. Sales in the interconnect and sensor system segment were $1.033 billion and increased by 5% in U.S. dollars and 1% organically. Segment operating margin was 18.3%. The company's GAAP effective tax rate for the third quarter was 18.2%, and the adjusted effective tax rate was 24.0%, which compared to 23.1% and 24.5% in the third quarter of 2022 respectively. GAAP diluted EPS was up 4% at $0.83 compared to $0.80 in the prior year period, and on an adjusted basis diluted EPS decreased 3% to $0.78 compared to $0.80 in the third quarter of 2022. This was an excellent result, especially considering the variety of challenges that the company continued to face during the quarter. Operating cash flow in the third quarter was $618 million or 128% of adjusted net income, and net of capital spending, our free cash flow, was $544 million or 112% of adjusted net income. We are pleased to continue to deliver such a strong cash flow yield. From a working capital standpoint, inventory days, day sales outstanding, and payable days were 87, 70, and 52 days respectively, all within the normal levels. As mentioned in today's earnings release, the company's Board of Directors has approved a 5% increase in the company's quarterly dividend to $0.22, effective for payments beginning in January of 2024. During the quarter, the company's repurchased 1.7 million shares of common stock at an average price of approximately $86, and when combined with our normal quarterly dividend, total capital return to shareholders during the third quarter of 2023 was approximately $275 million. Total debt on September 30th was $4.3 billion, and net debt was $2.6 billion. Total liquidity at the end of the quarter was $5 billion, which included cash and short-term investments on hand of $1.7 billion, plus availability under existing credit facilities. Third quarter of 2023 EBITDA was $784 million, and at the end of the third quarter of 2023, our net leverage ratio was 0.8 times. We are very pleased that the company's financial condition remains extremely strong by any measure. I will now turn the call over to Adam, who will provide some commentary on current market trends. Thanks, Wamsi. I appreciate the question. I think if you look at our profitability in 2023 and certainly here in the third quarter and I'll talk about the fourth quarter in a minute or two. I wouldn't say there's certainly no changes in regards to how we think about decremental margins in the long-term, but 2023, a few things have happened and certainly we've done a great job of. Number one, we're benefiting a bit from pricing and no particular order here, but we're certainly benefiting a bit from pricing that we did last year in 2022 and we did a call, we talked a bit about the work we did last year, the catch up with the inflationary environment that kind of by the third quarter into the fourth quarter of last year, the majority of the work we were pretty much back to kind of where we wanted to be and expected to be from a balance between price and cost perspective. So, we're certainly still benefiting on a year-over-year basis from that. In addition, I think we've just executed very well, certainly some of the markets that we've seen a reduction from and certainly communications markets, ID datacom being the biggest of them. We certainly have done a really great job of kind of offsetting some of those declines just from just great execution. And if you actually look at the over year-over-year margins and you take out some of the acquisitions impacts, we actually are well under those decremental margins that we typically would target. But I'd say, those are one of the two kind of bigger things that really are impacting it. I mean, 20.8% here in the third quarter is not quite a record, but certainly given the market mix in terms of the challenges that we've had from the ups and downs of a growth price perspective, not mix of margin from a market, because we don't have a significant margin range from a market, but just the mix of the growth that we've had, the ups and downs, it really has -- really been a, I think, great execution on the team's part to be able to manage that. So, as we look forward into the fourth quarter, I think our implied guidance would be that we continue to have these strong margins into the fourth quarter and that are offsetting some of the acquisitions that do clearly have lower than average margin levels and that we're working to get up to the company average over time, but no doubt we're really proud of it. I think the longer term kind of decremental margins haven't changed from this 30%, but I think this year, given a few of the factors I mentioned, I think has really benefited us and certainly we're proud of it. And these are the margins we should be at these revenue levels and we're going to continue to strive to do better. Hey, Mark, Good to hear your voice. Look, I think 6G will come one day, but we still haven't even invested totally in 5G. So, when I think about how the mobile networks market tends to go. And I've been around long enough working in the wireless market, long enough that I've seen 1G, 2G, 3G, 4G, and now 5G, and I have a decent sense of how that works. Generally what happen is there's an initial investment of that new generation. And then the operators digest and figure out the economics of it, because these are significant investments that they make. And if they can't figure out how to monetize that incremental investment, that's a challenge. I think the 5G, there's a lot of work going on to figure out how to monetize that. But I think there's a separate question. And that is, yes, this is a tough period for the wireless market. You've seen all the releases over the last several days, and the capital spending of the big operators here in the U.S, which is all down in the kind of 20% to 30% range, the equipment manufacturers in some cases down even more in this region at least, and certainly our business down on an organic basis as it was by 43%,. And I think we're in that digestion period of that new technology, but there's still a very modest proportion of the build out that has become truly 5G. And I don't know what the number is, is it 15%, is it 20%, but it's certainly not 50%, it's certainly not 60%, 70%, 80%. I mean, we're still, I believe, in the early innings of the 5G, and I think people are just taking kind of a third inning stretch on this right now to figure out how to make more money from the system. But if you think about what's going on in data more broadly, think about AI, think about video, think about all the extraordinarily bandwidth, hungry applications that continue to proliferate, accelerate, and be used everywhere you go. I mean, it's actually unbelievable when you see how data is being consumed and where it's being consumed. I watch my kids, who used to -- my son is a gamer, and he used to only game on his computer at home. Well, now he can be moving around, and he can be in the car, and he can be gaming and playing with all these strange creatures that they play with, I mean, really strange names, things like J\u00f6rmungandr [ph] and things like this, and weird things like that. And like, all these crazy, crazy things that you can do that are not connected to a cable, not connected to a desktop. And so when you think about the mobile internet and mobility of data long-term, I see no doubt that there's going to be continued acceleration and drive for next generation ways for people to do this. And when we look at our company's position here, we have a very unique position. We're one of the only companies who operate directly with the operators, as well as directly with the OEMs. And that puts us in a very unique position as they go about driving their systems to next generation capabilities. And I think the acquisition that we made of RFS earlier this year, other acquisitions that we've made put us in a really strong position. And yes, it's a tough quarter or two, and a pause of a year, but no doubt in my mind that long-term, the mobile networks market is going to be great. Yes. I mean, look, we read all the same papers, and I think, individual plants may be accelerated or delayed at a given time. And I wouldn't think that, an individual announcement doesn't really have a dramatic impact on our overall business. But look, I did talk about in particular one area, which is the semiconductor capital equipment market, which I think if you asked everybody a year ago, and I\u2019d say everybody except for maybe the two of us sitting here, they would have said, oh, this will never, ever have a cycle ever again. And sure enough, here we are this year, and there is a bit of a cycle in semi-cap equipment. We have a really strong position there. We've done a great job to position ourselves long-term as really an interconnect supplier of choice to that market. And clearly, I mentioned earlier that we did see a moderation of our sales into semi-cap equipment as part of our industrial market. I don't think that's because of any individual plant. But I'd say that that is more related to I think a bit of a pause in the capital spending of some of the larger semiconductor manufacturers. EV related, I think we still see that market is pretty strong. We had a really strong performance in our automotive market last quarter. And again, 90 days from now, we'll see what that looks like next year. But I wouldn't necessarily point to any specific things related to EV factories being built or not being built. Thank you."

            "name": "Adam Norwitt",
            "content": "Well, Craig, thank you very much, and I'd like to extend my welcome to everybody on the phone here today, and I hope that you're all having an enjoyable fall so far. It's a pleasure here in Wallingford to see the beautiful orange and red hues out of our windows. As Craig mentioned, I'm going to highlight our third quarter achievements, then discuss our trends and progress across our diversified end markets, and then I'll comment on our outlook for the fourth quarter and for the full year of 2023. Turning to the third quarter, our results in the third quarter were better than expected. As we exceeded the high end of our guidance in sales and adjusted diluted earnings per share, sales declined by 3% in U.S. dollars and local currencies, reaching just under $3.2 billion, with growth in the commercial air, military, and automotive end markets, as well as contributions from our acquisitions, which were more than offset by moderations in the mobile networks, mobile devices, IT Datacom, broadband, and industrial end markets. On an organic basis, sales declined by 5%, but sales did increase sequentially by 5% from second quarter levels. We're pleased that the company booked orders of $3.164 billion, and that represented a book-to-bill of 0.99 to 1. I'm especially encouraged that our orders in the third quarter did exceed prior year levels, and that's an encouraging sign going forward. Profitability was very strong in the quarter. We generated adjusted operating margins of 20.8%, and that was down just 20 basis points from prior year. Sequentially our margins improved by 40 basis points, and as Craig already mentioned, these operating margins in the third quarter reflected just outstanding execution by our global management team, who continued to manage dynamically and effectively, even in the face of moderating sales. Adjusted diluted EPS in the quarter was $0.78, and that declined just 3% from prior year, and increased by a strong 8% on a sequential basis. Then finally, we're very pleased with the company's cash flow generation in the quarter with operating and free cash flow of $618 million and $544 million respectively in the third quarter, clear demonstrations of the high quality of Amphenol's earnings. I come out of this quarter extremely proud of the Amphenol's team, and I'll just say that our results this quarter once again reflect the discipline and agility of our entrepreneurial organization as we continue to perform well amidst the dynamic and challenging environment. Our acquisition team has been extremely busy this year so far, and I'm really pleased that since our last earnings call, we've closed on three acquisitions, Connor Manufacturing, Q Microwave, and XMA Corporation. In addition, we've signed an agreement to acquire PCTEL. Since its headquarters in Illinois, Connor is a global manufacturer of power interconnect products, including especially high voltage bus bars for the automotive and industrial markets with annual sales of approximately $100 million. Based in California, Q Microwave is a designer and manufacturer of mission critical radio frequency components utilized in military platforms with annual sales of approximately $20 million. And based in New Hampshire, XMA is also a provider of RF components for the military as well as the IT Datacom market with annual sales of approximately $15 million. We're very pleased that we signed a definitive agreement to acquire PCTEL. PCTEL is a leading global provider of antennas for a broad array of markets, as well as purpose-built industrial IoT products and testing measurement solutions. We expect the PCTEL transaction to close by early 2024. I'm very excited to welcome the Conner, Q Microwave, and XMA teams to Amphenol, and I certainly look forward to welcoming the PCTEL team once that deal closes. Most importantly, I remain confident that our acquisition program will continue to create great value for the company. In fact, our ability to identify and execute upon acquisitions and then to successfully bring these companies into our entrepreneurial organization, this remains a core competitive advantage for Amphenol. Now, turning to our serve markets, we're very pleased that the company's end-market exposure remains highly diversified, balanced, and broad, and that creates great value for the company, particularly amidst these dynamic times. So, turning to each of our serve markets, the military market represented 11% of our sales in the quarter. Sales grew from prior year by a very strong 26% in U.S. dollars and 22% organically, and this was really driven by broad base strength across virtually every segment of the military market. Sequentially, our sales grew by 3%, which was better than our expectations coming into the quarter. And as we look into the fourth quarter, we expect sales to remain roughly at these robust third quarter levels, and for the full year 2023, we expect a high-teens increase in sales from prior year. With the acquisition last quarter of both Q Microwave and XMA, we further broadened our industry leading RF product offering into this important defense market. And in general, we remain encouraged by the company's strengthened position across the defense industry, where we continue to offer the market's widest range of high technology interconnect products. Amidst today's dynamic geopolitical environment, countries around the world are expanding their investments in both current and next generation defense technologies, thereby increasing the long-term demand potential for Amphenol. We're going to continue to accelerate our new product development while also increasing our capacity, and thus are well-positioned to support this increased demand long into the future. The commercial aerospace market represented 4% of our sales in the quarter, had another really strong quarter with sales increasing by a very robust 40% from prior year and 37% organically. And this was driven by broad-based strength across all aircraft applications. On a sequential basis, sales did decline by just 1%, and that was a bit better than our expectations coming into the quarter. As we look into the fourth quarter, we now expect a modest seasonal sequential decline in sales. And for the full year 2023, we expect sales to increase in the mid 30% range compared to 2022. I'm truly proud of our team working in the commercial air market. With the ongoing recovery and travel and thus demand for jetliners, our efforts to strengthen our breadth of high technology interconnect products while diversifying our market position into next generation aircraft are paying real dividends. We look forward to realizing the benefits of these initiatives for many years to come. The industrial market represented 24% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in the quarter did decline by 6% in U.S. dollars and 13% organically as growth in medical, oil and gas and rail mass transit applications was more than offset by declines in other segments of the industrial market. I did want to highlight that our sales into the distribution channel were particularly soft in the third quarter as many distributors have taken steps to reduce their inventory positions in the industrial market. Sequentially sales declined by 4% from the second quarter, which was somewhat worse than our expectations coming into the quarter. Looking into the fourth quarter, we expect sales to moderate slightly from these third quarter levels. And for the full year 2023, we expect sales to be roughly flat versus prior year as some organic moderations are offset by the benefit of our acquisitions. Despite this near-term demand pause in the industrial market, I continue to remain so proud of our outstanding global team working in this important area. They continue to pursue growth opportunities across the many exciting segments of this truly diverse market. And I remain confident that our long-term strategy to expand our high technology interconnect, antenna and sensor offering, both organically and through complementary acquisitions, has positioned us to capitalize on the many revolutions that will no doubt continue to occur across the industrial electronics market. The automotive market represented 23% of our sales in the quarter, and sales grew by a very robust 13% in U.S. dollars and 12% organically. This was driven by broad-based strength across most automotive applications, including electric and hybrid electric vehicle platforms. Sequentially, our sales increase by 7% from the second quarter, and this was much better than our expectations that we had coming into 3Q. For the fourth quarter, we expect sales to remain roughly at these levels, and for the full year 2023, we expect sales to increase by approximately 10% compared to prior year. I'm really proud of our team working in the automotive market. Their performance so far this year is yet another confirmation of the benefits of their focus on driving new design wins with customers who are implementing a wide array of new technologies into their vehicles, including electrified drivetrains, as well as a multitude of other exciting new applications. With the addition of Connor to the Amphenol family, we now have an even broader array of products for global electric vehicle manufacturers, and we look forward to benefiting from this position for many years to come. The mobile device market represented 10% of our sales in the quarter and our sales moderated by 20% in U.S. dollars and 18% organically, as strong growth in smartphones was more than offset by declining sales of products that are incorporated into laptops, tablets, and wearables. On a sequential basis, our sales increased by a much stronger than expected 25%, and that was really driven by higher than expected sales in smartphones and wearables. Looking to the fourth quarter, we expect sales to moderate in the high single digits sequentially. As strong growth in smartphones, we expect to be more than offset by continued declines in laptops and wearables. For the full year, we anticipate sales to decline in the mid-teens compared to 2022. While there's no question that mobile devices remains our most volatile and market, our team once again in the third quarter did an outstanding job of capitalizing on opportunities to realize incremental sales. Their agility and ability to adjust resources in real time with the changing levels of demand continues to create value for Amphenol. As we head into the end of 2023, our team stands poised as always to leverage their leading array of antennas, interconnect products, and mechanisms to capture any opportunities for incremental sales that may arise this year and beyond. The mobile networks market represented 3% of our sales in the quarter. Sales declined by 35% in U.S. dollars and 43% organically as we continued to manage through a broad base reduction in spending by network operators and wireless equipment manufacturers. On a sequential basis, our sales declined by 6%, which was a bit worse than our expectations coming into the quarter. For the fourth quarter, we expect sales to decline in the mid to high single digits sequentially, and for the full year, we anticipate moderation sales in the sort of mid 20% range versus 2022. Despite this more challenging short-term wireless investment environment, our team continues to work aggressively to realize the benefits of our efforts to expand our position in next generation 5G equipment and networks around the world. When customers once again drive renewed investments in these next generation systems, we look forward to benefiting from the increased potential that comes from Amphenol's unique position with both equipment manufacturers and mobile service providers. The IT datacom market represented 20% of our sales in the quarter, and while sales did decline by 12% in U.S. dollars and organically from prior year, our performance in the quarter was actually much better than we'd expected 90 days ago. In fact, on a sequential basis, our sales increased by a strong 13% in the third quarter, much better than previous expectations. The growth in our sales from the second quarter was driven by an accelerating surge in demand from customers who are making significant investments in AI data centers. We also continued to see robust orders for AI related applications, a confirmation of our team's success in positioning Amphenol as a leader in the complex interconnect systems that support alternative intelligence or artificial intelligence. As we look towards the fourth quarter, we expect sales to remain at these third quarter levels, and for the full year 2023, we expect the mid-teens decline in sales compared to prior year. While we've certainly had to manage through the inventory adjustments in the broader IT market, I am more encouraged than ever by the company's position in the global IT datacom industry. This revolution in AI is creating a true and unique opportunity for Amphenol, given our leading high-speed and power interconnect products. With machine learning applications driving a more intensive usage of our highest technology interconnect products, we're very well-positioned for the future. In addition, our team just continued to do an outstanding job developing leading high-speed power and fiber optic interconnect products that are enabling our OEM and web service provider customers to continue to drive their equipment and networks to higher levels of performance. This creates a continued long-term opportunity for the company. Finally, the broadband market represented 5% of our sales in the quarter, and sales were down 8% in U.S. dollars and organically as broadband operators continued to moderate their procurement levels. On a sequential basis, sales were down by 6% in line with our expectations coming into the quarter. For the fourth quarter, we expect the modest sequential increase in sales, and for the full year 2023, we expect sales to decline in the mid-single digits from prior year. Regardless of the current demand dynamics, we remain encouraged by the company's position in the broadband market. We look forward to continuing to support our service provider customers around the world, all of whom are working to increase their network coverage and bandwidth to support the proliferation of high-speed data applications to homes and businesses. In addition, we're very well-positioned to benefit from the broad array of government-funded initiatives, particularly in North America, thereby giving us confidence for the future. Now, turning to our outlook, there's no question that the current economic environment remains uncertain, and assuming market conditions do not meaningfully worsen, and also assuming constant exchange rates. For the fourth quarter, we expect sales in the range of $3.090 billion to $3.150 billion, and adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $0.75 to $0.77. This would represent a sales decline of 3% to 5%, and an adjusted diluted EPS decline of 1% to 4% compared to prior year. Our fourth quarter guidance also represents an expectation for full-year sales of $12.317 billion to $12.377 billion, and full-year adjusted diluted EPS of $2.94 to $2.96. This outlook represents full-year sales and adjusted EPS declines of 2% and 1% to 2%, respectively. I'm very confident in the ability of our outstanding management team to adapt to the many opportunities and challenges in the current dynamic environment, and to continue to grow Amphenol's market position while also driving strong profitability. In addition, I just want to reiterate that our entire Amphenol team around the world remains committed to delivering long-term sustainable value. And I would like to finally take this opportunity to thank each and every one of our 90,000 employees around the world for their truly outstanding efforts here in the third quarter. And with that operator, we'd be very happy to take any questions. Amit, thank you very much. Yes, I think when we look at the industrial market, I mean, the beauty of our industrial business is we have a very broad presence across, really every segment of the industrial market. And we did see some of those segments actually performing very strongly. I highlighted that we saw a very robust growth in oil and gas and rail mass transit, so strong growth in medical applications, heavy equipment, another one. But then there's other segments of the market where, which were down. And I think some of those have been pretty widely reported areas like factory automation, alternative energy, which seems to be having a little bit of a pause in the investment cycle for a variety of reasons. But by and large, our OEM business was only modestly down. And it was really the bigger impact here was the impact from the distribution channel, who it turns out, feels that they have a little bit too much inventory right now. And we started to see some signs of that maybe coming into the quarter. And I think it maybe accelerated a little bit through the quarter. And our guidance as we look out into the fourth quarter certainly incorporates a continued adjustment by our distributors in particular, as well as some on the OEM side as well. And that's what's envisioned in our sort of modest sequential moderation that is implied in our guidance. How long will that last? We certainly, 90 days from now, we'll try to give a good sense of what it looks like at least in the first quarter of next year. I would expect that it's hard to predict. But the underlying electrification and electrification of the industrial market broadly, that has not slowed down. I think, yes, there are certain things like Semicap and others where there's a bit of a digestion period right now. But we continue to see an enormous array of new innovations, new programs, new applications across the breadth of our industrial market. And I think we've built such a broad offering of interconnect products, sensors, antennas, that wherever those next revolutions are going to be in industrial, there's no doubt that Amphenol is going to be well represented there. So, I view this as a bit of a pause. I don't take an overly macro view of what's happening right now. I understand that some may look at industrial as sort of a macro proxy. And maybe there are certain areas like the German industrial market, which is really where more of the factory automation that could have a little bit more linkage between that. But the general trend of more electronics, more content being driven across all these areas of the industrial market is something that we don't see slowing down. And so, as we get into next year, we'll certainly try to give a good read on where that looks like 90 days from now. But we feel really good about our overall position in the industrial market despite this pause today. Thanks very much, Chris. Appreciate it. Look, I think we're really excited about where we are with our customers in AI. And I'll just put some historical perspective on this. I mean, we've been working on the innovation of products that ultimately support AI for many, many years. This is not like, all of a sudden, something like ChatGPT shows up in the newspaper and we started frantically developing products. We've been working with customers for a long time on the type of products that uniquely are required for an AI processing system. And we talked a little bit about this 90 days ago, but the nature of an AI system, the fact that it is a neural network based system, where you have these very high power chips that all have to talk to each other across a fabric like architecture, just means that there's a uniquely larger component of interconnect to allow those shifts to ultimately talk to each other. And the requirements of that, those interconnect products, both from a speed, a latency perspective, not even to mention the significant power requirements that go into these AI data centers, which consume dramatically higher levels of power, and thereby require higher technology, higher efficiency types of power interconnect to ensure that these AI data centers aren't just chewing up all the electricity in America, for example. These are really challenging and exciting opportunities where we've been investing in new product development for many, many years. It's clearly ramping. I talked about the fact that really, I would say all of our sequential growth from Q2 to Q3 came from AI. And as you recall, we had already a decent amount of AI business in the second quarter. And we don't split that out. We already talked about end markets, and we don't necessarily talk about every little sub component of that. But I would just tell you that it's a very significant opportunity for the company long-term, medium-term, and short-term as it's really driving that sequential growth that we've seen both in the second quarter and then the follow on sequential growth that we got here in the third quarter. What is the long-term of AI going to be? I don't think anybody knows the answer to that. But I think we all know that it's going to change a lot of things. And there's no doubt that the investments that are being put into these AI data centers, which are not -- these are not amounts that are for the faint of heart. They're going to really have dramatic impact on a lot of the ways that we interface and interact with and use data networks and data systems. And we're just really excited to be able to play our portion of that to enable these next generation systems. As it relates to the kind of non-AI and the inventory correction that we certainly have talked about for nearly four quarters, I would tell you that as we look into the fourth quarter, I think we feel that it's largely behind us, that inventory correction. Now, you could also say that some of the AI investments are \u201ccannibalizing\u201d some of the non-AI investments. I think there's plenty of people discussing from that vein. But I think the inventory positions have become much healthier today. And now it's all about investing in this exciting new revolution of AI and figuring out how to do that in effective fashion. And from an interconnect perspective, we're really standing right there in the front of the line, making sure that our customers have what they need. Yes, Luke. Thanks. It's actually a really great question. I mean, if I go back, everybody on the phone will recall that it was the beginning of 2022 when we evolved our organization and created now three global divisions, which are reportable segments. And then under those global divisions, initially 12 and now 13 operating groups. And each of those operating groups is run by just an outstanding group general manager. I think in my career, I was a general manager, then I was a group general manager myself before I came here to headquarters nearly 17 years ago. And those group general managers run very significant businesses. They're deeply involved in the operations of the company and they're deeply involved in the identification, the assessment and ultimately the welcoming of these new companies to Amphenol. And we now have just a broader platform of extraordinarily capable individuals. I've talked many times about how I view kind of my priorities as a CEO of this company. And I view them really twofold. One is to be the protector of our culture, that unique entrepreneurial culture that I believe is really second to none in its value and its impact on our results. And the second is to ensure the scalability of that culture so that we can grow as a company really in perpetuity. And, I joined a quarter of a century ago, we were less than a billion dollars in sales, but the culture was identical. It was general managers around the world who have full authority to run their businesses and ultimately can be held accountable. Therefore, today we've gone from when I joined the company less than 20 to today around 130 of those general managers and we've scaled the organization in support of that. And that's why today we have the three global divisions and the 13 groups. And that has included as well our acquisition program. Because if you go back in time and look back, we always used to talk about M&A representing roughly a third of our growth over the long-term. And we would always get questions, well, as you grow, that means you either have to do more acquisitions or bigger acquisitions. And I think I've consistently said, well, that's right, arithmetically, and we will do and we have done both of those things, both more deals and bigger ones. And we've acquired 26 companies so far since the beginning of 2019. That has included our first ever public company that has now -- we have now announced the signing of our second public company. RFS is one that maybe requires a little more, but you go back even 10 years when we acquired the sensor company from GE, which has been a fabulously successful acquisition and will celebrate just in a couple of months here, the 10th anniversary of that acquisition. We acquired, you'll recall, FCI, which requires, a little bit more work to align FCI into the Amphenol approach of entrepreneurial general managers. So I tell you that our muscle has grown commensurate with the scale of the company and our ability to do acquisitions, large, small, private, public, whatever you may say, all of that ability has remained very strong. And then the last thing I'll say is if you look at our balance sheet, I mean, we came out of this quarter with leverage of only .8 times. We have enormous availability of capital. We have cash flow that is really at, close to historical levels. I mean, free cash flow that is 17% of our sales in the quarter. And all of the financial means of doing the acquisitions together with the organizational means are all there. But I'll say one thing, we will always stay disciplined. We are a company that is always true to our principles. We're not just going to become a little private equity company. We're not going to be a holding company. We're not going to go out and buy bad companies, run by bad people. We're always going to look for the same criteria for acquisitions that I've talked about for many years. Number one, we want great people. Number two, we want great product technology. And number three, an outstanding market position. We got all three of those with the acquisitions of Conner, Q Microwave, and XMA. And I'm sure we'll do the same with PCTEL. And we'll continue to be very disciplined as we go forward at the same time as we have a real larger aperture of capabilities to continue to do M&A at the levels that we'd like to. Yes. Nice to meet you too, Andrew. Yes. Well, Andrew, thanks again and welcome to the, welcome to the call here. Not so often we get a new analyst. So, it's a pleasure to have you here. Look, the automotive market is a really exciting one for the company. I'm just so proud of our team working in the automotive market, results that they've driven in what has not been an easy environment, quite the contrary. Growing last quarter by 12% organically, I mean, you will recall that last year we grew by 29% organically in a market that was essentially flat to down in units. And if you look at the long-term performance of our automotive company over the nearly 15 years that I've been CEO, I still remember very well, my first quarter is CEO. And, by the way, this is my 60th of these earnings calls as CEO. In my first one of those, we had an automotive business that was 5% and our overall sales were $660 million that quarter. So, that's $33 million, $35 million, and here we are this quarter at close to $3.2 billion in our automotive market, 23% of sales. And I think we've just done a fabulous job over those years, not of taking market share out of the hands of incumbents, but of enabling new electronic systems as they were adopted in cars over that decade and a half. And I think you've just seen a collection of revolutions in the automotive industry, the most prominent and most recent of which being the electrification of vehicles. But that's not the only thing. I mean, there's so many new systems being put into these cars. And each time there's an opportunity for us to intersect those with high technology interconnect sensors and antennas. And I think our team's done a great job of that. How is that going to go into 2024? Again, I think I said this already on the call, nine days from now we'll try to give everybody a decent sense of where we think at least the beginning of 2024 is headed. But I say no reason to say that we will not continue to maintain our outperformance that we have been so consistently delivering really over a decade and a half during this time period. I'm just really proud of our team working on automotive and I'm really pleased with the broad array of technologies for all these exciting new applications in the car. Yes, well, thank you very much, Samik. I mean, look, I think we just talked about the auto market and we've been consistently outperforming the overall auto, whatever you want to call it, unit volumes or whatever markets that you want to talk about. I guess when we talk about orders from year-over-year perspective, more broadly in the company, yes, we were this quarter on a year-over-year basis higher in our orders than last year, and that was the first time in four quarters. And I think that that should translate eventually to year-over-year growth. I think we've guided for next quarter in a certain way, and we're going to keep fighting for that and we'll guide for the first quarter at the same time when we come to that 90 days from now, and you can imagine that our team is very focused on returning to growth, and we don't love having it be down this quarter. We don't like having it be down next quarter, and we don't like having it be down last quarter either, and there's a whole Amphenol team around us that's fighting for that. When you look across our end markets, one of the beauties of the diversification of the company is that we have end markets which are growing substantially already, and we have others though which are down because of the various reasons that we've talked about. And so, when you think about, for example, IT datacom which was down quite significantly last quarter, I think it was something like 20%, 24% or so, and then this quarter down 12%, I think at our current guidance, that would be pretty close to prior year, plus or minus. And so that's a sign, I think, of that returning to the growth trajectory that we would for sure look forward to seeing across the company. Yes, well, thanks very much, and look, we're really excited about the PCTEL acquisition, and PCTEL, we've known them for many, many years as a really broad and very successful antenna company, probably a little too small to be a public company, and that's certainly one thing I would say. And yes, they have a small test and measurement business, but we're really excited about this company, and we look forward to working to bring it to its closure, and I probably wouldn't say more about it given that we've just signed the deal. Yes, thanks, Steve. I really appreciate the question. Yes, I mean, look, XMA and Q Microwave are fabulous companies. They're certainly at a smaller scale for now you can imagine that we have high expectations for them over the long-term. And you correctly stated, we have really the broadest position in RF interconnect technology. And these companies bring us, just as we've gone a little bit into active optics, these companies bring us a little bit extra in RF that we can offer to our customers, a little bit more conditioning capabilities in the RF interconnect products. And that's something, especially in the mil aero market that we see as being a really important part of our interconnect offering to our customers in mil aero, and I think that's really exciting. Busbars is an area that we've been in for gosh, almost the whole of my career. I remember 23 years ago or so when I was a general manager, and we were making one of our first busbars at the time, and we've been involved in busbars in the telecom industry. We've been involved in bus bars in IT. We've made great acquisitions. You'll recall the acquisition of OXCEL [ph] several years ago, which brought us more into the industrial market. And what we really like about Conner, is Conner brings us really solidly into the busbar market in the automotive market in particular around EVs. And while we have today an outstanding offering of high voltage interconnect products that are used in EVs. There's no doubt that a compliment to that is the busbar systems that are used also to move the energy around the car. And Conner just does a fabulous job there. We're just really excited to have them. And it's a continued expansion of the reach of the interconnect system, making sure that our core technologies that we have, we have them in every one of the end markets where those find favor. And I think Conner is a wonderful piece of that puzzle. Yes. Thanks very much, Matt. I think you correctly stated the case here, which is, we've actually had a pretty good year in smartphones and our team's done a fabulous job there. But no doubt there's been a digestion period in the other devices in particular, the devices like tablets and laptops and the like. And I think what we've seen over this pandemic impacted kind of last four years is there was an unusual surge and a kind of disruption of the normal buying patterns of these devices, because when everybody got sent home either to work or to study or however they wanted to interact, they had to get new devices to do that. And there was just a massive surge in the consumption of those devices at the end of the day. And I think there's still a digestion from that. What is it going to be next year? I mean, look, I have a hard time guiding this market 90 days out. I'm generally wrong when I do that, and I certainly wouldn't get ahead of my speed and try to guide it for next year. But of course, at some point, that digestion of that surge of demand for those kind of devices, you would hope would normalize and I would expect that it would normalize that. I mean, I know for sure my own devices, I'm probably getting them. I run them a little longer than most, because we're pretty cost conscious here at Amphenol. But even a couple of my devices, I'm starting to think about whether I need to get a new one. Good afternoon, Michael. Well, operator, I think that's our last question. And once again, on behalf of Craig and I and our whole 90,000 team around the world, we'd like to just thank everybody for your time today. We wish you all the best and wish that you and your families all stay safe. Thanks so much."

        "content": "Operator: Hello. And welcome to the Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call for Amphenol Corporation. Following today\u2019s presentation, there will be a formal question-and-answer session. Until then all lines will remain in a listen-only mode. At the request of the company, today\u2019s conference is being recorded. If anyone has any objection, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to introduce today\u2019s conference host, Mr. Craig Lampo. Sir, you may begin.\nCraig Lampo: Thank you very much. Good afternoon, everyone. This is Craig Lampo, Amphenol\u2019s CFO and I am here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO. We would like to welcome you to our second quarter 2023 conference call. Our second quarter 2023 results were released this morning. I will provide some financial commentary and then Adam will give an overview of the business and current trends and then we will take questions. As a reminder, during the call, we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures and make certain forward-looking statements, so please refer to the relevant disclosures in our press release for further information. The company closed the second quarter with sales of $3,054 million and GAAP and adjusted diluted EPS of $0.74 and $0.72, respectively. Second quarter sales were down 3% in U.S. dollars, 2% in local currencies and organically -- and 4% organically compared to the second quarter of 2022. Sequentially, sales were up 3% in U.S. dollars in local currencies and 2% organically. Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes. Orders in the quarter were $3,044 million, which was down 12% compared to the second quarter of 2022, but up 5% sequentially, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1:1. GAAP operating income was $620 million in the second quarter of 2023, which included $4 million of acquisition-related costs. Excluding these costs, adjusted operating income was $624 million. GAAP and adjusted operating margins were 20.3% and 20.4%, respectively, in the second quarter of 2023. On a GAAP basis, operating margin decreased by 40 basis points compared to the second quarter of 2022, but increased by 40 basis points sequentially. And on an adjusted basis, operating margin decreased 30 basis points compared to the second quarter of 2022, but increased by 30 basis points sequentially. This modest year-over-year decrease in adjusted operating margin reflected a strong downside conversion on the sales -- lower sales volumes, as well as the dilutive impact of acquisitions, which are currently operating below the corporate average. On a sequential basis, the increase in adjusted operating margin reflected strong conversion on the higher sales levels. Our team continues to execute well in the quarter, and we are proud to have sustained these healthy levels of profitability despite the continued range of challenges around the world. During the second quarter, we were excited to have closed on the previously announced acquisition of RFS. The value of the net assets we acquired were in excess of the RFS purchase price. And as a result, we recorded a noncash gain of $5 million in the second quarter, which has been excluded from our adjusted EPS results. In the third quarter of 2023, we expect to incur restructuring costs associated with RFS, which we estimate will be in the range of $5 million to $10 million. These costs will be excluded from our third quarter adjusted EPS results and are excluded from our Q3 2023 guidance. Breaking down second quarter results by segment, relative to the second quarter of 2022, sales in the Harsh Environment Solutions segment were $889 million and increased by 12% in U.S. dollars and 9% organically and segment operating margin was 27%. Sales in the Communications Solutions segment were $1,162 million and declined by 16% in U.S. dollars and organically and segment operating margin was 20.5%. Sales in Interconnect and Sensor Systems segment were $1,003 million and increased by 4% in U.S. dollars and 1% organically and segment operating margin was 18.5%. The company\u2019s GAAP effective tax rate for the second quarter was 21.9% and the adjusted effective tax rate was 24%, which compared to 23.3% and 24.5% in the second quarter of 2022, respectively. GAAP diluted EPS decreased 3% to $0.74, compared to $0.76 in the prior year period. And on an adjusted basis, diluted EPS increased -- decreased 4% to $0.72, compared to $0.75 in the second quarter of 2022. Operating cash flow in the second quarter was $536 million or 120% of adjusted net income, and net of capital spending, our free cash flow was $442 million or nearly 100% of adjusted net income. We are very pleased to continue to deliver such a strong cash flow yield. From a working capital standpoint, inventory days, days sales outstanding and payable days were 87 days, 71 days and 48 days, respectively. Through the focused attention of our management team during the quarter, we were able to bring inventory days back in line with our normal range. During the quarter, the company repurchased 2 million shares of common stock at an average price of approximately $77. When combined with our normal quarterly dividend, total capital return to shareholders in the second quarter of 2023 was $280 million. Total debt on June 30th was $4.3 billion and net debt was $2.8 billion. Total liquidity at the end of the quarter was $4.8 billion, which included cash and short-term investments on hand of $1.5 billion plus availability under our existing credit facilities. Second quarter 2023 EBITDA was $736 million and at the end of the second quarter of 2023, our net leverage ratio was 0.9 times. We are very pleased that the company\u2019s financial position remains extremely strong by any measure. I will now turn the call over to Adam, who will provide some commentary on current market trends.\nAdam Norwitt: Well, thank you very much, Craig, and I\u2019d like to extend my welcome to all of you here on the phone today on this beautiful summer day here in Wallingford, Connecticut. And I do hope that all of you on the call, together with your family, friends and colleagues are enjoying a little bit of your summer thus far. As Craig mentioned, I am going to highlight some of our achievements in the second quarter. I will then spend a moment to discuss our trends and the progress across our served markets and make some comments on our outlook for the third quarter, and then obviously, we will have time for questions at the end. With respect to the second quarter, our results were better than expected as we exceeded the high end of our guidance in sales and adjusted diluted earnings per share. Sales declined 3% in U.S. dollars and 2% in local currency reaching $3,054 million, with growth in commercial air, military and automotive end markets, as well as contributions from our acquisitions, slightly more than offset by moderations in the mobile networks, IT datacom and mobile devices segments. On an organic basis, sales did decline by 4%. We are very pleased that the company booked orders in the quarter of $3.44 billion, which represented a book-to-bill of 1:1. As Craig described, our margins in the quarter, adjusted operating margins were 20.4%, which was down 30 basis points from prior year, but which improved by 30 basis points from the first quarter sequentially. I am very pleased that our margins in the second quarter once again reflected outstanding execution by our global management team, who continue to quickly adjust to changing demand and costs amidst these very dynamic times. Adjusted diluted EPS in the quarter of 72% -- $0.72 declined 4% from prior year but increased 4% from the sequential prior quarter. We also generated strong operating and free cash flow of $536 million and $442 million in the second quarter, yet another demonstration of the high quality of the company\u2019s earnings. I am extremely proud of the Amphenol team around the world. Our results this quarter once again reflect the strength of our Amphenolian entrepreneurial organization, as we continue to perform well amidst a very dynamic and challenging environment. We are pleased to announce today that we closed the previously announced acquisition of the North American cable and global base station antenna business of RFS. Despite some current moderation in the mobile networks market, we remain excited about the long-term prospects of RFS as part of the Amphenol family. We now expect this acquisition to generate roughly $30 million of sales in the second half of 2023. In addition, we are pleased that just in the last few days, we closed on the acquisition of EBY Electro. EBY is based in the state of New York in the U.S. with annual sales of approximately $15 million. And EBY is a designer and distributor of terminal block interconnect products to the North American industrial market. The addition of EBY further expands our offering of high technology interconnect products into the diversified industrial market. As we welcome these outstanding new teams to Amphenol, we remain confident that our acquisition program will continue to create great value for the company. Our ability to identify and execute upon acquisitions, and successfully bring these new organizations into the Amphenol organization remains a core competitive advantage for us. Now turning to the trends and progress across our served markets. We are very pleased that the company\u2019s end market exposure remains highly diversified, balanced and broad. In particular, in hits these very dynamic times, Amphenol\u2019s end market diversification continues to create great value for the company. The military market represented 12% of our sales in the quarter and sales in this market grew by a very strong 21% in U.S. dollars and 19% organically, and this was really driven by broad-based growth across most segments within the defense market. Sequentially, our sales increased by a better-than-expected 8%. Looking into the third quarter, we expect sales to remain at these robust second quarter levels. I just have to say that we remain very encouraged by the strength of the company\u2019s position in the defense market, where we continue to offer the industry\u2019s widest range of high technology interconnect products. Amidst today\u2019s highly dynamic geopolitical environment, countries around the world are expanding their investments in both current and next-generation defense technologies, thereby increasing the long-term demand potential for Amphenol. We continue to make targeted investments to expand our capacity and look forward to supporting this increased demand with our broad product offering. Turning to the commercial aerospace market. This market represented 4% of our sales in the quarter and we had another very strong quarter with sales increasing by a robust 40% in U.S. dollar and organically from prior year, as we benefited from both the continued recovery in global aircraft production, as well as our ongoing efforts to expand our position within this market. Sequentially, our sales grew 9% from the first quarter, which was much better than expectations coming into Q2. We are also very pleased that in the second quarter, our commercial air business was able to reach its highest ever level of quarterly sales. Looking to the third quarter, we expect sales to moderate slightly from these strong second quarter levels and I am just truly grateful to our team working in the commercial air market. With the ongoing recovery in travel and thus demand for jetliners, our efforts to strengthen our breadth of high technology interconnect products, while diversifying our market position into next-generation aircraft are paying real dividends and we look forward to realizing the benefits of these initiatives in 2023 and beyond. The industrial market represented 26% of our sales in the quarter and sales in this market were flat in U.S. dollars and local currencies, but did decline by 7% organically, as growth in medical, transportation, oil and gas, alternative energy and rail mass transit segments was more than offset by moderations across the other segments of the industrial market together with lower sales to the distribution channel. On a sequential basis, sales declined 3% from the first quarter, which was somewhat worse than our expectations. This reflected some incremental slowing of demand from certain customers, in particular, in factory automation and heavy equipment. Looking into the third quarter, we expect sales to moderate slightly from these second quarter levels. Nevertheless, and despite this positive demand, I am very proud of our outstanding global team working in the industrial market. They continue to pursue growth opportunities across the many distinct segments of this exciting and truly diverse market. I remain confident that our long-term strategy to expand our high technology interconnect antenna and sensor offering, both organically and through complementary acquisitions has positioned us to capitalize on the many revolutions that continue to occur across the industrial electronics market. We look forward to realizing the benefits of this strategy for many years to come. The automotive market represented 23% of our sales in the quarter and sales in this market grew 9% in U.S. dollars and 11% organically. This was really driven by broad-based strength across most automotive applications, including electric and hybrid electric vehicle applications. Sequentially, our sales increased by 7% from the first quarter and this was slightly better than our expectations coming into Q2. For the third quarter, we expect sales to be roughly at the same level as we achieved here in the second quarter and I am just really proud of our team working in automotive. Their performance so far this year is yet another confirmation of the benefits of their focus on driving new design wins with customers who are implementing a wide array of new technologies into their vehicles and this includes electrified drivetrains, as well as a multitude of other exciting applications. The mobile device market represented 8% of our sales in the quarter and our sales did moderate by 8% in U.S. dollars and 6% organically in the second quarter, as strength in smartphones and related products was more than offset by declines in tablets and wearables. Sequentially, our sales increased by 3%, which was substantially better than our expectation for a mid-teens decline that we had coming into the quarter. As we now look into the third quarter, we anticipate sales to increase sequentially in the mid-teens from these second quarter levels on seasonal strength. While there\u2019s no question that mobile devices remains our most volatile of end markets, our team once again in the second quarter did an outstanding job of capitalizing on opportunities to realize incremental sales. Their agility and ability to adjust resources in real time with the changing levels of demand continues to create value for Amphenol. As we head into the second half of 2023, our team stands poised as always to leverage our leading array of antennas, interconnect products and mechanisms to capture any opportunities for incremental sales that may arise this year and beyond. The mobile networks market represented 4% of our sales in the quarter. Sales declined by 24% in U.S. dollars and 32% organically as we manage through the expected and broad-based weakness in spending by network operators and wireless equipment manufacturers. Sequentially, our sales in the second quarter declined by 6%, which was a touch better than our expectations coming into the quarter. Looking to the third quarter, we now expect sales to remain at roughly similar levels as we achieved here in the second quarter. Look, there\u2019s no doubt that it\u2019s a challenging short-term wireless investment environment. But nevertheless, our team continues to work aggressively to realize the benefits of our efforts to expand our position in next-generation 5G equipment and networks. With now the addition of RFS together with our already broad array of products, when customers once again drive renewed wireless investments, we look forward to benefiting from the increased potential that comes from our unique position with both equipment manufacturers and mobile service providers. The IT datacom market represented 18% of our sales in the quarter and while sales did decline by 24% in U.S. dollars and organically from prior year, our performance in the quarter was actually better than we had expected 90 days ago. In fact, on a sequential basis, sales increased by 6%, which was in excess of our expectations for sales to be flat. This sequential uptick in sales was driven by a surge in demand from customers accelerating their investments in AI-focused systems or alternative intelligence -- artificial intelligence, which offset somewhat weaker demand in more traditional markets. We also saw robust orders for AI-related applications, which is a strong affirmation of our team\u2019s success in positioning Amphenol as a true leader in the interconnect systems that support AI. Looking to the third quarter, we expect sales to increase modestly from these second quarter levels. While we are continuing to manage through the inventory adjustment in the broader IT market, we are more encouraged than ever by the company\u2019s position in this important space. Whether enabling the current surge in AI-related installations or the broader range of Internet-enabling networks, our team has done an outstanding job developing leading high speed, power and fiber optic interconnect products that are enabling our OEM and web service provider customers to continue to drive their equipment and networks to higher levels of performance. This creates a continued long-term opportunity for Amphenol. The broadband market represented 5% of our sales in the quarter and sales were flat from prior year and up just 1% organically as broadband operators tempered their procurement levels. On a sequential basis, sales declined by 2%, which was modestly better than our expectations. Now looking into the third quarter, we do expect a mid-single-digit sequential decline in sales as operators moderate their spending following several quarters of strong demand and investments. Regardless of this momentary pause in demand, we do remain encouraged by the company\u2019s strengthened position in the broadband market and we look forward to continuing to support our service provider customers around the world, all of whom are working to increase their network coverage and bandwidth to support the proliferation of high speed data applications to homes and businesses. In addition, there remains a significant amount of government funded initiatives, particularly in North America, which gives us confidence for the future of the broadband market. Now turning to our outlook and assuming the current market environment does not meaningfully worsen and also assuming constant exchange rates. For the third quarter, we now expect sales in the range of $3.040 billion to $3.100 billion and adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $0.72 to $0.74. This would represent a sales decline of 6% to 8% and an adjusted diluted EPS decline of 8% to 10% compared to the third quarter of 2022. I remain confident in the ability of our outstanding management team to adapt to the many opportunities and challenges in the current environment and to continue to grow our composition while driving sustainable and strong profitability over the long-term. Finally, and really most importantly, I\u2019d like to take this opportunity to thank the entire Amphenol team around the world for their truly outstanding efforts here in the second quarter. And Operator, at this time, we would be very happy to take any questions that there may be.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Luke Junk with Baird. You may go ahead.\nLuke Junk: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Adam, given all of the attention on AI recently. Just was hoping you can help us better understand the materiality to Amphenol based on what you look, so far amid what you are calling the surge, I guess. Quantitatively, I am thinking in terms of percentage of sales, either relative to IT datacom or maybe even relative to the company, overall? And then qualitatively, just any perspective on sizing the longer opportunity -- longer-term opportunity from your point of view given what\u2019s clearly very early innings right now and just understanding how it\u2019s scaling in the business near term would be very helpful? Thank you.\nAdam Norwitt: Well, Luke, thank you very much. Yeah. Look, without putting specific numbers on to sub-segments of our end markets, I will just tell you that as we came into the second quarter, we had a certain expectation to be flat. And I would tell you that kind of the underlying IT business was maybe even a touch weaker as customers continue to manage through inventory that had built up over the last couple of years. Yet we ended up growing sequentially by 6%. And really, all of that upside -- more than just that upside came really from the near-term demand that we are seeing from a variety of customers who are building out their AI-related systems. In addition, we had a book-to-bill overall for the company of 1:1, but we had a very strong book-to-bill in our IT datacom market. I would tell you, it was about 1.1:1 in IT datacom, where we saw just really strong bookings, which gives us confidence as we guided in the third quarter to be sequentially up. And so I\u2019d say that it\u2019s -- while it\u2019s not the dominant thing in our IT datacom market far from it, because it\u2019s really -- as you say, the early innings. We see the investments in AI as being a real significant dynamic for our company in the future -- in the near-term and in the future and to think about why that is you really have to get to the architecture of these AI systems. In particular, as customers build out these very intensive systems with these GPUs and otherwise, they built them out in a structure that requires just an enormous amount of interconnect. They call it kind of a fabric, if you will, of interconnect, where you have -- you are creating effectively a neural network. And in the neural network, everything has to connect to everything else and it has to do that with high speed and low latency, while using as little power as possible and that just puts an enormous premium on the highest of technology, high speed products, on the most efficient interconnect -- power interconnect and these are all things where Amphenol has a strong leadership position in the industry. Look, long-term, I think, we are in the early euphoria of AI right now and I don\u2019t want to kind of try to prognosticate what AI will mean, let alone what it will mean sort of ethically and more -- metaphysically and all of those things, but what we know for sure is it requires a lot of interconnect today. And as our customers are building on these networks, we stand ready to react to them in real time to make sure that they can stay competitive in a world that has become a real -- a significant dynamic for our customers. Many of them see this kind of existentially and when they need us the most is when we step up to the plate always as Amphenol and are there for our customers. And I think that means that as they continue those investments long term, they will continue to turn to us as really their first phone call.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. You may go ahead.\nSamik Chatterjee: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I guess I am just curious about the industrial segment and this segment you were not very long ago doing double-digit organic growth. It\u2019s obviously moderated since then. This quarter, I think, you had a decline is what you said. I mean how much of this is attributable to inventory digestion of the distributors versus essentially some of the demand -- direct demand from some of the end markets starting to turn negative and any thoughts in terms of when you start to sort of cycle past those individual drivers in terms of timing? Thank you.\nAdam Norwitt: Yeah. Thank you very much, Samik. I think we talked at least last quarter about the fact that we started to see some signs of a little bit of -- some early signs of a little bit of inventory in the industrial market including with our distributors. And no doubt about it, when we look at our results here in the second quarter, where we weren\u2019t in U.S. dollars flat, but organically, we were down by 7%. There is some element of that which comes from distributors managing a bit more of their inventory across the industrial market. And then there are a few segments of the industrial market where I think it\u2019s been well reported that there\u2019s a bit of softness in area like factory automation, on a year-over-year basis, something like instrumentation, where even if there\u2019s been this euphoria around semiconductor capital equipment, for example, there have also been pockets of that market where you have seen real pullbacks in CapEx. I think it\u2019s a market where long-term, there\u2019s a great degree of optimism about the long-term in semiconductor equipment, but there are some short-term vacillations that have been going on in the last quarter or two. Those are areas that maybe I would highlight. I think that our position in industrial remains very broad. We continue to have parts of the industrial market that are performing extremely well. In fact, we saw great growth in areas like rail mass transit, alternative energy, even oil and gas, believe it or not, medical continues to be a very strong area for us. And a credit to our team for never going kind of all in on any one segment of the industrial market, but rather continuing that long-term drive to be as present as possible with the broadest range of products as possible. And to the extent that -- to your question about how long that cycle, may be hard for me to guess. I mean I think we have had similar questions about IT datacom in the past. Here, I think, you have certainly some correction that is happening with distributors, whether that is a one quarter, two quarter, three quarter, hard for me to guess and we will certainly let you know as soon as we have a better view of that.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs. You may go ahead.\nMark Delaney: Yes. Good afternoon and thank you for taking my question. Is there anything in particular that has been helping gross margins such as price/cost mix or the integration of acquisitions or the gross margin in 2Q was at the highest in about five years, even as a handful of end markets are still soft. So I am hoping to better understand what may be positively impacting margins and then any color you can see on how to expect either gross or EBIT margins to trend going forward?\nCraig Lampo: Yeah. Thanks, Mark. Yeah. No. We are -- I mean, we are really just proud of kind of this overall profitability here in the second quarter. I mean we converted on a sequential basis just under 35%, which is certainly far eating kind of our 25% kind of goal on higher sales and year-over-year, the negative version is 30%, which was certainly roughly kind of what we kind of expect on the downside. But if you actually peel acquisitions away from that, it\u2019s really even much better than this 30% that we certainly reported in U.S. dollars here. So, I think, overall, the profitability just of the company just continues to be very robust and really just -- is really because of the great work of the management team to be able to continue to protect the bottomline when we have some markets like communications market, specifically IT datacom that has on a year-over-year basis really seen some significant declines in mobile networks and mobile devices and of sort. So this is really just a great representation of the agility of the entire team to be able to have these robust margins in this environment. I mean specific to gross margins. We typically don\u2019t necessarily measure ourselves on gross margins or SG&A, we really do look at operating margin, which is kind of looking at all aspects of cost. But certainly, to your point, gross margins were higher this quarter than they have been over certainly the recent past. And I think that if you look at kind of the mix of our markets, our markets certainly do have -- our businesses that serve that certain markets do have sometimes higher gross margins or in high SG&A or lower gross margin and lower SG&A to kind of get to those operating margins that we expect and so times -- sometimes the mix of the sales in those markets could have an impact on the overall mix that you are talking about from a gross margin or SG&A perspective. I think we are seeing some of that in our business in the second quarter, where places like military and commercial air certainly very strong. But I think, overall, regardless of how they fluctuate kind of what we are focused on here is operating margin. So I think that, whether or not gross margin SG&A fluctuates a bit on a quarterly basis, I wouldn\u2019t necessarily be concerned or be super focused on that. But at the end of the day, I think, really, what we are focused on is making sure that our operating margins continue to drive good, robust leverage on the higher sales and I think that\u2019s exactly what we are seeing. And as we move forward, even our guidance implies really as strong, I think, conversion and leverage going into here the third quarter, and certainly, I think pricing over the last year has helped a bit with that. But I think that\u2019s kind of necessarily a new story, I think, we talked about us kind of catching up on pricing kind of later last year. So I wouldn\u2019t call that a 2023 story in terms of pricing. I think pricing cost at this point is relatively neutral, and certainly, we will react to anything that happens in the cost environment if that changes. But certainly, very happy with the overall margins and we are going to continue to march forward on that front.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from Abdullah Khan with Evercore. You may go ahead.\nAbdullah Khan: Hi, everyone. Thanks a lot for the question. I wanted to ask about autos, and specifically, we have seen some auto OEMs take down inventories that were built up during the worst crisis of the supply chain. And so I wanted to get your perspective on that, if you have an estimate of how much inventory is overbuilt, if there is any, and as well as the various percentages around the end market? Thank you.\nAdam Norwitt: Yeah. Thank you very much, Abdullah. Honestly, we don\u2019t have a good read on the auto OEM inventory, whether that\u2019s overbuilt or whether they are taking it down. I think what we know is that what our customers are taking from us and what we are able to support them with, and in the quarter, we were able to have a very strong -- yet another very strong quarter in automotive, growing by 9% in U.S. dollars and 11% organically. And I think that\u2019s just a testament to our team\u2019s continued success in developing new products that go on new applications in the car. And so, to the extent that there is some vacillation that should come, if automakers decide to take more inventory or less inventory if they sell more cars or less cars, I mean, these are kind of things that are what they are. But what we can control is our position on these new applications on things like electrified drivetrains, on things like advanced safety, on things like advanced communication and so many other new applications going into cars. I mean I just got a new car recently and I still after a couple of weeks haven\u2019t figured out half of what the darn thing can do. And it just reminds me how many new systems are put into these cars, how many new applications and how much content for new products that weren\u2019t previously in a car. And we are seeing products being sold into cars that in the past, we were selling things that went into computers or to other advanced systems and all of a sudden they are being repackaged and repurposed to go into these cars where the continued growth in content is really explosive. And so I don\u2019t know, was inventory going down a little bit this quarter when we were going up 11% organically, maybe others have a better read on that than we do. But for sure, we continue to see strong momentum in automotive, and I think next quarter, we have once again a strong outlook in this market, and that\u2019s after several years of real outperformance to any comparable measure.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. You may go ahead.\nWamsi Mohan: Yes. Thank you so much. Adam, I know you mentioned it\u2019s a hard market to nail down seasonality, but if you think about seasonality in mobile devices and where you are guiding to in the mid-teens, that\u2019s the lowest level since 2016. It\u2019s at least 15 points below what you typically guide, or well, typically achieve anyway and when I sort of look at even 2016, that was a year where 2Q grew in the mid-teens, and you were coming off a much stronger base. So can you help us think through maybe what you are seeing today in terms of what seasonality it feels as though, at least from what we hear, at least on the PC side, there is a sequential improvement. So just wondering what the puts and takes are that you are seeing that\u2019s causing you to guide to good mid-teens over here? Thank you.\nAdam Norwitt: Yeah. Wamsi, thanks so much. I mean, look, I will put this maybe in a couple of contexts. One is that we came into the second quarter with an expectation for the market to be actually down in the mid-teens and we ultimately achieved on a sequential basis, close to 20 points better than that, growing by 3% sequentially. Yes, still down on a year-over-year basis, but very strong compared to our expectations and that strength really did come out of smartphones, in particular. And as we look at our guidance here for the third quarter, I think, you are arithmetically correct, that 17% sequential in the third quarter is maybe a touch lower than what we have seen in years past, maybe 2016 to the contrary notwithstanding. But if we break that down a little bit, I can just tell you this, that our expectation for our sales into smartphones is actually very robust, actually, I would say, even a little bit above our normal seasonality and that\u2019s offset by a more modest expectation in areas like tablets and laptops and other computing devices. And look, I don\u2019t know what the PC forecasts are, how those relate to, to the various devices that we are selling into. But one dynamic is, for sure, is that with COVID happening over the recent three years, there was a surge in demand for those products that were really used for home by people who are studying and working and otherwise communicating from home. And that kind of put a little bit of a hitch in the typical replacement cycle of a lot of these devices and I think we are still seeing a bit of a hangover from that right now in terms of the overall demand for those devices. Meanwhile, the smartphone products, our position on smartphones remains very robust and we see strong growth potential in smartphones going forward into the third quarter and that ultimately comes all together with this mid-teens expectation that we have on a sequential basis for the third quarter. Look, I mean, you can get pretty grey hair pretty quickly by trying to guess all the ins and outs of where the mobile device market is headed and we do our best job as we can in giving an outlook for that. But then once we give that outlook, as you know, our team is not resting on their laurels. They are ready at any time to capitalize on any upside that may come along or to manage through a downside that make it along as well and it remains our hardest market to forecast and guide to and it remains our team that is the most agile of any that I have ever seen in the industry. So I am confident going forward, that our team will continue to create great success and that our robust position in this market will continue to create great value for Amphenol.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from Matt Sheerin with Stifel. You may go ahead.\nMatt Sheerin: Yes. Thanks, and good afternoon, everyone. Adam, I wanted to asked about the military market, you have had some very strong double-digit growth here for a few quarters and your outlook continues to be strong. Could you talk about some of the drivers and maybe some of the programs and the diversification within those end markets?\nAdam Norwitt: Yeah. Thanks very much, Matt. No doubt about it, our team working in the military aerospace market or defense market, as I actually call it a lit bit often these days, is doing a great job. And it\u2019s interesting, we track, I don\u2019t know, kind of 10 or a dozen different sub-segments of that market. And about three quarters or even closer to like eight out of 10 of those markets grew in very strong double digits on a year-over-year basis last quarter, with just a couple of them a little bit lower performance. And it just reflects the real breadth of our position and the breadth of investments that countries around the world are making in new defense technologies. I mean, look, I look every day at what\u2019s happening with the tragedy in Ukraine. I looked with some anxiety at some of the other geopolitical tensions that are around the world. At the same time, I think, we at Amphenol look in the mirror and we feel very positive about the role that our team is directly playing in ensuring that the free people of the world get to remain free. And that reactivity of our team to grow by 19% organically on a year-over-year basis in a market with a product set that is not an easy product set to scale. I mean, these are products that are very complex to manufacture. They require an immense amount of qualifications and adherence to standards. They are very vertically integrated. And so to flex one\u2019s capacity in this market as we have done is really an extraordinary and one that is not lost on our customers in terms of our ability to really do what it takes and our willingness to invest when need be and to flex whenever possible to satisfy this really kind of existential demand that we are seeing in many cases. As I look forward in the defense market, I think, for better or for worse, I think, we are in an era today of more anxiety, more dynamics where more and more the nations that are allied with our country, with the Europeans and others are having to invest more significantly than ever before in next-generation defense technologies. And is the broadest manufacturer of those products, both having the broadest product line in the deepest technologies, we are ready and able to support that as much as possible. We will see, I mean, we are guiding here in the third quarter to a kind of similar levels in what is traditionally a softer third quarter from a seasonality perspective and our team stands ready to react whenever needed. And every day we watch the pictures coming from Ukraine and while we have a tear in one eye, we also have a pride in our belly of the part that we are doing to help those people stay free.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from Steven Fox with Fox Advisors. You may go ahead.\nSteven Fox: Thanks. Good afternoon, Adam. I was just hoping to circle back a little bit more on the industrial markets. I mean the macro data is looking worrisome, but I am trying to understand how much of your sales on to like factory plant floors is under pressure, maybe where there\u2019s some good signs and how long of a decline you are thinking looking at that just industrial factory sales? Thanks.\nAdam Norwitt: Thanks very much, Steve. Look, I think, we talked a little bit about factory automation as one area that I highlighted that we did see on a year-over-year basis, some downturn and also on the sequential basis. And I think it\u2019s been broadly reported that there\u2019s some moderation in demand around that area. How long that\u2019s going to last? It\u2019s really hard, Steve, for me to give a prognosis on. I think that we have a very strong position here. I think that the adoption of electronics in factories. The underlying trend of that, I think, is a very positive trend in the short-, medium- and in particular, the long-term. As countries and companies around the world deal with labor shortages, and I mean, gosh, you can\u2019t pick up a newspaper these days without seeing something about some either labor shortage or labor strike that is happening in the world over, there\u2019s no doubt that the adoption of electronic be it automation, robotics, next-generation factory management systems, I mean, these are really accelerating broadly. And the fact that we go through right now, let\u2019s call it, a kind of temporary pause in that for a variety of reasons, it does not take away from the very long-term prognosis for factory automation, which I think is quite a positive over the long-term.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from Chris Snyder with UBS. You may go ahead.\nChris Snyder: Thank you. I wanted to follow-up on some of the AI commentary from earlier. It certainly seems to be an opportunity right in the company to real house, and obviously, great to see meaningful revenue impact already. I was just wondering if you could talk a bit about the competitive landscape for these high power, low latency data center applications and Amphenol\u2019s competitive positioning within that. I would assume there\u2019s not too many companies that can deliver this technology? Thank you.\nAdam Norwitt: Yeah. Thanks so much, Chris. I mean, look, these are really hard products to make, let\u2019s start from that. To have a high speed interconnect product, be it a cable assembly, an IO connector, a backplane connector, a cable backplane system, whatever it may be, these are extraordinarily complicated products to make where the underlying technology to make them take years to develop, the manufacturing processes are extremely challenging to make these things. And so you are correct, there is a very small universe of companies and we have strong competitors, there\u2019s no doubt about it, who we respect, no question. But it is a relatively confined universe of companies who ultimately have put in the decades. And I call it really decades of investments in the engineering competency, the test and the validation of those products and all of those things, which ultimately allow one to make a reliable product that can support these next-generation complicated AI learning systems. Our position, look, we are the world leader in high speed interconnect technology. That\u2019s something that we are very proud of and that we continue to be very carefully building upon over the years and that position, I think, is a robust one for as AI investments continue.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from Joe Giordano with TD Cowen. You may go ahead.\nJoe Giordano: Hey. Good afternoon, guys. Just curious if you can give some color or kind of update on how your mix in auto regionally has shifted over time. Just given the growth that you have had over the last several years? Just commentary like you expect 3Q to be kind of similar to 2Q, but production is supposed to be down sequentially like 5%. So I am just curious if some of that is just content you are winning or some of that is regional shifts and you are participating more in faster growth markets than you used to, just any color there would be helpful?\nAdam Norwitt: Yeah. Thanks very much, Joe. Look, I think, if you look over a very long time period, the mix of our auto business has changed quite dramatically. I remember, gosh, when I first became CEO and that\u2019s 15 years ago, not to mention when I which was 25 years ago yesterday, our auto business was a predominantly European business. And even in my first quarter as CEO, I think, it was roughly two-thirds was European and the rest was sort of split evenly between Asia and North America and today I would tell you that the three regions are relatively balanced with maybe a touch more in Asia, followed by Europe and North America. So that has changed a lot. And I think part of that change has been really this revolution electrification where our team has done a fabulous job in taking advantage of that revolution electrification and where the largest markets for that, at least so far, have been in Asia and we have done an excellent job of positioning ourselves on a broad basis with companies who are really driving electrified and hybrid electrified vehicles. And so if I look at last quarter, we grew organically really in all three regions. I would say Europe actually grew the strongest last quarter, but we did realize growth in all three regions and I think we have a very robust position across all regions for the automotive market. And to the extent that those dynamics change, there\u2019s new companies, accelerating their performance in other regions, I am confident that our team is going to do a good job of positioning ourselves there to benefit from that.\nOperator: Thank you. And our last question comes from Will Stein with Truist Securities. You may go ahead.\nWill Stein: Thanks for taking my question. I\u2019d like to ask about the broadband end market. It\u2019s been fairly well discussed among companies and in the media that there are several big projects in the U.S. like RDOF and other countries as well, to deliver broadband to more rural areas and I wonder if you can describe how that\u2019s been influencing demand in that end market and your anticipated performance over the next few quarters? Thank you.\nAdam Norwitt: Yeah. Thanks very much, Will. Look, I think, I mentioned in my prepared remarks that, while we do see a temporary pause. I mean, we have had really strong growth in broadband over the last year. I mean, last year alone, we grew by 62% in U.S. dollars and 38% organically, and yes, I mean, in the second quarter, we were flat and we guided it to be a little bit down sequentially in the third quarter. But no doubt about it, we are benefiting not just from the demand for customers around the world for higher speed connectivity to their homes and businesses, but also from the government funding that is going into this. And in particular, you mentioned RDOF, there\u2019s also BID [ph]. Both of these initiatives in North America are very significant, and by the way, long overdue from my perspective. I mean we live in a world where connectivity to the Internet becomes not just a nice thing to have, but it is really -- it is a kind of thing that you must have, it\u2019s like electricity and access to water and indoor plumbing, having the plumbing to the Internet is critical. You try to look for a job if you don\u2019t have the Internet. Try to apply for a government benefit if you don\u2019t have access to the Internet. It\u2019s essentially impossible these days. And so I think it\u2019s a really noble cause that is there to build access some of the remotest areas of our country, so that all people can have equal access to high speed, low latency Internet and all what comes along with that. And we are very happy to play our part in that, and to benefit from that over the long-term and this temporary pause that is going on right now, I think, is just that. And we look forward over -- in the coming years as that money does necessarily get spent by governments, as well as by the private sector that will be a strong participant and enabler of the broadband revolution.\nOperator: Thank you. And I will now turn the call back to Mr. Norwitt for closing remarks.\nAdam Norwitt: Well, thank you all so much for your time today. We appreciate everybody\u2019s time on this hot summer day and I hope it\u2019s not too late to wish all of you a nice summer. And I hope that you will have a little bit of chance to get some downtime as we get into the end of July and August, and we look forward to speaking to all of you in the fall in just 90 days. Thanks so much.\nCraig Lampo: Thanks, everybody.\nOperator: Thank you for attending today\u2019s conference and have a nice day.",

            "name": "Craig Lampo",
            "content": "Thank you very much. Good afternoon, everyone. This is Craig Lampo, Amphenol\u2019s CFO and I am here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO. We would like to welcome you to our second quarter 2023 conference call. Our second quarter 2023 results were released this morning. I will provide some financial commentary and then Adam will give an overview of the business and current trends and then we will take questions. As a reminder, during the call, we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures and make certain forward-looking statements, so please refer to the relevant disclosures in our press release for further information. The company closed the second quarter with sales of $3,054 million and GAAP and adjusted diluted EPS of $0.74 and $0.72, respectively. Second quarter sales were down 3% in U.S. dollars, 2% in local currencies and organically -- and 4% organically compared to the second quarter of 2022. Sequentially, sales were up 3% in U.S. dollars in local currencies and 2% organically. Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes. Orders in the quarter were $3,044 million, which was down 12% compared to the second quarter of 2022, but up 5% sequentially, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1:1. GAAP operating income was $620 million in the second quarter of 2023, which included $4 million of acquisition-related costs. Excluding these costs, adjusted operating income was $624 million. GAAP and adjusted operating margins were 20.3% and 20.4%, respectively, in the second quarter of 2023. On a GAAP basis, operating margin decreased by 40 basis points compared to the second quarter of 2022, but increased by 40 basis points sequentially. And on an adjusted basis, operating margin decreased 30 basis points compared to the second quarter of 2022, but increased by 30 basis points sequentially. This modest year-over-year decrease in adjusted operating margin reflected a strong downside conversion on the sales -- lower sales volumes, as well as the dilutive impact of acquisitions, which are currently operating below the corporate average. On a sequential basis, the increase in adjusted operating margin reflected strong conversion on the higher sales levels. Our team continues to execute well in the quarter, and we are proud to have sustained these healthy levels of profitability despite the continued range of challenges around the world. During the second quarter, we were excited to have closed on the previously announced acquisition of RFS. The value of the net assets we acquired were in excess of the RFS purchase price. And as a result, we recorded a noncash gain of $5 million in the second quarter, which has been excluded from our adjusted EPS results. In the third quarter of 2023, we expect to incur restructuring costs associated with RFS, which we estimate will be in the range of $5 million to $10 million. These costs will be excluded from our third quarter adjusted EPS results and are excluded from our Q3 2023 guidance. Breaking down second quarter results by segment, relative to the second quarter of 2022, sales in the Harsh Environment Solutions segment were $889 million and increased by 12% in U.S. dollars and 9% organically and segment operating margin was 27%. Sales in the Communications Solutions segment were $1,162 million and declined by 16% in U.S. dollars and organically and segment operating margin was 20.5%. Sales in Interconnect and Sensor Systems segment were $1,003 million and increased by 4% in U.S. dollars and 1% organically and segment operating margin was 18.5%. The company\u2019s GAAP effective tax rate for the second quarter was 21.9% and the adjusted effective tax rate was 24%, which compared to 23.3% and 24.5% in the second quarter of 2022, respectively. GAAP diluted EPS decreased 3% to $0.74, compared to $0.76 in the prior year period. And on an adjusted basis, diluted EPS increased -- decreased 4% to $0.72, compared to $0.75 in the second quarter of 2022. Operating cash flow in the second quarter was $536 million or 120% of adjusted net income, and net of capital spending, our free cash flow was $442 million or nearly 100% of adjusted net income. We are very pleased to continue to deliver such a strong cash flow yield. From a working capital standpoint, inventory days, days sales outstanding and payable days were 87 days, 71 days and 48 days, respectively. Through the focused attention of our management team during the quarter, we were able to bring inventory days back in line with our normal range. During the quarter, the company repurchased 2 million shares of common stock at an average price of approximately $77. When combined with our normal quarterly dividend, total capital return to shareholders in the second quarter of 2023 was $280 million. Total debt on June 30th was $4.3 billion and net debt was $2.8 billion. Total liquidity at the end of the quarter was $4.8 billion, which included cash and short-term investments on hand of $1.5 billion plus availability under our existing credit facilities. Second quarter 2023 EBITDA was $736 million and at the end of the second quarter of 2023, our net leverage ratio was 0.9 times. We are very pleased that the company\u2019s financial position remains extremely strong by any measure. I will now turn the call over to Adam, who will provide some commentary on current market trends. Yeah. Thanks, Mark. Yeah. No. We are -- I mean, we are really just proud of kind of this overall profitability here in the second quarter. I mean we converted on a sequential basis just under 35%, which is certainly far eating kind of our 25% kind of goal on higher sales and year-over-year, the negative version is 30%, which was certainly roughly kind of what we kind of expect on the downside. But if you actually peel acquisitions away from that, it\u2019s really even much better than this 30% that we certainly reported in U.S. dollars here. So, I think, overall, the profitability just of the company just continues to be very robust and really just -- is really because of the great work of the management team to be able to continue to protect the bottomline when we have some markets like communications market, specifically IT datacom that has on a year-over-year basis really seen some significant declines in mobile networks and mobile devices and of sort. So this is really just a great representation of the agility of the entire team to be able to have these robust margins in this environment. I mean specific to gross margins. We typically don\u2019t necessarily measure ourselves on gross margins or SG&A, we really do look at operating margin, which is kind of looking at all aspects of cost. But certainly, to your point, gross margins were higher this quarter than they have been over certainly the recent past. And I think that if you look at kind of the mix of our markets, our markets certainly do have -- our businesses that serve that certain markets do have sometimes higher gross margins or in high SG&A or lower gross margin and lower SG&A to kind of get to those operating margins that we expect and so times -- sometimes the mix of the sales in those markets could have an impact on the overall mix that you are talking about from a gross margin or SG&A perspective. I think we are seeing some of that in our business in the second quarter, where places like military and commercial air certainly very strong. But I think, overall, regardless of how they fluctuate kind of what we are focused on here is operating margin. So I think that, whether or not gross margin SG&A fluctuates a bit on a quarterly basis, I wouldn\u2019t necessarily be concerned or be super focused on that. But at the end of the day, I think, really, what we are focused on is making sure that our operating margins continue to drive good, robust leverage on the higher sales and I think that\u2019s exactly what we are seeing. And as we move forward, even our guidance implies really as strong, I think, conversion and leverage going into here the third quarter, and certainly, I think pricing over the last year has helped a bit with that. But I think that\u2019s kind of necessarily a new story, I think, we talked about us kind of catching up on pricing kind of later last year. So I wouldn\u2019t call that a 2023 story in terms of pricing. I think pricing cost at this point is relatively neutral, and certainly, we will react to anything that happens in the cost environment if that changes. But certainly, very happy with the overall margins and we are going to continue to march forward on that front. Thanks, everybody."

            "name": "Adam Norwitt",
            "content": "Well, thank you very much, Craig, and I\u2019d like to extend my welcome to all of you here on the phone today on this beautiful summer day here in Wallingford, Connecticut. And I do hope that all of you on the call, together with your family, friends and colleagues are enjoying a little bit of your summer thus far. As Craig mentioned, I am going to highlight some of our achievements in the second quarter. I will then spend a moment to discuss our trends and the progress across our served markets and make some comments on our outlook for the third quarter, and then obviously, we will have time for questions at the end. With respect to the second quarter, our results were better than expected as we exceeded the high end of our guidance in sales and adjusted diluted earnings per share. Sales declined 3% in U.S. dollars and 2% in local currency reaching $3,054 million, with growth in commercial air, military and automotive end markets, as well as contributions from our acquisitions, slightly more than offset by moderations in the mobile networks, IT datacom and mobile devices segments. On an organic basis, sales did decline by 4%. We are very pleased that the company booked orders in the quarter of $3.44 billion, which represented a book-to-bill of 1:1. As Craig described, our margins in the quarter, adjusted operating margins were 20.4%, which was down 30 basis points from prior year, but which improved by 30 basis points from the first quarter sequentially. I am very pleased that our margins in the second quarter once again reflected outstanding execution by our global management team, who continue to quickly adjust to changing demand and costs amidst these very dynamic times. Adjusted diluted EPS in the quarter of 72% -- $0.72 declined 4% from prior year but increased 4% from the sequential prior quarter. We also generated strong operating and free cash flow of $536 million and $442 million in the second quarter, yet another demonstration of the high quality of the company\u2019s earnings. I am extremely proud of the Amphenol team around the world. Our results this quarter once again reflect the strength of our Amphenolian entrepreneurial organization, as we continue to perform well amidst a very dynamic and challenging environment. We are pleased to announce today that we closed the previously announced acquisition of the North American cable and global base station antenna business of RFS. Despite some current moderation in the mobile networks market, we remain excited about the long-term prospects of RFS as part of the Amphenol family. We now expect this acquisition to generate roughly $30 million of sales in the second half of 2023. In addition, we are pleased that just in the last few days, we closed on the acquisition of EBY Electro. EBY is based in the state of New York in the U.S. with annual sales of approximately $15 million. And EBY is a designer and distributor of terminal block interconnect products to the North American industrial market. The addition of EBY further expands our offering of high technology interconnect products into the diversified industrial market. As we welcome these outstanding new teams to Amphenol, we remain confident that our acquisition program will continue to create great value for the company. Our ability to identify and execute upon acquisitions, and successfully bring these new organizations into the Amphenol organization remains a core competitive advantage for us. Now turning to the trends and progress across our served markets. We are very pleased that the company\u2019s end market exposure remains highly diversified, balanced and broad. In particular, in hits these very dynamic times, Amphenol\u2019s end market diversification continues to create great value for the company. The military market represented 12% of our sales in the quarter and sales in this market grew by a very strong 21% in U.S. dollars and 19% organically, and this was really driven by broad-based growth across most segments within the defense market. Sequentially, our sales increased by a better-than-expected 8%. Looking into the third quarter, we expect sales to remain at these robust second quarter levels. I just have to say that we remain very encouraged by the strength of the company\u2019s position in the defense market, where we continue to offer the industry\u2019s widest range of high technology interconnect products. Amidst today\u2019s highly dynamic geopolitical environment, countries around the world are expanding their investments in both current and next-generation defense technologies, thereby increasing the long-term demand potential for Amphenol. We continue to make targeted investments to expand our capacity and look forward to supporting this increased demand with our broad product offering. Turning to the commercial aerospace market. This market represented 4% of our sales in the quarter and we had another very strong quarter with sales increasing by a robust 40% in U.S. dollar and organically from prior year, as we benefited from both the continued recovery in global aircraft production, as well as our ongoing efforts to expand our position within this market. Sequentially, our sales grew 9% from the first quarter, which was much better than expectations coming into Q2. We are also very pleased that in the second quarter, our commercial air business was able to reach its highest ever level of quarterly sales. Looking to the third quarter, we expect sales to moderate slightly from these strong second quarter levels and I am just truly grateful to our team working in the commercial air market. With the ongoing recovery in travel and thus demand for jetliners, our efforts to strengthen our breadth of high technology interconnect products, while diversifying our market position into next-generation aircraft are paying real dividends and we look forward to realizing the benefits of these initiatives in 2023 and beyond. The industrial market represented 26% of our sales in the quarter and sales in this market were flat in U.S. dollars and local currencies, but did decline by 7% organically, as growth in medical, transportation, oil and gas, alternative energy and rail mass transit segments was more than offset by moderations across the other segments of the industrial market together with lower sales to the distribution channel. On a sequential basis, sales declined 3% from the first quarter, which was somewhat worse than our expectations. This reflected some incremental slowing of demand from certain customers, in particular, in factory automation and heavy equipment. Looking into the third quarter, we expect sales to moderate slightly from these second quarter levels. Nevertheless, and despite this positive demand, I am very proud of our outstanding global team working in the industrial market. They continue to pursue growth opportunities across the many distinct segments of this exciting and truly diverse market. I remain confident that our long-term strategy to expand our high technology interconnect antenna and sensor offering, both organically and through complementary acquisitions has positioned us to capitalize on the many revolutions that continue to occur across the industrial electronics market. We look forward to realizing the benefits of this strategy for many years to come. The automotive market represented 23% of our sales in the quarter and sales in this market grew 9% in U.S. dollars and 11% organically. This was really driven by broad-based strength across most automotive applications, including electric and hybrid electric vehicle applications. Sequentially, our sales increased by 7% from the first quarter and this was slightly better than our expectations coming into Q2. For the third quarter, we expect sales to be roughly at the same level as we achieved here in the second quarter and I am just really proud of our team working in automotive. Their performance so far this year is yet another confirmation of the benefits of their focus on driving new design wins with customers who are implementing a wide array of new technologies into their vehicles and this includes electrified drivetrains, as well as a multitude of other exciting applications. The mobile device market represented 8% of our sales in the quarter and our sales did moderate by 8% in U.S. dollars and 6% organically in the second quarter, as strength in smartphones and related products was more than offset by declines in tablets and wearables. Sequentially, our sales increased by 3%, which was substantially better than our expectation for a mid-teens decline that we had coming into the quarter. As we now look into the third quarter, we anticipate sales to increase sequentially in the mid-teens from these second quarter levels on seasonal strength. While there\u2019s no question that mobile devices remains our most volatile of end markets, our team once again in the second quarter did an outstanding job of capitalizing on opportunities to realize incremental sales. Their agility and ability to adjust resources in real time with the changing levels of demand continues to create value for Amphenol. As we head into the second half of 2023, our team stands poised as always to leverage our leading array of antennas, interconnect products and mechanisms to capture any opportunities for incremental sales that may arise this year and beyond. The mobile networks market represented 4% of our sales in the quarter. Sales declined by 24% in U.S. dollars and 32% organically as we manage through the expected and broad-based weakness in spending by network operators and wireless equipment manufacturers. Sequentially, our sales in the second quarter declined by 6%, which was a touch better than our expectations coming into the quarter. Looking to the third quarter, we now expect sales to remain at roughly similar levels as we achieved here in the second quarter. Look, there\u2019s no doubt that it\u2019s a challenging short-term wireless investment environment. But nevertheless, our team continues to work aggressively to realize the benefits of our efforts to expand our position in next-generation 5G equipment and networks. With now the addition of RFS together with our already broad array of products, when customers once again drive renewed wireless investments, we look forward to benefiting from the increased potential that comes from our unique position with both equipment manufacturers and mobile service providers. The IT datacom market represented 18% of our sales in the quarter and while sales did decline by 24% in U.S. dollars and organically from prior year, our performance in the quarter was actually better than we had expected 90 days ago. In fact, on a sequential basis, sales increased by 6%, which was in excess of our expectations for sales to be flat. This sequential uptick in sales was driven by a surge in demand from customers accelerating their investments in AI-focused systems or alternative intelligence -- artificial intelligence, which offset somewhat weaker demand in more traditional markets. We also saw robust orders for AI-related applications, which is a strong affirmation of our team\u2019s success in positioning Amphenol as a true leader in the interconnect systems that support AI. Looking to the third quarter, we expect sales to increase modestly from these second quarter levels. While we are continuing to manage through the inventory adjustment in the broader IT market, we are more encouraged than ever by the company\u2019s position in this important space. Whether enabling the current surge in AI-related installations or the broader range of Internet-enabling networks, our team has done an outstanding job developing leading high speed, power and fiber optic interconnect products that are enabling our OEM and web service provider customers to continue to drive their equipment and networks to higher levels of performance. This creates a continued long-term opportunity for Amphenol. The broadband market represented 5% of our sales in the quarter and sales were flat from prior year and up just 1% organically as broadband operators tempered their procurement levels. On a sequential basis, sales declined by 2%, which was modestly better than our expectations. Now looking into the third quarter, we do expect a mid-single-digit sequential decline in sales as operators moderate their spending following several quarters of strong demand and investments. Regardless of this momentary pause in demand, we do remain encouraged by the company\u2019s strengthened position in the broadband market and we look forward to continuing to support our service provider customers around the world, all of whom are working to increase their network coverage and bandwidth to support the proliferation of high speed data applications to homes and businesses. In addition, there remains a significant amount of government funded initiatives, particularly in North America, which gives us confidence for the future of the broadband market. Now turning to our outlook and assuming the current market environment does not meaningfully worsen and also assuming constant exchange rates. For the third quarter, we now expect sales in the range of $3.040 billion to $3.100 billion and adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $0.72 to $0.74. This would represent a sales decline of 6% to 8% and an adjusted diluted EPS decline of 8% to 10% compared to the third quarter of 2022. I remain confident in the ability of our outstanding management team to adapt to the many opportunities and challenges in the current environment and to continue to grow our composition while driving sustainable and strong profitability over the long-term. Finally, and really most importantly, I\u2019d like to take this opportunity to thank the entire Amphenol team around the world for their truly outstanding efforts here in the second quarter. And Operator, at this time, we would be very happy to take any questions that there may be. Well, Luke, thank you very much. Yeah. Look, without putting specific numbers on to sub-segments of our end markets, I will just tell you that as we came into the second quarter, we had a certain expectation to be flat. And I would tell you that kind of the underlying IT business was maybe even a touch weaker as customers continue to manage through inventory that had built up over the last couple of years. Yet we ended up growing sequentially by 6%. And really, all of that upside -- more than just that upside came really from the near-term demand that we are seeing from a variety of customers who are building out their AI-related systems. In addition, we had a book-to-bill overall for the company of 1:1, but we had a very strong book-to-bill in our IT datacom market. I would tell you, it was about 1.1:1 in IT datacom, where we saw just really strong bookings, which gives us confidence as we guided in the third quarter to be sequentially up. And so I\u2019d say that it\u2019s -- while it\u2019s not the dominant thing in our IT datacom market far from it, because it\u2019s really -- as you say, the early innings. We see the investments in AI as being a real significant dynamic for our company in the future -- in the near-term and in the future and to think about why that is you really have to get to the architecture of these AI systems. In particular, as customers build out these very intensive systems with these GPUs and otherwise, they built them out in a structure that requires just an enormous amount of interconnect. They call it kind of a fabric, if you will, of interconnect, where you have -- you are creating effectively a neural network. And in the neural network, everything has to connect to everything else and it has to do that with high speed and low latency, while using as little power as possible and that just puts an enormous premium on the highest of technology, high speed products, on the most efficient interconnect -- power interconnect and these are all things where Amphenol has a strong leadership position in the industry. Look, long-term, I think, we are in the early euphoria of AI right now and I don\u2019t want to kind of try to prognosticate what AI will mean, let alone what it will mean sort of ethically and more -- metaphysically and all of those things, but what we know for sure is it requires a lot of interconnect today. And as our customers are building on these networks, we stand ready to react to them in real time to make sure that they can stay competitive in a world that has become a real -- a significant dynamic for our customers. Many of them see this kind of existentially and when they need us the most is when we step up to the plate always as Amphenol and are there for our customers. And I think that means that as they continue those investments long term, they will continue to turn to us as really their first phone call. Yeah. Thank you very much, Samik. I think we talked at least last quarter about the fact that we started to see some signs of a little bit of -- some early signs of a little bit of inventory in the industrial market including with our distributors. And no doubt about it, when we look at our results here in the second quarter, where we weren\u2019t in U.S. dollars flat, but organically, we were down by 7%. There is some element of that which comes from distributors managing a bit more of their inventory across the industrial market. And then there are a few segments of the industrial market where I think it\u2019s been well reported that there\u2019s a bit of softness in area like factory automation, on a year-over-year basis, something like instrumentation, where even if there\u2019s been this euphoria around semiconductor capital equipment, for example, there have also been pockets of that market where you have seen real pullbacks in CapEx. I think it\u2019s a market where long-term, there\u2019s a great degree of optimism about the long-term in semiconductor equipment, but there are some short-term vacillations that have been going on in the last quarter or two. Those are areas that maybe I would highlight. I think that our position in industrial remains very broad. We continue to have parts of the industrial market that are performing extremely well. In fact, we saw great growth in areas like rail mass transit, alternative energy, even oil and gas, believe it or not, medical continues to be a very strong area for us. And a credit to our team for never going kind of all in on any one segment of the industrial market, but rather continuing that long-term drive to be as present as possible with the broadest range of products as possible. And to the extent that -- to your question about how long that cycle, may be hard for me to guess. I mean I think we have had similar questions about IT datacom in the past. Here, I think, you have certainly some correction that is happening with distributors, whether that is a one quarter, two quarter, three quarter, hard for me to guess and we will certainly let you know as soon as we have a better view of that. Yeah. Thank you very much, Abdullah. Honestly, we don\u2019t have a good read on the auto OEM inventory, whether that\u2019s overbuilt or whether they are taking it down. I think what we know is that what our customers are taking from us and what we are able to support them with, and in the quarter, we were able to have a very strong -- yet another very strong quarter in automotive, growing by 9% in U.S. dollars and 11% organically. And I think that\u2019s just a testament to our team\u2019s continued success in developing new products that go on new applications in the car. And so, to the extent that there is some vacillation that should come, if automakers decide to take more inventory or less inventory if they sell more cars or less cars, I mean, these are kind of things that are what they are. But what we can control is our position on these new applications on things like electrified drivetrains, on things like advanced safety, on things like advanced communication and so many other new applications going into cars. I mean I just got a new car recently and I still after a couple of weeks haven\u2019t figured out half of what the darn thing can do. And it just reminds me how many new systems are put into these cars, how many new applications and how much content for new products that weren\u2019t previously in a car. And we are seeing products being sold into cars that in the past, we were selling things that went into computers or to other advanced systems and all of a sudden they are being repackaged and repurposed to go into these cars where the continued growth in content is really explosive. And so I don\u2019t know, was inventory going down a little bit this quarter when we were going up 11% organically, maybe others have a better read on that than we do. But for sure, we continue to see strong momentum in automotive, and I think next quarter, we have once again a strong outlook in this market, and that\u2019s after several years of real outperformance to any comparable measure. Yeah. Wamsi, thanks so much. I mean, look, I will put this maybe in a couple of contexts. One is that we came into the second quarter with an expectation for the market to be actually down in the mid-teens and we ultimately achieved on a sequential basis, close to 20 points better than that, growing by 3% sequentially. Yes, still down on a year-over-year basis, but very strong compared to our expectations and that strength really did come out of smartphones, in particular. And as we look at our guidance here for the third quarter, I think, you are arithmetically correct, that 17% sequential in the third quarter is maybe a touch lower than what we have seen in years past, maybe 2016 to the contrary notwithstanding. But if we break that down a little bit, I can just tell you this, that our expectation for our sales into smartphones is actually very robust, actually, I would say, even a little bit above our normal seasonality and that\u2019s offset by a more modest expectation in areas like tablets and laptops and other computing devices. And look, I don\u2019t know what the PC forecasts are, how those relate to, to the various devices that we are selling into. But one dynamic is, for sure, is that with COVID happening over the recent three years, there was a surge in demand for those products that were really used for home by people who are studying and working and otherwise communicating from home. And that kind of put a little bit of a hitch in the typical replacement cycle of a lot of these devices and I think we are still seeing a bit of a hangover from that right now in terms of the overall demand for those devices. Meanwhile, the smartphone products, our position on smartphones remains very robust and we see strong growth potential in smartphones going forward into the third quarter and that ultimately comes all together with this mid-teens expectation that we have on a sequential basis for the third quarter. Look, I mean, you can get pretty grey hair pretty quickly by trying to guess all the ins and outs of where the mobile device market is headed and we do our best job as we can in giving an outlook for that. But then once we give that outlook, as you know, our team is not resting on their laurels. They are ready at any time to capitalize on any upside that may come along or to manage through a downside that make it along as well and it remains our hardest market to forecast and guide to and it remains our team that is the most agile of any that I have ever seen in the industry. So I am confident going forward, that our team will continue to create great success and that our robust position in this market will continue to create great value for Amphenol. Yeah. Thanks very much, Matt. No doubt about it, our team working in the military aerospace market or defense market, as I actually call it a lit bit often these days, is doing a great job. And it\u2019s interesting, we track, I don\u2019t know, kind of 10 or a dozen different sub-segments of that market. And about three quarters or even closer to like eight out of 10 of those markets grew in very strong double digits on a year-over-year basis last quarter, with just a couple of them a little bit lower performance. And it just reflects the real breadth of our position and the breadth of investments that countries around the world are making in new defense technologies. I mean, look, I look every day at what\u2019s happening with the tragedy in Ukraine. I looked with some anxiety at some of the other geopolitical tensions that are around the world. At the same time, I think, we at Amphenol look in the mirror and we feel very positive about the role that our team is directly playing in ensuring that the free people of the world get to remain free. And that reactivity of our team to grow by 19% organically on a year-over-year basis in a market with a product set that is not an easy product set to scale. I mean, these are products that are very complex to manufacture. They require an immense amount of qualifications and adherence to standards. They are very vertically integrated. And so to flex one\u2019s capacity in this market as we have done is really an extraordinary and one that is not lost on our customers in terms of our ability to really do what it takes and our willingness to invest when need be and to flex whenever possible to satisfy this really kind of existential demand that we are seeing in many cases. As I look forward in the defense market, I think, for better or for worse, I think, we are in an era today of more anxiety, more dynamics where more and more the nations that are allied with our country, with the Europeans and others are having to invest more significantly than ever before in next-generation defense technologies. And is the broadest manufacturer of those products, both having the broadest product line in the deepest technologies, we are ready and able to support that as much as possible. We will see, I mean, we are guiding here in the third quarter to a kind of similar levels in what is traditionally a softer third quarter from a seasonality perspective and our team stands ready to react whenever needed. And every day we watch the pictures coming from Ukraine and while we have a tear in one eye, we also have a pride in our belly of the part that we are doing to help those people stay free. Thanks very much, Steve. Look, I think, we talked a little bit about factory automation as one area that I highlighted that we did see on a year-over-year basis, some downturn and also on the sequential basis. And I think it\u2019s been broadly reported that there\u2019s some moderation in demand around that area. How long that\u2019s going to last? It\u2019s really hard, Steve, for me to give a prognosis on. I think that we have a very strong position here. I think that the adoption of electronics in factories. The underlying trend of that, I think, is a very positive trend in the short-, medium- and in particular, the long-term. As countries and companies around the world deal with labor shortages, and I mean, gosh, you can\u2019t pick up a newspaper these days without seeing something about some either labor shortage or labor strike that is happening in the world over, there\u2019s no doubt that the adoption of electronic be it automation, robotics, next-generation factory management systems, I mean, these are really accelerating broadly. And the fact that we go through right now, let\u2019s call it, a kind of temporary pause in that for a variety of reasons, it does not take away from the very long-term prognosis for factory automation, which I think is quite a positive over the long-term. Yeah. Thanks so much, Chris. I mean, look, these are really hard products to make, let\u2019s start from that. To have a high speed interconnect product, be it a cable assembly, an IO connector, a backplane connector, a cable backplane system, whatever it may be, these are extraordinarily complicated products to make where the underlying technology to make them take years to develop, the manufacturing processes are extremely challenging to make these things. And so you are correct, there is a very small universe of companies and we have strong competitors, there\u2019s no doubt about it, who we respect, no question. But it is a relatively confined universe of companies who ultimately have put in the decades. And I call it really decades of investments in the engineering competency, the test and the validation of those products and all of those things, which ultimately allow one to make a reliable product that can support these next-generation complicated AI learning systems. Our position, look, we are the world leader in high speed interconnect technology. That\u2019s something that we are very proud of and that we continue to be very carefully building upon over the years and that position, I think, is a robust one for as AI investments continue. Yeah. Thanks very much, Joe. Look, I think, if you look over a very long time period, the mix of our auto business has changed quite dramatically. I remember, gosh, when I first became CEO and that\u2019s 15 years ago, not to mention when I which was 25 years ago yesterday, our auto business was a predominantly European business. And even in my first quarter as CEO, I think, it was roughly two-thirds was European and the rest was sort of split evenly between Asia and North America and today I would tell you that the three regions are relatively balanced with maybe a touch more in Asia, followed by Europe and North America. So that has changed a lot. And I think part of that change has been really this revolution electrification where our team has done a fabulous job in taking advantage of that revolution electrification and where the largest markets for that, at least so far, have been in Asia and we have done an excellent job of positioning ourselves on a broad basis with companies who are really driving electrified and hybrid electrified vehicles. And so if I look at last quarter, we grew organically really in all three regions. I would say Europe actually grew the strongest last quarter, but we did realize growth in all three regions and I think we have a very robust position across all regions for the automotive market. And to the extent that those dynamics change, there\u2019s new companies, accelerating their performance in other regions, I am confident that our team is going to do a good job of positioning ourselves there to benefit from that. Yeah. Thanks very much, Will. Look, I think, I mentioned in my prepared remarks that, while we do see a temporary pause. I mean, we have had really strong growth in broadband over the last year. I mean, last year alone, we grew by 62% in U.S. dollars and 38% organically, and yes, I mean, in the second quarter, we were flat and we guided it to be a little bit down sequentially in the third quarter. But no doubt about it, we are benefiting not just from the demand for customers around the world for higher speed connectivity to their homes and businesses, but also from the government funding that is going into this. And in particular, you mentioned RDOF, there\u2019s also BID [ph]. Both of these initiatives in North America are very significant, and by the way, long overdue from my perspective. I mean we live in a world where connectivity to the Internet becomes not just a nice thing to have, but it is really -- it is a kind of thing that you must have, it\u2019s like electricity and access to water and indoor plumbing, having the plumbing to the Internet is critical. You try to look for a job if you don\u2019t have the Internet. Try to apply for a government benefit if you don\u2019t have access to the Internet. It\u2019s essentially impossible these days. And so I think it\u2019s a really noble cause that is there to build access some of the remotest areas of our country, so that all people can have equal access to high speed, low latency Internet and all what comes along with that. And we are very happy to play our part in that, and to benefit from that over the long-term and this temporary pause that is going on right now, I think, is just that. And we look forward over -- in the coming years as that money does necessarily get spent by governments, as well as by the private sector that will be a strong participant and enabler of the broadband revolution. Well, thank you all so much for your time today. We appreciate everybody\u2019s time on this hot summer day and I hope it\u2019s not too late to wish all of you a nice summer. And I hope that you will have a little bit of chance to get some downtime as we get into the end of July and August, and we look forward to speaking to all of you in the fall in just 90 days. Thanks so much."

        "content": "Operator: Hello, and welcome to the First Quarter Earnings Conference Call for Amphenol Corporation. Following today's presentation, there will be a formal question-and-answer session. Until then all lines will remain in a listen-only mode. At the request of the company, today's conference is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to turn \u2013 introduce today's conference host, Mr. Craig Lampo. Sir, you may begin.\nCraig Lampo: Thank you very much. Good afternoon, everyone. This is Craig Lampo, Amphenol's CFO; and I'm here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO. We would like to welcome you to our first quarter 2023 conference call. Our first quarter 2023 results were released this morning. I will provide some financial commentary, and then Adam will give an overview of the business and current trends, and then we will take questions. As a reminder, during the call, we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures and make certain forward-looking statements. So please refer to the relevant disclosures in our press release for further information. The company closed the first quarter with sales of $2.974 billion and GAAP and adjusted diluted EPS of $0.71 and $0.69, respectively. First quarter sales were up 1% in U.S. dollars and organically and up 3% in local currencies compared to the first quarter of 2022. Sequentially, sales were down by 8% in U.S. dollars, 9% in local currencies and 10% organically. Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes. Orders in the quarter were $2.896 billion, which was down 16% compared to the first quarter of 2022 and flat sequentially, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 0.97 to 1. The lower book-to-bill was driven by lower bookings in the communications related markets, which continue to experience a decline in demand. GAAP and adjusted operating income were $592 million and $597 million, respectively, in the first quarter of 2023. GAAP and adjusted operating margins were 19.9% and 20.1%, respectively, in the first quarter. On a GAAP basis, operating margin decreased by 10 basis points compared to the first quarter of 2022 and decreased by 70 basis points sequentially, and GAAP operating margins for the first quarter included $5 billion of acquisition-related costs. On an adjusted basis, operating margin increased 10 basis points compared to the first quarter of 2022 and decreased by 80 basis points sequentially. The year-over-year increase in adjusted operating margin was driven by strong operating leverage on the modestly higher sales volumes. And on a sequential basis, the decrease in adjusted operating margin reflected normal downside conversion on the lower sales levels. Our team continues to execute strongly in the quarter, and we are proud to have sustained these strong levels of profitability despite the continued range of challenges around the world, including the moderating conditions in several of our communications-related markets. In particular, we truly appreciate the quick reactivity of our teams working in the communications markets, who took appropriate actions to preserve strong profitability in the face of downturns in customer demand. Breaking down first quarter results by segment. In the Harsh Environment Solutions segment, sales were $854 million in the first quarter, which was an increase of 17% in U.S. dollars and 15% organically versus prior year. Segment operating margin was 26.5%. In the Communications Solutions segment, sales were $1.127 billion in the quarter, which was a decrease of 15% in U.S. dollars and 13% organically versus the prior year. Segment operating margin was 20.5%. In the Interconnect and Sensor Systems segment, sales were $993 million in the first quarter, which was an increase of 10% in U.S. dollars inorganically versus the prior year. Segment operating margin was 18%. The company's GAAP effective tax rate for the first quarter was 20.9%, and the adjusted effective tax rate was 24.0%, which compared to 23.8% and 24.5% in the first quarter of 2022, respectively. GAAP diluted EPS increased 4% to $0.71 compared to $0.68 in the prior year period, and adjusted diluted EPS increased 3% to $0.69 compared to $0.67 in the first quarter of 2022. Operating cash flow in the first quarter was $532 million or 125% of adjusted net income. And net of capital spending, our free cash flow was $436 million or 102% of adjusted net income. We are pleased to continue to deliver a strong cash flow yield. From a working capital standpoint, inventory days, days sales outstanding and payable days were 93, 72 and 52 days, respectively. The higher inventory days were primarily driven by the lower sales level in the first quarter together with some continued impacts from the supply chain disruptions that our industry experienced over the past year. Our management team is focused on bringing the inventory days back down to a more normal range over the coming quarters. During the quarter, the company repurchased 2.1 million shares of common stock at an average price of approximately $79. And when combined with our normal quarterly dividend, total capital returned to shareholders in the first quarter of 2023 was more than $290 million. Total debt at March 31 was $4.6 billion, and net debt was $3.1 billion. Total liquidity at the end of the quarter was $4.5 billion, which includes cash and short-term investments on hand of $1.5 billion, plus availability under our existing credit facilities. First quarter EBITDA was $708 million. And at the end of the first quarter of 2023, our net leverage ratio was 1.0 times. We are very pleased that the company's financial condition remains extremely strong by any measure. I will now turn the call over to Adam, who will provide some commentary on current market trends.\nAdam Norwitt: Well, Craig, thank you very much, and allow me to extend my welcome to all of you on the phone here today. And I hope you all are all enjoying a lovely spring so far. As Craig mentioned, I'm going to highlight some of our achievements here in the first quarter. I'll then discuss our trends and progress across our served markets, and then make some comments on our outlook for the second quarter. And then, of course, we'll have time for some questions at the end. With respect to the first quarter, our results were stronger than expected, exceeding the high end of guidance in sales and adjusted diluted earnings per share. Our sales grew from prior year by 1% in U.S. dollars and 3% in local currency, reaching $2.974 billion. On an organic basis, our sales increased by 1%, with growth in commercial air, broadband, military, automotive and industrial markets, largely offset by declines in the IT datacom, mobile networks and mobile devices markets. The company booked just under $2.9 billion in orders in the quarter, representing a book-to-bill of 0.97:1. Our operating margins, adjusted operating margins in the quarter reached 20.1%, and that was a 10 basis point increase from last year's levels. As Craig just mentioned, we achieved a still very robust level of profitability despite the ongoing cost challenges around the world, as well as declining volumes in many of our communications markets, and this is just an excellent reflection of the strength of our company's execution in these very dynamic times. Adjusted diluted EPS grew 3% from prior year to $0.69, and we generated strong operating cash flow of $532 million and $436 million, respectively, in the quarter, all clear demonstrations of the high quality of Amphenol's earnings. I'm just extremely proud of our global team of Amphenolians around the world. The company's results this quarter once again reflects the discipline and agility of our uniquely entrepreneurial organization as we continue to perform well in a very dynamic and challenging environment. Now turning to our progress across our various served markets, I would just comment that we remain very pleased that our end market exposure is still highly diversified, balanced and broad. This diversification continues to create great value for Amphenol because it enables us to participate across all areas of the worldwide electronics industry, while not being disproportionately exposed to the risk associated with any given market or application. So with that said, the military market represented 11% of our sales in the quarter. And sales in this market grew from prior year by a strong 15% in U.S. dollars and 16% organically. And this was really driven by broad-based growth across most segments within the defense market. Sequentially, our sales increased by 2%, which was in line with our expectations coming into the first quarter. And as we look into the second quarter, we expect sales to increase modestly from these first quarter levels. We remain very encouraged by the strength of the company's position in the defense market, where we continue to offer the industry's broadest range of high-technology interconnect products. As the geopolitical environment has become certainly more dynamic, nations around the world are expanding their investments in next-generation defense technologies, thereby increasing the long-term demand potential. We look forward to supporting this increased demand with our wide array of interconnect and sensor products, together with our expanded capacity, resulting from the investments that we've made in recent years. The commercial aerospace market represented 4% of our sales in the quarter, and sales increased by a strong 42% from prior year and 44% organically as we benefited from the continued recovery in global aircraft production. And while aircraft production may not yet be back to the levels that it was before the pandemic, we are very pleased that after several very challenging years in this market, our team has driven our sales essentially back to pre-crisis levels, a really great achievement. Sequentially, our sales grew by a much better-than-expected 15% from the fourth quarter. And as we look into the second quarter, we expect sales to remain at these first quarter levels. I'm just so grateful to our team who works in the commercial air market. With the ongoing recovery in travel and thus demand for jetliners, our efforts to strengthen our breadth of high-technology interconnect products, while diversifying our market position into next-generation aircraft, are paying real dividends. And we look forward to realizing the benefits of these initiatives here in 2023 and beyond. The industrial market represented 28% of our sales in the quarter. And our sales in this market grew from prior year by 11% in U.S. dollars, 14% in local currency and 5% organically. This growth was driven, in particular, by sales into traditional and alternative energy generation, heavy equipment, rail mass transit, factory automation and medical applications, together with contributions from our acquisition program. On a sequential basis, sales were up 2% from the fourth quarter, which was a bit better than our expectations. And as we look into the second quarter, we expect sales in the industrial market to remain at similar levels as we saw here in the first quarter. Our outstanding global team working across the industrial market, continues to find new opportunities for growth across the many distinct segments of this exciting and truly diverse market. I remain confident that our long-term strategy to expand our high technology interconnect antenna and sensor offering both organically and through complimentary acquisitions has positioned us to capitalize on the many revolutions that are happening around the industrial electronics market. We look forward to realizing the benefits of this strategy for many years to come, the automotive market represented 22% of our sales in the quarter, and sales in the first quarter grew 9% in U.S. dollars and 14% organically with our growth supported once again by strength of our sales into electrified vehicle applications, together with other products sold into a wide array of new electronic systems in cars. While sales in Asia were slightly down from prior year, we realized strong growth in North America and Europe in the automotive market. Sequentially, our sales declined by 5% from the fourth quarter, which was a bit better than our expectations coming into the quarter, and that just reflected strong execution by our team in reacting to opportunities with customer demand. For the second quarter, we expect a modest sequential increase in sales from these levels. And I just have to say that I remain truly impressed by our team working in the automotive market. They continue to grow our global position by remaining focused on driving new design wins with customers who are implementing a wide array of new technologies into their vehicles. In particular, our long-term efforts at expanding our now comprehensive range of next generation interconnect products that are incorporated into electrified vehicles has enabled us to expand our position with a wide range of customers, all of whom are pursuing carbon neutral driving solutions and that creates further potential for the business. The mobile devices market represented 9% of our sales in the quarter, and sales declined by 15% from prior year as growth in smartphones was more than offset by declining sales into laptops, tablets, and wearables. Sequentially, our sales declined by a slightly better than expected 31% from the fourth quarter. And as we look into the second quarter, we do expect a further mid-teen sales decline from these first quarter levels. There's no question that the mobile devices market remains one of our most volatile. Nevertheless, our outstanding and agile team has adjusted their resources in real-time with the changing levels of demand and stands poised as always to capture any opportunities for incremental sales that may arise in 2023 and beyond. Our leading array of antennas, interconnect products and precision mechanisms continues to enable a broad range of next-generation mobile devices, which positions us well for the long-term. The mobile networks market represented 4% of our sales in the quarter. Sales declined from prior year by 19% in U.S. dollars and 17% organically as operators and equipment manufacturers reduced their demand after several quarters of stronger consumption. Sequentially, our sales in the first quarter were down by 11% from the fourth quarter, which was a bit more than we had expected coming into the quarter. And now as we look into the second quarter, we do expect a further low double-digit sequential decline in sales as operators further moderate their spending. Our team continues to work aggressively to realize the benefits of our efforts to expand our position in next-generation 5G equipment, as well as the networks being constructed around the world. And while there is currently seemingly a pause in the investment cycle when customers once again drive renewed construction of these advanced systems, we look forward to benefiting from the increased potential that comes from our unique position with both equipment manufacturers and mobile service providers. The information technology and data communications market represented 17% of sales in the quarter, and sales did decline by 21% in U.S. dollars and organically as both service providers and equipment manufacturers moderated their demand in light of still significant levels of inventory across the market. On a sequential basis, sales declined 17% from the fourth quarter, which was a touch better than our expectation of 20% down coming into the quarter. And as we look towards the second quarter, we expect sales to remain roughly at these first quarter levels. Regardless of this current correction in demand largely due to inventory, we remain encouraged by the company's outstanding position in the global IT datacom market. Our team's just done an outstanding job developing leading high speed, power and fiber optic interconnect products that are enabling our OEM and web service provider customers to continue to drive their equipment and networks to higher levels of performance. With exciting new applications, including in particular alternative intelligence or AI, together with the continued growth in overall data traffic, we're confident that we'll be able to realize the benefits of our leading position in this important market for many years to come. And finally, the broadband communications market represented 5% of our sales in the quarter. Sales grew by a very strong 17% from prior year and 18% organically as we experienced a significant increase in demand from cable operators for a wide range of our products. This growth was driven by increased network build-outs as well as our customers preparing for new government supported spending on expanded broadband coverage, particularly here in North America. On a sequential basis, sales declined by 15%, slightly worse than our expectations coming into the quarter. As we look into the second quarter, we anticipate a mid-single digit sequential moderation of sales from these first quarter levels as broadband operators temper their procurement levels. Nevertheless, we remain encouraged by the company\u2019s strong and expanded position in the broadband market and we look forward to continuing to support our service provider customers around the world, all of whom are working to increase their network coverage and bandwidth to support the proliferation of high speed data applications to homes and businesses. Now turning to our outlook. The current economic environment remains for sure dynamic and highly uncertain. In addition, we do expect reduce demand to continue in the second quarter across the communications related markets. Assuming market conditions do not meaningfully worsen, and also assuming constant exchange rates. For the second quarter, we expect sales in the range of $2.890 billion to $2.950 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share in the range of $0.66 to $0.68. This would represent a year-over-year sales decline of 6% to 8% and adjusted diluted EPS decline of 9% to 12% again compared to the second quarter of prior year. Nevertheless, I remain confident in the ability of our outstanding management team to adapt to the many opportunities and challenges in the current environment and to continue to grow our market position while driving sustainable and strong profitability over the long-term. Finally, I would be remiss if I didn\u2019t take this opportunity to offer my true gratitude to our entire global team around the world for their outstanding efforts here in the first quarter. And operator with that, we\u2019d be very happy to take any questions.\nOperator: Thank you. The question-and-answer period will now begin. Please limit to one question per caller. Our first question comes from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. You may go ahead.\nAmit Daryanani: Yes. Thanks a lot. Good afternoon, everyone. Adam, I hope you could expand a bit more on the communication segment softness that you\u2019re seeing. I think we\u2019ve talked about the IT datacom softness for a few quarters, now it sounds like maybe it\u2019s incrementally there on the mobile network side as well. Would love to get your perspective if you think this is more demand driven or inventory driven issue, and then from your vantage point, what do you think is the duration of this softness of correction as you go forward? Thank you.\nAdam Norwitt: Well, thanks very much, Amit. And for sure, I mean, our team working in the communications market has been wrestling with quite some vacillations in demand. And if you just look back over the prior couple of years, we had just fabulous, fabulous growth in all the communications market, in particular in IT datacom, but we also had strong growth in mobile networks and decent growth in the mobile devices. And I think what we\u2019ve seen as we came into the end of last year and certainly coming into this quarter that in particular in the IT datacom market, there is a significant \u2013 there was a significant degree of overbuying of components. Not because we had disappointed our customers, quite the contrary. We were constantly coming to the rescue of our customers over the course of their boom and demand with the agility that they\u2019ve come to expect from Amphenol. But regardless, they seem to have opened their aperture of procurement across virtually everything that they buy in light of the supply chain crisis. And that included building up inventory of our products certainly, which we saw with hindsight. Relative to the mobile networks market, I\u2019d say this is not as much an inventory issue as it is the dynamics of service provider spending. And I think it\u2019s kind of well reported the ups and downs of the various service providers and their capital plans. And I think what we\u2019ve seen in particular in mobile networks as we\u2019ve seen the early stages of operators building out their 5G networks and we benefited no doubt about it from that build-out with the long-term efforts that we put in to build our position across those next generation systems. And sometimes what you see is initial build-outs and then they digest it and they figure out the economics and then they come once again to build-out a next phase. And I would tell you that in most of the places where we operate places like North America, Europe, and otherwise, these 5G networks are certainly not fully built-out quite the contrary, but they\u2019ve built out the rough framework of them. It allows them to get a certain amount of coverage, start to realize a certain amount of economic return for their investments, and then as typically happens, they would at a certain point start to do further investments to build up more capacity in those networks. And when that happens, we\u2019ll be well equipped to deal with that. I mean, the other communications market mobile devices, this is one that is very volatile. We saw in particular last quarter still really robust strength in smartphones, but that was offset or more than offset by fairly dramatic declines in the overall demand for computing devices like laptops and tablets. And I think that\u2019s also a well reported dynamic with the kind of pull forward of demand of those kind of devices as everybody went to work from home. And if our office is any indication, work from home is a distant memory because as Craig and I come into the office, the parking lot is full, the cubicles and the offices are quite full here. And so I think that mad rush to equip people for working from home with those various devices, has a little bit change the cycle of replacement of them and maybe bunched a bit more into the prior two years. And then last I\u2019ll talk about is broadband, which is our kind of fourth of the communications markets. We had just outstanding performance in broadband last year and that continued here into the first quarter. And that was really supporting our customers with a really broad array of products. We\u2019ve dramatically expanded the range of products that we sell into the broadband market. And that resulted in us taking significant position with our customers. I mean, we grew, as you\u2019ll recall, very well last year by 38% organically in 62% in U.S. dollars with the variety of acquisitions that we\u2019ve made in recent times and still robust double-digit organic growth here in the first quarter. And I think now we see a little bit of digestion of those customers as we look into the second quarter. But no doubt about it, the position that we\u2019ve built over the last couple of years in broadband is something that we think long-term is going to create great value for the company.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. You may go ahead.\nWamsi Mohan: Yes, thank you. Adam, curious as to why you think this weakness is contained within communications. I mean, you are so diversified even within communications, radio, consumer exposure and mobile. You have enterprise and cloud exposure and IT datacom, carrier exposure and mobile networks. Given that, like why is this \u2013 it sounds like it\u2019s a very broad macro kind of slowdown. Is this just more early cycle given some of the inventory things that you noted and we should expect some moderation even in industrial and auto and other areas as we go through the course of the year. Is that the right way to think about it? And if I could, would love to get your perspective on trends in China as well I\u2019m not sure if you had a chance to get over there, but you typically do. And now that it\u2019s opened up if you have or even if you\u2019re not, it would be great to get some perspective on what you\u2019re seeing on the ground in China. Thank you.\nAdam Norwitt: Yes. Thanks very much, Wamsi. Look, I don\u2019t think that the communications markets and the dynamics that I just discussed, which are quite unique in each of them. We\u2019re talking about one dynamic in IT datacom and different in mobile networks, a different again in devices, and yet again in broadband. I wouldn\u2019t say that that is an indicative or leading indicator for a broad economic situation. Quite contrary, we\u2019ve given guidance for next quarter for all of our markets. And I don\u2019t think that that guidance reflects a kind of a broad economic slowdown, quite the contrary. Relative to China, I mean, I\u2019m glad you asked the question. It was just early last month when China changed its visa policies and as soon as the news came out that visas were reenacted literally that day we booked our flights and Craig and I were in China at the very first day of April, and what a pleasure it was. I can\u2019t tell you to be three years away from our team in China who just did such a phenomenal, phenomenal job over these three very challenging years. In particular, over last year, which was particularly challenging in certain places, including in Shanghai. I tell you, I had the opportunity to meet some of our factory workers who went into a bubble in Shanghai for more than six weeks in one case. And just to be able to see them and to be honest, to like hug them and thank them for all what they did on behalf of the company during that time period was just a tremendous, tremendous satisfaction for me. Not to mention Craig and I, somehow we didn\u2019t gain weight with all the food that we ate over that week of visiting 21 of our operations in China. But the trends in China, I tell you being there on the ground, this does not seem like a place that is going into deep recessions. Infrastructure investments continue apace. You see new rails for high speed trains next to virtually every highway you go on. And what I was most impressed by was our own operations and what they have done during this time period when nobody was visiting them. And it\u2019s a credit to how we are organized as a company that we don\u2019t have just subsidiary factories that are relying on a whole infrastructure outside of China to function, but rather we have standalone entrepreneurial organizations like we do around the world run by general managers and their teams and what amazing work they did over this time, driving growth in technology, developing new products for the China market, not relying on Western countries or engineers who may be subject to government restrictions that can be applied from anywhere that you think of, but rather developing native capabilities inside of Amphenol. Also, many of our Chinese operations had during that time for a variety of reasons, the incentive to set up operations outside of China, and doing that while still not being able to travel, going to a place like Vietnam or to India or to Thailand or even Mexico and setting up satellite factories on behalf of their customers who wanted to have China Plus One or something like that. It was just really exceptional to see that. And another reminder of what really makes this company special. Are there trends in China? Are there macro issues, long-term things like population growth or lack thereof? Sure. Are there geopolitics that are sitting kind of at the highest levels between Beijing and Washington? Sure they are. But I can tell you, when you go on the ground, you meet with the people there, you get really encouraged as I do everywhere that I go around Amphenol, from the U.S. to Mexico to India, to Western Europe, and now finally being able to go back to China, and I look forward to going back again soon.\nOperator: Our next question is from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. You may go ahead.\nSamik Chatterjee: Hi thanks for taking my question. Adam, just wanted to see if I can get some of your thoughts about how you\u2019re thinking sort of for the second half of the year with the guidance that you have for 2Q, the first half, you\u2019re going to be down a bit year-over-year. But the orders have now stabilized. Is that giving you a bit more visibility into the opportunities for growth or the opportunity for the aggregate company to grow in the second half or maybe even for the full year, any thoughts there? Thank you.\nAdam Norwitt: Yes. Thank you very much, Samik. Look, I mean, we\u2019re not giving full year guidance because it does remain a very volatile environment. And so as much as I would love to sort of get out ahead of my skis and tell you that the second half is going to give growth or not give growth, I\u2019m going to refrain from doing that here today. But I can tell you this that the company remains strong. The base of our strength with customers, the financial condition of the company, I mean just look at the margins that we were able to secure in the first quarter despite real volatility that we saw in our communications market. And Craig mentioned that very specifically. I mean it\u2019s just another testament to the underlying strength of the company. So to the extent that in the second half, customers want more product from us, for sure, we\u2019re going to support them with that. But I think today, sitting here just on the 26th of April, it\u2019s premature given how dynamic it is for me to give a sense of what Q3 and Q4 and, ultimately, the full year is going to bring. You can bet our team has high aspirations, but we\u2019re also realistic to the environment that\u2019s in front of us, and we\u2019re going to manage through whatever comes our way.\nOperator: And our next question is from Steven Fox with Fox Advisors. You may go ahead.\nSteven Fox: Hi good afternoon. Adam, I was just looking back at your earnings track record for the long period of time. If I take out the COVID period, the early COVID period, you\u2019re experiencing a down year of earnings for the first time since 2009. And I was just curious what you think about this cycle relative to prior cycles where your earnings are down, and what steps you\u2019re going to take to maybe sort of mute that earnings decline in coming quarters? Thank you.\nAdam Norwitt: Yes. Well, thanks so much, Steve. I mean, look, we\u2019ll see how the year goes. As I just said to Samik, I have no idea, and certainly, I\u2019m not going to talk about what the full year earnings will be. But what I did say just now, I think really resonates when you bring up 2009. Because -- whether it was 2009 or even 2001, and you\u2019re probably one of the few people on the call who\u2019s been closely associated and following us since that time, and I certainly have been in the company for that time or longer, the way that Amphenolians manage through dynamics is to just face it up. We don\u2019t kind of punt it. We don\u2019t say, \"Well, the good times are going to come,\" or, \"let\u2019s wait another quarter, let\u2019s wait a third quarter and then we have to play catch-up and get behind kind of the curve of the cost.\" Rather, we see what orders we have, we see what our customers want. And if we have too few or too many resources, we make adjustments rapidly. And that gets reflected then in the profitability of the company. And as you know very well, what distinguished our company, whether it was in 2009, 2001 or in that sort of COVID environment of early in 2020 was from peak to trough, our margins declined just 300 basis points during very, very significant downturns in demand. Now we are certainly not with our guidance in the second quarter, guiding to such kind of cataclysm as we all saw in 2009. But at the same time, it\u2019s a dynamic world. And so our playbook hasn\u2019t changed whatsoever. Even if the size of the company is significantly bigger than it was in 2009 and categorically bigger than it was in 2001, our sort of modus operandi is the same that culture of entrepreneurship, which is, today, represented across 130 general managers, and maybe in 2009, it was like 50 and in 2001, it was like 20, it\u2019s still the same way to deal with it. These GMs are out with customers every day. They\u2019re listening to them. They\u2019re immediately coming back, reacting in real time to adjust resources accordingly. And then once -- if you have less orders, less demand, you take out cost, but then you go out and you take market share. And that\u2019s the approach of Amphenol. It has been my entire 25 years in this company, and it will be for as long as I can secure that. So who knows what it\u2019s going to be this year. We certainly don\u2019t aspire to have a reduction in our EPS. But if demand is softer than it was last year, we\u2019ll manage through it.\nCraig Lampo: Hey, Steve, this is Craig. And I think I just would add just one thing to that. I think that if you look in the first quarter results, and we\u2019ve said this a couple times. But if you look at the first quarter results and you take into account that we have three or four markets that are reducing sequentially by double digits. You really just see that resiliency from a margin perspective and the ability for the company to kind of react to those kind of reductions. I mean, the mobile devices market is certainly normally used to having kind of reductions like that. But places like IT, data, mobile networks, broadband, these are not markets that typically have that type of volatility from a quarter-to-quarter basis. And I think that you really as that kind of shows through just in the results for the first quarter. And as Adam said, I don\u2019t think that would be any different in the future. But the bottom line is we\u2019re driving for continued growth and we will react to demand reductions where that may be.\nOperator: Our next question is from Luke Junk with Baird. You may go ahead.\nLuke Junk: Yes. Thank you for taking the question. Adam, hoping you could just comment on the focus areas specifically for the IT datacom group right now, as the market goes through this consolidation period, is the fact that you\u2019re able to catch your breath after what you already referenced today as a very busy multi-year period. In some respects, is that actually a positive relative to the longer-term positioning of the business? I guess, if I look at the margin side, 27% decremental margins for communication solutions could have been worse. And then on the demand side, looks like there\u2019s some interesting AI related opportunities that are emerging on the horizon. If you could speak to both those things? Thank you.\nAdam Norwitt: Luke, well, thank you very much. I\u2019m glad you emphasize this. I mean, this 27% downside conversion margin for an organization that is already making pretty robust margins is really phenomenal. And by any measure, it\u2019s a reflection of that quick reactivity that I was discussing earlier. Luke, I would be lying if I told you our folks working in that market are happy to have a little bit of a downturn to kind of to use your phrase, catch their breath. Nobody likes dealing with this. But we do it. It is what it is. Like it\u2019s \u2013 we don\u2019t sort of punt reality. It just is what it is. At the same time though, what\u2019s interesting is while we\u2019re making sure that the financial strength of the company is stays as robust as it did, and again, the 27% convergent margin that you mentioned is a great indicator of that. We are working on an extraordinary array of next generation technologies. Just because customers have some extra inventory doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t have an enormous amount of next generation things that they\u2019re trying to achieve. And you mentioned, and I think I alluded to, AI as one of those, I mean, these are the kind of revolutions that drive kind of quantum leaps in the demands of our customers for processor power, for speed as it relates to data transmission and networking, all of which creates demands on the equipment for next generation high speed interconnect for the fiber optics and for the high efficiency power interconnect that\u2019s so important to sustaining the operating expenses and let alone the carbon footprint of these massive processors that are going into these enormous data centers. And so we haven\u2019t slowed down at all as it relates to developing and designing next generation products together with our customers. And you could actually argue that in certain cases we\u2019ve had to accelerate those efforts as customers have gotten into competitive situations with others on things like AI, machine learning and alike. And that\u2019s the kind of carrying water on both shoulders that is an Amphenol in trait as well. It\u2019s not something necessarily. I emphasize so much. But we talk a lot in the company about driving with one foot on the gas, one on the brake, carrying water on both shoulders. Sometimes you got to go out and cut costs at the very same time as you\u2019re ramping up engineering support for next generation systems. And being able to do that, having the mindset and the agility to do that is I think a very unique trait that is resident inside our organization. And that includes within all of those working across IT datacom.\nOperator: And our next question is from Chris Snyder with UBS. You may go ahead.\nChris Snyder: Thank you. I wanted to ask on IT datacom, obviously that\u2019s been a segment that\u2019s been I guess the most impacted so far by inventory digestion. I think in Q1 you guys said it was down about 17% sequentially. And if I heard it right, it sounds like the subsegment is going to be actually be flat sequentially in Q2. And I know there\u2019s seasonality involved, but does that indicate that subsegment is moving past maybe the bulk of some of the inventory, digestion headwinds that have impacted the segment over the last three, four quarters now? Thank you.\nAdam Norwitt: Thanks. Thanks, Chris. Look, I\u2019ve talked a lot about IT datacom, but to the specific of your question, I mean, I don\u2019t know what the second half is going to bring. I certainly hope that Q2 and the fact that we see sales to be flat is an indication that we've kind of reached a kind of a little bit more of an equilibrium. 90 days from now, I hope to be able to give you a better sense of that as it relates to the second half. But it's certainly a better indication than if we had seen another leg down on a sequential basis. So we'll see what the second half brings. Again, the fact that it's flat in the second quarter gives me some hope, but 90 days from now we'll try to give you a little more certainty about that.\nOperator: Our next question is from William Stein with Truist Securities. You may go ahead.\nWilliam Stein: Great. Thank you for taking my question. I'd like to just linger on these relatively weaker end markets for a moment, just to get slightly more clarity. And the weakness in comms, in general are you seeing that more pronounced in any particular geography? And within IT datacom specifically, is that more hyperscalers where you're seeing the weakness? Or is it more broad-based across all sizes and shapes of customers? Thanks.\nAdam Norwitt: Thanks very much, Will. I wouldn't point out any significant geographical distinction across the communications markets. I mean remember that a lot of these communications products they do get that \u2013 a lot of them still get made in Asia, especially on the device side and a good portion of the \u2013 at least the OEM products of the IT datacom. So you can imagine that in Asia, that's having a worse situation overall for the company. And sure enough in Asia, our \u2013 we did not have as robust performance in the quarter as we did in North America and Europe overall and that's driven a lot by that. But otherwise, I wouldn't say that there's any sort of end customer geographic changes here. Relative to hyperscale versus the equipment manufacturers, again, I don't think there's a real distinction because ultimately the hyperscale people are also customers for the equipment manufacturers in many cases. And I think that that overall inventory position is fairly broad across both areas of that market.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs. You may go ahead.\nMark Delaney: Yes. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. I was hoping to touch a little bit more on supply chain and what it might mean for your own free cash flow generation. Given demand softer, do you think supply chain stabilizing enough that perhaps you can take inventory down and lead to better free cash flow here?\nCraig Lampo: Yes. Thanks Mark. Yes, I mean, in Q1 we actually had good cash flow, I mean 100% essentially of our yield on for the first quarter, which for the first quarter actually is probably better than average. But given that, I do recognize that our inventory was even a little bit higher than we would typically wanted to see here in the first quarter from a day's perspective. And the team is \u2013 there's many reasons for that. I mean we had certainly a very strong 2022. We had supply chain issues throughout the majority of the year of 2022. And I think that as we came into the first quarter, where days typically get higher. Normally, there certainly is kind of a lag effect or a hangover effect from a supply chain perspective as well. And I do believe that the team certainly will have some impact on that over the coming quarters, and we should see some improvement from a day's perspective on inventory, which just naturally will help from a cash flow. But I think our target cash flow continues to be 100%, or 90% to 100% kind of from a free cash flow perspective. And I think that certainly, that should be achievable here and for the full year, and there may be a quarter or two where we're actually a little higher than that as we kind of bring inventory a bit down.\nOperator: And our last question today comes from Guy Hardwick with Credit Suisse. You may go ahead.\nGuy Hardwick: Hi, good afternoon.\nAdam Norwitt: Hi, Guy.\nGuy Hardwick: Could you expand a little bit on the industrial segment, which is now by far away your largest segment, I think you had 28% of sales. I know factory automation is probably the largest end market within that, but can you give us a little bit more color on trends within industrial, whether it's medical or energy?\nAdam Norwitt: Yes. Well, thanks very much, Guy. I mean the fact is as industrial is at least this quarter our largest segment, it was 28% of our sales. At the same time, industrial is far and away our most diversified market. I mean there's really not a correlation amongst the various segments within Industrial, except that they all represent harsh environments where our customers are trying to push new electronics deeper and deeper into some of the harshest of environments to an offshore wind mill, into a semiconductor factory, into an operating theater, onto a train going 400 kilometers an hour and everything in between. In terms of the segments, I wouldn't say that necessarily factory automation is the largest. It's a significant segment, but we have strong sales in the areas like heavy equipment and medical, instrumentation, which includes things like semiconductor manufacturing into electric vehicles, heavy electric vehicles and battery. All times of \u2013 types of energy generation and that includes both alternative energy, but also traditional energy extraction and generation, rail mass, transit, things like marine and entertainment? I mean, and you can tell these are not markets that correlate with one another. So if we're going to have one of our markets be a little bit bigger than the others, and in this case, still just 28% of sales, this would be the one that you'd want to have that. And we're just really excited by the progress that we've made in our industrial market over a very long time period. If I go back to 20 years ago, I mean this was a relatively small business that we didn't really have a close touch with where it went. It all went through distribution. And we had just fabulous leadership in our industrial business over that time who really drove a very much an application and segment-based approach to developing new products, application-specific, technology-specific products. At the same time, as we made a number of great acquisitions over many years, and we continue to make great acquisitions across the industrial market that have ultimately positioned us for this just multitude of revolutions going on as electronics gets pushed deeper and deeper into harsher and harsher environments. And so it's not just one or another piece of that, and we're just really excited about the ongoing strength of our industrial market, which has just been a fabulous asset for the company for many years, and I believe will remain so for many years to come.\nOperator: We do have one additional question from Michael Anastasiou with TD Cowen. You may go ahead. \nMichael Anastasiou: Good afternoon guys. Thanks for taking my question. Looking at the capital deployment side, you had a couple deals announced at the beginning of the year. Can you just describe how CRM and RFS into the overall strategy? And on the broader front, what end markets or adjacencies, do you see the most opportunity inorganically for the year? Thank you. \nAdam Norwitt: Thank you very much, Michael. Well, CMR, as we announced, we closed earlier in the year, and that's a fabulous company making harsh environment, value-add interconnect products that go into the industrial market, in particular, in heavy equipment. RFS, we announced that we signed the acquisition, but we have not yet closed it. We \u2013 as we said last quarter, we expect to close by the end of the second quarter, and we don't change what we say about that. And RFS really expands our position in the mobile networks market with really high-technology antennas and fiber optic solutions that go into next-generation mobile networks. And we're, again, very excited about that company, and our team continues to work closely with the RFS team as we get closer to bring them into the Amphenol family. In terms of our pipeline of acquisitions and where we see the future, we don't pick and choose our markets and say, well, that's the market where we want to make acquisitions or, that's the market where we don't want to make acquisitions. And the reason for that is when we make an acquisition, we're getting married forever. We're not a trader where we buy companies and sell them and buy and sell and kind of do this portfolio management. We look for companies with great people, with outstanding enabling technologies and robust and complementary market positions across all of our end markets. And in our experience, which stretches over, in my career, more than 75 acquisitions, and I think more than 50 since I've been CEO in these 15 years nearly, that \u2013 having that very simple approach leads to really outstanding long-term success and a great return on our capital that we deploy towards the M&A program. Our acquisition pipeline remains very robust today. I remain wholly incapable of predicting when we will close and if we will close certain deals. But I know that long-term, the program is going to continue to support really great growth for the company and a great use of the capital and the cash that we generate so much of. And so we look very much forward to continuing our M&A program, and it really complements the culture of the company as well because every time we bring in one of these new entrepreneurs, it actually strengthens the entrepreneurial culture of Amphenol. And that's something that I look very much forward to as well.\nCraig Lampo: And Michael, just to clarify, just to avoid any confusion, RFS, since we have not closed on it yet, is not included in our guidance and it wouldn't be included in guidance until we close.\nAdam Norwitt: Well, very good. I think we have no further questions, operator. And so if that's the case, I would like to take this opportunity to wish all of you a wonderful continuation of your spring and we look forward to talking to you all just 90 days from now. Thank you so much, and best wishes to you all.\nCraig Lampo: Thanks, everybody.\nOperator: And thank you for attending today's conference, and have a great day.",

            "content": "Thank you very much. Good afternoon, everyone. This is Craig Lampo, Amphenol's CFO; and I'm here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO. We would like to welcome you to our first quarter 2023 conference call. Our first quarter 2023 results were released this morning. I will provide some financial commentary, and then Adam will give an overview of the business and current trends, and then we will take questions. As a reminder, during the call, we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures and make certain forward-looking statements. So please refer to the relevant disclosures in our press release for further information. The company closed the first quarter with sales of $2.974 billion and GAAP and adjusted diluted EPS of $0.71 and $0.69, respectively. First quarter sales were up 1% in U.S. dollars and organically and up 3% in local currencies compared to the first quarter of 2022. Sequentially, sales were down by 8% in U.S. dollars, 9% in local currencies and 10% organically. Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes. Orders in the quarter were $2.896 billion, which was down 16% compared to the first quarter of 2022 and flat sequentially, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 0.97 to 1. The lower book-to-bill was driven by lower bookings in the communications related markets, which continue to experience a decline in demand. GAAP and adjusted operating income were $592 million and $597 million, respectively, in the first quarter of 2023. GAAP and adjusted operating margins were 19.9% and 20.1%, respectively, in the first quarter. On a GAAP basis, operating margin decreased by 10 basis points compared to the first quarter of 2022 and decreased by 70 basis points sequentially, and GAAP operating margins for the first quarter included $5 billion of acquisition-related costs. On an adjusted basis, operating margin increased 10 basis points compared to the first quarter of 2022 and decreased by 80 basis points sequentially. The year-over-year increase in adjusted operating margin was driven by strong operating leverage on the modestly higher sales volumes. And on a sequential basis, the decrease in adjusted operating margin reflected normal downside conversion on the lower sales levels. Our team continues to execute strongly in the quarter, and we are proud to have sustained these strong levels of profitability despite the continued range of challenges around the world, including the moderating conditions in several of our communications-related markets. In particular, we truly appreciate the quick reactivity of our teams working in the communications markets, who took appropriate actions to preserve strong profitability in the face of downturns in customer demand. Breaking down first quarter results by segment. In the Harsh Environment Solutions segment, sales were $854 million in the first quarter, which was an increase of 17% in U.S. dollars and 15% organically versus prior year. Segment operating margin was 26.5%. In the Communications Solutions segment, sales were $1.127 billion in the quarter, which was a decrease of 15% in U.S. dollars and 13% organically versus the prior year. Segment operating margin was 20.5%. In the Interconnect and Sensor Systems segment, sales were $993 million in the first quarter, which was an increase of 10% in U.S. dollars inorganically versus the prior year. Segment operating margin was 18%. The company's GAAP effective tax rate for the first quarter was 20.9%, and the adjusted effective tax rate was 24.0%, which compared to 23.8% and 24.5% in the first quarter of 2022, respectively. GAAP diluted EPS increased 4% to $0.71 compared to $0.68 in the prior year period, and adjusted diluted EPS increased 3% to $0.69 compared to $0.67 in the first quarter of 2022. Operating cash flow in the first quarter was $532 million or 125% of adjusted net income. And net of capital spending, our free cash flow was $436 million or 102% of adjusted net income. We are pleased to continue to deliver a strong cash flow yield. From a working capital standpoint, inventory days, days sales outstanding and payable days were 93, 72 and 52 days, respectively. The higher inventory days were primarily driven by the lower sales level in the first quarter together with some continued impacts from the supply chain disruptions that our industry experienced over the past year. Our management team is focused on bringing the inventory days back down to a more normal range over the coming quarters. During the quarter, the company repurchased 2.1 million shares of common stock at an average price of approximately $79. And when combined with our normal quarterly dividend, total capital returned to shareholders in the first quarter of 2023 was more than $290 million. Total debt at March 31 was $4.6 billion, and net debt was $3.1 billion. Total liquidity at the end of the quarter was $4.5 billion, which includes cash and short-term investments on hand of $1.5 billion, plus availability under our existing credit facilities. First quarter EBITDA was $708 million. And at the end of the first quarter of 2023, our net leverage ratio was 1.0 times. We are very pleased that the company's financial condition remains extremely strong by any measure. I will now turn the call over to Adam, who will provide some commentary on current market trends. Hey, Steve, this is Craig. And I think I just would add just one thing to that. I think that if you look in the first quarter results, and we\u2019ve said this a couple times. But if you look at the first quarter results and you take into account that we have three or four markets that are reducing sequentially by double digits. You really just see that resiliency from a margin perspective and the ability for the company to kind of react to those kind of reductions. I mean, the mobile devices market is certainly normally used to having kind of reductions like that. But places like IT, data, mobile networks, broadband, these are not markets that typically have that type of volatility from a quarter-to-quarter basis. And I think that you really as that kind of shows through just in the results for the first quarter. And as Adam said, I don\u2019t think that would be any different in the future. But the bottom line is we\u2019re driving for continued growth and we will react to demand reductions where that may be. Yes. Thanks Mark. Yes, I mean, in Q1 we actually had good cash flow, I mean 100% essentially of our yield on for the first quarter, which for the first quarter actually is probably better than average. But given that, I do recognize that our inventory was even a little bit higher than we would typically wanted to see here in the first quarter from a day's perspective. And the team is \u2013 there's many reasons for that. I mean we had certainly a very strong 2022. We had supply chain issues throughout the majority of the year of 2022.

And I do believe that the team certainly will have some impact on that over the coming quarters, and we should see some improvement from a day's perspective on inventory, which just naturally will help from a cash flow. But I think our target cash flow continues to be 100%, or 90% to 100% kind of from a free cash flow perspective. And I think that certainly, that should be achievable here and for the full year, and there may be a quarter or two where we're actually a little higher than that as we kind of bring inventory a bit down. And Michael, just to clarify, just to avoid any confusion, RFS, since we have not closed on it yet, is not included in our guidance and it wouldn't be included in guidance until we close. Thanks, everybody."

            "name": "Adam Norwitt",
            "content": "Well, Craig, thank you very much, and allow me to extend my welcome to all of you on the phone here today. And I hope you all are all enjoying a lovely spring so far. As Craig mentioned, I'm going to highlight some of our achievements here in the first quarter. I'll then discuss our trends and progress across our served markets, and then make some comments on our outlook for the second quarter. And then, of course, we'll have time for some questions at the end. With respect to the first quarter, our results were stronger than expected, exceeding the high end of guidance in sales and adjusted diluted earnings per share. Our sales grew from prior year by 1% in U.S. dollars and 3% in local currency, reaching $2.974 billion. On an organic basis, our sales increased by 1%, with growth in commercial air, broadband, military, automotive and industrial markets, largely offset by declines in the IT datacom, mobile networks and mobile devices markets. The company booked just under $2.9 billion in orders in the quarter, representing a book-to-bill of 0.97:1. Our operating margins, adjusted operating margins in the quarter reached 20.1%, and that was a 10 basis point increase from last year's levels. As Craig just mentioned, we achieved a still very robust level of profitability despite the ongoing cost challenges around the world, as well as declining volumes in many of our communications markets, and this is just an excellent reflection of the strength of our company's execution in these very dynamic times. Adjusted diluted EPS grew 3% from prior year to $0.69, and we generated strong operating cash flow of $532 million and $436 million, respectively, in the quarter, all clear demonstrations of the high quality of Amphenol's earnings. I'm just extremely proud of our global team of Amphenolians around the world. The company's results this quarter once again reflects the discipline and agility of our uniquely entrepreneurial organization as we continue to perform well in a very dynamic and challenging environment. Now turning to our progress across our various served markets, I would just comment that we remain very pleased that our end market exposure is still highly diversified, balanced and broad. This diversification continues to create great value for Amphenol because it enables us to participate across all areas of the worldwide electronics industry, while not being disproportionately exposed to the risk associated with any given market or application. So with that said, the military market represented 11% of our sales in the quarter. And sales in this market grew from prior year by a strong 15% in U.S. dollars and 16% organically. And this was really driven by broad-based growth across most segments within the defense market. Sequentially, our sales increased by 2%, which was in line with our expectations coming into the first quarter. And as we look into the second quarter, we expect sales to increase modestly from these first quarter levels. We remain very encouraged by the strength of the company's position in the defense market, where we continue to offer the industry's broadest range of high-technology interconnect products. As the geopolitical environment has become certainly more dynamic, nations around the world are expanding their investments in next-generation defense technologies, thereby increasing the long-term demand potential. We look forward to supporting this increased demand with our wide array of interconnect and sensor products, together with our expanded capacity, resulting from the investments that we've made in recent years. The commercial aerospace market represented 4% of our sales in the quarter, and sales increased by a strong 42% from prior year and 44% organically as we benefited from the continued recovery in global aircraft production. And while aircraft production may not yet be back to the levels that it was before the pandemic, we are very pleased that after several very challenging years in this market, our team has driven our sales essentially back to pre-crisis levels, a really great achievement. Sequentially, our sales grew by a much better-than-expected 15% from the fourth quarter. And as we look into the second quarter, we expect sales to remain at these first quarter levels. I'm just so grateful to our team who works in the commercial air market. With the ongoing recovery in travel and thus demand for jetliners, our efforts to strengthen our breadth of high-technology interconnect products, while diversifying our market position into next-generation aircraft, are paying real dividends. And we look forward to realizing the benefits of these initiatives here in 2023 and beyond. The industrial market represented 28% of our sales in the quarter. And our sales in this market grew from prior year by 11% in U.S. dollars, 14% in local currency and 5% organically. This growth was driven, in particular, by sales into traditional and alternative energy generation, heavy equipment, rail mass transit, factory automation and medical applications, together with contributions from our acquisition program. On a sequential basis, sales were up 2% from the fourth quarter, which was a bit better than our expectations. And as we look into the second quarter, we expect sales in the industrial market to remain at similar levels as we saw here in the first quarter. Our outstanding global team working across the industrial market, continues to find new opportunities for growth across the many distinct segments of this exciting and truly diverse market. I remain confident that our long-term strategy to expand our high technology interconnect antenna and sensor offering both organically and through complimentary acquisitions has positioned us to capitalize on the many revolutions that are happening around the industrial electronics market. We look forward to realizing the benefits of this strategy for many years to come, the automotive market represented 22% of our sales in the quarter, and sales in the first quarter grew 9% in U.S. dollars and 14% organically with our growth supported once again by strength of our sales into electrified vehicle applications, together with other products sold into a wide array of new electronic systems in cars. While sales in Asia were slightly down from prior year, we realized strong growth in North America and Europe in the automotive market. Sequentially, our sales declined by 5% from the fourth quarter, which was a bit better than our expectations coming into the quarter, and that just reflected strong execution by our team in reacting to opportunities with customer demand. For the second quarter, we expect a modest sequential increase in sales from these levels. And I just have to say that I remain truly impressed by our team working in the automotive market. They continue to grow our global position by remaining focused on driving new design wins with customers who are implementing a wide array of new technologies into their vehicles. In particular, our long-term efforts at expanding our now comprehensive range of next generation interconnect products that are incorporated into electrified vehicles has enabled us to expand our position with a wide range of customers, all of whom are pursuing carbon neutral driving solutions and that creates further potential for the business. The mobile devices market represented 9% of our sales in the quarter, and sales declined by 15% from prior year as growth in smartphones was more than offset by declining sales into laptops, tablets, and wearables. Sequentially, our sales declined by a slightly better than expected 31% from the fourth quarter. And as we look into the second quarter, we do expect a further mid-teen sales decline from these first quarter levels. There's no question that the mobile devices market remains one of our most volatile. Nevertheless, our outstanding and agile team has adjusted their resources in real-time with the changing levels of demand and stands poised as always to capture any opportunities for incremental sales that may arise in 2023 and beyond. Our leading array of antennas, interconnect products and precision mechanisms continues to enable a broad range of next-generation mobile devices, which positions us well for the long-term. The mobile networks market represented 4% of our sales in the quarter. Sales declined from prior year by 19% in U.S. dollars and 17% organically as operators and equipment manufacturers reduced their demand after several quarters of stronger consumption. Sequentially, our sales in the first quarter were down by 11% from the fourth quarter, which was a bit more than we had expected coming into the quarter. And now as we look into the second quarter, we do expect a further low double-digit sequential decline in sales as operators further moderate their spending. Our team continues to work aggressively to realize the benefits of our efforts to expand our position in next-generation 5G equipment, as well as the networks being constructed around the world. And while there is currently seemingly a pause in the investment cycle when customers once again drive renewed construction of these advanced systems, we look forward to benefiting from the increased potential that comes from our unique position with both equipment manufacturers and mobile service providers. The information technology and data communications market represented 17% of sales in the quarter, and sales did decline by 21% in U.S. dollars and organically as both service providers and equipment manufacturers moderated their demand in light of still significant levels of inventory across the market. On a sequential basis, sales declined 17% from the fourth quarter, which was a touch better than our expectation of 20% down coming into the quarter. And as we look towards the second quarter, we expect sales to remain roughly at these first quarter levels. Regardless of this current correction in demand largely due to inventory, we remain encouraged by the company's outstanding position in the global IT datacom market. Our team's just done an outstanding job developing leading high speed, power and fiber optic interconnect products that are enabling our OEM and web service provider customers to continue to drive their equipment and networks to higher levels of performance. With exciting new applications, including in particular alternative intelligence or AI, together with the continued growth in overall data traffic, we're confident that we'll be able to realize the benefits of our leading position in this important market for many years to come. And finally, the broadband communications market represented 5% of our sales in the quarter. Sales grew by a very strong 17% from prior year and 18% organically as we experienced a significant increase in demand from cable operators for a wide range of our products. This growth was driven by increased network build-outs as well as our customers preparing for new government supported spending on expanded broadband coverage, particularly here in North America. On a sequential basis, sales declined by 15%, slightly worse than our expectations coming into the quarter. As we look into the second quarter, we anticipate a mid-single digit sequential moderation of sales from these first quarter levels as broadband operators temper their procurement levels. Nevertheless, we remain encouraged by the company\u2019s strong and expanded position in the broadband market and we look forward to continuing to support our service provider customers around the world, all of whom are working to increase their network coverage and bandwidth to support the proliferation of high speed data applications to homes and businesses. Now turning to our outlook. The current economic environment remains for sure dynamic and highly uncertain. In addition, we do expect reduce demand to continue in the second quarter across the communications related markets. Assuming market conditions do not meaningfully worsen, and also assuming constant exchange rates. For the second quarter, we expect sales in the range of $2.890 billion to $2.950 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share in the range of $0.66 to $0.68. This would represent a year-over-year sales decline of 6% to 8% and adjusted diluted EPS decline of 9% to 12% again compared to the second quarter of prior year. Nevertheless, I remain confident in the ability of our outstanding management team to adapt to the many opportunities and challenges in the current environment and to continue to grow our market position while driving sustainable and strong profitability over the long-term. Finally, I would be remiss if I didn\u2019t take this opportunity to offer my true gratitude to our entire global team around the world for their outstanding efforts here in the first quarter. And operator with that, we\u2019d be very happy to take any questions. Well, thanks very much, Amit. And for sure, I mean, our team working in the communications market has been wrestling with quite some vacillations in demand. And if you just look back over the prior couple of years, we had just fabulous, fabulous growth in all the communications market, in particular in IT datacom, but we also had strong growth in mobile networks and decent growth in the mobile devices. And I think what we\u2019ve seen as we came into the end of last year and certainly coming into this quarter that in particular in the IT datacom market, there is a significant \u2013 there was a significant degree of overbuying of components. Not because we had disappointed our customers, quite the contrary. We were constantly coming to the rescue of our customers over the course of their boom and demand with the agility that they\u2019ve come to expect from Amphenol. But regardless, they seem to have opened their aperture of procurement across virtually everything that they buy in light of the supply chain crisis. And that included building up inventory of our products certainly, which we saw with hindsight. Relative to the mobile networks market, I\u2019d say this is not as much an inventory issue as it is the dynamics of service provider spending. And I think it\u2019s kind of well reported the ups and downs of the various service providers and their capital plans. And I think what we\u2019ve seen in particular in mobile networks as we\u2019ve seen the early stages of operators building out their 5G networks and we benefited no doubt about it from that build-out with the long-term efforts that we put in to build our position across those next generation systems. And sometimes what you see is initial build-outs and then they digest it and they figure out the economics and then they come once again to build-out a next phase. And I would tell you that in most of the places where we operate places like North America, Europe, and otherwise, these 5G networks are certainly not fully built-out quite the contrary, but they\u2019ve built out the rough framework of them. It allows them to get a certain amount of coverage, start to realize a certain amount of economic return for their investments, and then as typically happens, they would at a certain point start to do further investments to build up more capacity in those networks. And when that happens, we\u2019ll be well equipped to deal with that. I mean, the other communications market mobile devices, this is one that is very volatile. We saw in particular last quarter still really robust strength in smartphones, but that was offset or more than offset by fairly dramatic declines in the overall demand for computing devices like laptops and tablets. And I think that\u2019s also a well reported dynamic with the kind of pull forward of demand of those kind of devices as everybody went to work from home. And if our office is any indication, work from home is a distant memory because as Craig and I come into the office, the parking lot is full, the cubicles and the offices are quite full here. And so I think that mad rush to equip people for working from home with those various devices, has a little bit change the cycle of replacement of them and maybe bunched a bit more into the prior two years. And then last I\u2019ll talk about is broadband, which is our kind of fourth of the communications markets. We had just outstanding performance in broadband last year and that continued here into the first quarter. And that was really supporting our customers with a really broad array of products. We\u2019ve dramatically expanded the range of products that we sell into the broadband market. And that resulted in us taking significant position with our customers. I mean, we grew, as you\u2019ll recall, very well last year by 38% organically in 62% in U.S. dollars with the variety of acquisitions that we\u2019ve made in recent times and still robust double-digit organic growth here in the first quarter. And I think now we see a little bit of digestion of those customers as we look into the second quarter. But no doubt about it, the position that we\u2019ve built over the last couple of years in broadband is something that we think long-term is going to create great value for the company. Yes. Thanks very much, Wamsi. Look, I don\u2019t think that the communications markets and the dynamics that I just discussed, which are quite unique in each of them. We\u2019re talking about one dynamic in IT datacom and different in mobile networks, a different again in devices, and yet again in broadband. I wouldn\u2019t say that that is an indicative or leading indicator for a broad economic situation. Quite contrary, we\u2019ve given guidance for next quarter for all of our markets. And I don\u2019t think that that guidance reflects a kind of a broad economic slowdown, quite the contrary. Relative to China, I mean, I\u2019m glad you asked the question. It was just early last month when China changed its visa policies and as soon as the news came out that visas were reenacted literally that day we booked our flights and Craig and I were in China at the very first day of April, and what a pleasure it was. I can\u2019t tell you to be three years away from our team in China who just did such a phenomenal, phenomenal job over these three very challenging years. In particular, over last year, which was particularly challenging in certain places, including in Shanghai. I tell you, I had the opportunity to meet some of our factory workers who went into a bubble in Shanghai for more than six weeks in one case. And just to be able to see them and to be honest, to like hug them and thank them for all what they did on behalf of the company during that time period was just a tremendous, tremendous satisfaction for me. Not to mention Craig and I, somehow we didn\u2019t gain weight with all the food that we ate over that week of visiting 21 of our operations in China. But the trends in China, I tell you being there on the ground, this does not seem like a place that is going into deep recessions. Infrastructure investments continue apace. You see new rails for high speed trains next to virtually every highway you go on. And what I was most impressed by was our own operations and what they have done during this time period when nobody was visiting them. And it\u2019s a credit to how we are organized as a company that we don\u2019t have just subsidiary factories that are relying on a whole infrastructure outside of China to function, but rather we have standalone entrepreneurial organizations like we do around the world run by general managers and their teams and what amazing work they did over this time, driving growth in technology, developing new products for the China market, not relying on Western countries or engineers who may be subject to government restrictions that can be applied from anywhere that you think of, but rather developing native capabilities inside of Amphenol. Also, many of our Chinese operations had during that time for a variety of reasons, the incentive to set up operations outside of China, and doing that while still not being able to travel, going to a place like Vietnam or to India or to Thailand or even Mexico and setting up satellite factories on behalf of their customers who wanted to have China Plus One or something like that. It was just really exceptional to see that. And another reminder of what really makes this company special. Are there trends in China? Are there macro issues, long-term things like population growth or lack thereof? Sure. Are there geopolitics that are sitting kind of at the highest levels between Beijing and Washington? Sure they are. But I can tell you, when you go on the ground, you meet with the people there, you get really encouraged as I do everywhere that I go around Amphenol, from the U.S. to Mexico to India, to Western Europe, and now finally being able to go back to China, and I look forward to going back again soon. Yes. Thank you very much, Samik. Look, I mean, we\u2019re not giving full year guidance because it does remain a very volatile environment. And so as much as I would love to sort of get out ahead of my skis and tell you that the second half is going to give growth or not give growth, I\u2019m going to refrain from doing that here today. But I can tell you this that the company remains strong. The base of our strength with customers, the financial condition of the company, I mean just look at the margins that we were able to secure in the first quarter despite real volatility that we saw in our communications market. And Craig mentioned that very specifically. I mean it\u2019s just another testament to the underlying strength of the company. So to the extent that in the second half, customers want more product from us, for sure, we\u2019re going to support them with that. But I think today, sitting here just on the 26th of April, it\u2019s premature given how dynamic it is for me to give a sense of what Q3 and Q4 and, ultimately, the full year is going to bring. You can bet our team has high aspirations, but we\u2019re also realistic to the environment that\u2019s in front of us, and we\u2019re going to manage through whatever comes our way. Yes. Well, thanks so much, Steve. I mean, look, we\u2019ll see how the year goes. As I just said to Samik, I have no idea, and certainly, I\u2019m not going to talk about what the full year earnings will be. But what I did say just now, I think really resonates when you bring up 2009. Because -- whether it was 2009 or even 2001, and you\u2019re probably one of the few people on the call who\u2019s been closely associated and following us since that time, and I certainly have been in the company for that time or longer, the way that Amphenolians manage through dynamics is to just face it up. We don\u2019t kind of punt it. We don\u2019t say, \"Well, the good times are going to come,\" or, \"let\u2019s wait another quarter, let\u2019s wait a third quarter and then we have to play catch-up and get behind kind of the curve of the cost.\" Rather, we see what orders we have, we see what our customers want. And if we have too few or too many resources, we make adjustments rapidly. And that gets reflected then in the profitability of the company. And as you know very well, what distinguished our company, whether it was in 2009, 2001 or in that sort of COVID environment of early in 2020 was from peak to trough, our margins declined just 300 basis points during very, very significant downturns in demand. Now we are certainly not with our guidance in the second quarter, guiding to such kind of cataclysm as we all saw in 2009. But at the same time, it\u2019s a dynamic world. And so our playbook hasn\u2019t changed whatsoever. Even if the size of the company is significantly bigger than it was in 2009 and categorically bigger than it was in 2001, our sort of modus operandi is the same that culture of entrepreneurship, which is, today, represented across 130 general managers, and maybe in 2009, it was like 50 and in 2001, it was like 20, it\u2019s still the same way to deal with it. These GMs are out with customers every day. They\u2019re listening to them. They\u2019re immediately coming back, reacting in real time to adjust resources accordingly. And then once -- if you have less orders, less demand, you take out cost, but then you go out and you take market share. And that\u2019s the approach of Amphenol. It has been my entire 25 years in this company, and it will be for as long as I can secure that. So who knows what it\u2019s going to be this year. We certainly don\u2019t aspire to have a reduction in our EPS. But if demand is softer than it was last year, we\u2019ll manage through it. Luke, well, thank you very much. I\u2019m glad you emphasize this. I mean, this 27% downside conversion margin for an organization that is already making pretty robust margins is really phenomenal. And by any measure, it\u2019s a reflection of that quick reactivity that I was discussing earlier. Luke, I would be lying if I told you our folks working in that market are happy to have a little bit of a downturn to kind of to use your phrase, catch their breath. Nobody likes dealing with this. But we do it. It is what it is. Like it\u2019s \u2013 we don\u2019t sort of punt reality. It just is what it is. At the same time though, what\u2019s interesting is while we\u2019re making sure that the financial strength of the company is stays as robust as it did, and again, the 27% convergent margin that you mentioned is a great indicator of that. We are working on an extraordinary array of next generation technologies. Just because customers have some extra inventory doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t have an enormous amount of next generation things that they\u2019re trying to achieve. And you mentioned, and I think I alluded to, AI as one of those, I mean, these are the kind of revolutions that drive kind of quantum leaps in the demands of our customers for processor power, for speed as it relates to data transmission and networking, all of which creates demands on the equipment for next generation high speed interconnect for the fiber optics and for the high efficiency power interconnect that\u2019s so important to sustaining the operating expenses and let alone the carbon footprint of these massive processors that are going into these enormous data centers. And so we haven\u2019t slowed down at all as it relates to developing and designing next generation products together with our customers. And you could actually argue that in certain cases we\u2019ve had to accelerate those efforts as customers have gotten into competitive situations with others on things like AI, machine learning and alike. And that\u2019s the kind of carrying water on both shoulders that is an Amphenol in trait as well. It\u2019s not something necessarily. I emphasize so much. But we talk a lot in the company about driving with one foot on the gas, one on the brake, carrying water on both shoulders. Sometimes you got to go out and cut costs at the very same time as you\u2019re ramping up engineering support for next generation systems. And being able to do that, having the mindset and the agility to do that is I think a very unique trait that is resident inside our organization. And that includes within all of those working across IT datacom. Thanks. Thanks, Chris. Look, I\u2019ve talked a lot about IT datacom, but to the specific of your question, I mean, I don\u2019t know what the second half is going to bring. I certainly hope that Q2 and the fact that we see sales to be flat is an indication that we've kind of reached a kind of a little bit more of an equilibrium. 90 days from now, I hope to be able to give you a better sense of that as it relates to the second half. But it's certainly a better indication than if we had seen another leg down on a sequential basis. So we'll see what the second half brings. Again, the fact that it's flat in the second quarter gives me some hope, but 90 days from now we'll try to give you a little more certainty about that. Thanks very much, Will. I wouldn't point out any significant geographical distinction across the communications markets. I mean remember that a lot of these communications products they do get that \u2013 a lot of them still get made in Asia, especially on the device side and a good portion of the \u2013 at least the OEM products of the IT datacom. So you can imagine that in Asia, that's having a worse situation overall for the company. And sure enough in Asia, our \u2013 we did not have as robust performance in the quarter as we did in North America and Europe overall and that's driven a lot by that. But otherwise, I wouldn't say that there's any sort of end customer geographic changes here. Relative to hyperscale versus the equipment manufacturers, again, I don't think there's a real distinction because ultimately the hyperscale people are also customers for the equipment manufacturers in many cases. And I think that that overall inventory position is fairly broad across both areas of that market. Hi, Guy. Yes. Well, thanks very much, Guy. I mean the fact is as industrial is at least this quarter our largest segment, it was 28% of our sales. At the same time, industrial is far and away our most diversified market. I mean there's really not a correlation amongst the various segments within Industrial, except that they all represent harsh environments where our customers are trying to push new electronics deeper and deeper into some of the harshest of environments to an offshore wind mill, into a semiconductor factory, into an operating theater, onto a train going 400 kilometers an hour and everything in between. In terms of the segments, I wouldn't say that necessarily factory automation is the largest. It's a significant segment, but we have strong sales in the areas like heavy equipment and medical, instrumentation, which includes things like semiconductor manufacturing into electric vehicles, heavy electric vehicles and battery. All times of \u2013 types of energy generation and that includes both alternative energy, but also traditional energy extraction and generation, rail mass, transit, things like marine and entertainment? I mean, and you can tell these are not markets that correlate with one another. So if we're going to have one of our markets be a little bit bigger than the others, and in this case, still just 28% of sales, this would be the one that you'd want to have that. And we're just really excited by the progress that we've made in our industrial market over a very long time period. If I go back to 20 years ago, I mean this was a relatively small business that we didn't really have a close touch with where it went. It all went through distribution. And we had just fabulous leadership in our industrial business over that time who really drove a very much an application and segment-based approach to developing new products, application-specific, technology-specific products. At the same time, as we made a number of great acquisitions over many years, and we continue to make great acquisitions across the industrial market that have ultimately positioned us for this just multitude of revolutions going on as electronics gets pushed deeper and deeper into harsher and harsher environments. And so it's not just one or another piece of that, and we're just really excited about the ongoing strength of our industrial market, which has just been a fabulous asset for the company for many years, and I believe will remain so for many years to come. Thank you very much, Michael. Well, CMR, as we announced, we closed earlier in the year, and that's a fabulous company making harsh environment, value-add interconnect products that go into the industrial market, in particular, in heavy equipment. RFS, we announced that we signed the acquisition, but we have not yet closed it. We \u2013 as we said last quarter, we expect to close by the end of the second quarter, and we don't change what we say about that. And RFS really expands our position in the mobile networks market with really high-technology antennas and fiber optic solutions that go into next-generation mobile networks. And we're, again, very excited about that company, and our team continues to work closely with the RFS team as we get closer to bring them into the Amphenol family. In terms of our pipeline of acquisitions and where we see the future, we don't pick and choose our markets and say, well, that's the market where we want to make acquisitions or, that's the market where we don't want to make acquisitions. And the reason for that is when we make an acquisition, we're getting married forever. We're not a trader where we buy companies and sell them and buy and sell and kind of do this portfolio management. We look for companies with great people, with outstanding enabling technologies and robust and complementary market positions across all of our end markets. And in our experience, which stretches over, in my career, more than 75 acquisitions, and I think more than 50 since I've been CEO in these 15 years nearly, that \u2013 having that very simple approach leads to really outstanding long-term success and a great return on our capital that we deploy towards the M&A program. Our acquisition pipeline remains very robust today. I remain wholly incapable of predicting when we will close and if we will close certain deals. But I know that long-term, the program is going to continue to support really great growth for the company and a great use of the capital and the cash that we generate so much of. And so we look very much forward to continuing our M&A program, and it really complements the culture of the company as well because every time we bring in one of these new entrepreneurs, it actually strengthens the entrepreneurial culture of Amphenol. And that's something that I look very much forward to as well. Well, very good. I think we have no further questions, operator. And so if that's the case, I would like to take this opportunity to wish all of you a wonderful continuation of your spring and we look forward to talking to you all just 90 days from now. Thank you so much, and best wishes to you all."

        "content": "Operator: Hello, and welcome to the third quarter earnings conference call for Amphenol Corporation. Following today's presentation, there will be a formal question-and-answer session. Until then, all lines will remain in a listen-only mode. At the request of the company, today's conference is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to introduce today's conference host, Mr. Craig Lampo. Sir, you may begin.\nCraig Lampo: Thank you very much. Good afternoon, everyone. This is Craig Lampo, Amphenol's CFO; and I'm here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO. We would like to welcome you to our third quarter 2024 conference call. Our third quarter results were released this morning and I will provide some financial commentary, and then Adam will give an overview of the business and current market trends. And then, of course, we will take questions. As a reminder, during the call, we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures and make certain forward-looking statements, so please refer to the relevant disclosures in our press release for further information. In addition, as a result of our previously announced two-for-one stock split completed in June of this year, all share and per share data discussed on this earnings call is on a split-adjusted basis. The company closed the third quarter of 2024 with record sales of $4.39 billion and record GAAP and adjusted diluted EPS of $0.48 and $0.50, respectively. Third quarter sales were up 26% in US dollars in local currencies and 15% organically compared to the third quarter of 2023. Sequentially, sales were up 12% in US dollars, 11% in local currencies and 8% organically. Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes. Orders in the quarter were a record $4.412 billion, up 39% compared to the prior year and up 9% sequentially, resulting in a strong book-to-bill ratio of 1.09:1. GAAP operating income was $819 million and included $64 million of acquisition-related costs in the quarter, primarily related to CIT. GAAP operating margin was 20.3%. Excluding these costs, adjusted operating income was $883 million, resulting in a record adjusted operating margin of 21.9% in the third quarter of 2024. On an adjusted basis, operating margin increased by 110 basis points from the prior year quarter and 60 basis points sequentially. The year-over-year increase in adjusted operating margin was primarily driven by strong operating leverage on higher sales volumes, which was partially offset by the dilutive impact of acquisitions completed in the prior 12 months. On a sequential basis, the increase in adjusted operating margin reflected strong conversion on the higher sales levels, partially offset by the dilutive impact of acquisitions, in particular, CIT, which closed during the second quarter. I am very proud of the company's operating margin performance in the third quarter, which reflects continued strong execution by our teams. Breaking down the third quarter results by segment compared to the third quarter of 2023, sales in the Harsh Environment Solutions segment were $1.194 billion and increased by 35% in US dollars and 3% organically, and segment operating margin was 23.8%. Sales in the Communications Solutions segment were $1.685 billion and increased by 32% in US dollars and 30% organically, and segment operating margin was 25.6%. And sales in the Interconnect and Sensor Systems segment was $1.160 billion, an increased by 12% in US dollars and 6% organically. Segment operating margin was 18.8%. The company's GAAP effective tax rate for the third quarter was 21.4%, and the adjusted effective tax rate was 24%, which compared to 18.2% and 24% in the third quarter of 2023. GAAP Diluted EPS was a record $0.48 in the third quarter, up 17% compared to the prior year period, and on an adjusted basis, diluted EPS increased 28% to a record $0.50 compared to $0.39 in the third quarter of 2023. Operating cash flow in the third quarter was $704 million or 117% of net income. And net of capital spending, our free cash flow was $476 million or 79% of net income. And as expected, our capital spending was somewhat elevated in the quarter due to investments we are making support the strong growth we are seeing in IT datacom and defense markets. In the fourth quarter, we expect to continue to have somewhat elevated levels of capital spending to further support our growth in these markets. From a working capital standpoint, inventory days, days sales outstanding and payable days were 87, 69 and 59 days, respectively, all within normal levels. During the quarter, the company repurchased 2.7 million shares of common stock at an average price of approximately $65, and when combined with our normal quarterly dividend, total capital returned to our shareholders in the third quarter of 2024 was $308 million. Total debt on September 30 was $5.5 billion, and net debt was $3.9 billion, and total liquidity at the end of the quarter was $4.6 billion, which included cash and short-term investments on hand of $1.6 billion, plus availability under our existing credit facilities. In addition, we expect quarterly interest expense net of interest income earned on cash on hand to be approximately $45 million in the fourth quarter of 2024. Excluding acquisition-related costs, third quarter 2024 EBITDA was $1.30 billion. And at the end of the third quarter of 2024, net leverage ratio was 1.0 times. I will now turn the call over to Adam, who will provide some commentary on current market trends.\nAdam Norwitt: Well, thank you very much, Craig, and thank you all for joining our call here on a very beautiful fall day in Wallingford, Connecticut. And I hope that all of you are enjoying a very nice fall so far. As Craig mentioned, I'm going to highlight our achievements here in the third quarter. And in particular, we'll discuss the trends and progress across our served markets. And then I'll comment on our outlook for the fourth quarter and the full year 2024, and of course, we'll have some time at the end for questions. Our results in the third quarter were really strong and actually stronger than expected and exceeding the high end of our guidance in sales and adjusted diluted earnings per share. Sales grew from prior year by a very strong 26% in US dollars and in local currencies, reaching a new record of $4.39 billion. We're very proud to have that new sales record. On an organic basis, our sales did increase by 15%, driven by growth in the IT datacom, mobile networks, mobile devices, commercial air and defense end markets, and I'll talk about those details in a few moments. The company also booked record orders of $4,412 billion, representing a robust book-to-bill of 1.09:1. This was also driven especially by continued strength in the IT datacom market. Our adjusted operating margins reached a new record, 21.9%, in the quarter, and this represented a 110-basis-point increase from last year's third quarter. Adjusted diluted EPS grew 28% from prior year to reach a new record, $0.50, in the third quarter. And then finally, we generated operating and free cash flow of $704 million and $476 million, respectively, in the quarter, and this is yet another clear demonstration of the high quality of the company's earnings. I just have to say, I'm extremely proud of the Amphenol team. Our results this quarter, once again, reflect the strength of our entrepreneurial organization as we continue to outperform in any environment. Now just here in early October, we're very pleased to have closed on the previously announced acquisition of Lutze Europe. Lutze is based in Germany with annual sales of approximately $100 million, and it's a leading provider of harsh environment cable and cable assembly solutions for diverse applications in the industrial markets. The Lutze Europe acquisition is a great complement to our broad offering of high-technology interconnect products for the worldwide industrial market. And together with Lutze US, it strengthens our range of value-add interconnect products for this very important market. In addition, we remain excited about the pending acquisition of the Andrew businesses from CommScope, and we now expect that transaction to close in the first quarter of 2025. We remain confident that our acquisition program will continue to create great value for Amphenol. Our ability to identify and execute upon acquisitions and then to successfully bring these new companies into the Amphenol family remains a core competitive advantage for the company. Now turning to our served markets. We're once again pleased that the company's end market exposure remains highly diversified, balanced and broad. Now this diversification, no question, continues to create great value for Amphenol because it enables us to participate across all areas of the global electronics industry, while not being disproportionately exposed to the volatility of any given market or application. Now starting out with the defense market, it represented 11% of our sales in the quarter, and sales grew from prior year by a strong 16% in US dollars and 8% organically. This was driven by growth across really most segments of the defense market with contributions, especially from space, aircraft and avionics, communications and ground vehicle applications. Sequentially, our sales grew by 4%, which was in line with our expectations coming into the quarter. As we now look into the fourth quarter, we expect sales in the defense market to increase moderately from these third quarter levels. And for the full year 2024, we expect a mid-teens increase in sales. We remain encouraged by the company's strengthening position in the defense market, where we continue to offer the industry's widest range of high-technology interconnect products. Amidst the current dynamic geopolitical environment, countries around the world are expanding their spending on both current and next-generation defense technologies. With our investments in the development of a broad array of new products, as well as, very importantly, the capacities to build those products, we're well positioned to capitalize on this long-term demand potential. The commercial air market represented 6% of our sales in the quarter, and we had another strong quarter in commercial air with sales increasing by 123% from prior year in US dollars and 12% organically, as we benefited from the addition of CIT, which we closed back in the second quarter, as well as continued progress in expanding our content on next-generation commercial aircraft. Compared to the second quarter, sales increased by 37% sequentially, and were up slightly on an organic basis, and this was modestly lower than our expectations coming into the quarter. Looking to the fourth quarter, we expect a high single-digit increase in sales. And for the full year 2024, we expect sales to increase by more than 80% from last year, driven by the addition of CIT, as well as robust organic growth. I'm truly proud of our team working in the commercial air market. With the ongoing growth in demand for jet liners, our efforts to strengthen our product offering, while diversifying our market position into next-generation aircraft are paying real dividends. We continue to see great long-term opportunities for the expansion of our technology offering into this important market, and look forward to realizing the benefits of our growth initiatives for many years to come. The industrial market represented 23% of our sales in the quarter. And sales in the quarter grew by 24% in US dollars from prior year, as we benefited from acquisitions. On an organic basis, our sales were flat, as growth in alternative energy, instrumentation, medical and rail mass transit solutions was offset by reduced demand in factory automation, heavy equipment, transportation and oil and gas. Sequentially, our sales did increase by 9% and from the second quarter and were up by 3% organically, which was somewhat better than our expectations coming into the quarter. While we are encouraged to see stronger growth in North America and Asia, demand in Europe did again slowed this quarter. Accordingly, looking into the fourth quarter, we do expect sales to moderate from these third quarter levels. And for the full year 2024, we expect sales to grow in the low double digits, with the benefit of acquisitions partially offset by an organic moderation of sales. With the additions this year of CIT and L\u00dcTZE, we now have an even broader range of products and capabilities to offer customers across the diversified industrial market. I'm confident that our long-term strategy to expand our high-technology interconnect antenna and sensor offerings, both organically and through complementary acquisitions, has positioned us to capitalize on the many electronic revolutions that will no doubt continue to occur across the industrial market. And this creates exciting opportunities for outstanding teams working around the world. The automotive market represented 19% of our sales in the quarter, and sales grew by 4% in US dollars and were flat organically. Similar to the industrial market, while we did grow in North America and Asia in the automotive market, our sales in Europe declined from prior year. Sequentially, our sales increased by 4% from the second quarter, which was a bit better than our expectations coming into Q3. For the fourth quarter, we expect sales to decline modestly from these third quarter levels. And for the full year 2024, we expect sales to increase in the mid-single-digit range compared to prior year. I remain proud of our team working in the automotive market. While there are some areas of the automotive market that have shown some signs of slowing, our team remains focused on driving new design wins with customers who are implementing a wide array of new technologies into their vehicles. These include electrified drivetrains as well as a multitude of other exciting applications, and we look forward to benefiting from our strong position in the automotive market for many years to come. The mobile devices market represented 10% of our sales in the quarter. Sales increased by 18% in U.S. dollars and 17% organically, and this was really driven by broad-based strength across applications in the mobile devices market. Sequentially, our sales increased by a much stronger-than-expected 38% and that was driven also by higher sales across all segments of the mobile devices market. Looking to the fourth quarter, we expect our sales to remain at these higher levels. And for the full year, we anticipate sales to be up in the high single-digit range compared to 2023. I'm very proud of our team working in the always dynamic mobile devices market as their agility and reactivity have once again enabled us to capture incremental sales in the quarter. I'm confident that with our leading array of antennas, interconnect products and mechanisms designed in across a broad range of next-generation mobile devices, we are well positioned for the long-term. The mobile networks market represented 3% of our sales in the quarter, and sales grew by a strong 22% in U.S. dollars and 19% organically, as we continue to see a recovery in demand from both mobile network operators as well as wireless equipment manufacturers. On a sequential basis, our sales increased by 1%, which was a bit better than our expectations coming into the quarter. For the fourth quarter, we now expect sales to decline seasonally in the mid-teens. And for the full year, we anticipate sales to grow in the high single-digit range versus last year. We're encouraged by the recent strengthening in the mobile networks market. As operators ramp up their investments in next-generation systems, our team remains focused on realizing the benefits of our long-term efforts to expand our position in next-generation equipment and networks around the world. With the pending acquisition of the Andrew businesses from CommScope, we look forward to participating even more strongly in these networks for many years to come. The IT datacom market represented 25% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in IT datacom grew in the quarter by a very strong 60% in U.S. dollars and 59% organically, and this was driven by the continued acceleration in demand for our products used in artificial intelligence applications, together with robust growth in our base IT datacom business. On a sequential basis, sales increased by 15% from the second quarter, substantially better than our expectations coming into the third -- coming into the quarter. As we look towards the fourth quarter, we do expect a further mid single-digit sequential increase from these third quarter levels. And for the full year 2024, we expect sales in IT datacom to grow by more than 50% compared to 2023. I have to say that we're more encouraged than ever by the company's position in the global IT datacom market. Our team who is just doing an amazing job around the world in securing future business on next-generation IT systems, particularly those enabling AI, there's no doubt that this revolution in AI has created a unique opportunity for the interconnect industry and for Amphenol given our leading high-speed and power interconnect products. Whether high-speed, power or fiber optic interconnect, our products are critical components in these next-generation networks, and this continues to create a long-term growth opportunity for Amphenol. Finally, the broadband market represented 3% of our sales in the quarter, and sales were down by 15% in US dollars and 14% organically as broadband operators continued to moderate their procurement levels. On a sequential basis, sales were down 3%, which was roughly in line with our expectations coming into the quarter. For the fourth quarter, we expect a further high single-digit reduction in sales, and for the full year 2024, we expect a mid-teens sales decline from prior year. Regardless of this current more muted demand environment, we remain encouraged by the company's position in the broadband market, and we look forward to continuing to support our service provider customers around the world, when they resume growing their investments to expand bandwidth and coverage to their enterprise and consumer customers. Now turning to our outlook and obviously, assuming the continuation of current market conditions as well as constant exchange rates. For the fourth quarter, we expect sales in the range of $3.950 billion to $4.50 billion and adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $0.48 to $0.50. This would represent a sales increase of 19% to 22%, and an adjusted diluted EPS increase of 17% to 22% compared to the fourth quarter of 2023. Our fourth quarter guidance represents an expectation for full year sales of $14.855 billion to $14.955 billion, as well as full year adjusted diluted EPS and of $1.82 to $1.84. This outlook would represent full year sales and adjusted EPS increases of 18% to 19% 21% to 22%, respectively. This has been a very strong year for Amphenol thus far in 2024 and I remain confident in the ability of our outstanding management team to adapt to the many opportunities and challenges in the current environment and to continue to grow our market position, while driving sustainable and strong profitability through this year and into the long term. And finally, I'd like to take this opportunity to thank our entire global team for their truly outstanding efforts here in the third quarter. There's no doubt that they worked extremely hard to deliver, especially this level of growth, and I'm truly grateful to them. And with that, operator, we'd be happy to take any questions.\nOperator: Thank you. The question-and-answer session period will now begin. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Andrew Buscaglia with BNP. You may go ahead.\nAndrew Buscaglia: Hey, good morning, guys.\nAdam Norwitt: Good morning.\nAndrew Buscaglia: So obviously, a very robust quarter for IT datacom. And even you said slightly better than maybe you expected. So I think last quarter you were alluding to IT datacom, the non-AI portion, also starting to improve. So could you help us parse out how much of this sequential improvement is from AI versus non-AI?\nAdam Norwitt: Yeah. Well, Andrew, thanks so much for the question. Look, I think we did start last quarter being the second quarter to see a little bit of stronger performance. And I would tell you here in the third quarter, the underlying IT datacom, obviously, with the caveat that we -- it's not always exactly easy to tell what product goes into what application. But our best assessment of it is that the underlying IT datacom market did show actually very, very strong growth this quarter. Now I will tell you that roughly the AI -- the products that we sell into AI represented a bit more than half of our overall year-over-year growth and about the same in terms of sequential. So, very strong performance for anything related to AI. We have a very significant position in AI, as you know well, but we were encouraged, very encouraged to see that the underlying IT datacom demand has grown. And there's no doubt that there is today a real rush to equip data centers, enterprises, consumers, service providers with this next-generation compute power with all the switching that's associated with that and the like. And I think that is driving a bit of a recovery in these products in quite a significant way for us here in the quarter.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Luke Junk with Baird. You may go ahead.\nLuke Junk: Great. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Adam, just hoping to double click on your automotive business. Clearly, a very dynamic market right now in terms of overall production volatility. You mentioned Europe, especially EV moderation, et cetera. Just given that backdrop, be curious what you're seeing in terms of the bookings pipeline right now, especially relative to your ability to continue to drive growth above market at or above the levels the company has driven historically. Is the market constraining your growth potential at all right now? Or the OEMs actually need more help from Amphenol in this environment? I appreciate the perspective.\nAdam Norwitt: Well, thanks so much, Luke. I mean a lot to unwrap there, but let me say this. I mean, I'm really proud of our team in automotive. I mean, on a year-to-date basis, we've just done a fabulous job of continuing to outperform and navigating what, as you term, is very much so a dynamic worldwide automotive market. And these dynamics are sort of multifaceted. There's the dynamic of drivetrain choice, and I'm not going to go down that rabbit hole, but for sure, the world is talking about this. There's also the dynamic of just overall demand in certain geographies and in particular, Europe, where it's been widely reported, and I'm probably not the first to say that there are some challenges in the overall European demand in automotive. And we see that on a related basis, I think in industrial. But what I'm really pleased with is, if you look this quarter, we did have still robust growth in Asia and North America on an organic basis on a year-over-year basis and that was offset in part at least by a moderation in Europe. So to your specific question about content and Amphenol continuing to outperform, we have every confidence that the momentum that we've had in gaining content, enabling new applications with our customers around the world, whether those be next-generation drivetrains, whether those be next-generation electronics in cars, connectivity, communications, antennas, sensors and the like, the breadth of the product offerings that we have, the capabilities to fulfill those offerings on a global basis, continues to put us in a very strong position with automotive OEMs, the world over. And our team just has to navigate those dynamics as they are. But the good news is, regardless of whether something is made in Europe, made in Asia, made in North America, regardless of whether something is a full electric vehicle, a hybrid or a full internal combustion engine, there is continuing to be a proliferation of electronics across all of those cars. And so it's up to us to make sure that we continue to drive our next-generation products into those platforms around the world. And I'm confident that our team is well positioned to do that.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. You may go ahead.\nAmit Daryanani: Thanks a lot and congrats on a nice quarter. I guess, Adam, there's been a fair amount of noise around your content when it comes to AI deployments. And if I sort of think of the number you just said about half of the year-over-year growth is AI-driven. Can you just talk about the breadth of your customer base when it comes to AI deployments? And if there's a way to maybe even think about how do your revenue stack up hyperscale versus XPU providers, and just the breadth of your offering there would be really helpful.\nAdam Norwitt: Yeah, Amit, thanks so much. I mean, look, we have really an outstanding breadth of offering into the IT datacom market and, in particular, into applications related to AI. And I think we've talked about this in the past. What's unique about AI is that we're working with customers throughout the entire stack of the chain. And that starts -- it starts with the people who have the money, and that's the web service providers. And there's only a limited universe of those, and we're very well-positioned with those companies. Through the OEMs, the people who outfit the data centers, the OEMs who make equipment to sell into those data centers all the way down to the chip companies who sometimes are creating designs and configurations of those things that are used. And I think that comprehensive aspect of our relationships has really served us well because it's not about an individual product, an individual program or whatever, it's about the collective efforts of the industry to build out artificial intelligence in kind of a big way. And I think that collective efforts are happening in so many different aspects. You have different types of chips being used, different architectures being used. But what ties them all together from an interconnect perspective is two things. They have to be high speed and low latency, and you've got to help them use less power. And those two things of the speed and latency on one side and the power efficiency on the other are where we come into play and we create value for our customers because we have the industry's leading high-speed products, the highest -- operating at the highest speed, the lowest latencies. We have industry's leading efficient power interconnect products, everything from power connectors, assemblies, bus bars and the like, everything that gets power all the way down to these power-hungry chips. And working on those complex architectures, as our engineers have done for many years, together with scaling out our capacity and capability on a global basis, so that we can meet this demand has really put us in a strong position with customers of the world over. And so I wouldn't get hung up on noise of one or another program or configuration, I would think much more about the overall opportunity that is here and the fact that we're, for sure, capturing more than our fair share of that.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. You may go ahead.\nSamik Chatterjee: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. And Adam, congrats on the strong results here. I guess, I'll follow-up to what Amit's question was. Adam, you talked in your prepared remarks about your team working hard to win or secure business in IT datacom on next-generation systems. Can you talk in relation to when you're seeing the robust growth numbers in IT datacom, what are we seeing in terms of content growth in of next-generation systems? How much visibility are you getting today in relation to what your content on a per unit basis, in some cases, looks like going to a next-generation system? And how are you positioned whether that next relation system uses more copper or fiber? How do you think about opportunities on both those fronts? Thank you.\nAdam Norwitt: Yeah. Thanks very much, Samik. I mean look, we've talked in the past about the fact that the unique architecture of these neural network, machine learning, AI, whatever you want to call them, systems, is that you essentially have to create a very high-speed, low-latency mesh fabric so that the chips can all talk to each other. And that's -- and I am not an electrical engineer, the farthest thing from it. But I can tell you that it is unbelievable the type of interconnection requirements that are going on these -- in these systems. And that just means there is greater content and a greater role. I mean, we use this word content, but let me change that to talk about just the role that interconnect plays in the functioning of these systems. Because the role of the interconnect becomes really fundamental to whether these systems can operate. If the chips can't talk to each other at a high enough speed and at a enough low latency, then to go out and build a complex large language model or whatever other model you're trying to do, it just takes too long and the thing becomes obsolete before it's even completed. And so the ability to have these rapid calculations and comparisons and probabilities that come across these chips is, in many ways, dependent on the interconnect as a link to that. And thus, the content opportunity regardless of who makes what chip, regardless of how someone chooses to architect that, that content has gone up and will continue to go up. And we have a very strong position with customers, again, across that that stack I described earlier. Relative to copper and fiber, the good news for Amphenol is we're present in both, and we've made great acquisitions and been a strong innovator in fiber as well as in copper. But I think you also know very well that there are advantages to each. And when you think about power, you want to use copper as much as possible because optics has a much higher usage of power. And so the value that we can create for our customers is by stretching the capabilities of copper such that it can meet these ultra-high bandwidth demand. And that's something we've been doing for more than two decades. When I think back on the acquisition of Teradyne Connection Systems 19 years ago, that brought us into a leadership position of high-speed over copper. Back then, we were talking about things like five gigabits as being kind of an aspirational or 10 gigabits as an aspirational speed over copper. Today, we're achieving things like 200 and aspiring to 400 and 800, and who knows maybe beyond over copper. And that's the incredible value that you can create for customers by stretching the capabilities of copper through your engineering expertise. This is real value that you can create through engineering and technology, and I think our teams are doing that.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Asiya Merchant with Citi. You may go ahead.\nAsiya Merchant: Great. Thank you for taking my question and congratulations on the results. If I can a little a little bit on CapEx. I think Craig mentioned bit on elevated CapEx here. And so if you could help me understand how long do we expect this CapEx run rate to exist? Are we at the end of the CapEx that you guys are putting in to support the IT datacom growth? Thank you.\nCraig Lampo: Yeah. Thanks, Asiya. So if you think about kind of our capital spend, we talked about this last quarter a bit, and we said we would expect to be kind of elevated for certainly the next couple of quarters being this quarter. And I just kind of reiterated that here in the fourth quarter, we expect to be kind of a little bit elevated levels to drive this and support the significant growth we're seeing in both IT datacom, as well as, to a certain extent, to the defense market as well. I mean we're not giving guidance yet for next year, so I'm not going to necessarily comment specifically on what we expect for capital spend for 2025. But we do certainly continue to target kind of that 3% to 4% of sales from a capital perspective. I think nothing structurally has changed over kind of the mid- or long-term from our expectation of capital spend to kind of maintain our business going forward. Certainly, in years, we're going to see strong growth such as 2024 here, and certainly in other years, we tend to be kind of at the higher end of that range in years that we see kind lower growth, yes, I would expect to be kind of more in the middle of that range or so. So I think that that's how we expect our capital at this point. Certainly, we'll talk about 2025 more specifically, if we see elevated levels as we enter the year next year.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Joe Spak with UBS. You may go ahead.\nJoe Spak: Thanks so much, everyone. Maybe two quick ones. One, I just wanted to understand, in the aerospace guidance you gave, whether you assumed any impact from the ongoing strike and if that's at all significant? And then last quarter, you talked about some industrial green shoots, and I know you mentioned today that North America, Asia, okay, Europe tough. Just wondering if there's, I guess, any further sprouting, and if you're seeing any impact from any of the China stimulus in that region?\nAdam Norwitt: Yes. Thanks very much, Joe. I mean look, relative to your first question on aerospace and strikes, I mean, look, we wish for all of our customers that they have peaceful relations with their workforce. And without commenting specifically on any customer, I'll tell you that our guidance always incorporates all the information that we have from our customers around the world, including within that market. In terms of the industrial green shoots, it's absolutely the case. The last quarter, we did talk about seeing some green shoots in industrial. And look, I mean, this quarter, we did see some sequential growth on an organic basis from prior quarter. But I will say that our view of the trends in Europe are probably a little more muted than maybe they were a quarter ago. I mean we're pleased with what we've seen in North America and Asia. We grew in industrial organically in both regions, both on a year-over-year basis and sequentially, but we've probably seen an incremental tick down in Europe. And what to look for there, I mean I think we'll have to watch. The automotive industry and the industrial -- the automotive market and industrial market in Europe are fairly tied at the hip as you know well. You have a lot of factory automation and machine tool industries and the like, which are somewhat dependent on the investment cycles that come from the automakers, who are such a big component of the European economy. And so I think we'll have to watch that and see how it proceeds. But look, in our organization, I mean, not to be cavalier about this, but like it is what it is. Like we -- our team is very used to this scenario where you tighten your belt and you put your head up high and got and take some business. And so to the extent that there is, in Europe, a moderation in these -- in a place like industrial and automotive, our team know how to deal with that. We've got a playbook. And to the extent that there are opportunities in other geographies, we'll work to capitalize upon those and take more than our fair share as they come along.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs. You may go ahead.\nMark Delaney: Yes. Good afternoon. Thank you very much for taking the question. EBIT margins came in at a record high, even with a full quarter contribution of the CIT acquisition. So I'm hoping to better understand what led to the margin strength this past quarter? Maybe you can level set us on where CIT margins are running at this point, and if they're already at the levels you're targeting? And how should investors think about incremental margins going forward? Thank you.\nCraig Lampo: Yes. Thanks, Mark. We're really, really proud of our operating margins here in the third quarter. I mean, this year, we really have done a great job of really execution, and this really goes without saying here in the third quarter. The CIT margins, I would say, ultimately, we're not going to talk so much specifically about their margins. But I would say, they're still on their journey. That really wasn't a strong contributor here in the third quarter to the margin improvement, really, the margin improvement here was just the execution of the team and the ability for team to really just maximize the profitability on the strong growth that we've seen. And I think that as we go forward, we talk about this 25% conversion margin. We've done clearly better than that recently. I still think, over the long-term, 25% is kind of the way we kind of think about things, but the team really has been executing very well on this the strong growth that we've seen over the recent quarters. And I would expect as we continue to grow, we'll continue to be able to kind of execute well and increase those margins as we grow. As it relates to how long it's going to take us to kind of get CIT at the company average, we're not going to really talk about so much how long exactly we think, but we're certainly very happy with the progress so far. And certainly, I would say, today, even versus 90 days ago, I would say, I'm even more optimistic that, ultimately, that CIT will get to the company average. But this is just a great team. They're extremely motivated. They're excited to be part of Amphenol. And I think they're really making some great strides to take the steps they need to get those really great goals.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Guy Hardwick with Freedom Capital Markets. You may go ahead.\nGuy Hardwick: Hi. Good afternoon. Congratulations on the fantastic Q3 results.\nAdam Norwitt: Thank you, Guy.\nGuy Hardwick: Just -- obviously, it's great news that you can close Andrew a little bit closer than earlier than expected. Does that mean any sort of antitrust issues that you may have encountered or receiving?\nAdam Norwitt: Yes. Well, thanks very much. I mean, look, we never thought there were going to be any meaningful antitrust issues, but we knew that there would be a lot of filings to be done, because Andrew operates on a global basis in lots of different geographies. And you never know how long those things can take. And I think we're just encouraged by how the process is going and that gives us really the confidence to think that it's going be sometime in the first quarter as opposed to in the first half. But we -- again, just to reiterate, we never thought there were any substantive antitrust issues, but there's always a process to do.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Steven Fox with Fox Advisors. You may go ahead.\nSteven Fox: Hi. Good afternoon Adam and Craig. I was wondering if you could step back on the mobile device market. You called out that you're now going to see high single-digit growth for the year, which is kind of an interesting data point, even if it's off of a down year in 2023. Can you just sort of talk about what that high single digits is comprised of, how much you think it's content growth, what you think the markets are doing and what it implies maybe for next few quarters, roughly? Thank you.\nAdam Norwitt: Yeah. Well, thanks very much, Steve. I will punt a little bit on your last part of your question, because I'm not very good at forecasting mobile devices even in one quarter, let alone the next several quarters. But let me do this, our team working in mobile devices has still done a fabulous job again this year. I mean, this is such a phenomenal organization. And you think about the technologies that we're working in, things like connectors, obviously, antennas, obviously, the mechanisms that we participate in. And there's no doubt that the content in many of these products, the breadth of content continues to expand. And if I think back on a phrase that I've used for many, many years, probably almost entirety my nearly 16 years here doing these calls as CEO. It's that when the hardware creates value for the customers, then our products can create value for our customers. And there's no question that you see continued innovations in the things themselves and the devices and those ultimately result in just really, really beautiful products that are coming out. And our team is helping to make those beautiful products. And the more functionality that comes into them, the more opportunity there is ultimately for us. Now look, all of that is with the caveat to tell you that this is a very fickle dynamic volatile market. And so we're guiding the market here in the fourth quarter to stay at these pretty robust levels that we achieved in the third quarter. And hopefully, I'll be right about that, but time has told that I'm usually not spot on in even guiding in a 90-day period on mobile devices. But there is no doubt. I mean -- and maybe I'm a power user of these mobile devices. I mean, I have them sitting all around me at all times. I use them constantly. We have learned, I think, the extraordinary things that you can do with mobile devices and what used to be just a phone becomes a tablet, a wearable, hearable device. The line gets blurred between all of these things, but ultimately, they allow you to communicate and to be productive. And I think that our customers continue to push the limits of that that productivity and communication such that consumers ultimately want to buy the product. So I think that's where we stand today. Next year, who knows what it's going to be, Steve, we still see.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Scott Graham with Seaport Research Partners. You may go ahead.\nScott Graham: Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question, and great quarter. I was hoping you would perhaps comment on organic orders in the quarter and maybe call out, which verticals were maybe stronger versus those, which were weaker?\nAdam Norwitt: Yeah. I mean we don't really talk about organic orders, like if you're talking about order growth or something like this. I mean, our book-to-bill is what it is because we acquire a company and they have bookings greater than their revenues, that's still organic book-to-bill, and I think our strong book-to-bill is a total reflection of the companies that we own, not being on prior to being part of Amphenol.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. You may go ahead.\nWamsi Mohan: Yeah. Thank you so much. Adam, I was wondering if you could maybe comment on the aperture of these orders, again, like a very strong order number, can you talk about maybe, one, the visibility that you have around these orders? And how far out maybe some of these orders are? Like how much would you fulfill current quarter versus maybe next? Are these stretched out even beyond that, that would be helpful? Thank you.\nAdam Norwitt: Yes. Well, thanks very much, Wamsi. I appreciate the question. Look, I have mentioned, I think, last quarter, and I'll reiterate it again this quarter that these are very strong books book-to-bill. And in particular, we see those strong books-to-bill in IT datacom first and probably defense and comm air to a somewhat lesser extent. And there's no doubt that we have seen a bit of the order aperture opening. And I would actually relate that also to the fact that we're spending more on capital spending. And Craig already talked about CapEx. And you can imagine, when we think about spending a little bit more than we're used to on capital that we work with customers to make sure that we have assurance that, that capital is going to be used, and that assurance often comes in the form of orders. It can also come in the form of contributions or guarantees. And so there's some extent of that order aperture that's a little bit longer that is there to give us the comfort and security that we'll be making those investments, which may be more significant than is typical. In terms of how far out, I mean, look, we'll never book anything -- we don't record any booking that's more than a year out in our numbers. That's a sort of even an accounting rule some sort internally. But the vast majority of our orders would be fulfilled within a couple of quarters. And I can't tell you are there some of those that poke out into three quarters out occasionally, that could be on an occasional basis. But I would say the vast majority would be within a couple of quarters.\nOperator: Thank you. And our last question comes from Joe Giordano with TD Cowen. You may go ahead.\nJoe Giordano: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Adam, you hinted at this, and you've done it, you said calls historically about how you guys motivate your people to go find new business in new markets, if it's not in your current one. Like I'm just curious, what you're doing now in and the money you're spending there and the success you're having, like is there an ability to scale that to markets that are not currently using it? And I guess the other side of this, the people in that IT sector that are running full tilt it to meet demand now, like how do you prepare them for times when it's not going to be growing 50% a year to make sure that the business kind of stays at high levels and when growth ultimately kind of starts to moderate?\nAdam Norwitt: Yes, Joe. I mean, look, excellent question. I mean, first, what you get to here with -- you're talking about kind of two sides here, how do you motivate people to get new business maybe when they don't have it? And how do you motivate people to keep working as hard as they do, knowing that maybe there can be always volatility? And I think that's really the Amphenolians way. I mean if you get to the essence of our culture of entrepreneurship, it really boils down to agility, reactivity, flexibility, which is kind of -- those are three words that kind of mean the same thing. I understand that. And that just means you always thinking about -- in a difficult time, you're planting seeds, you're aggressively going out there and finding ways to proliferate your technology into other applications. And there may be a multitude of ways of doing that. I mean I still remember anecdotally, the folks in our business who worked in oil and gas at the time when the price of oil dropped by 60%, 70% from like more than $100 down to $40, and they realized that they weren't necessarily just selling oil and gas connectors, they were selling really high-voltage, high-power products that went into ultra-harsh environment. So, how do you go and find a new application for those ultra-high-voltage, ultra harsh environment products that may not be oil and gas. And then lo and behold, you do that work for some time, you may be develop some new opportunities for those technologies and along comes that market recovering once again. And now you've got a more stable base, kind of a second or third leg of the stool. By the same token, when you're in a really strong market and there's no doubt about it. I mean, our folks working in IT datacom, they grew 60% on a year-over-year basis. We have individual operations that grew by a heck of a lot more than that, you can imagine. This is hard, hard work. I mean I just -- I said it earlier in my prepared remarks, but I cannot commend enough our folks working around the world on these products and the sacrifices that they have made personally, weekends, nights, travel, missing family events and the like. I mean it is -- it's humbling to me, let me tell you, to just bear witness to what these folks have done and thereby, achieved and which -- I get to talk about just some numbers here, but these guys have put their heart and soul into the matter. But everybody in Amphenol, regardless of where they are, they're always putting one foot on the gas and on one the brake. They're thinking with each investment, what if this goes down, what is inevitably there is a cycle? And they're managing their business accordingly. So, that one day, when there is a cycle. I mean, we're a diversified company. We've been around for 92 years. We know that business goes in cycles. And it's our job to maximize our business on the -- when those cycles are strong and to moderate the impact when those cycles are not strong. And I think we've demonstrated that over a couple of decades through every cycle, whether those are big cataclysmic cycles like the global financial crisis, the Internet bubble burst in COVID, where we've moderated the impact of this on the downside. Our margins dropping just 300 basis points peak to trough in each of those cycle. And we've also done it in those little cycles across businesses, the best example being our mobile devices' team who probably deals with the cycle three times a year. I mean they are, every quarter, having one of these cycles, growing massively. I mean, look, they grew by 38% sequentially in our mobile devices team from Q2 to Q3. And probably in Q1, they're going to go down by a decent amount at that time. And so there's no doubt about it. And the IT datacom team, this team who is working on AI, they have also gone through their own cycles, whether it was before COVID, coming out of COVID when we saw a flood of demand so that people could communicate with their families and relatives, and all of and all of this -- the stuff that happened through the building of the Internet and thereby, the kind of inventory that was built up thereafter. And so I'm very confident in our team that not only are they going to maximize their performance here. But when inevitably a cycle comes and I'm certainly not going to be the one to pick when that cycle will be, we'll be ready for it as Amphenolians always have been.\nOperator: Thank you. And that was our last question. I will turn it back to Mr. Norwitt for any closing remarks.\nAdam Norwitt: Well, thank you very much to all. And I'm really grateful to have all of you on the phone here today, and I wish that you have a great finish to the year. And hard to say it, but we'll talk to you all in 2025. Thank you.\nCraig Lampo: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you for attending today's conference, and have a nice day.",

            "name": "Craig Lampo",
            "content": "Thank you very much. Good afternoon, everyone. This is Craig Lampo, Amphenol's CFO; and I'm here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO. We would like to welcome you to our third quarter 2024 conference call. Our third quarter results were released this morning and I will provide some financial commentary, and then Adam will give an overview of the business and current market trends. And then, of course, we will take questions. As a reminder, during the call, we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures and make certain forward-looking statements, so please refer to the relevant disclosures in our press release for further information. In addition, as a result of our previously announced two-for-one stock split completed in June of this year, all share and per share data discussed on this earnings call is on a split-adjusted basis. The company closed the third quarter of 2024 with record sales of $4.39 billion and record GAAP and adjusted diluted EPS of $0.48 and $0.50, respectively. Third quarter sales were up 26% in US dollars in local currencies and 15% organically compared to the third quarter of 2023. Sequentially, sales were up 12% in US dollars, 11% in local currencies and 8% organically. Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes. Orders in the quarter were a record $4.412 billion, up 39% compared to the prior year and up 9% sequentially, resulting in a strong book-to-bill ratio of 1.09:1. GAAP operating income was $819 million and included $64 million of acquisition-related costs in the quarter, primarily related to CIT. GAAP operating margin was 20.3%. Excluding these costs, adjusted operating income was $883 million, resulting in a record adjusted operating margin of 21.9% in the third quarter of 2024. On an adjusted basis, operating margin increased by 110 basis points from the prior year quarter and 60 basis points sequentially. The year-over-year increase in adjusted operating margin was primarily driven by strong operating leverage on higher sales volumes, which was partially offset by the dilutive impact of acquisitions completed in the prior 12 months. On a sequential basis, the increase in adjusted operating margin reflected strong conversion on the higher sales levels, partially offset by the dilutive impact of acquisitions, in particular, CIT, which closed during the second quarter. I am very proud of the company's operating margin performance in the third quarter, which reflects continued strong execution by our teams. Breaking down the third quarter results by segment compared to the third quarter of 2023, sales in the Harsh Environment Solutions segment were $1.194 billion and increased by 35% in US dollars and 3% organically, and segment operating margin was 23.8%. Sales in the Communications Solutions segment were $1.685 billion and increased by 32% in US dollars and 30% organically, and segment operating margin was 25.6%. And sales in the Interconnect and Sensor Systems segment was $1.160 billion, an increased by 12% in US dollars and 6% organically. Segment operating margin was 18.8%. The company's GAAP effective tax rate for the third quarter was 21.4%, and the adjusted effective tax rate was 24%, which compared to 18.2% and 24% in the third quarter of 2023. GAAP Diluted EPS was a record $0.48 in the third quarter, up 17% compared to the prior year period, and on an adjusted basis, diluted EPS increased 28% to a record $0.50 compared to $0.39 in the third quarter of 2023. Operating cash flow in the third quarter was $704 million or 117% of net income. And net of capital spending, our free cash flow was $476 million or 79% of net income. And as expected, our capital spending was somewhat elevated in the quarter due to investments we are making support the strong growth we are seeing in IT datacom and defense markets. In the fourth quarter, we expect to continue to have somewhat elevated levels of capital spending to further support our growth in these markets. From a working capital standpoint, inventory days, days sales outstanding and payable days were 87, 69 and 59 days, respectively, all within normal levels. During the quarter, the company repurchased 2.7 million shares of common stock at an average price of approximately $65, and when combined with our normal quarterly dividend, total capital returned to our shareholders in the third quarter of 2024 was $308 million. Total debt on September 30 was $5.5 billion, and net debt was $3.9 billion, and total liquidity at the end of the quarter was $4.6 billion, which included cash and short-term investments on hand of $1.6 billion, plus availability under our existing credit facilities. In addition, we expect quarterly interest expense net of interest income earned on cash on hand to be approximately $45 million in the fourth quarter of 2024. Excluding acquisition-related costs, third quarter 2024 EBITDA was $1.30 billion. And at the end of the third quarter of 2024, net leverage ratio was 1.0 times. I will now turn the call over to Adam, who will provide some commentary on current market trends. Yeah. Thanks, Asiya. So if you think about kind of our capital spend, we talked about this last quarter a bit, and we said we would expect to be kind of elevated for certainly the next couple of quarters being this quarter. And I just kind of reiterated that here in the fourth quarter, we expect to be kind of a little bit elevated levels to drive this and support the significant growth we're seeing in both IT datacom, as well as, to a certain extent, to the defense market as well. I mean we're not giving guidance yet for next year, so I'm not going to necessarily comment specifically on what we expect for capital spend for 2025. But we do certainly continue to target kind of that 3% to 4% of sales from a capital perspective. I think nothing structurally has changed over kind of the mid- or long-term from our expectation of capital spend to kind of maintain our business going forward. Certainly, in years, we're going to see strong growth such as 2024 here, and certainly in other years, we tend to be kind of at the higher end of that range in years that we see kind lower growth, yes, I would expect to be kind of more in the middle of that range or so. So I think that that's how we expect our capital at this point. Certainly, we'll talk about 2025 more specifically, if we see elevated levels as we enter the year next year. Yes. Thanks, Mark. We're really, really proud of our operating margins here in the third quarter. I mean, this year, we really have done a great job of really execution, and this really goes without saying here in the third quarter. The CIT margins, I would say, ultimately, we're not going to talk so much specifically about their margins. But I would say, they're still on their journey. That really wasn't a strong contributor here in the third quarter to the margin improvement, really, the margin improvement here was just the execution of the team and the ability for team to really just maximize the profitability on the strong growth that we've seen. And I think that as we go forward, we talk about this 25% conversion margin. We've done clearly better than that recently. I still think, over the long-term, 25% is kind of the way we kind of think about things, but the team really has been executing very well on this the strong growth that we've seen over the recent quarters. And I would expect as we continue to grow, we'll continue to be able to kind of execute well and increase those margins as we grow. As it relates to how long it's going to take us to kind of get CIT at the company average, we're not going to really talk about so much how long exactly we think, but we're certainly very happy with the progress so far. And certainly, I would say, today, even versus 90 days ago, I would say, I'm even more optimistic that, ultimately, that CIT will get to the company average. But this is just a great team. They're extremely motivated. They're excited to be part of Amphenol. And I think they're really making some great strides to take the steps they need to get those really great goals. Thank you very much."

            "name": "Adam Norwitt",
            "content": "Well, thank you very much, Craig, and thank you all for joining our call here on a very beautiful fall day in Wallingford, Connecticut. And I hope that all of you are enjoying a very nice fall so far. As Craig mentioned, I'm going to highlight our achievements here in the third quarter. And in particular, we'll discuss the trends and progress across our served markets. And then I'll comment on our outlook for the fourth quarter and the full year 2024, and of course, we'll have some time at the end for questions. Our results in the third quarter were really strong and actually stronger than expected and exceeding the high end of our guidance in sales and adjusted diluted earnings per share. Sales grew from prior year by a very strong 26% in US dollars and in local currencies, reaching a new record of $4.39 billion. We're very proud to have that new sales record. On an organic basis, our sales did increase by 15%, driven by growth in the IT datacom, mobile networks, mobile devices, commercial air and defense end markets, and I'll talk about those details in a few moments. The company also booked record orders of $4,412 billion, representing a robust book-to-bill of 1.09:1. This was also driven especially by continued strength in the IT datacom market. Our adjusted operating margins reached a new record, 21.9%, in the quarter, and this represented a 110-basis-point increase from last year's third quarter. Adjusted diluted EPS grew 28% from prior year to reach a new record, $0.50, in the third quarter. And then finally, we generated operating and free cash flow of $704 million and $476 million, respectively, in the quarter, and this is yet another clear demonstration of the high quality of the company's earnings. I just have to say, I'm extremely proud of the Amphenol team. Our results this quarter, once again, reflect the strength of our entrepreneurial organization as we continue to outperform in any environment. Now just here in early October, we're very pleased to have closed on the previously announced acquisition of Lutze Europe. Lutze is based in Germany with annual sales of approximately $100 million, and it's a leading provider of harsh environment cable and cable assembly solutions for diverse applications in the industrial markets. The Lutze Europe acquisition is a great complement to our broad offering of high-technology interconnect products for the worldwide industrial market. And together with Lutze US, it strengthens our range of value-add interconnect products for this very important market. In addition, we remain excited about the pending acquisition of the Andrew businesses from CommScope, and we now expect that transaction to close in the first quarter of 2025. We remain confident that our acquisition program will continue to create great value for Amphenol. Our ability to identify and execute upon acquisitions and then to successfully bring these new companies into the Amphenol family remains a core competitive advantage for the company. Now turning to our served markets. We're once again pleased that the company's end market exposure remains highly diversified, balanced and broad. Now this diversification, no question, continues to create great value for Amphenol because it enables us to participate across all areas of the global electronics industry, while not being disproportionately exposed to the volatility of any given market or application. Now starting out with the defense market, it represented 11% of our sales in the quarter, and sales grew from prior year by a strong 16% in US dollars and 8% organically. This was driven by growth across really most segments of the defense market with contributions, especially from space, aircraft and avionics, communications and ground vehicle applications. Sequentially, our sales grew by 4%, which was in line with our expectations coming into the quarter. As we now look into the fourth quarter, we expect sales in the defense market to increase moderately from these third quarter levels. And for the full year 2024, we expect a mid-teens increase in sales. We remain encouraged by the company's strengthening position in the defense market, where we continue to offer the industry's widest range of high-technology interconnect products. Amidst the current dynamic geopolitical environment, countries around the world are expanding their spending on both current and next-generation defense technologies. With our investments in the development of a broad array of new products, as well as, very importantly, the capacities to build those products, we're well positioned to capitalize on this long-term demand potential. The commercial air market represented 6% of our sales in the quarter, and we had another strong quarter in commercial air with sales increasing by 123% from prior year in US dollars and 12% organically, as we benefited from the addition of CIT, which we closed back in the second quarter, as well as continued progress in expanding our content on next-generation commercial aircraft. Compared to the second quarter, sales increased by 37% sequentially, and were up slightly on an organic basis, and this was modestly lower than our expectations coming into the quarter. Looking to the fourth quarter, we expect a high single-digit increase in sales. And for the full year 2024, we expect sales to increase by more than 80% from last year, driven by the addition of CIT, as well as robust organic growth. I'm truly proud of our team working in the commercial air market. With the ongoing growth in demand for jet liners, our efforts to strengthen our product offering, while diversifying our market position into next-generation aircraft are paying real dividends. We continue to see great long-term opportunities for the expansion of our technology offering into this important market, and look forward to realizing the benefits of our growth initiatives for many years to come. The industrial market represented 23% of our sales in the quarter. And sales in the quarter grew by 24% in US dollars from prior year, as we benefited from acquisitions. On an organic basis, our sales were flat, as growth in alternative energy, instrumentation, medical and rail mass transit solutions was offset by reduced demand in factory automation, heavy equipment, transportation and oil and gas. Sequentially, our sales did increase by 9% and from the second quarter and were up by 3% organically, which was somewhat better than our expectations coming into the quarter. While we are encouraged to see stronger growth in North America and Asia, demand in Europe did again slowed this quarter. Accordingly, looking into the fourth quarter, we do expect sales to moderate from these third quarter levels. And for the full year 2024, we expect sales to grow in the low double digits, with the benefit of acquisitions partially offset by an organic moderation of sales. With the additions this year of CIT and L\u00dcTZE, we now have an even broader range of products and capabilities to offer customers across the diversified industrial market. I'm confident that our long-term strategy to expand our high-technology interconnect antenna and sensor offerings, both organically and through complementary acquisitions, has positioned us to capitalize on the many electronic revolutions that will no doubt continue to occur across the industrial market. And this creates exciting opportunities for outstanding teams working around the world. The automotive market represented 19% of our sales in the quarter, and sales grew by 4% in US dollars and were flat organically. Similar to the industrial market, while we did grow in North America and Asia in the automotive market, our sales in Europe declined from prior year. Sequentially, our sales increased by 4% from the second quarter, which was a bit better than our expectations coming into Q3. For the fourth quarter, we expect sales to decline modestly from these third quarter levels. And for the full year 2024, we expect sales to increase in the mid-single-digit range compared to prior year. I remain proud of our team working in the automotive market. While there are some areas of the automotive market that have shown some signs of slowing, our team remains focused on driving new design wins with customers who are implementing a wide array of new technologies into their vehicles. These include electrified drivetrains as well as a multitude of other exciting applications, and we look forward to benefiting from our strong position in the automotive market for many years to come. The mobile devices market represented 10% of our sales in the quarter. Sales increased by 18% in U.S. dollars and 17% organically, and this was really driven by broad-based strength across applications in the mobile devices market. Sequentially, our sales increased by a much stronger-than-expected 38% and that was driven also by higher sales across all segments of the mobile devices market. Looking to the fourth quarter, we expect our sales to remain at these higher levels. And for the full year, we anticipate sales to be up in the high single-digit range compared to 2023. I'm very proud of our team working in the always dynamic mobile devices market as their agility and reactivity have once again enabled us to capture incremental sales in the quarter. I'm confident that with our leading array of antennas, interconnect products and mechanisms designed in across a broad range of next-generation mobile devices, we are well positioned for the long-term. The mobile networks market represented 3% of our sales in the quarter, and sales grew by a strong 22% in U.S. dollars and 19% organically, as we continue to see a recovery in demand from both mobile network operators as well as wireless equipment manufacturers. On a sequential basis, our sales increased by 1%, which was a bit better than our expectations coming into the quarter. For the fourth quarter, we now expect sales to decline seasonally in the mid-teens. And for the full year, we anticipate sales to grow in the high single-digit range versus last year. We're encouraged by the recent strengthening in the mobile networks market. As operators ramp up their investments in next-generation systems, our team remains focused on realizing the benefits of our long-term efforts to expand our position in next-generation equipment and networks around the world. With the pending acquisition of the Andrew businesses from CommScope, we look forward to participating even more strongly in these networks for many years to come. The IT datacom market represented 25% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in IT datacom grew in the quarter by a very strong 60% in U.S. dollars and 59% organically, and this was driven by the continued acceleration in demand for our products used in artificial intelligence applications, together with robust growth in our base IT datacom business. On a sequential basis, sales increased by 15% from the second quarter, substantially better than our expectations coming into the third -- coming into the quarter. As we look towards the fourth quarter, we do expect a further mid single-digit sequential increase from these third quarter levels. And for the full year 2024, we expect sales in IT datacom to grow by more than 50% compared to 2023. I have to say that we're more encouraged than ever by the company's position in the global IT datacom market. Our team who is just doing an amazing job around the world in securing future business on next-generation IT systems, particularly those enabling AI, there's no doubt that this revolution in AI has created a unique opportunity for the interconnect industry and for Amphenol given our leading high-speed and power interconnect products. Whether high-speed, power or fiber optic interconnect, our products are critical components in these next-generation networks, and this continues to create a long-term growth opportunity for Amphenol. Finally, the broadband market represented 3% of our sales in the quarter, and sales were down by 15% in US dollars and 14% organically as broadband operators continued to moderate their procurement levels. On a sequential basis, sales were down 3%, which was roughly in line with our expectations coming into the quarter. For the fourth quarter, we expect a further high single-digit reduction in sales, and for the full year 2024, we expect a mid-teens sales decline from prior year. Regardless of this current more muted demand environment, we remain encouraged by the company's position in the broadband market, and we look forward to continuing to support our service provider customers around the world, when they resume growing their investments to expand bandwidth and coverage to their enterprise and consumer customers. Now turning to our outlook and obviously, assuming the continuation of current market conditions as well as constant exchange rates. For the fourth quarter, we expect sales in the range of $3.950 billion to $4.50 billion and adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $0.48 to $0.50. This would represent a sales increase of 19% to 22%, and an adjusted diluted EPS increase of 17% to 22% compared to the fourth quarter of 2023. Our fourth quarter guidance represents an expectation for full year sales of $14.855 billion to $14.955 billion, as well as full year adjusted diluted EPS and of $1.82 to $1.84. This outlook would represent full year sales and adjusted EPS increases of 18% to 19% 21% to 22%, respectively. This has been a very strong year for Amphenol thus far in 2024 and I remain confident in the ability of our outstanding management team to adapt to the many opportunities and challenges in the current environment and to continue to grow our market position, while driving sustainable and strong profitability through this year and into the long term. And finally, I'd like to take this opportunity to thank our entire global team for their truly outstanding efforts here in the third quarter. There's no doubt that they worked extremely hard to deliver, especially this level of growth, and I'm truly grateful to them. And with that, operator, we'd be happy to take any questions. Good morning. Yeah. Well, Andrew, thanks so much for the question. Look, I think we did start last quarter being the second quarter to see a little bit of stronger performance. And I would tell you here in the third quarter, the underlying IT datacom, obviously, with the caveat that we -- it's not always exactly easy to tell what product goes into what application. But our best assessment of it is that the underlying IT datacom market did show actually very, very strong growth this quarter. Now I will tell you that roughly the AI -- the products that we sell into AI represented a bit more than half of our overall year-over-year growth and about the same in terms of sequential. So, very strong performance for anything related to AI. We have a very significant position in AI, as you know well, but we were encouraged, very encouraged to see that the underlying IT datacom demand has grown. And there's no doubt that there is today a real rush to equip data centers, enterprises, consumers, service providers with this next-generation compute power with all the switching that's associated with that and the like. And I think that is driving a bit of a recovery in these products in quite a significant way for us here in the quarter. Well, thanks so much, Luke. I mean a lot to unwrap there, but let me say this. I mean, I'm really proud of our team in automotive. I mean, on a year-to-date basis, we've just done a fabulous job of continuing to outperform and navigating what, as you term, is very much so a dynamic worldwide automotive market. And these dynamics are sort of multifaceted. There's the dynamic of drivetrain choice, and I'm not going to go down that rabbit hole, but for sure, the world is talking about this. There's also the dynamic of just overall demand in certain geographies and in particular, Europe, where it's been widely reported, and I'm probably not the first to say that there are some challenges in the overall European demand in automotive. And we see that on a related basis, I think in industrial. But what I'm really pleased with is, if you look this quarter, we did have still robust growth in Asia and North America on an organic basis on a year-over-year basis and that was offset in part at least by a moderation in Europe. So to your specific question about content and Amphenol continuing to outperform, we have every confidence that the momentum that we've had in gaining content, enabling new applications with our customers around the world, whether those be next-generation drivetrains, whether those be next-generation electronics in cars, connectivity, communications, antennas, sensors and the like, the breadth of the product offerings that we have, the capabilities to fulfill those offerings on a global basis, continues to put us in a very strong position with automotive OEMs, the world over. And our team just has to navigate those dynamics as they are. But the good news is, regardless of whether something is made in Europe, made in Asia, made in North America, regardless of whether something is a full electric vehicle, a hybrid or a full internal combustion engine, there is continuing to be a proliferation of electronics across all of those cars. And so it's up to us to make sure that we continue to drive our next-generation products into those platforms around the world. And I'm confident that our team is well positioned to do that. Yeah, Amit, thanks so much. I mean, look, we have really an outstanding breadth of offering into the IT datacom market and, in particular, into applications related to AI. And I think we've talked about this in the past. What's unique about AI is that we're working with customers throughout the entire stack of the chain. And that starts -- it starts with the people who have the money, and that's the web service providers. And there's only a limited universe of those, and we're very well-positioned with those companies. Through the OEMs, the people who outfit the data centers, the OEMs who make equipment to sell into those data centers all the way down to the chip companies who sometimes are creating designs and configurations of those things that are used. And I think that comprehensive aspect of our relationships has really served us well because it's not about an individual product, an individual program or whatever, it's about the collective efforts of the industry to build out artificial intelligence in kind of a big way. And I think that collective efforts are happening in so many different aspects. You have different types of chips being used, different architectures being used. But what ties them all together from an interconnect perspective is two things. They have to be high speed and low latency, and you've got to help them use less power. And those two things of the speed and latency on one side and the power efficiency on the other are where we come into play and we create value for our customers because we have the industry's leading high-speed products, the highest -- operating at the highest speed, the lowest latencies. We have industry's leading efficient power interconnect products, everything from power connectors, assemblies, bus bars and the like, everything that gets power all the way down to these power-hungry chips. And working on those complex architectures, as our engineers have done for many years, together with scaling out our capacity and capability on a global basis, so that we can meet this demand has really put us in a strong position with customers of the world over. And so I wouldn't get hung up on noise of one or another program or configuration, I would think much more about the overall opportunity that is here and the fact that we're, for sure, capturing more than our fair share of that. Yeah. Thanks very much, Samik. I mean look, we've talked in the past about the fact that the unique architecture of these neural network, machine learning, AI, whatever you want to call them, systems, is that you essentially have to create a very high-speed, low-latency mesh fabric so that the chips can all talk to each other. And that's -- and I am not an electrical engineer, the farthest thing from it. But I can tell you that it is unbelievable the type of interconnection requirements that are going on these -- in these systems. And that just means there is greater content and a greater role. I mean, we use this word content, but let me change that to talk about just the role that interconnect plays in the functioning of these systems. Because the role of the interconnect becomes really fundamental to whether these systems can operate. If the chips can't talk to each other at a high enough speed and at a enough low latency, then to go out and build a complex large language model or whatever other model you're trying to do, it just takes too long and the thing becomes obsolete before it's even completed. And so the ability to have these rapid calculations and comparisons and probabilities that come across these chips is, in many ways, dependent on the interconnect as a link to that. And thus, the content opportunity regardless of who makes what chip, regardless of how someone chooses to architect that, that content has gone up and will continue to go up. And we have a very strong position with customers, again, across that that stack I described earlier. Relative to copper and fiber, the good news for Amphenol is we're present in both, and we've made great acquisitions and been a strong innovator in fiber as well as in copper. But I think you also know very well that there are advantages to each. And when you think about power, you want to use copper as much as possible because optics has a much higher usage of power. And so the value that we can create for our customers is by stretching the capabilities of copper such that it can meet these ultra-high bandwidth demand. And that's something we've been doing for more than two decades. When I think back on the acquisition of Teradyne Connection Systems 19 years ago, that brought us into a leadership position of high-speed over copper. Back then, we were talking about things like five gigabits as being kind of an aspirational or 10 gigabits as an aspirational speed over copper. Today, we're achieving things like 200 and aspiring to 400 and 800, and who knows maybe beyond over copper. And that's the incredible value that you can create for customers by stretching the capabilities of copper through your engineering expertise. This is real value that you can create through engineering and technology, and I think our teams are doing that. Yes. Thanks very much, Joe. I mean look, relative to your first question on aerospace and strikes, I mean, look, we wish for all of our customers that they have peaceful relations with their workforce. And without commenting specifically on any customer, I'll tell you that our guidance always incorporates all the information that we have from our customers around the world, including within that market. In terms of the industrial green shoots, it's absolutely the case. The last quarter, we did talk about seeing some green shoots in industrial. And look, I mean, this quarter, we did see some sequential growth on an organic basis from prior quarter. But I will say that our view of the trends in Europe are probably a little more muted than maybe they were a quarter ago. I mean we're pleased with what we've seen in North America and Asia. We grew in industrial organically in both regions, both on a year-over-year basis and sequentially, but we've probably seen an incremental tick down in Europe. And what to look for there, I mean I think we'll have to watch. The automotive industry and the industrial -- the automotive market and industrial market in Europe are fairly tied at the hip as you know well. You have a lot of factory automation and machine tool industries and the like, which are somewhat dependent on the investment cycles that come from the automakers, who are such a big component of the European economy. And so I think we'll have to watch that and see how it proceeds. But look, in our organization, I mean, not to be cavalier about this, but like it is what it is. Like we -- our team is very used to this scenario where you tighten your belt and you put your head up high and got and take some business. And so to the extent that there is, in Europe, a moderation in these -- in a place like industrial and automotive, our team know how to deal with that. We've got a playbook. And to the extent that there are opportunities in other geographies, we'll work to capitalize upon those and take more than our fair share as they come along. Thank you, Guy. Yes. Well, thanks very much. I mean, look, we never thought there were going to be any meaningful antitrust issues, but we knew that there would be a lot of filings to be done, because Andrew operates on a global basis in lots of different geographies. And you never know how long those things can take. And I think we're just encouraged by how the process is going and that gives us really the confidence to think that it's going be sometime in the first quarter as opposed to in the first half. But we -- again, just to reiterate, we never thought there were any substantive antitrust issues, but there's always a process to do. Yeah. Well, thanks very much, Steve. I will punt a little bit on your last part of your question, because I'm not very good at forecasting mobile devices even in one quarter, let alone the next several quarters. But let me do this, our team working in mobile devices has still done a fabulous job again this year. I mean, this is such a phenomenal organization. And you think about the technologies that we're working in, things like connectors, obviously, antennas, obviously, the mechanisms that we participate in. And there's no doubt that the content in many of these products, the breadth of content continues to expand. And if I think back on a phrase that I've used for many, many years, probably almost entirety my nearly 16 years here doing these calls as CEO. It's that when the hardware creates value for the customers, then our products can create value for our customers. And there's no question that you see continued innovations in the things themselves and the devices and those ultimately result in just really, really beautiful products that are coming out. And our team is helping to make those beautiful products. And the more functionality that comes into them, the more opportunity there is ultimately for us. Now look, all of that is with the caveat to tell you that this is a very fickle dynamic volatile market. And so we're guiding the market here in the fourth quarter to stay at these pretty robust levels that we achieved in the third quarter. And hopefully, I'll be right about that, but time has told that I'm usually not spot on in even guiding in a 90-day period on mobile devices. But there is no doubt. I mean -- and maybe I'm a power user of these mobile devices. I mean, I have them sitting all around me at all times. I use them constantly. We have learned, I think, the extraordinary things that you can do with mobile devices and what used to be just a phone becomes a tablet, a wearable, hearable device. The line gets blurred between all of these things, but ultimately, they allow you to communicate and to be productive. And I think that our customers continue to push the limits of that that productivity and communication such that consumers ultimately want to buy the product. So I think that's where we stand today. Next year, who knows what it's going to be, Steve, we still see. Yeah. I mean we don't really talk about organic orders, like if you're talking about order growth or something like this. I mean, our book-to-bill is what it is because we acquire a company and they have bookings greater than their revenues, that's still organic book-to-bill, and I think our strong book-to-bill is a total reflection of the companies that we own, not being on prior to being part of Amphenol. Yes. Well, thanks very much, Wamsi. I appreciate the question. Look, I have mentioned, I think, last quarter, and I'll reiterate it again this quarter that these are very strong books book-to-bill. And in particular, we see those strong books-to-bill in IT datacom first and probably defense and comm air to a somewhat lesser extent. And there's no doubt that we have seen a bit of the order aperture opening. And I would actually relate that also to the fact that we're spending more on capital spending. And Craig already talked about CapEx. And you can imagine, when we think about spending a little bit more than we're used to on capital that we work with customers to make sure that we have assurance that, that capital is going to be used, and that assurance often comes in the form of orders. It can also come in the form of contributions or guarantees. And so there's some extent of that order aperture that's a little bit longer that is there to give us the comfort and security that we'll be making those investments, which may be more significant than is typical. In terms of how far out, I mean, look, we'll never book anything -- we don't record any booking that's more than a year out in our numbers. That's a sort of even an accounting rule some sort internally. But the vast majority of our orders would be fulfilled within a couple of quarters. And I can't tell you are there some of those that poke out into three quarters out occasionally, that could be on an occasional basis. But I would say the vast majority would be within a couple of quarters. Yes, Joe. I mean, look, excellent question. I mean, first, what you get to here with -- you're talking about kind of two sides here, how do you motivate people to get new business maybe when they don't have it? And how do you motivate people to keep working as hard as they do, knowing that maybe there can be always volatility? And I think that's really the Amphenolians way. I mean if you get to the essence of our culture of entrepreneurship, it really boils down to agility, reactivity, flexibility, which is kind of -- those are three words that kind of mean the same thing. I understand that. And that just means you always thinking about -- in a difficult time, you're planting seeds, you're aggressively going out there and finding ways to proliferate your technology into other applications. And there may be a multitude of ways of doing that. I mean I still remember anecdotally, the folks in our business who worked in oil and gas at the time when the price of oil dropped by 60%, 70% from like more than $100 down to $40, and they realized that they weren't necessarily just selling oil and gas connectors, they were selling really high-voltage, high-power products that went into ultra-harsh environment. So, how do you go and find a new application for those ultra-high-voltage, ultra harsh environment products that may not be oil and gas. And then lo and behold, you do that work for some time, you may be develop some new opportunities for those technologies and along comes that market recovering once again. And now you've got a more stable base, kind of a second or third leg of the stool. By the same token, when you're in a really strong market and there's no doubt about it. I mean, our folks working in IT datacom, they grew 60% on a year-over-year basis. We have individual operations that grew by a heck of a lot more than that, you can imagine. This is hard, hard work. I mean I just -- I said it earlier in my prepared remarks, but I cannot commend enough our folks working around the world on these products and the sacrifices that they have made personally, weekends, nights, travel, missing family events and the like. I mean it is -- it's humbling to me, let me tell you, to just bear witness to what these folks have done and thereby, achieved and which -- I get to talk about just some numbers here, but these guys have put their heart and soul into the matter. But everybody in Amphenol, regardless of where they are, they're always putting one foot on the gas and on one the brake. They're thinking with each investment, what if this goes down, what is inevitably there is a cycle? And they're managing their business accordingly. So, that one day, when there is a cycle. I mean, we're a diversified company. We've been around for 92 years. We know that business goes in cycles. And it's our job to maximize our business on the -- when those cycles are strong and to moderate the impact when those cycles are not strong. And I think we've demonstrated that over a couple of decades through every cycle, whether those are big cataclysmic cycles like the global financial crisis, the Internet bubble burst in COVID, where we've moderated the impact of this on the downside. Our margins dropping just 300 basis points peak to trough in each of those cycle. And we've also done it in those little cycles across businesses, the best example being our mobile devices' team who probably deals with the cycle three times a year. I mean they are, every quarter, having one of these cycles, growing massively. I mean, look, they grew by 38% sequentially in our mobile devices team from Q2 to Q3. And probably in Q1, they're going to go down by a decent amount at that time. And so there's no doubt about it. And the IT datacom team, this team who is working on AI, they have also gone through their own cycles, whether it was before COVID, coming out of COVID when we saw a flood of demand so that people could communicate with their families and relatives, and all of and all of this -- the stuff that happened through the building of the Internet and thereby, the kind of inventory that was built up thereafter. And so I'm very confident in our team that not only are they going to maximize their performance here. But when inevitably a cycle comes and I'm certainly not going to be the one to pick when that cycle will be, we'll be ready for it as Amphenolians always have been. Well, thank you very much to all. And I'm really grateful to have all of you on the phone here today, and I wish that you have a great finish to the year. And hard to say it, but we'll talk to you all in 2025. Thank you."

        "content": "Operator: Hello, and welcome to the Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call for Amphenol Corporation. Following today's presentation, there will be a formal question-and-answer session. Until then, all lines will remain in a listen-only mode. At the request of the company, today's conference is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to introduce today's conference host, Mr. Craig Lampo. Sir you may begin.\nCraig Lampo: Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. This is Craig Lampo, Amphenol's CFO, and I'm here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO. We would like to welcome you to our second quarter 2024 conference call. Our second quarter 2024 results were released this morning. I will provide some financial commentary and then Adam will give an overview of the business and current market trends and then we will take questions. As a reminder, during the call we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures and make certain forward-looking statements, so please refer to the relevant disclosures in our press release for further information. In addition as a result of our recently announced two-for-one stock split effective on June 11, 2024 all share and per share data discussed on this earnings call is on a split-adjusted basis. The company closed the second quarter with record sales of $3.610 billion and GAAP and record adjusted diluted EPS of $0.41 and $0.44, respectively. Second quarter sales were up 18% in US dollars, 19% local currencies, and 11% organically compared to the second quarter of 2023. Sequentially sales were up 11% in US dollars and in local currencies and up 8% organically. Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes. Orders in the quarter were a record $4.061 billion, up 33% to the prior year and up 21% sequentially resulting in a strong book-to-bill ratio of 1.12:1. GAAP operating income and operating margin were $699 million and 19.4%, respectively, which included $70 million of acquisition related costs primarily associated with the CIT acquisition. Excluding these costs, adjusted operating income was $769 million resulting in a record adjusted operating margin of 21.3% in the second quarter of 2024. On an adjusted basis operating margin increased by 90 basis points from the prior year quarter and 30 basis points sequentially. The year-over-year increase in adjusted operating margin was primarily driven by strong operating leverage on higher sales volumes, which was partially offset by the dilutive impact of acquisitions completed in the prior 12 months. On a sequential basis, the modest increase in adjusted operating margin reflected a strong conversion on the higher sales levels partially offset by the dilutive impact of acquisitions made in the second quarter particularly CIT, which is currently operating well-below the company's average profitability levels. We are very proud of the company's operating margin performance in the second quarter, which reflects continued strong execution by our teams. Breaking down second quarter results by segment compared to the second quarter of 2023. Sales in the Harsh Environment Solutions segment were $1.046 billion, an increased by 18% in US dollars and 1% organically and segment operating margin was 24.8%. Sales in the Communications Solutions segment were $1.445 billion and increased by 24% in US dollars and 23% organically segment operating margin was 24.3%. Sales in the Interconnect and Sensor Systems segment were $1.119 billion, an increased by 12% in US dollars and 7% organically and segment operating margin was 18.2%. The company's GAAP effective tax rate for the second quarter was 20.4% and the adjusted effective tax rate was 24%, which compared to 21.9% and 24% in the second quarter of 2023 respectively. We continue to expect our adjusted effective tax rate to be at 24% in the third quarter and for the full year of 2024. GAAP adjusted EPS was $0.41 in the second quarter, up 11% compared to the prior year period. And on an adjusted basis, diluted EPS increased 22% to a record $0.44 compared to $0.36 in the second quarter of 2023. Operating cash flow in the second quarter was $664 million or 120% of adjusted net income and net of capital spending our free cash flow was $528 million or 95% of adjusted net income. We are pleased to have continued to deliver a strong cash flow yield in the quarter despite our slightly increased levels of CapEx. I would note that while our second quarter capital spending was higher than the first quarter, it was still within our normal range. We continue to expect somewhat elevated levels of capital spending in the coming couple of quarters as we invest to support the growth we are seeing in the defense and IT datacom markets. From a working capital standpoint, inventory days, days sales outstanding and payable days were 84, 69 and 56 days respectively, all within normal levels. During the quarter, the company repurchased 3.1 million shares of common stock at an average price of approximately $62. When combined with our normal quarterly dividend total capital return to shareholders in the second quarter of 2024 was more than $320 million. Total debt at June 30 was $5.4 billion and net debt was $4.1 billion and total liquidity at the end of the quarter was $4.3 billion, which included cash and sort of investments on hand of $1.3 billion plus availability under our existing credit facilities. Excluding acquisition-related costs second quarter 2024 EBITDA was $900 million and at the end of the second quarter of 2024 our net leverage ratio was 1.2 times. As a result of the $1.5 billion US bond offerings completed earlier in the second quarter and the subsequent closing of CIT in May, we expect quarterly interest expense net of interest income earned on cash on hand to be approximately $45 million in the third quarter. The company is in a very strong financial position and we continue to be well-positioned to fund future opportunities as they arise. In particular, we are well positioned to fund the pending acquisition of the own and DAS businesses of CommScope for a purchase price of $2.1 billion, which we expect to close by the end of the first half of 2025. We will fund this acquisition through cash on hand and debt. Finally, as mentioned in today's earnings release, the company's Board of Directors has approved a 50% increase in the company's quarterly dividend to $0.165 per share, effective preferred payments beginning in October of 2024. I will now turn it over to Adam, who will provide some commentary on current market trends.\nAdam Norwitt: Well, thank you very much, Craig, and I'd like to extend my welcome to all of you here on the phone today. And I hope that you and your family friends and colleagues are enjoying a very nice summer so far. As Craig mentioned, I'm going to highlight a few of our achievements in the second quarter. I will spend the few moments to review our recently closed and announced acquisitions. I'll talk about our trends and progress across our served markets, and then we'll make some comments on our outlook for the third quarter. And of course, we'll have some time for questions at the end. Our results in the second quarter were stronger than expected exceeding the high end of our guidance in sales and adjusted diluted earnings per share. Sales grew from prior year by 18% in US dollars and 19% in local currencies, reaching a new record $3.61 billion. On an organic basis, sales increased by a strong 11% with growth in IT datacom, defense, commercial air, mobile networks, mobile devices and automotive, only slightly offset by moderations in the broadband and industrial markets. Importantly, the company booked record orders of $4.061 billion, representing a robust book-to-bill of 1.12:1. I would just note here that, our bookings were particularly strong from IT datacom customers focused on artificial intelligence or AI. Adjusted operating margins reached a record 21.3% in the second quarter, a strong 90 basis point increase from last year's second quarter. And adjusted diluted EPS grew 22% from prior year to a record $0.44. We also generated strong operating and free cash flow in the quarter of $664 million and $528 million, respectively, both clear demonstrations of the high quality of the company's earnings. And finally, as Craig mentioned, we announced this morning a 50% increase in the company's quarterly dividend to $0.165 per share, effective with our October dividend payment. Just want to say how proud I am of our team here this quarter as the results that they drove once again reflect the strength of our entrepreneurial organization as we continue to perform well amidst a very dynamic environment. As you know, our M&A team has once again been very busy of late. I'm very pleased to announce that on May 21, we closed the previously announced acquisition of CIT, previously called Carlisle Interconnect Technologies. I'm very excited to welcome the talented CIT team to the Amphenol family, and we really look forward to realizing the benefits of the combined breadth of our company's highly complementary product solutions, which will enable us to offer our customers an expanded array of innovative technologies across the important commercial air defense and industrial markets. In addition, we're pleased to have signed a definitive agreement to acquire Lutze. Lutze is a leading provider of harsh environment cable and cable assembly solutions for high-technology applications in the industrial markets. This acquisition includes two businesses, Lutze US based in North Carolina and Lutze Europe based in Germany. In May, we did close on the acquisition of Lutze U.S., which has annual sales of approximately $75 million. And we expect to close on Lutze Europe, which has annual sales of approximately $100 million, by the end of the third quarter of 2024. That's this quarter here. The Lutze acquisition is a great complement to our broad offering of high-technology interconnect products for the worldwide industrial market and, in particular, strengthens our range of value-add interconnect products. Finally, just last week, we announced an agreement to acquire the mobile networks-related businesses of CommScope for a purchase price of $2.1 billion. We're really excited to be acquiring CommScope's Outdoor Wireless Networks or OWN and Distributed Antenna Systems or DAS businesses. These businesses provide exciting mobile network solutions with advanced technologies in the areas of base station antennas and related interconnect solutions as well as distributed antenna systems. I just want to mention that, we're especially encouraged that the businesses that we're acquiring really make up the former Andrew Corporation portfolio of products, a company with a rich history of innovation and technology in the wireless industry. These businesses are expected to generate revenues of approximately $1.2 billion with EBITDA margins of approximately 25% in 2024. This represents operating margins in the high teens, including our current estimate of post acquisition-related amortization. We really look forward to supporting customers who are developing next-generation wireless networks around the world, with these advanced solutions, as well as with our own existing complementary interconnect products. Most importantly, we look forward to welcoming the approximately 4,000 employees of these businesses around the world. There's no doubt in my mind that these talented individuals will make great future Amphenolians. As we welcome these outstanding new teams to Amphenol, and we look forward to the future closings of Lutze Europe and CommScope OWN and DAS, we remain confident that Amphenol's acquisition program will continue to create great value for the company. Our ability to identify and execute upon acquisitions and successfully bring these new companies into Amphenol, remains a core competitive advantage for the company. Now turning to our trends across our served markets, I would just comment that we're very pleased that the company's end market exposure remains highly diversified balanced and broad. This diversification continues to create great value for Amphenol, enabling us to participate across all areas of the global electronics industry, while not being disproportionately exposed to the risks associated with any given market or application. So with that said, the defense market represented 11% of our sales in the quarter Sales in this market grew from prior year by a strong 14% in US dollars and 10% organically, driven by broad-based growth across most segments within the defense market. Sequentially, our sales increased by 9%, which was a bit better than our expectations coming into the quarter, driven in part by the earlier-than-anticipated closing of CIT. Looking to the third quarter, we expect sales to increase in the mid-single-digit range from the second quarter levels, including the benefit of acquisitions. And we remain encouraged by the company's strengthened position in the defense market, where we continue to offer the industry's widest range of high-technology interconnect products. Amidst today's highly dynamic geopolitical environment, countries around the world are expanding their investments in both current and next-generation defense technologies, thereby increasing the long-term demand potential for Amphenol. With the addition now of CIT's highly complementary products to our portfolio, we're better positioned than ever to support our customers with new products and the capacity to supply them wherever they may be needed. The commercial aerospace market represented 5% of our sales in the quarter. We had another strong quarter with sales increasing by a robust 60% in US dollars and 9% organically from prior year, as we benefited from the addition of CIT during the quarter, as well as continued progress in expanding our content on next-generation commercial aircraft. Sequentially, our sales grew by 46% in US dollars from the first quarter, as we benefited from the addition of CIT. On an organic basis, our sales were flat sequentially which was a bit better than we had anticipated coming into the quarter. Looking into the third quarter, we expect sales to increase in the mid-40% range as we benefit particularly from a full quarter of CIT sales. I'm truly proud of our team working in the commercial air market. Now with the addition of CIT, we offer the broadest range of high-technology interconnect products to our customers in this important area. With the ongoing growth in travel and thus the demand for jet liners, our efforts to strengthen our product offering while diversifying our market position into next-generation aircraft are paying real dividends. We continue to see great long-term opportunities for expansion of our technology offering to this important market and look forward to realizing the benefits of our growth initiatives for many years to come. The industrial market represented 24% of our sales in the quarter and sales in the second quarter did grow 9% in US dollars from prior year, as we benefited from acquisitions. On an organic basis, sales declined by 5%, as we saw moderations in most segments on a year-over-year basis of the industrial market. Sequentially, sales grew by a better-than-expected 7% from the first quarter, driven primarily by acquisitions but our organic sales were up slightly on a sequential basis. Looking at the third quarter, we expect sales to grow in the mid-single-digit range sequentially, driven by the benefit of our recent acquisitions. While the industrial market certainly has been experiencing a pause as customers and distributors have adjusted their demand levels, we are encouraged to see some early signs of momentum growing in certain areas of the industrial market. In addition, with the additions this quarter of CIT and Lutze US, we now have an ever broaden \u2013 an even broader range of products and capabilities to offer customers across the diversified industrial market. I'm confident that our long-term strategy to expand our high-technology interconnect antenna and sensor offerings both organically and through complementary acquisitions has positioned us to capitalize on the many electronic revolutions that will no doubt continue to occur across the industrial market. This creates opportunities long-term for our outstanding team working in this market. The automotive market represented 21% of our sales in the quarter and sales grew 6% in US dollars and 5% organically, driven by strength across newer automotive applications. Sequentially, our sales moderated by 4% from the first quarter, which was in line with our expectations coming into the quarter. I would note that we did see some incremental softening of demand in Europe in the quarter. As vehicle manufacturers there moderated their production volumes and that was offset by a more favorable performance in North America and Asia. For the third quarter, we do expect sales to be slightly down from these levels, as certain automakers have slowed their summer production schedules. I'm truly proud of our team working in the automotive market. Our continued outperformance is yet another confirmation of the benefit of our team's focus on driving new design wins with customers who are implementing a wide array of new technologies into their vehicles. And this includes electrified drivetrains as well as a multitude of other exciting applications. We look forward to benefiting from our strong position in the automotive market for many years to come. The mobile devices market represented 8% of our sales in the quarter and sales grew by 6% in US dollars and 7% organically as strength in smartphones and wearables more than offset moderations in sales related to laptops. Sequentially, our sales increased by 9% which was much better than our expectations for a mid-single-digit decline and we really did see sequential growth across all segments of the mobile devices market, which was encouraging. Looking into the third quarter, we anticipate sales to increase by approximately 20% from the second quarter levels, as customers prepare for year-end new product launches. While mobile devices will always remain Amphenol's most volatile of end markets, our outstanding and agile team remains well positioned to capture any opportunities for incremental sales that may arise in 2024 and beyond. Our leading array of antennas interconnect products and mechanisms continues to enable a broad range of next-generation mobile devices, thereby positioning us well for the long term. The mobile networks market represented 4% of our sales in the quarter and sales grew by 13% in US dollars and 7% organically, as we did see the beginning of a recovery in our sales to network operators and wireless equipment manufacturers after a number of quarters of demand moderation. Sequentially, sales in the quarter increased by a strong 22% which was much better than our expectations coming into the quarter. Looking to the third quarter, we do expect some moderation from the strong second quarter levels on traditional summer seasonality. We're encouraged by the recent strengthening in the mobile networks market, as operators ramp up their investments in next-generation systems. Our team remains focused on realizing the benefits of our long-term efforts to expand our position in next-generation equipment and networks around the world. Now with the pending acquisition of the OWN and DAS businesses from CommScope, we look forward to participating even more strongly in these next-generation networks for years to come. The IT datacom market represented 24% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in the second quarter grew by a very strong 57% in US dollars and 56% organically, driven by the continued acceleration in demand for our products used in next-generation AI data centers. While the vast majority of this growth did result from our expanding position in AI Interconnect, we were encouraged to also see some improvements in base IT datacom demand. On a sequential basis, sales increased by a strong 29% from the first quarter, substantially better than our expectations coming into Q2. Looking into the third quarter, we expect sales to grow modestly from these elevated second quarter levels. We're more encouraged than ever by the company's position in the global IT datacom market. Our team continues to do an outstanding job securing future business on next-generation IT systems, particularly those enabling AI. Indeed, the revolution in AI has created a unique opportunity for Amphenol. Given our leading high-speed and power interconnect products. With machine learning driving a more intensive usage of these highest technology of interconnect products, we're very well positioned for the future. And whether high-speed power or fiber optic interconnect our products are critical components in these next-generation networks and this creates a continued long-term growth opportunity for Amphenol. Finally, the broadband market represented 3% of our sales in the quarter and sales did decline by 17% in US dollars and organically from prior year, as broadband operators continued to reduce their procurement levels. On a sequential basis, sales were flat as we had anticipated. And looking into the third quarter, we expect a further moderation of sales sequentially. Regardless of this current muted demand environment, we do remain encouraged by the company's continued strong position in the broadband market, and we look forward to continuing to support our service provider customers around the world. As they eventually increase their spending to increase network coverage and bandwidth in support of the proliferation of high-speed data applications to homes and businesses. Now, turning to our outlook, and assuming the continuation of current market conditions as well as constant currency exchange rates. For the third quarter, we expect sales in the range of $3.7 billion to $3.8 billion and adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $0.43 to $0.45. This would represent sales growth of 16% to 19% and adjusted diluted EPS growth of 10% to 15%, compared to the third quarter of 2023. As is our usual practice, this guidance does not include acquisitions, which have not yet closed but does include CIT and Lutze US, both of which are currently operating below the corporate average level of profitability. I remain confident in the ability of our outstanding management team to adapt to the many opportunities and challenges in the current environment while continuing to grow Amphenol's market position and driving sustainable and strong profitability over the long term. And finally, I just want to take this opportunity here to thank our entire global team for what were truly outstanding efforts here in the second quarter. And with that, operator, we'd be more than happy to take any questions.\nOperator: Thank you. The question-and-answer period will now begin. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. You may go head.\nWamsi Mohan: Yes. Thank you so much. Adam, really impressive order growth over here. Big, big numbers. Can you just talk about how much of that was driven by AI? Are you seeing a lot of new programs kick in? And how do we square that with your expectation of a moderate increase here in IT datacom for the third quarter? Thank you.\nAdam Norwitt: Yeah. Well, thank you very much, Wamsi. Look, we were very encouraged by the orders this quarter. And as I mentioned, our 1.12 book-to-bill far and away, the biggest driver of that was a very significant book-to-bill that we saw in the IT datacom market. And no doubt about it, I mean there's a significant portion of that, that is being driven by AI. And this is existing programs that we've already won, new programs that we are winning, a really broad array of momentum that we have across AI. And I think -- I'm just so proud of our team, who is leveraging our leading position in high speed and power to really continuing to win in these extraordinarily complex systems. And, yeah, as it relates to your question on the third quarter and the guide related to our sales, we shouldn't forget, these are some of the most complex interconnect products ever built that we are making in many cases. And they have to be that because what our end customers are trying to achieve with AI is really phenomenal. I mean, the phenomenal array of growth of these next-generation models that are being trained, the intensity of the interconnect, the requirements of both speed, high -- ultra-high-speed, ultra-low latency, the complexity of these systems, because you're effectively having to connect every GPU or TPU or whatever it may be to every other one in order to create this sort of fabric-like network. There is an enormous amount of technology involved in these things. And we've talked about also in the past that for some of these systems, it requires also some meaningful investments upfront. And while our CapEx last quarter was kind of in line with our normal historical, I think Craig did mention that we continue to expect some elevated CapEx here in the second half. And so I would say that the orders that we're getting from customers in many ways they have slightly opened the order aperture to maybe give us more confidence in, kind of, extending ourselves in those investments and as well in order to make sure that these significant new products with all the challenges associated with them that we're building the right capacities in order to do that. And I'm not talking about massive extensions in these order apertures, but these are not necessarily just orders for the next quarter alone. And so as we look at our order book, we look at our backlog related to AI, I mean it gives us confidence not just for the quarter ahead, but for a long-term to come.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. You may go ahead.\nAmit Daryanani: Yes, good afternoon everyone. Thanks for taking my question. I guess I'll stick to the AI theme. Adam, maybe -- there's obviously a lot of focus on what does the AI opportunity really mean for Amphenol. So, I'm wondering if you could spend some time just framing on how do you see this opportunity playing out for you? Is it bigger with hyperscalers or with semiconductor companies for you? And is there a way to think about maybe how much of the incremental, let's say, $300 million of revenues you had in June was AI driven versus not? Thank you.\nAdam Norwitt: Thank you very much, Amit. I mean, look, the answer is all of the above. I mean at the end of the day, there are folks who are spending money to build AI data centers. And those tend to play down to the chip companies. And I think what's unique about AI is these systems are so much more complicated, there's so much more technology embedded in them that, in fact, we are working through the stack of that entire chain in making sure that our products are doing the right thing at each level. And so I think from that perspective, it's a little bit unique compared to traditional IT datacom, where we work with just OEMs or just service providers. I say here, we work with companies up and down the stack and in significant ways, let me say that. In terms of the growth over prior year, I mean, you've characterized our growth, which is just over $300 million on a year-over-year basis. And I think what I -- how I described that was the vast majority of that growth really came out of AI. And we've been careful not to just put specific numbers. In fact, it's not always easy to tell what is exactly AI and what is exactly not AI. And so we've tried to be a little bit more directional about those numbers. And I think we've been consistent about that from really the beginning of the sort of advent of this revolution. But I think you can safely say, it's the vast majority of our growth on a year-over-year basis. And then on a sequential basis, just to give another data point, I would say that the strong majority of our growth on a sequential basis, but not all of it. And we were encouraged on a sequential basis as well to see some growth in the base IT demand, which has been a long time coming. I think we all know, I mean that was not the easiest of markets over the last, I don't know, six to eight quarters. And it's encouraging for us to finally see meaningful growth from that sort of base IT investments, which we always expected would when they come. But no doubt about it, the vast majority of year-over-year, the strong majority of our sequential growth has come out of AI.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. You may go ahead.\nSamik Chatterjee: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Adam, I'm actually going to switch gears here and ask you about the acquisition of CommScope particularly in terms of when you think about mobile networks and you mentioned you're starting to see somewhat of a cyclical sort of spending recovery from your customers. But I think investor perception generally for that mobile networks business has been that service providers don't really need to spend massively until we get to 6G. So maybe if you can sort of outline why now, why now the acquisition, how you're thinking about sort of the outlook for the next few years? And what drove sort of -- what drove the decision here to double down on this mobile networks business. Thank you.\nAdam Norwitt: Yes. Well thank you, very much Samik. Look and I'm just going to -- from a vernacular perspective, we'll call this Andrew. So it's not to confuse as anybody because we're not buying all of CommScope for buying the mobile networks business from CommScope which is essentially Andrew that was acquired by them in 2007. And Andrew is just a fabulous, fabulous company. I mean as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, a rich legacy of technology and outstanding enabler of all the generations. I mean they go back all the way to 1G and 2G and 3G and 4G and now 5G as a core partner in enabling those next-generation networks and I think yes, for the last year or 1.5 years, we've seen more muted demand in mobile networks. We're encouraged to see that now. I'm not going to tell you that we're smart enough to have timed exactly this announcement to exactly when we started to see that market turn. I think that's more coincidental. This is a company that we have admired for a long, long, long time. It's a fabulous organization with fabulous people, fabulous technology. So that's not -- it's that -- we saw the market turning and then we decided to acquire it, but quite the contrary. These are lengthy discussions. So the why now, I think is not necessarily. I wouldn't tell you that there is a now. It just happened that this was the right time for them and the right time for us in how these discussions go. But the long term, I will say this, the long term for mobile networks is something that we do believe in as a component of the broad diversified presence that we have across the entire range of the electronics industry. And the fact is, all these things that we're talking about, be they AI or next-generation communications or mobile devices or whatever. We are accessing these things by and large through mobile networks today, not through fixed line. And by the way we cover fixed line. We still have our broadband business as a way to make sure that we're present whenever people are getting Internet through a cable or otherwise. But we've always said, we want to be present in a high-technology way as a partner to our customers in every way that people are accessing data. And over the long term, there's no doubt in my mind that the highest growth way that people are going to access data is through -- is in a disconnected fashion through mobile networks. And yes, there's 5G today, where there's still a lot of work to be done to build that out. There will be a 6G, there will be a 7G, there will be an 8G. I've been in the company long enough to have watched these generations unfold and we want to be a participant in that. Doubling down. I mean sure, this is going to significantly expand our position in the mobile networks market which I would argue today is somewhat underrepresented 4% of our sales last quarter. But this is not doubling down for all of Amphenol in that respect. After we make this acquisition mobile networks may represent somewhere in the high single digits roughly of our sales. And I would also put that into context that over the last 18 months, we've made -- now we've completed 12 acquisitions and we've signed two others Lutze Europe and now Andrew to be -- that we'll be closing in the future. And we've made these acquisitions across the range of Amphenol of the served markets that we have, but in particular with the acquisition of CIT and a number of our other industrial markets those kind of slower cycle markets of commercial, air, defense, industrial, automotive those have been a little bit more concentrated there. And we do believe that having balanced across the faster cycle markets and the slower cycle markets, the communications markets being the faster ones, we think that balance is a very great thing for the company long-term and it allows us to continue to have great exposure to every corner of the electronics market. While not having overexposure and thereby being overly susceptible to risk should there be a problem in any given market. So we think this is a great strategic acquisition from a product technology perspective. It's great from a global customer relationship perspective. And it's great for overall Amphenol and what it brings. Not to mention that the 4,000 people that one day will join our organization, many of whom have worked for the company all the way back to the time when it was in fact Andrew they're going to make fantastic Amphenolians in the future.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from Luke Junk with Baird. You may go ahead.\nLuke Junk: Thank you for taking the question. Adam maybe a near-term question, but you mentioned in your prepared remarks that of course you've been seeing a pause in the industrial markets that you were encouraged by some early signs of momentum in the quarter. Could you just double quick on what you're seeing in some of those areas be geographically or by end market? And maybe if you could frame it up with what you're seeing in terms of orders as a leading indicator that would be helpful as well? Thank you.\nAdam Norwitt: Yeah. Thanks very much Luke. Yeah. Look starting with orders. I mean, we were encouraged actually, I think I can't tell you how long it's been but to have a positive book-to-bill in the industrial market and not just like 101:1. It was like a decently positive book-to-bill that we had in industrial. So that I would say is encouraging sign number one. I would say encouraging sign number two is that we saw with our distributors in particular on a sequential basis. But even on a year-over-year basis, growth in demand from our distributors, the demand they put upon us. And that's a great early indication that the kind of inventory corrections that were happening with the end customer and in the distribution channel those seem to be largely behind us. And I never want to be the guy to call a bottom, let me say that. But I'm encouraged that we actually had meaningful growth on a sequential basis in distribution from the first quarter, and when I say meaningful I'm talking about high-teens kind of growth rate on a sequential basis from distribution. And that's broadly from distribution, but also from the distribution that is within industrial. So I think those are good signs. If you look at our guide here for the third quarter, yes, we were on a year-over-year basis in the second quarter organically down, but we were actually up slightly sequentially in industrial. And then our guide for the third quarter would have us be kind of flattish sequentially on an organic basis. I mean, I talked about the fact that we will grow but that growth is really driven by the new acquisitions. So look this is not to say that all is perfect in industrial, but I think the cognition of the orders and the behavior of distributors those are two pretty good early signs. And as we get into the third quarter 90 days from now and we see how that goes, we'll certainly try to be able to give everybody a little bit more visibility to whether that is in fact happening. The last thing I would say is you mentioned geographical. There's no doubt that the industrial trends are diverging geographically. So we actually saw organic growth in the quarter on a sequential basis in North America and Asia and we saw continued organic declines in Europe. And so I think Europe is certainly not out of the woods right now, but it's encouraging that we see this in distribution. North America has maybe a little bit more distribution than Europe does and to see also the growth that we're seeing now in Asia.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Asiya Merchant with Citigroup. You may go ahead.\nAsiya Merchant: Great. Thank you for taking my question. Just double click on operating margins, really strong here in the comm segment. As you continue to see AI momentum here, how should we think about both incremental operating margins going forward? And just broadly EBIT margins going forward? Thank you.\nCraig Lampo: Yeah. Thanks a lot for the question. Yeah. Listen we're really proud of the operating margins here in the second quarter and 21.3% record operating margins and that's obviously including part of the quarter where we have CIT which is well below the company average kind of in the low double-digit range. And so certainly proud of the operating margins. And certainly, that's driven by a bunch of factors, and I wouldn't focus it on one particular area. There was a few things happening here. Certainly, in some of the markets that are growing including IT data market and military and some others are certainly. Those businesses continue just to execute well on the higher growth rates. And the other side of that coin is we have certain markets in certain businesses that are not growing in industrial we talked about a little bit. And they're really doing a good job kind of on the other side of the coin to be able to kind of protect their margins. So overall, I wouldn't focus it on say one area, but I think as we continue to grow as we continue to be able to drive volume, we should be able to continue to drive our margins up and into that kind of 25% or so targeted conversion margins we talk about. Clearly, CIT here in the third quarter sequentially is going to have a bit of an impact and you see that in our kind of implied guidance from a sequential perspective. But if you look organically coming into the third quarter, we're still converting very well excluding kind of the CIT impact into those margins and we feel real good about the margins and the expansion potential as we move forward here in the year.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Joe Spak with UBS. You may go ahead.\nJoe Spak: Thanks so much. I want to go back to Andrew's. So I'm getting the nomenclature right now. The -- just a couple of quick things. One, the 25% EBITDA margins you sort of highlighted on that deal. I mean, again, just looking at some of the historical looks a little bit higher. I just wanted to understand, if you were building in any sort of synergies or anything else into that? Or that's just a forecast. And then two, I noticed in the release you said EPS accretive ex-transaction costs and I'm sure you're still going through some of the deal amortization and the other issues. But you generally run that through. So is it also just straight EPS accretive? Should we expect that?\nCraig Lampo : Sure. Yes. No, I think this is just to start with the EPS accretion part. We haven't called that out, because I think it's a little bit far into the future to start calling out EPS accretion and certainly will be EPS accretive. It's a very its strong profitability. Adam mentioned in his prepared remarks, this is high teens operating margin, assuming kind of the amortization we would expect based on our current estimates post-acquisition. So, certainly, we would expect a good level of EPS accretion after the acquisition. In regards to the 25% EBITDA, there's certainly no synergies. We're not anticipating any synergies. We don't talk about synergies typically as you know our approach when acquiring companies and bringing them into the Amphenol family is we don't try to make significant changes. We kind of -- we essentially enable the businesses to expand margins while helping them do so as part of Amphenol. And that will be our continued playbook in addition to -- as we bring CommScope and we ultimately closed the Andrew's business there. So I wouldn't say that this 25% is -- that's what we view it as right now. I'm not going to talk so much about it's still part of CommScope's business and we're not going to necessarily talk so much about kind of what their expectations are and they're going to continue to report on this business and we'll let them do so.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Guy Hardwick with Freedom Capital Markets. You may go ahead.\nGuy Hardwick : Hi. Good afternoon.\nAdam Norwitt : Good afternoon, Guy.\nGuy Hardwick : Hi. Thanks Adam for the background on Andrew Core. Just a question. Why so long to close? Because I think it's -- by your timetable is looking like a 10, 11 months to close compared to say four months of CIT?\nAdam Norwitt: Yes. No, look, I think in any company there's a process a regulatory process and they operate in a lot of countries, because they sell to mobile network operators around the world. And so there's -- when you have lots and lots of different geographies that can sometimes cause a little bit longer time period. But there's nothing more fancy about it than that.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from Scott Graham with Seaport Research. You may go ahead.\nScott Graham : Hey, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my questions. I wanted to just understand the nature of the restructuring charge and maybe the payback on that? And if I could squeeze in a second one. Adam you commented that you were seeing some of your automotive manufacturers slowing production. I'm hoping you could elaborate on that. Thanks.\nAdam Norwitt: Yes. I mean, I don't know what restructuring charge you're talking about. We did talk about a $70 million acquisition-related charge, which is acquisition expenses, which includes the money that we pay to various advisers who help us do the deal together with some amortization of backlog and things like that. This is not a restructuring charge. You usually will not hear Amphenol talking about restructuring. Relative to auto, I think, what I mentioned is that we do see -- in particular, I would say, in Europe that some of the demand expectations for our customers going to the third quarter are a little bit more muted. But our guide is this is not a severe change in the volumes. It's just a very modest change here in the third quarter.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Andrew Buscaglia with BNP Paribas. You may go ahead.\nAndrew Buscaglia: Hey, guys. I wanted to check on mobile devices. Correct me, if I'm wrong, I think you said you're guiding that up 20% sequentially. And presumably there's some renewed optimism around, that's being driven by an upgrade cycle of devices. Can you talk about first off, can you confirm that and then secondly, how do you in past cycles tend to participate in upgrade cycles that this work to do on \u2013 is it earlier on, later on or how does that play out in line?\nAdam Norwitt: Yes. Well, thanks very much, Andrew. I mean look, I think we had a very strong second quarter in mobile devices, much stronger than we anticipated coming into the quarter. And now with a guide of 20% sequential growth on a higher than we had anticipated baseline here in the third quarter I mean it's \u2013 I think that's a fairly positive view. Is that due to upgrade cycles? I mean yes, I guess every year mobile devices there's new releases. These are very short life cycle products. And so there tend to be new products every year. Whether there's a more significant upgrade cycle I wouldn't tell you that that's necessarily what we're sort of discounting for here. As always, we have a team of folks who work in mobile devices, who are extraordinarily agile. And we have demonstrated over many, many years of participating in this market that when there are additional sales to be had, when there is kind of more of a \u2013 I don't know the term folks use now super cycle of upgrades, we have always been able to capitalize and get more than our fair share of that. So we'll see what happens here this year. I think this is probably a more kind of a normal outlook that we would have and it remains to be seen. And to your question of when would we or how would we participate? I mean if people are making more devices then we'll sell more components to go on those devices. And when they build those will depend largely on the type of demand that they see from their customers. And our job is not to anticipate that but rather to react in real time when there are changes in the demand. And if there are favorable changes, we\u2019ll manage through that and I'm sure we'll do well. And if there are not favorable changes, our team will adjust in real time to preserve the bottom line and that's how we've always operated.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs. You may go ahead.\nMark Delaney: Yes. Good afternoon and thank you very much for taking my question. With the CIT transaction and the proposed Andrew [ph] deals both over $2 billion and I think the largest Amphenol has done in its history. I was hoping you can help us to better understand if the degree of diligence Amphenol does changes for deals of that size including as you think about cultural fit. And how you think about the ability and your confidence in getting the margin performance and execution to more typical Amphenol levels over time when taking on these larger businesses? Thank you.\nAdam Norwitt: Well, thanks very much, Mark. I mean look, you can imagine that we are very serious in both our diligence but also in our interactions with the people. And the bigger the company, the more people you're going to want to interact with. I mean it's pretty linear from that perspective. And so we had a very, very significant review and diligence with both CIT and these businesses from CommScope, which we will just refer to here as Andrew. And both from a diligence integrity of the numbers but also from a cultural perspective, I mean, on one side, in terms of integrity, Carlisle and CommScope are both great companies. They're public companies. They report great numbers. So I think, yes, we do enormous financial diligence around them. But I think the starting point is also, these are public companies with audited financials from extremely reputable big four auditing firms. As opposed to sometimes, you buy family companies and you almost have to sort of do a ground-up audit of them. And you don't have to do that kind of work here. But the cultural aspects, getting to know the people, understanding are they passionate about becoming part of Amphenol, do they believe in the business, do they see the potential, are they -- do they feel even liberated by being part of an interconnect company in the case of CIT, or being able to be a stand-alone business in the case of Andrew, this is really important because we always preserve the management. And we're not going to buy a company like this, if we hear from the management team that they're not committed to being part of our company going forward. And I can tell you that both inside CIT and Andrew, the folks are extremely passionate, extremely excited to be part of the Amphenol organization. Now, relative to margins, I mean, we've been making acquisitions for many, many, many years, as you know, Mark. And at the end of the day, we don't have just one recipe for how do companies improve their operating margins to bring up to at or above our corporate average. We believe that there are no sacred cows. Margin is price minus cost. And we seek to expose them to their sister and brother companies around the world, so that they can see some of the ways that other Amphenolians have gone about improving their companies in due course. And I think both the folks at CIT and in Andrew, and they have different levels of profitability, by the way, CIT is a lower profitability today, Andrew is actually operating at really nice levels of profitability. But we see with both of them long-term great opportunities, both on the top line and on the bottom line. And how that's going to happen, these are exciting businesses with lots of different inputs and outputs. And I'm very confident that the team will find a way, and we'll certainly help them do that.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Will Stein with Truist Securities. You may go ahead.\nWill Stein: Okay. Great. Thanks for taking my question. Adam, congrats on all the deals you've announced recently, some really big ones in some storied companies, with Andrew in particular. And it sort of forces me to wonder about management's bandwidth to deal with all these and to potentially continue to look at deals. I know that you've added, I think, a new layer of management, that might have been several years ago, to facilitate potentially adding in bigger acquisitions. We're starting to see something like that. But I wonder whether you have the management bandwidth to continue to look at new deals and to do even more. Or perhaps, you're going to have to put a pause on deals for a while. Thank you.\nAdam Norwitt: Well, thank you, Will. I mean, look, you asked a question that is so close to my heart. And I think I've even used this with you before. I view my job as CEO of Amphenol really twofold to protect the culture of the company, and to scale the company given that culture. Call it, to protect and to scale. Not quite like the NYPD, to protect and to serve. And I think we can look back over these last, let's call it, 20 years, 25 years even. I've been in the company 26 years. I've been now CEO for 15.5 of those years. I think we've done actually an outstanding job of both of those things. I would tell you that the culture of the company today, across our more than 135, I don't know, 137 or so general Managers, that Amphenolian culture of entrepreneurship is stronger today than it has ever been before as its embodied across those people. The vibrancy and the strength of that entrepreneurship is amazing. I see it all over the world as I travel around to meet with our people. It is so unique and so powerful. But at the same time, we have scaled the company. And you correctly point out, two and a half years ago, we took a big step in the company's evolution with the creation of three divisions run by division Presidents. Each of those are reportable segments, but that was a natural evolution that goes all the way back to even the beginning of the 2000, 2003 when we created our first operating groups, where we had five of those. And that was the first time that General Managers didn't just report to our then CEO, who still happens to be our Chairman. We have a lot of continuity in Amphenol, as you know. And those groups expanded over time to the point where today, we have 15 of these operating groups. These are groups that are roughly $1 billion or so on average in size. We have the three global divisions. And that has created an enormous bandwidth for us both to pursue organic growth opportunities, which are still very, very critical and really core to the company, but also to continue to expand the range of our acquisition program and we've gotten the question over the years. You may have even asked it yourself, Will. As the company grows and if you roughly contribute about a third of your growth over the long term from acquisitions, that must mean either you have to do more deals or you have to do bigger deals. And my answer has always been, for the last 15.5 years, yes, some combination of the two, we will have to do. And I think we can look back and say, yes, we have continued to do that. We have continued to open the aperture of both the number and the scale of the deals that we do. And that is exactly related to that scaling up of our organization. It's interesting though. When you think about most companies and how traditionally they would scale an organization, you would build layers, you would build matrices, you would build really bureaucracies at the end of the day, but that's not what this has happened in Amphenol. In fact, whether it's the divisions or the groups, these are very lean organizations, but they're exactly what our lean headquarters once was before. I mean if you think about the -- when we had just 15 GMs reporting to the CEO, and we would make maybe one acquisition in a year or two. And then when we first started our five groups, maybe we'd make three or four. And now here in the last 18 months, we've made -- we've closed on 12 acquisitions, we've signed two more, and that's included the two largest in the company's 92-year history. And that is just a reflection of the successful scaling of the Amphenol culture. The fact is, is CIT and what we will call Andrew are in different divisions. They report to different division presidents. And you can bet that those individuals are working extraordinarily hard on getting to know the companies, doing the diligence like we discussed with Mark's question, and ultimately bringing them successfully into the Amphenol family. No doubt about it, we would not have been able to do this if we didn't have -- if we hadn't have evolved the organization. But today, we have really almost a limitless capability to do that and coupled with a balance sheet that is second to none that Craig has been such an amazing steward of.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Steven Fox with Fox Advisors. You may go ahead.\nSteven Fox: Hey, good afternoon. Just one more on CommScope. Can you just talk Adam a little bit from a technology standpoint how you plan on leveraging all the antenna portfolio you will have combined cable assemblies connectors et cetera, as part of one big organization that would be helpful. Thanks.\nAdam Norwitt: Yeah. Look Steve I think it's early. We've just signed the deal and we're obviously going to go through a regulatory process here. And then once we get through that we'll certainly be very thoughtful about the company. But what I would say is this, I mean Amphenol has been in RF connectors from the beginning. I mean we invented the world's first off connector back in 1941. Andrew was really the innovator of antenna technology, one of the innovators in antenna technology for mobile networks. And I think the combination of those two rich legacies ultimately is going to create enormous value for our customers. And I can tell you having talked already to several of those customers, they feel very excited about Amphenol as a home for this important partner for them.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Joe Giordano with TD Cowen. You may go ahead.\nMichael Anastasiou: This is Michael on for Joe. So, previously you guys adjusted like AI revenues are probably annualizing around $800 million, and there's probably a path to $1 billion or so for next year. Can you just provide any color on customers like CapEx ramp required to support this AI growth? And if you could provide any clarity on how margins compare versus the rest of the portfolio would greatly appreciate it. Thank you.\nAdam Norwitt: Yeah. Thanks very much. Again we've given I think some good directional guidance on the scale of this. I talked about the fact that the vast majority of our growth on a year-over-year basis is really growth in AI. And by the way we had some AI already a year ago in the second quarter. I think we talked quite a bit already about the order patterns and the potential CapEx required for this. I don't really want to repeat myself on that. What I would just say is that the customers they want to work with us because of our technology. And at the end of the day these products, these systems have such demands put upon them, the performance levels that they're being run at are so extraordinary that it is coming back all the time to do you have the product number one? And do you have the capacity and the competency to build that product, and that capacity and competency to build is something that we have demonstrated over many, many years, many different revolutions in IT datacom, but it does require for sure us to continue to make investments, so that we can support this real revolution in AI investments.\nCraig Lampo: And just from a margin perspective, we wouldn't call out any significant difference in the AI product line is certainly margin accretive, but not so -- not meaningfully different from the rest of the portfolio of products that we have. And it's a good business and we want all of our businesses to continue to grow and provide margin contribution which we expect that will happen.\nOperator: Thank you. And our last question comes from Saree Boroditsky with Jefferies. You may go ahead.\nSaree Boroditsky: Hi. Thanks for fitting us on. Just kind of going back to the industrial commentary. You talked about distribution growing meaningfully sequentially. Do you have a sense of underlying demand getting better? Or is this just the end of destocking. Thank you.\nAdam Norwitt: Yes. Thanks very much Saree. I mean look, I think the end of destocking usually just means that end demand starts to match with the demand put on us by the distributors, because it wouldn't be a restocking if you will. So if you think about, how that would normally go, customers start to reduce their demand. Distributors are left with too much inventory, they reduced their demand by even more. And then once they get to a level that they feel good about, then they try to sort of mirror their end demand with the demand put on us. So I don't think that our distributors are necessarily restocking but, probably they're matching what they're seeing. And that -- again, that's why I say, without saying that industrial is sort of booming here, I think the early signs of the positive book-to-bill that we saw together with the sequential and also somewhat year-over-year momentum from distributors is a good and positive early sign for industrial, but we'll see how it goes through the third quarter and through the end of the year.\nOperator: And I'll now turn the call back over to Mr. Norwitt for any closing remarks.\nAdam Norwitt: Well, thank you very much and we truly appreciate everybody's time today. And I do hope that all of you get a little bit of a chance to take some time off this summer and we look forward to being back with you here in the fall just 90 days from now. Thank you very much.\nCraig Lampo: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you for attending today's conference and have a nice day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Craig Lampo",
            "content": "Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. This is Craig Lampo, Amphenol's CFO, and I'm here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO. We would like to welcome you to our second quarter 2024 conference call. Our second quarter 2024 results were released this morning. I will provide some financial commentary and then Adam will give an overview of the business and current market trends and then we will take questions. As a reminder, during the call we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures and make certain forward-looking statements, so please refer to the relevant disclosures in our press release for further information. In addition as a result of our recently announced two-for-one stock split effective on June 11, 2024 all share and per share data discussed on this earnings call is on a split-adjusted basis. The company closed the second quarter with record sales of $3.610 billion and GAAP and record adjusted diluted EPS of $0.41 and $0.44, respectively. Second quarter sales were up 18% in US dollars, 19% local currencies, and 11% organically compared to the second quarter of 2023. Sequentially sales were up 11% in US dollars and in local currencies and up 8% organically. Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes. Orders in the quarter were a record $4.061 billion, up 33% to the prior year and up 21% sequentially resulting in a strong book-to-bill ratio of 1.12:1. GAAP operating income and operating margin were $699 million and 19.4%, respectively, which included $70 million of acquisition related costs primarily associated with the CIT acquisition. Excluding these costs, adjusted operating income was $769 million resulting in a record adjusted operating margin of 21.3% in the second quarter of 2024. On an adjusted basis operating margin increased by 90 basis points from the prior year quarter and 30 basis points sequentially. The year-over-year increase in adjusted operating margin was primarily driven by strong operating leverage on higher sales volumes, which was partially offset by the dilutive impact of acquisitions completed in the prior 12 months. On a sequential basis, the modest increase in adjusted operating margin reflected a strong conversion on the higher sales levels partially offset by the dilutive impact of acquisitions made in the second quarter particularly CIT, which is currently operating well-below the company's average profitability levels. We are very proud of the company's operating margin performance in the second quarter, which reflects continued strong execution by our teams. Breaking down second quarter results by segment compared to the second quarter of 2023. Sales in the Harsh Environment Solutions segment were $1.046 billion, an increased by 18% in US dollars and 1% organically and segment operating margin was 24.8%. Sales in the Communications Solutions segment were $1.445 billion and increased by 24% in US dollars and 23% organically segment operating margin was 24.3%. Sales in the Interconnect and Sensor Systems segment were $1.119 billion, an increased by 12% in US dollars and 7% organically and segment operating margin was 18.2%. The company's GAAP effective tax rate for the second quarter was 20.4% and the adjusted effective tax rate was 24%, which compared to 21.9% and 24% in the second quarter of 2023 respectively. We continue to expect our adjusted effective tax rate to be at 24% in the third quarter and for the full year of 2024. GAAP adjusted EPS was $0.41 in the second quarter, up 11% compared to the prior year period. And on an adjusted basis, diluted EPS increased 22% to a record $0.44 compared to $0.36 in the second quarter of 2023. Operating cash flow in the second quarter was $664 million or 120% of adjusted net income and net of capital spending our free cash flow was $528 million or 95% of adjusted net income. We are pleased to have continued to deliver a strong cash flow yield in the quarter despite our slightly increased levels of CapEx. I would note that while our second quarter capital spending was higher than the first quarter, it was still within our normal range. We continue to expect somewhat elevated levels of capital spending in the coming couple of quarters as we invest to support the growth we are seeing in the defense and IT datacom markets. From a working capital standpoint, inventory days, days sales outstanding and payable days were 84, 69 and 56 days respectively, all within normal levels. During the quarter, the company repurchased 3.1 million shares of common stock at an average price of approximately $62. When combined with our normal quarterly dividend total capital return to shareholders in the second quarter of 2024 was more than $320 million. Total debt at June 30 was $5.4 billion and net debt was $4.1 billion and total liquidity at the end of the quarter was $4.3 billion, which included cash and sort of investments on hand of $1.3 billion plus availability under our existing credit facilities. Excluding acquisition-related costs second quarter 2024 EBITDA was $900 million and at the end of the second quarter of 2024 our net leverage ratio was 1.2 times. As a result of the $1.5 billion US bond offerings completed earlier in the second quarter and the subsequent closing of CIT in May, we expect quarterly interest expense net of interest income earned on cash on hand to be approximately $45 million in the third quarter. The company is in a very strong financial position and we continue to be well-positioned to fund future opportunities as they arise. In particular, we are well positioned to fund the pending acquisition of the own and DAS businesses of CommScope for a purchase price of $2.1 billion, which we expect to close by the end of the first half of 2025. We will fund this acquisition through cash on hand and debt. Finally, as mentioned in today's earnings release, the company's Board of Directors has approved a 50% increase in the company's quarterly dividend to $0.165 per share, effective preferred payments beginning in October of 2024. I will now turn it over to Adam, who will provide some commentary on current market trends. Yeah. Thanks a lot for the question. Yeah. Listen we're really proud of the operating margins here in the second quarter and 21.3% record operating margins and that's obviously including part of the quarter where we have CIT which is well below the company average kind of in the low double-digit range. And so certainly proud of the operating margins. And certainly, that's driven by a bunch of factors, and I wouldn't focus it on one particular area. There was a few things happening here. Certainly, in some of the markets that are growing including IT data market and military and some others are certainly. Those businesses continue just to execute well on the higher growth rates. And the other side of that coin is we have certain markets in certain businesses that are not growing in industrial we talked about a little bit. And they're really doing a good job kind of on the other side of the coin to be able to kind of protect their margins. So overall, I wouldn't focus it on say one area, but I think as we continue to grow as we continue to be able to drive volume, we should be able to continue to drive our margins up and into that kind of 25% or so targeted conversion margins we talk about. Clearly, CIT here in the third quarter sequentially is going to have a bit of an impact and you see that in our kind of implied guidance from a sequential perspective. But if you look organically coming into the third quarter, we're still converting very well excluding kind of the CIT impact into those margins and we feel real good about the margins and the expansion potential as we move forward here in the year. Sure. Yes. No, I think this is just to start with the EPS accretion part. We haven't called that out, because I think it's a little bit far into the future to start calling out EPS accretion and certainly will be EPS accretive. It's a very its strong profitability. Adam mentioned in his prepared remarks, this is high teens operating margin, assuming kind of the amortization we would expect based on our current estimates post-acquisition. So, certainly, we would expect a good level of EPS accretion after the acquisition. In regards to the 25% EBITDA, there's certainly no synergies. We're not anticipating any synergies. We don't talk about synergies typically as you know our approach when acquiring companies and bringing them into the Amphenol family is we don't try to make significant changes. We kind of -- we essentially enable the businesses to expand margins while helping them do so as part of Amphenol. And that will be our continued playbook in addition to -- as we bring CommScope and we ultimately closed the Andrew's business there. So I wouldn't say that this 25% is -- that's what we view it as right now. I'm not going to talk so much about it's still part of CommScope's business and we're not going to necessarily talk so much about kind of what their expectations are and they're going to continue to report on this business and we'll let them do so. And just from a margin perspective, we wouldn't call out any significant difference in the AI product line is certainly margin accretive, but not so -- not meaningfully different from the rest of the portfolio of products that we have. And it's a good business and we want all of our businesses to continue to grow and provide margin contribution which we expect that will happen. Thank you."

            "name": "Adam Norwitt",
            "content": "Well, thank you very much, Craig, and I'd like to extend my welcome to all of you here on the phone today. And I hope that you and your family friends and colleagues are enjoying a very nice summer so far. As Craig mentioned, I'm going to highlight a few of our achievements in the second quarter. I will spend the few moments to review our recently closed and announced acquisitions. I'll talk about our trends and progress across our served markets, and then we'll make some comments on our outlook for the third quarter. And of course, we'll have some time for questions at the end. Our results in the second quarter were stronger than expected exceeding the high end of our guidance in sales and adjusted diluted earnings per share. Sales grew from prior year by 18% in US dollars and 19% in local currencies, reaching a new record $3.61 billion. On an organic basis, sales increased by a strong 11% with growth in IT datacom, defense, commercial air, mobile networks, mobile devices and automotive, only slightly offset by moderations in the broadband and industrial markets. Importantly, the company booked record orders of $4.061 billion, representing a robust book-to-bill of 1.12:1. I would just note here that, our bookings were particularly strong from IT datacom customers focused on artificial intelligence or AI. Adjusted operating margins reached a record 21.3% in the second quarter, a strong 90 basis point increase from last year's second quarter. And adjusted diluted EPS grew 22% from prior year to a record $0.44. We also generated strong operating and free cash flow in the quarter of $664 million and $528 million, respectively, both clear demonstrations of the high quality of the company's earnings. And finally, as Craig mentioned, we announced this morning a 50% increase in the company's quarterly dividend to $0.165 per share, effective with our October dividend payment. Just want to say how proud I am of our team here this quarter as the results that they drove once again reflect the strength of our entrepreneurial organization as we continue to perform well amidst a very dynamic environment. As you know, our M&A team has once again been very busy of late. I'm very pleased to announce that on May 21, we closed the previously announced acquisition of CIT, previously called Carlisle Interconnect Technologies. I'm very excited to welcome the talented CIT team to the Amphenol family, and we really look forward to realizing the benefits of the combined breadth of our company's highly complementary product solutions, which will enable us to offer our customers an expanded array of innovative technologies across the important commercial air defense and industrial markets. In addition, we're pleased to have signed a definitive agreement to acquire Lutze. Lutze is a leading provider of harsh environment cable and cable assembly solutions for high-technology applications in the industrial markets. This acquisition includes two businesses, Lutze US based in North Carolina and Lutze Europe based in Germany. In May, we did close on the acquisition of Lutze U.S., which has annual sales of approximately $75 million. And we expect to close on Lutze Europe, which has annual sales of approximately $100 million, by the end of the third quarter of 2024. That's this quarter here. The Lutze acquisition is a great complement to our broad offering of high-technology interconnect products for the worldwide industrial market and, in particular, strengthens our range of value-add interconnect products. Finally, just last week, we announced an agreement to acquire the mobile networks-related businesses of CommScope for a purchase price of $2.1 billion. We're really excited to be acquiring CommScope's Outdoor Wireless Networks or OWN and Distributed Antenna Systems or DAS businesses. These businesses provide exciting mobile network solutions with advanced technologies in the areas of base station antennas and related interconnect solutions as well as distributed antenna systems. I just want to mention that, we're especially encouraged that the businesses that we're acquiring really make up the former Andrew Corporation portfolio of products, a company with a rich history of innovation and technology in the wireless industry. These businesses are expected to generate revenues of approximately $1.2 billion with EBITDA margins of approximately 25% in 2024. This represents operating margins in the high teens, including our current estimate of post acquisition-related amortization. We really look forward to supporting customers who are developing next-generation wireless networks around the world, with these advanced solutions, as well as with our own existing complementary interconnect products. Most importantly, we look forward to welcoming the approximately 4,000 employees of these businesses around the world. There's no doubt in my mind that these talented individuals will make great future Amphenolians. As we welcome these outstanding new teams to Amphenol, and we look forward to the future closings of Lutze Europe and CommScope OWN and DAS, we remain confident that Amphenol's acquisition program will continue to create great value for the company. Our ability to identify and execute upon acquisitions and successfully bring these new companies into Amphenol, remains a core competitive advantage for the company. Now turning to our trends across our served markets, I would just comment that we're very pleased that the company's end market exposure remains highly diversified balanced and broad. This diversification continues to create great value for Amphenol, enabling us to participate across all areas of the global electronics industry, while not being disproportionately exposed to the risks associated with any given market or application. So with that said, the defense market represented 11% of our sales in the quarter Sales in this market grew from prior year by a strong 14% in US dollars and 10% organically, driven by broad-based growth across most segments within the defense market. Sequentially, our sales increased by 9%, which was a bit better than our expectations coming into the quarter, driven in part by the earlier-than-anticipated closing of CIT. Looking to the third quarter, we expect sales to increase in the mid-single-digit range from the second quarter levels, including the benefit of acquisitions. And we remain encouraged by the company's strengthened position in the defense market, where we continue to offer the industry's widest range of high-technology interconnect products. Amidst today's highly dynamic geopolitical environment, countries around the world are expanding their investments in both current and next-generation defense technologies, thereby increasing the long-term demand potential for Amphenol. With the addition now of CIT's highly complementary products to our portfolio, we're better positioned than ever to support our customers with new products and the capacity to supply them wherever they may be needed. The commercial aerospace market represented 5% of our sales in the quarter. We had another strong quarter with sales increasing by a robust 60% in US dollars and 9% organically from prior year, as we benefited from the addition of CIT during the quarter, as well as continued progress in expanding our content on next-generation commercial aircraft. Sequentially, our sales grew by 46% in US dollars from the first quarter, as we benefited from the addition of CIT. On an organic basis, our sales were flat sequentially which was a bit better than we had anticipated coming into the quarter. Looking into the third quarter, we expect sales to increase in the mid-40% range as we benefit particularly from a full quarter of CIT sales. I'm truly proud of our team working in the commercial air market. Now with the addition of CIT, we offer the broadest range of high-technology interconnect products to our customers in this important area. With the ongoing growth in travel and thus the demand for jet liners, our efforts to strengthen our product offering while diversifying our market position into next-generation aircraft are paying real dividends. We continue to see great long-term opportunities for expansion of our technology offering to this important market and look forward to realizing the benefits of our growth initiatives for many years to come. The industrial market represented 24% of our sales in the quarter and sales in the second quarter did grow 9% in US dollars from prior year, as we benefited from acquisitions. On an organic basis, sales declined by 5%, as we saw moderations in most segments on a year-over-year basis of the industrial market. Sequentially, sales grew by a better-than-expected 7% from the first quarter, driven primarily by acquisitions but our organic sales were up slightly on a sequential basis. Looking at the third quarter, we expect sales to grow in the mid-single-digit range sequentially, driven by the benefit of our recent acquisitions. While the industrial market certainly has been experiencing a pause as customers and distributors have adjusted their demand levels, we are encouraged to see some early signs of momentum growing in certain areas of the industrial market. In addition, with the additions this quarter of CIT and Lutze US, we now have an ever broaden \u2013 an even broader range of products and capabilities to offer customers across the diversified industrial market. I'm confident that our long-term strategy to expand our high-technology interconnect antenna and sensor offerings both organically and through complementary acquisitions has positioned us to capitalize on the many electronic revolutions that will no doubt continue to occur across the industrial market. This creates opportunities long-term for our outstanding team working in this market. The automotive market represented 21% of our sales in the quarter and sales grew 6% in US dollars and 5% organically, driven by strength across newer automotive applications. Sequentially, our sales moderated by 4% from the first quarter, which was in line with our expectations coming into the quarter. I would note that we did see some incremental softening of demand in Europe in the quarter. As vehicle manufacturers there moderated their production volumes and that was offset by a more favorable performance in North America and Asia. For the third quarter, we do expect sales to be slightly down from these levels, as certain automakers have slowed their summer production schedules. I'm truly proud of our team working in the automotive market. Our continued outperformance is yet another confirmation of the benefit of our team's focus on driving new design wins with customers who are implementing a wide array of new technologies into their vehicles. And this includes electrified drivetrains as well as a multitude of other exciting applications. We look forward to benefiting from our strong position in the automotive market for many years to come. The mobile devices market represented 8% of our sales in the quarter and sales grew by 6% in US dollars and 7% organically as strength in smartphones and wearables more than offset moderations in sales related to laptops. Sequentially, our sales increased by 9% which was much better than our expectations for a mid-single-digit decline and we really did see sequential growth across all segments of the mobile devices market, which was encouraging. Looking into the third quarter, we anticipate sales to increase by approximately 20% from the second quarter levels, as customers prepare for year-end new product launches. While mobile devices will always remain Amphenol's most volatile of end markets, our outstanding and agile team remains well positioned to capture any opportunities for incremental sales that may arise in 2024 and beyond. Our leading array of antennas interconnect products and mechanisms continues to enable a broad range of next-generation mobile devices, thereby positioning us well for the long term. The mobile networks market represented 4% of our sales in the quarter and sales grew by 13% in US dollars and 7% organically, as we did see the beginning of a recovery in our sales to network operators and wireless equipment manufacturers after a number of quarters of demand moderation. Sequentially, sales in the quarter increased by a strong 22% which was much better than our expectations coming into the quarter. Looking to the third quarter, we do expect some moderation from the strong second quarter levels on traditional summer seasonality. We're encouraged by the recent strengthening in the mobile networks market, as operators ramp up their investments in next-generation systems. Our team remains focused on realizing the benefits of our long-term efforts to expand our position in next-generation equipment and networks around the world. Now with the pending acquisition of the OWN and DAS businesses from CommScope, we look forward to participating even more strongly in these next-generation networks for years to come. The IT datacom market represented 24% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in the second quarter grew by a very strong 57% in US dollars and 56% organically, driven by the continued acceleration in demand for our products used in next-generation AI data centers. While the vast majority of this growth did result from our expanding position in AI Interconnect, we were encouraged to also see some improvements in base IT datacom demand. On a sequential basis, sales increased by a strong 29% from the first quarter, substantially better than our expectations coming into Q2. Looking into the third quarter, we expect sales to grow modestly from these elevated second quarter levels. We're more encouraged than ever by the company's position in the global IT datacom market. Our team continues to do an outstanding job securing future business on next-generation IT systems, particularly those enabling AI. Indeed, the revolution in AI has created a unique opportunity for Amphenol. Given our leading high-speed and power interconnect products. With machine learning driving a more intensive usage of these highest technology of interconnect products, we're very well positioned for the future. And whether high-speed power or fiber optic interconnect our products are critical components in these next-generation networks and this creates a continued long-term growth opportunity for Amphenol. Finally, the broadband market represented 3% of our sales in the quarter and sales did decline by 17% in US dollars and organically from prior year, as broadband operators continued to reduce their procurement levels. On a sequential basis, sales were flat as we had anticipated. And looking into the third quarter, we expect a further moderation of sales sequentially. Regardless of this current muted demand environment, we do remain encouraged by the company's continued strong position in the broadband market, and we look forward to continuing to support our service provider customers around the world. As they eventually increase their spending to increase network coverage and bandwidth in support of the proliferation of high-speed data applications to homes and businesses. Now, turning to our outlook, and assuming the continuation of current market conditions as well as constant currency exchange rates. For the third quarter, we expect sales in the range of $3.7 billion to $3.8 billion and adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $0.43 to $0.45. This would represent sales growth of 16% to 19% and adjusted diluted EPS growth of 10% to 15%, compared to the third quarter of 2023. As is our usual practice, this guidance does not include acquisitions, which have not yet closed but does include CIT and Lutze US, both of which are currently operating below the corporate average level of profitability. I remain confident in the ability of our outstanding management team to adapt to the many opportunities and challenges in the current environment while continuing to grow Amphenol's market position and driving sustainable and strong profitability over the long term. And finally, I just want to take this opportunity here to thank our entire global team for what were truly outstanding efforts here in the second quarter. And with that, operator, we'd be more than happy to take any questions. Yeah. Well, thank you very much, Wamsi. Look, we were very encouraged by the orders this quarter. And as I mentioned, our 1.12 book-to-bill far and away, the biggest driver of that was a very significant book-to-bill that we saw in the IT datacom market. And no doubt about it, I mean there's a significant portion of that, that is being driven by AI. And this is existing programs that we've already won, new programs that we are winning, a really broad array of momentum that we have across AI. And I think -- I'm just so proud of our team, who is leveraging our leading position in high speed and power to really continuing to win in these extraordinarily complex systems. And, yeah, as it relates to your question on the third quarter and the guide related to our sales, we shouldn't forget, these are some of the most complex interconnect products ever built that we are making in many cases. And they have to be that because what our end customers are trying to achieve with AI is really phenomenal. I mean, the phenomenal array of growth of these next-generation models that are being trained, the intensity of the interconnect, the requirements of both speed, high -- ultra-high-speed, ultra-low latency, the complexity of these systems, because you're effectively having to connect every GPU or TPU or whatever it may be to every other one in order to create this sort of fabric-like network. There is an enormous amount of technology involved in these things. And we've talked about also in the past that for some of these systems, it requires also some meaningful investments upfront. And while our CapEx last quarter was kind of in line with our normal historical, I think Craig did mention that we continue to expect some elevated CapEx here in the second half. And so I would say that the orders that we're getting from customers in many ways they have slightly opened the order aperture to maybe give us more confidence in, kind of, extending ourselves in those investments and as well in order to make sure that these significant new products with all the challenges associated with them that we're building the right capacities in order to do that. And I'm not talking about massive extensions in these order apertures, but these are not necessarily just orders for the next quarter alone. And so as we look at our order book, we look at our backlog related to AI, I mean it gives us confidence not just for the quarter ahead, but for a long-term to come. Thank you very much, Amit. I mean, look, the answer is all of the above. I mean at the end of the day, there are folks who are spending money to build AI data centers. And those tend to play down to the chip companies. And I think what's unique about AI is these systems are so much more complicated, there's so much more technology embedded in them that, in fact, we are working through the stack of that entire chain in making sure that our products are doing the right thing at each level. And so I think from that perspective, it's a little bit unique compared to traditional IT datacom, where we work with just OEMs or just service providers. I say here, we work with companies up and down the stack and in significant ways, let me say that. In terms of the growth over prior year, I mean, you've characterized our growth, which is just over $300 million on a year-over-year basis. And I think what I -- how I described that was the vast majority of that growth really came out of AI. And we've been careful not to just put specific numbers. In fact, it's not always easy to tell what is exactly AI and what is exactly not AI. And so we've tried to be a little bit more directional about those numbers. And I think we've been consistent about that from really the beginning of the sort of advent of this revolution. But I think you can safely say, it's the vast majority of our growth on a year-over-year basis. And then on a sequential basis, just to give another data point, I would say that the strong majority of our growth on a sequential basis, but not all of it. And we were encouraged on a sequential basis as well to see some growth in the base IT demand, which has been a long time coming. I think we all know, I mean that was not the easiest of markets over the last, I don't know, six to eight quarters. And it's encouraging for us to finally see meaningful growth from that sort of base IT investments, which we always expected would when they come. But no doubt about it, the vast majority of year-over-year, the strong majority of our sequential growth has come out of AI. Yes. Well thank you, very much Samik. Look and I'm just going to -- from a vernacular perspective, we'll call this Andrew. So it's not to confuse as anybody because we're not buying all of CommScope for buying the mobile networks business from CommScope which is essentially Andrew that was acquired by them in 2007. And Andrew is just a fabulous, fabulous company. I mean as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, a rich legacy of technology and outstanding enabler of all the generations. I mean they go back all the way to 1G and 2G and 3G and 4G and now 5G as a core partner in enabling those next-generation networks and I think yes, for the last year or 1.5 years, we've seen more muted demand in mobile networks. We're encouraged to see that now. I'm not going to tell you that we're smart enough to have timed exactly this announcement to exactly when we started to see that market turn. I think that's more coincidental. This is a company that we have admired for a long, long, long time. It's a fabulous organization with fabulous people, fabulous technology. So that's not -- it's that -- we saw the market turning and then we decided to acquire it, but quite the contrary. These are lengthy discussions. So the why now, I think is not necessarily. I wouldn't tell you that there is a now. It just happened that this was the right time for them and the right time for us in how these discussions go. But the long term, I will say this, the long term for mobile networks is something that we do believe in as a component of the broad diversified presence that we have across the entire range of the electronics industry. And the fact is, all these things that we're talking about, be they AI or next-generation communications or mobile devices or whatever. We are accessing these things by and large through mobile networks today, not through fixed line. And by the way we cover fixed line. We still have our broadband business as a way to make sure that we're present whenever people are getting Internet through a cable or otherwise. But we've always said, we want to be present in a high-technology way as a partner to our customers in every way that people are accessing data. And over the long term, there's no doubt in my mind that the highest growth way that people are going to access data is through -- is in a disconnected fashion through mobile networks. And yes, there's 5G today, where there's still a lot of work to be done to build that out. There will be a 6G, there will be a 7G, there will be an 8G. I've been in the company long enough to have watched these generations unfold and we want to be a participant in that. Doubling down. I mean sure, this is going to significantly expand our position in the mobile networks market which I would argue today is somewhat underrepresented 4% of our sales last quarter. But this is not doubling down for all of Amphenol in that respect. After we make this acquisition mobile networks may represent somewhere in the high single digits roughly of our sales. And I would also put that into context that over the last 18 months, we've made -- now we've completed 12 acquisitions and we've signed two others Lutze Europe and now Andrew to be -- that we'll be closing in the future. And we've made these acquisitions across the range of Amphenol of the served markets that we have, but in particular with the acquisition of CIT and a number of our other industrial markets those kind of slower cycle markets of commercial, air, defense, industrial, automotive those have been a little bit more concentrated there. And we do believe that having balanced across the faster cycle markets and the slower cycle markets, the communications markets being the faster ones, we think that balance is a very great thing for the company long-term and it allows us to continue to have great exposure to every corner of the electronics market. While not having overexposure and thereby being overly susceptible to risk should there be a problem in any given market. So we think this is a great strategic acquisition from a product technology perspective. It's great from a global customer relationship perspective. And it's great for overall Amphenol and what it brings. Not to mention that the 4,000 people that one day will join our organization, many of whom have worked for the company all the way back to the time when it was in fact Andrew they're going to make fantastic Amphenolians in the future. Yeah. Thanks very much Luke. Yeah. Look starting with orders. I mean, we were encouraged actually, I think I can't tell you how long it's been but to have a positive book-to-bill in the industrial market and not just like 101:1. It was like a decently positive book-to-bill that we had in industrial. So that I would say is encouraging sign number one. I would say encouraging sign number two is that we saw with our distributors in particular on a sequential basis. But even on a year-over-year basis, growth in demand from our distributors, the demand they put upon us. And that's a great early indication that the kind of inventory corrections that were happening with the end customer and in the distribution channel those seem to be largely behind us. And I never want to be the guy to call a bottom, let me say that. But I'm encouraged that we actually had meaningful growth on a sequential basis in distribution from the first quarter, and when I say meaningful I'm talking about high-teens kind of growth rate on a sequential basis from distribution. And that's broadly from distribution, but also from the distribution that is within industrial. So I think those are good signs. If you look at our guide here for the third quarter, yes, we were on a year-over-year basis in the second quarter organically down, but we were actually up slightly sequentially in industrial. And then our guide for the third quarter would have us be kind of flattish sequentially on an organic basis. I mean, I talked about the fact that we will grow but that growth is really driven by the new acquisitions. So look this is not to say that all is perfect in industrial, but I think the cognition of the orders and the behavior of distributors those are two pretty good early signs. And as we get into the third quarter 90 days from now and we see how that goes, we'll certainly try to be able to give everybody a little bit more visibility to whether that is in fact happening. The last thing I would say is you mentioned geographical. There's no doubt that the industrial trends are diverging geographically. So we actually saw organic growth in the quarter on a sequential basis in North America and Asia and we saw continued organic declines in Europe. And so I think Europe is certainly not out of the woods right now, but it's encouraging that we see this in distribution. North America has maybe a little bit more distribution than Europe does and to see also the growth that we're seeing now in Asia. Good afternoon, Guy. Yes. No, look, I think in any company there's a process a regulatory process and they operate in a lot of countries, because they sell to mobile network operators around the world. And so there's -- when you have lots and lots of different geographies that can sometimes cause a little bit longer time period. But there's nothing more fancy about it than that. Yes. I mean, I don't know what restructuring charge you're talking about. We did talk about a $70 million acquisition-related charge, which is acquisition expenses, which includes the money that we pay to various advisers who help us do the deal together with some amortization of backlog and things like that. This is not a restructuring charge. You usually will not hear Amphenol talking about restructuring. Relative to auto, I think, what I mentioned is that we do see -- in particular, I would say, in Europe that some of the demand expectations for our customers going to the third quarter are a little bit more muted. But our guide is this is not a severe change in the volumes. It's just a very modest change here in the third quarter. Yes. Well, thanks very much, Andrew. I mean look, I think we had a very strong second quarter in mobile devices, much stronger than we anticipated coming into the quarter. And now with a guide of 20% sequential growth on a higher than we had anticipated baseline here in the third quarter I mean it's \u2013 I think that's a fairly positive view. Is that due to upgrade cycles? I mean yes, I guess every year mobile devices there's new releases. These are very short life cycle products. And so there tend to be new products every year. Whether there's a more significant upgrade cycle I wouldn't tell you that that's necessarily what we're sort of discounting for here. As always, we have a team of folks who work in mobile devices, who are extraordinarily agile. And we have demonstrated over many, many years of participating in this market that when there are additional sales to be had, when there is kind of more of a \u2013 I don't know the term folks use now super cycle of upgrades, we have always been able to capitalize and get more than our fair share of that. So we'll see what happens here this year. I think this is probably a more kind of a normal outlook that we would have and it remains to be seen. And to your question of when would we or how would we participate? I mean if people are making more devices then we'll sell more components to go on those devices. And when they build those will depend largely on the type of demand that they see from their customers. And our job is not to anticipate that but rather to react in real time when there are changes in the demand. And if there are favorable changes, we\u2019ll manage through that and I'm sure we'll do well. And if there are not favorable changes, our team will adjust in real time to preserve the bottom line and that's how we've always operated. Well, thanks very much, Mark. I mean look, you can imagine that we are very serious in both our diligence but also in our interactions with the people. And the bigger the company, the more people you're going to want to interact with. I mean it's pretty linear from that perspective. And so we had a very, very significant review and diligence with both CIT and these businesses from CommScope, which we will just refer to here as Andrew. And both from a diligence integrity of the numbers but also from a cultural perspective, I mean, on one side, in terms of integrity, Carlisle and CommScope are both great companies. They're public companies. They report great numbers. So I think, yes, we do enormous financial diligence around them. But I think the starting point is also, these are public companies with audited financials from extremely reputable big four auditing firms. As opposed to sometimes, you buy family companies and you almost have to sort of do a ground-up audit of them. And you don't have to do that kind of work here. But the cultural aspects, getting to know the people, understanding are they passionate about becoming part of Amphenol, do they believe in the business, do they see the potential, are they -- do they feel even liberated by being part of an interconnect company in the case of CIT, or being able to be a stand-alone business in the case of Andrew, this is really important because we always preserve the management. And we're not going to buy a company like this, if we hear from the management team that they're not committed to being part of our company going forward. And I can tell you that both inside CIT and Andrew, the folks are extremely passionate, extremely excited to be part of the Amphenol organization. Now, relative to margins, I mean, we've been making acquisitions for many, many, many years, as you know, Mark. And at the end of the day, we don't have just one recipe for how do companies improve their operating margins to bring up to at or above our corporate average. We believe that there are no sacred cows. Margin is price minus cost. And we seek to expose them to their sister and brother companies around the world, so that they can see some of the ways that other Amphenolians have gone about improving their companies in due course. And I think both the folks at CIT and in Andrew, and they have different levels of profitability, by the way, CIT is a lower profitability today, Andrew is actually operating at really nice levels of profitability. But we see with both of them long-term great opportunities, both on the top line and on the bottom line. And how that's going to happen, these are exciting businesses with lots of different inputs and outputs. And I'm very confident that the team will find a way, and we'll certainly help them do that. Well, thank you, Will. I mean, look, you asked a question that is so close to my heart. And I think I've even used this with you before. I view my job as CEO of Amphenol really twofold to protect the culture of the company, and to scale the company given that culture. Call it, to protect and to scale. Not quite like the NYPD, to protect and to serve. And I think we can look back over these last, let's call it, 20 years, 25 years even. I've been in the company 26 years. I've been now CEO for 15.5 of those years. I think we've done actually an outstanding job of both of those things. I would tell you that the culture of the company today, across our more than 135, I don't know, 137 or so general Managers, that Amphenolian culture of entrepreneurship is stronger today than it has ever been before as its embodied across those people. The vibrancy and the strength of that entrepreneurship is amazing. I see it all over the world as I travel around to meet with our people. It is so unique and so powerful. But at the same time, we have scaled the company. And you correctly point out, two and a half years ago, we took a big step in the company's evolution with the creation of three divisions run by division Presidents. Each of those are reportable segments, but that was a natural evolution that goes all the way back to even the beginning of the 2000, 2003 when we created our first operating groups, where we had five of those. And that was the first time that General Managers didn't just report to our then CEO, who still happens to be our Chairman. We have a lot of continuity in Amphenol, as you know. And those groups expanded over time to the point where today, we have 15 of these operating groups. These are groups that are roughly $1 billion or so on average in size. We have the three global divisions. And that has created an enormous bandwidth for us both to pursue organic growth opportunities, which are still very, very critical and really core to the company, but also to continue to expand the range of our acquisition program and we've gotten the question over the years. You may have even asked it yourself, Will. As the company grows and if you roughly contribute about a third of your growth over the long term from acquisitions, that must mean either you have to do more deals or you have to do bigger deals. And my answer has always been, for the last 15.5 years, yes, some combination of the two, we will have to do. And I think we can look back and say, yes, we have continued to do that. We have continued to open the aperture of both the number and the scale of the deals that we do. And that is exactly related to that scaling up of our organization. It's interesting though. When you think about most companies and how traditionally they would scale an organization, you would build layers, you would build matrices, you would build really bureaucracies at the end of the day, but that's not what this has happened in Amphenol. In fact, whether it's the divisions or the groups, these are very lean organizations, but they're exactly what our lean headquarters once was before. I mean if you think about the -- when we had just 15 GMs reporting to the CEO, and we would make maybe one acquisition in a year or two. And then when we first started our five groups, maybe we'd make three or four. And now here in the last 18 months, we've made -- we've closed on 12 acquisitions, we've signed two more, and that's included the two largest in the company's 92-year history. And that is just a reflection of the successful scaling of the Amphenol culture. The fact is, is CIT and what we will call Andrew are in different divisions. They report to different division presidents. And you can bet that those individuals are working extraordinarily hard on getting to know the companies, doing the diligence like we discussed with Mark's question, and ultimately bringing them successfully into the Amphenol family. No doubt about it, we would not have been able to do this if we didn't have -- if we hadn't have evolved the organization. But today, we have really almost a limitless capability to do that and coupled with a balance sheet that is second to none that Craig has been such an amazing steward of. Yeah. Look Steve I think it's early. We've just signed the deal and we're obviously going to go through a regulatory process here. And then once we get through that we'll certainly be very thoughtful about the company. But what I would say is this, I mean Amphenol has been in RF connectors from the beginning. I mean we invented the world's first off connector back in 1941. Andrew was really the innovator of antenna technology, one of the innovators in antenna technology for mobile networks. And I think the combination of those two rich legacies ultimately is going to create enormous value for our customers. And I can tell you having talked already to several of those customers, they feel very excited about Amphenol as a home for this important partner for them. Yeah. Thanks very much. Again we've given I think some good directional guidance on the scale of this. I talked about the fact that the vast majority of our growth on a year-over-year basis is really growth in AI. And by the way we had some AI already a year ago in the second quarter. I think we talked quite a bit already about the order patterns and the potential CapEx required for this. I don't really want to repeat myself on that. What I would just say is that the customers they want to work with us because of our technology. And at the end of the day these products, these systems have such demands put upon them, the performance levels that they're being run at are so extraordinary that it is coming back all the time to do you have the product number one? And do you have the capacity and the competency to build that product, and that capacity and competency to build is something that we have demonstrated over many, many years, many different revolutions in IT datacom, but it does require for sure us to continue to make investments, so that we can support this real revolution in AI investments. Yes. Thanks very much Saree. I mean look, I think the end of destocking usually just means that end demand starts to match with the demand put on us by the distributors, because it wouldn't be a restocking if you will. So if you think about, how that would normally go, customers start to reduce their demand. Distributors are left with too much inventory, they reduced their demand by even more. And then once they get to a level that they feel good about, then they try to sort of mirror their end demand with the demand put on us. So I don't think that our distributors are necessarily restocking but, probably they're matching what they're seeing. And that -- again, that's why I say, without saying that industrial is sort of booming here, I think the early signs of the positive book-to-bill that we saw together with the sequential and also somewhat year-over-year momentum from distributors is a good and positive early sign for industrial, but we'll see how it goes through the third quarter and through the end of the year. Well, thank you very much and we truly appreciate everybody's time today. And I do hope that all of you get a little bit of a chance to take some time off this summer and we look forward to being back with you here in the fall just 90 days from now. Thank you very much."

        "content": "Operator: Hello, and welcome to the First Quarter Earnings Conference Call for Amphenol Corporation. [Operator Instructions]. At the request of the company, today's conference is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to introduce today's conference host, Mr. Craig Lampo, and you may begin. \nCraig Lampo: Thank you very much. Good afternoon, everyone. This is Craig Lampo, Amphenol's CFO, and I'm here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO. We would like to welcome you to our first quarter 2024 conference call. Our first quarter 2024 results were released this morning and I will provide some financial commentary, and then Adam will give an overview of the business and current market trends. Then we will take questions. \n As a reminder, during the call, we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures and make some forward-looking statements. So please refer to the relevant disclosures in our press release for further information. \n The company closed the first quarter with sales of $3.256 billion and adjusted diluted EPS of $0.80. First quarter sales were up 9% in U.S. dollars, 10% in local currencies and 6% organically compared to the first quarter of 2023. Sequentially, sales were down 2% in U.S. dollars, 2% in local currencies and 4% organically.  \n Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes. Orders in the quarter were $3.348 billion, up 16% compared to the first quarter of 2023 and 66% sequentially, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.03:1. GAAP and adjusted operating income was $685 million, and operating margin was 21% in the first quarter of 2024.  \n On a GAAP basis, operating margin increased by 110 basis points compared to the first quarter of '23 and 30 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of '23. On an adjusted basis, operating margin increased by 90 basis points from the prior year quarter and decreased by 20 basis points sequentially. The year-over-year increase in adjusted operating margin was primarily driven by strong operating leverage on higher sales volumes, which was partially offset by the dilutive impact of acquisitions completed in the prior 12 months.  \n On a sequential basis, the modest decrease in adjusted operating margin reflected better-than-typical conversion on the lower sales levels, partially offset by the dilutive impact of acquisitions made in the fourth quarter. We are very proud of the company's operating margin performance, which reflects the continued strong execution of our teams. \n Breaking down the first quarter results by segment relative to the first quarter of 2023, sales in Harsh Environment Solutions segment were $916 million and increased by 7% in U.S. dollars and 3% organically and segment operating margin was 26.7%. Sales in the Communications Solutions segment were $1.266 billion and increased by 12% in U.S. dollars and 11% organically. Segment operating margin was 22.6%. Sales in the Interconnect and Sensor Systems segment were $1.075 billion increased by 8% in U.S. dollars and 2% organically, and segment operating margin was 18.2%.  \n The company's GAAP effective tax rate for the first quarter was 16.7%, and the adjusted effective tax rate was 24%, which compared to 20.9% and 24% in the first quarter of 2023, respectively. GAAP diluted EPS was $0.87 in the first quarter of '24, up 23% compared to the prior year period. And on an adjusted basis, diluted EPS increased 16% to $0.80 compared to $0.69 in the first quarter of '23. This was an excellent result. Operating cash flow in the first quarter was $599 million or 120% of adjusted net income. And net of capital spending, our free cash flow was $506 million or 101% of adjusted net income.  \n We are pleased to have continued to deliver a strong free cash flow yield in the quarter. I would note here that we may see slightly elevated levels of CapEx in the coming couple of quarters as we invest to support some of the growth that we are seeing in certain markets. From a working capital standpoint, inventory days, days sales outstanding and payable days were 89, 70 and 53 days, respectively, all within the normal levels. During the quarter, the company repurchased 1.4 million shares of common stock at an average price of approximately $108. When combined with our normal quarterly dividend, total capital returned to shareholders in the first quarter of '24 was $286 million.  \n During the month of April, the company repurchased the remaining authorized amount of stock under its existing $2 billion stock repurchase plan, thus completing the plan. And as noted in today's earnings release, the company's Board of Directors has approved a new $2 billion 3-year open-market stock repurchase plan. Total debt on March 31 was $4.3 billion and net debt was $2.3 billion. Total liquidity at the end of the quarter was $5.7 billion, which included cash and short-term investments on hand of $2 billion plus availability under our existing credit facilities.  \n First quarter 2024 EBITDA was $810 million. And at the end of the first quarter of 2024, our net leverage was 0.7x. Following the close of the quarter in April, the company used $350 million in cash on hand to repay its maturing 3.2% U.S. senior notes and our $750 million undrawn term loan matured and was not renewed. In addition in early April, we completed a $1.5 billion U.S. bond offering, and the company intends to use the net proceeds from the bond offering, together with cash on hand and other debt financing to fund the company's pending acquisition of Carlisle Interconnect Technologies, which we continue to expect to close by the end of the second quarter of 2024.  \n As a result of the U.S. bond offering, we do expect quarterly interest expense to increase to approximately $55 million, although until CIT is closed, we also expect interest income generated from the increased cash balance to offset the increase in interest expense. As such, the impact on earnings will be relatively usual until the CIT closing occurs. The company is in a very strong financial position, and we are well positioned to fund future opportunities as they arise.  \n I will now turn the call over to Adam, who will provide some commentary on market trends. \nR. Norwitt: Well, thank you very much, Craig, and I'd like to extend my warmest welcome to all of you here from beautiful Wallingford, Connecticut, where spring is certainly in the air. As you know as is typical, I'm going to highlight some of our achievements in the first quarter. I'll then discuss our trends and our progress across our diversified markets. Finally, I'll comment on the outlook for the second quarter. And of course, we'll have time for questions. \n Our results in the first quarter were stronger than expected, exceeding the high end of guidance in sales and adjusted diluted earnings per share. We're very pleased that our sales grew from prior year by 9% in U.S. dollars and 10% in local currencies, reaching $3.256 billion. On an organic basis, our sales increased by 6% with growth in IT datacom, commercial air, automotive, defense and mobile devices markets, somewhat offset by declines in the mobile networks, broadband and industrial markets.  \n And I'll talk about each of those markets here in a few moments. We're very pleased that the company booked $3.348 billion in orders in the first quarter and that, that represented a positive book-to-bill of 1.03:1. Our profitability was very strong in the quarter, and adjusted operating margins reached 21% even in the quarter, a robust 90 basis point increase from last year's levels. And from that profitability, we generated adjusted diluted EPS, which grew 16% from prior year to $0.80.  \n Finally, we generated strong operating and free cash flow of $599 million and $506 million, another clear demonstration of the high quality of the company's earnings. As Craig mentioned, we're very pleased that the Board of Directors has approved a new $2 billion 3-year stock repurchase program, and this represents another important component of the company's balanced capital deployment. I'm extremely proud of our global team of Amphenolians. The company's results this quarter once again reflect the discipline and agility of our entrepreneurial organization who continued to perform very well in the most dynamic of environment.  \n Now as we announced on January 30, just after our Q4 earnings, we're very pleased to have signed an agreement to acquire Carlisle's Interconnect Technologies business for $2 billion in cash. CIT as it is known, is a leading global supplier of harsh environment interconnect solutions primarily to the commercial air, defense and industrial end markets, with approximately 6,000 employees worldwide. The company's wide range of products, including wire and cable, cable assemblies, contacts, connectors and sensors are highly complementary to Amphenol's existing interconnect and sensor solutions.  \n As previously announced, CIT is expected to have annual sales of approximately $900 million in 2024 with an EBITDA margin of approximately 20%. We do continue to anticipate that the transaction will be completed by the end of this second quarter. Accordingly and based on CIT's current operating performance, we do expect this acquisition to add roughly $0.02 to earnings in the second half of 2024, excluding acquisition-related costs.  \n As we look forward to welcoming the outstanding CIT team to Amphenol, I remain confident that our acquisition program will continue to create great value for the company. Our ability to identify and execute upon acquisitions really of all sizes, and to successfully bring these new companies into Amphenol remains a core competitive advantage for the company. As our organization has evolved and scaled, so too has our ability to effectively manage a greater number of acquisitions of all sizes.  \n Now turning to our progress across our served markets. I would just comment that we continue to be pleased that the company's end market exposure remains highly diversified, balanced and broad. This diversification continues to create great value for Amphenol, enabling us to participate across all areas of the global electronics industry while not being disproportionately exposed to the risks associated with any given market or application.  \n So starting out with the defense market. This important market represents 11% of our sales in the quarter and sales grew from prior year by a strong 13% in U.S. dollars and 11% organically, and this was really driven by broad-based growth across most segments within the defense market. Sequentially, our sales were down by 2%, and this was modestly better than our expectations coming into the quarter. Looking into the second quarter. We expect sales to increase modestly from these first quarter levels. And we remain encouraged by the company's strengthened position in the defense market, where we continue to offer the industry's widest range of high-technology interconnect products.  \n Amidst today's dynamic geopolitical environment, countries around the world are expanding their investments in both current and next-generation defense technologies, thereby increasing the long-term demand potential for Amphenol. We're well positioned to accelerate our new product development while also increasing our capacity to support this demand long into the future. The commercial aerospace market represented 4% of our sales in the quarter. Sales increased by a strong 20%, both in U.S. dollars and organically and that was really driven by broad-based strength across virtually all aircraft applications.  \n Sequentially, our sales grew much better than expected, 11% from the fourth quarter. As we look into the second quarter, we do expect a modest reduction in sales versus these very strong first quarter levels. I'm just really proud of our team working in the commercial air market. With the ongoing growth in travel and thus demand for jetliners, our efforts to strengthen our breadth of high-technology interconnect products, while diversifying our market position into next-generation aircraft are paying real dividends for the company. We continue to see great, long-term opportunities for expansion of our technology offering to this important market, including with the CIT acquisition, and look forward to realizing the benefits of our growth initiatives for many years to come. \n The industrial market represented 25% of our sales in the quarter and our sales in this market did decline by 1% in U.S. dollars and 10% organically. During the quarter, we did see some growth in marine, public safety, rail mass transit and oil and gas applications but that was more than offset by moderating performance, particularly in battery and electric heavy vehicles, instrumentation and factory automation. On a sequential basis, we were pleased that sales were up 6% from the fourth quarter, a bit better than our expectations, but that growth was really driven by our acquisitions completed in the fourth quarter. \n Looking into the second quarter. We expect sales in the industrial market to remain at similar levels as here in the first quarter. And despite this near-term positive demand, I remain proud of our outstanding global team working in the industrial market. And I'm confident that our long-term strategy to expand our high-technology interconnect antenna and sensor offering, both organically and through complementary acquisitions, has positioned us to capitalize on the many electronic revolutions that will no doubt continue to occur across the industrial market.  \n The automotive market represented 24% of our sales in the first quarter. And sales in the first quarter grew 18% in U.S. dollars and 17% organically. That was really driven by broad-based strength across most automotive applications, including especially communications-related applications as well as electric and hybrid, electric vehicle drivetrains. Sequentially, our sales declined by 3% from the fourth quarter, which was better than our expectations, and that reflected strong execution by our team working in the automotive market.  \n As we head into the second quarter, we do expect a modest sequential decline in sales. But I'm just so proud of our team working in the automotive market. Our continued and clear outperformance is yet another confirmation of the benefit of our team's focus on driving new design wins with customers who are implementing a wide array of new technologies into their vehicles. And while that includes electrified drivetrains, it also includes a multitude of other exciting applications. And we look forward to benefiting from that strong position for many years to come.  \n The mobile devices market represented 8% of our sales in the quarter. Our sales were flat from prior year in U.S. dollars but grew 2% organically as growth in laptops and smartphones was offset by declines in tablets, wearables and other products. Sequentially, our sales declined by a better-than-expected 29% compared to the fourth quarter. As we head into the second quarter, we now expect a mid-single-digit sales decline from these first quarter levels as customers prepare for new model launches in the second half of 2024.  \n While mobile devices will no doubt always remain one of our most volatile markets, our outstanding and agile team is poised as always to capture any opportunities for incremental sales that may arise in 2024 and beyond. Our leading array of antennas, interconnect products and mechanisms continues to enable a broad range of next-generation mobile devices, which positions us well for the long term. The mobile networks market represented 3% of our sales in the quarter, and sales did decline from prior year by 13% in U.S. dollars and 25% organically as we continue to manage through a broad-based reduction in spending by network operators and wireless equipment manufacturers.  \n Sequentially though, we were pleased to see that our sales did grow by 5% from the fourth quarter, as we had expected, coming into Q1. And as we look into the second quarter, we now expect a high single-digit increase in sales, which does reflect some increased demand that we are seeing from our mobile operator customers. While no doubt the short-term investment environment in the mobile networks market has been challenging, I can just tell you that our team continues to work aggressively to realize the benefits of our efforts to expand our position in next-generation 5G equipment and networks around the world.  \n When customers once again drive renewed wireless investments, we look forward to benefiting from the increased potential that comes from our unique position with both equipment manufacturers and mobile service providers. We're poised to build on that position as wireless technology continues to accelerate long into the future. \n The information technology and data communications market represented 21% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in the first quarter grew by a very strong 29% in U.S. dollars and 28% organically, and this was driven by accelerating demand for our products used in artificial intelligence data centers. On a sequential basis, sales increased by 1% from the fourth quarter, which was substantially better than our expectation for a mid-single-digit decline. \n We continue to experience strong orders for AI-related interconnect products. And accordingly, as we look into the second quarter, we expect sales to grow in the low double-digit range from these first quarter levels. I can tell you that we're more encouraged than ever by the company's position in the global IT datacom market.  \n Our team continues to do a really outstanding job securing future business on next-generation IT systems, particularly those enabling AI. Indeed, this revolution in AI that we're all living through right now has created a unique opportunity for Amphenol given our leading high-speed and power interconnect products. \n With machine learning driving a more intensive usage of these highest technology interconnect products, we're very well positioned for the future. And whether it's high-speed power or fiber optic interconnect, our products are critical components in these next-generation networks, and that just creates a continued long-term growth opportunity for the company. \n The broadband market represented 4% of our sales in the quarter. Sales declined by 19% in U.S. dollars and organically from prior year as broadband operators continued to reduce their procurement levels. On a sequential basis, sales were flat, which was slightly worse than our expectations coming into the quarter. And as we look into the second quarter, we anticipate sales to remain roughly at these first quarter levels.  \n Yes, regardless of the current demand dynamics in broadband, we do remain encouraged by the company's strengthened position. We look forward to continuing to support our service provider customers around the world, all of whom are working to increase their network coverage and bandwidth to support the proliferation of high-speed data applications to homes and businesses.  \n Now turning to our outlook and of course, assuming current market conditions as well as constant exchange rates. For the second quarter, we expect sales in the range of $3.240 billion to $3.300 billion and adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $0.79 to $0.81. This would represent sales growth of 6% to 8% and adjusted diluted EPS growth of 10% to 13% compared to the second quarter of last year.  \n I just wanted to note that as is our usual practice, this guidance does not include acquisitions, which have not yet closed, including CIT. I remain confident in the ability of our outstanding management team to adapt to the many opportunities and challenges in the current environment and to continue to grow our market position while driving sustainable and strong profitability over the long term. And finally, I'd just like to take, again, this opportunity to thank the entire global team of Amphenolians around the world, nearly 100,000 of them worldwide for their truly outstanding efforts here in the first quarter.  \n And with that, operator, we'd be very happy to take any questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. \nAmit Daryanani: I guess, Adam, AI, you talked a little bit about AI as well, but it's mainly a big focus for everyone, including investors. So I'm hoping you could maybe, perhaps, help us understand what solutions, what products does Amphenol really sell to the customer base right now when it comes to AI infrastructure? And how does that really differ from what you sell to processor companies versus the cloud providers that are running their own infrastructure? I'd love to just understand that. And if there's any way to put dimensions around how big this business can get for you folks over time would be really helpful. \nR. Norwitt: Well, thanks very much, Amit, and really appreciate the question. Look, we're really excited about the renewed and really revolutionary investments that are being made in AI right now. I mean I have to confess that I am a consumer of these products. I've been using them. It's amazing. Last night, my wife made me tacos because, of course, it's Tuesday, and she went on ChatGPT. And she said, \"Give me a great taco recipe.\" And it's just unbelievable what you can do for these things.\n And the underlying magic of these systems is just extraordinary computations, creating essentially probability models that are based on comparing everything to everything else. And to do that, you need the chips, whether they'd be GPUs or TPUs or sensor or whatever the chips that there are. They need to be connected to each other in essentially a fabric network. And these calculations and computations and comparisons have to happen virtually at light speed. And thus, that requires an enormous degree of high-speed, low latency interconnect products that are different in their architecture. \n You have much more use, for example, of cable assemblies than you did in the past using maybe printed circuit boards. You have really direct connecting as close as possible to the chip of those high-speed products. And these are extraordinarily challenging products to build. These are products that we've been working on for so many years. I mean, more than a decade of effort in developing these products. And they're just extremely challenging, extremely high technology and extremely critical to the good performance of those products. \n But it doesn't just start and end with high speed. I think it's been broadly discussed lately, power and what does power mean for AI? And is there even enough power in the world to energize these AI data centers that people are talking about. And so you can imagine that there's an enormous focus as well on the efficiency of the power interconnect in these systems. And that's another area where Amphenol is participating with some of our leading-edge power interconnect whether that's connectors, cable assemblies, bus bars and all the like. \n And then there's, obviously, fiber optics and the fact of using optical interfaces, whether those are active or passive fiber optic products. Those are all things that we can offer to our customers. And we have the broadest deepest highest technology offering into the data center market. We've been working and preparing for kind of this moment for so many years as we've been developing the sort of type of interconnect architecture that needs to be used. \n And fortunately, over the last kind of 5 quarters or so, that's really taken hold. And I think it's -- this AI seems to really have a lot of value for the end users, it seems to draw an enormous amount of investment in capital, maybe, by the way, even a little bit of cannibalizing of capital from more traditional data centers. And it's not just about having the right products. But it's also about being able to ramp up those products and being able to react quickly to our customers who are really having, in many ways, kind of an arms race. \n And when I talked about the IT datacom market, I mentioned all of our growth. And in fact, a little bit more than all of our growth this quarter, which was very substantial growth. 28% organically came from products that are being integrated into AI data centers. And it's something that as we look into next quarter, where we still have a favorable view of that, I think our team is realizing the benefits of really a lot of labors for many years in the past. \nOperator: Our next question is from Luke Junk with Baird. \nLuke Junk: Just hoping you could help us unpack a little bit more the uptick in orders and book-to-bill being positive this quarter. Just particular areas of strength that are driving that and maybe areas that are still lagging at this point? \nR. Norwitt: Well, thanks so much, Luke. First of all, we're really pleased to see the positive book-to-bill, 1.03. I mean, I know during COVID, there were some funny books to bill at a few points where it was like 1.15:1 and then there were some negative book-to-bill. I mean, traditionally, 1.03 is actually a very strong book-to-bill for us because our lead times are not that long. We're a very reactive company, and I think that's a really good sign.\n It shouldn't be surprising that maybe the 2 places where we saw slightly negative book-to-bill would have been in mobile networks and industrial. Otherwise, we saw either flat or positive book-to-bill and probably our strongest bookings on a book-to-bill came out of IT datacom as well as Commercial Air, which were really good books to bill. \nOperator: Our next question is from Saree Boroditsky with Jefferies. \nSaree Boroditsky: I wanted to dig in more on the Carlisle, CIT, acquisition. It's relatively large. It was held by a commercial roofing company before. So what's the opportunity here being under your ownership? And where do you see potential to improve margins? \nR. Norwitt: Well, thank you very much, Saree. I mean first, I just want to complement Carlisle, the corporation. I work closely with the CEO of Carlisle, who's a wonderful guy. It's a fabulous company actually. And it's true, their focus and their stated strategic focus is to be in the building materials industry. And they were a wonderful steward of Carlisle Interconnect for many years. But there's no doubt that interconnect was not where they were focused strategically. And I'm really pleased and happy for the team, the corporate team at Carlisle because I think they've really been able to realize their vision to be a focused building materials company. \n At the same time, Carlisle Interconnect is a fabulous company. I've known this company for most of my quarter century in Amphenol. It's one of those companies that we actually don't compete with them very much. Very little, actually. It's such a complementary company, but I've always admired the company. And we've always admired the company for their great technology fabulous people. \n And I've known some of the people at CIT also for many, many years. And I just can't tell you how happy I am that they're going to be on our side of the table, but they're going to join the Amphenol family. And that's really just -- it's such a fabulous organization inside of CIT. I mean what we really love about this company, they are a true leader in the technologies around wire and cable; in cable assemblies; in contact technologies, which is just so complementary to our leadership position on connectors and other value-add interconnect on things like back shells and the like. \n And when we bring that together, that offering to customers, whether that's in the commercial air market, whether that's in the defense market, whether that's in certain segments of the industrial market where they participate. We will be able to bring a total solution to those customers at a time when those customers really want to have reliable partners. I mean you think about some of the dynamics that are evident, for example, in Commercial Air, the reliability of your partners is an enormous premium in these things. \n I mean you're making critical devices, airplanes that hundreds of passengers go on and being able to go to one company and say, can you bring us a total set of solutions for our interconnect needs, that has a really, really wonderful and comforting dynamic for the customers. In terms of the profitability. CIT is a great company. It is operated in a bit of a holding company structure. I can tell you that we, in Amphenol, have a lot of different sister companies, brother companies around the world who have figured out lots of tricks of the trade of accessing low-cost manufacturing, of helping to reduce the supply chain and all of that. \n And while the CIT team, they're going to still run this company. It's not like we're going to parachute a bunch of folks into CIT and say, \"Go run it on their behalf.\"  It's the quite the contrary. I mean, the existing management team is going to stay running that company as part of Amphenol, but they will be able to avail themselves of experience of collaborative interactions with folks around Amphenol that in our experience, ultimately leads to better performance. \n We've had a good track record and some may call it a great track record of buying companies that were great companies with great technology, great people, that just were maybe part of the wrong parent company. All the way back to early 19 years ago when we acquired Teradyne Connection Systems from Teradyne Corporation. Again, Teradyne is an outstanding company, in the test and measurement industry, but they were not an interconnect company. \n When we acquired the Advanced Sensors business from GE, and again, GE is an outstanding company. And just as you know, they focus now, and it's now GE Aerospace. It's a wonderful company but they were not an interconnect company. And here again, with MTS, the company that we acquired in 2021. Another example of a great company that ultimately was not an interconnect or in that case, a sensor company. I think as part of now an interconnect company where they really belong. I have really high hopes long term for the progress that the CIT team will make. This will not come overnight. There's no doubt about it. That takes time. And we're patient in that respect, but we're very hopeful and we have really a strong vision for the future of this company as part of the Amphenol family. \nOperator: Our next question is from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. \nWamsi Mohan: Adam, maybe back to this AI topic a little bit. Thanks for all the color you shared. Clearly, Amphenol has been in this space for a long time, and you continue to push the envelope both in terms of data speeds and signal integrity issues. So can you just talk about how you're seeing pricing evolves, maybe generation to generation? What's been the history there? How are you anticipating that given the higher value and kind of much more sort of transmitting 800 gigs instead of 400 gig speeds. So clearly, there's value in there, but the density of applications is becoming more complicated and the unit volumes are also growing kind of order of magnitude, higher. \n So putting all those together, how should we think about just the opportunity here? Is it right to think about maybe you're guiding to like a 30% growth in this end market right here in the next quarter. Is that something that's possible to continue into 2025? \nR. Norwitt: Well, thanks, Wamsi. A lot wrapped up in that question. I mean, look, I guess to the very end of your question, I'm not going to get out ahead of myself and try to give a guidance about this revolutionary thing into 2025. As you know, we give guidance for the quarter ahead of us, and then we try to make sure we're maximizing our position of whatever the market will bring us long term. .\n But I would say this, number one, you mentioned pricing. I mean we are always trying to deliver to our customers' value and so our goal is to deliver the maximum amount of value to our customers at the lowest price that they can get. And if we can deliver enough value to our customers, then there will be some of that value left over for us. \n And I think what you see in AI is the criticality of the interconnect in these systems. I mean there is a direct correlation between the power of these AI learning and inference models and the quality and performance and capability of the interconnect systems because, again, you're talking about speed and latency. \n And so when you think about how long does it take to build a model, well, if you have even the tiniest proportion of higher latency between the chips, then all of a sudden, what may take a month, takes 3 months to build these complex models that are using trillions of learning factors across them. And if you take 3 months and your competitor takes 1 month, and your model is more up-to-date than your competitors, all of a sudden, you as a service provider, are not able to monetize these massive investments that you're making. \n So if you think about that correlation between the speed and the latency and then, in fact, the economics of the models, you can understand that there is a lot of value embedded in our products as it relates to what it creates in terms of functionality for our customers. And whether that's at the chip processor level, whether that's inside the data centers, with the cloud operators, whatever that is. There's no doubt about it that we have to build also our capacity and that these are extremely high-precision products. \n They require intensity of testing. They require intensity of automation. Craig, I think, alluded to in his prepared remarks a little bit that we might see a couple of quarters of a little bit more CapEx, not just for this market, but for other markets as well. But this is one of those areas where we're really building up phenomenal capabilities. And I just have to take one last moment here and answer your question. Like everything that I'm talking about, it's easy for me to say all these things. \n I can't tell you how hard our team is working to execute on these words. I mean again, these are complex products with complex production processes, complex systems, extremely high reliability, a lot at stake because of those underlying economics. And boy, I have rarely been as grateful as I am to those folks who are working 24/7 across Amphenol around the world to really ramp up in support of our customers that are implementing these AI data centers. \nOperator: Our next question is from Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs. \nMark Delaney: I'm hoping to better understand how Amphenol is thinking about capital allocation for the rest of the year, especially with the pending Carlisle Interconnect transaction. Is the M&A funnel still active? And with the new repurchase authorization you announced this morning, but also the potential cash usage for M&A., so just Carlisle, how active might the company be on buybacks this year? \nCraig Lampo: Yes. Thanks, Mark. Yes, I think in regards to our capital deployment, we've had a very consistent policy and practice over many years with regard to our capital deployment and over a whole host of years where we've done a significant amount of M&A and less M&A, and we continue to be kind of -- it continues to be a balanced and flexible deployment strategy. \n In the current year with the CIT, I talked about how strong our balance sheet is, the 0.7x net leverage, the strong free cash flow that we generate and continue to generate. And so I wouldn't think even with CIT, I wouldn't say that, that would have any impact ultimately on our capital deployment strategy. And we did just renew or have a new $2 billion 3-year share repurchase program. Certainly, that's one of the legs and a return of capital to shareholders. We, ultimately over time, we want to return about 50% or roughly half of our free cash flow to our shareholders. \n And part of that is our dividend yield, which is roughly 1%, and we continue to target that over time as well as our share repurchase plan. So I would say this new plan is just consistent with that and our dividend -- certainly policy is consistent with that. And ultimately, that M&A continues to be the focus that ultimately over time, we believe that, that will continue to drive strong returns. \n So if there was a time where we generated a significant closing of deals in this particular year, what we think about maybe dialing back share repurchases. But at the end of the day, just considering the significant free cash flow that we generate, we really haven't had to do that and certainly wouldn't expect this year just with CIT to have any adjustment to that. \nR. Norwitt: And Mark, relative to the M&A pipeline. I would just tell you that our pipeline remains strong. Yes, we completed last year, 10 acquisitions. Yes, we announced in January, our largest ever acquisition was CIT. But I can tell you, we have the appetite, the capacity and the ability and agility to continue to make acquisitions, large and small. And I think we continue to demonstrate our ability to do more acquisitions, do bigger acquisitions. And the beauty of this industry and the beauty of this market is that there's just so many great opportunities to find companies with great people and great technology and a very complementary market position to Amphenol. \n We remain extremely disciplined in our acquisition program, and we will walk away for -- if we get a bad feeling up until the last second, before we wire money. But there's no doubt about it that there's great, great opportunities for us for the future. And as Craig mentioned, like our financial condition is in really a fantastic position with 0.7x leverage here at the end of the quarter. Our leverage will just be a touch above 1, following the acquisition of CIT. And so we have really the capacity, the capability and the appetite to continue. \nOperator: Our next question is from Steven Fox with Fox Advisors. \nSteven Fox: I was just wondering on the auto markets, the 17% growth you talked about. I know you highlighted communications. And I know you guys don't like to count cars per se, but can you just sort of provide some color on the backdrop you're settling into right now and into Q2? And what exactly would you call out as sort of leading products that you're especially doing well on right now? \nR. Norwitt: Yes. Thanks very much, Steve. And you're right, I don't like counting cars necessarily. I mean, the market is what the market is. But look, we have taken advantage, I think, for a very long time, not of an overall growing auto market. I mean, if you look over, I don't know, 8 years or something, it's still sort of a similar level of total worldwide auto production. But there's no doubt that the content has expanded dramatically over these years.\n And I think we've taken a real advantage of that. So when we think about our opportunities, we talked a lot over the past years about electrified drivetrains, the high-voltage connectors, for example, sensors that go into that. But we've also talked about all the other applications. And so when you think about communications, as I highlighted earlier, there's just more and more communications technology being put into cars. And as a leader in RF technology for cars, as a leader in antennas for cars, as someone who participates really across that whole signal chain of communication, that creates a great opportunity. There's other areas like connectivity, passenger connectivity, engine control. \n By the way, there's still the vast majority of cars that are built are using fuel-based engines or ICE vehicles and those require an enormous amount of different contents as well. Most of actually what we sell into cars is agnostic to the drivetrain. But it's not agnostic to the increase in content in cars. As there's more electronics, there's going to be more opportunities for Amphenol. \nOperator: Our next question is from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. \nJoseph Cardoso: This is Joe Cardoso on for Samik. Can you just give us an update on where we stand on the inventory destocking headwinds in the industrial market and how you're thinking about timing of when we see that normalizing? And then maybe as a quickie second, if I can. Can you just touch on the CapEx investments that you highlighted in your prepared remarks? How should we be thinking about magnitude and besides IT datacom that you mentioned, what are the other major buckets of investments there? \nR. Norwitt: Yes. I mean just very quickly on industrial. I mean, I think we continue to see the demand in industrial to be somewhat muted. There is no doubt an impact from destocking with distributors. But it's not just destocking. I think distributors'  orders themselves are also down. And so it's not just that they have too much inventory, but the demand in certain pockets of industrial. I would say, in particular, in places like Europe, maybe to a lesser extent in some parts of Asia and then even to a lesser extent, in North America.\n With regards to our comments on CapEx. I mean I talked about it in the context of AI. But you can imagine, we're growing strongly in a number of our markets, including, in particular, in Defense. We grew last year in Defense by 20%. We grew last quarter by 11% organically. We continue to see strong momentum. And the defense industry uses also extremely high-technology products. We have a very vertically integrated capability and offering to our customers. \n And usually, you can't grow by 20% in Defense-related products. It's just impossible to flex. And I think our team has just done a fabulous job of flexing their capacity. But that may require a little bit more. But look, we're not talking about big numbers here. I mean we said we expect a slight elevation in CapEx. Our CapEx is still very, very reasonable. I think, Craig, it was less than 3% last quarter. And so this is not a big deal. We expect to still have very strong and robust free cash flow through the year. \nOperator: Our next question is from William Stein with Truist Securities. \nWilliam Stein: I'm going to ask yet another on AI. We understand that the 3 main connector vendors in the space, Amphenol and 2 others have very solid positions, very good technical capabilities. I'm wondering if you can talk about the competitive dynamics among the 3 of you, and also the degree to which you can capture some of their share. Or whether it's possible, another entrant among the hundreds of connector companies globally could realistically attack this market. \nR. Norwitt: Thanks very much, Will. Look, I'm not going to comment on our peers. I have great respect for them. They're fabulous companies. What I will say is that we've been working in this area for a very, very long time. And as the leader in high-speed interconnect technology, you can imagine that we also have a very robust position here. This is not something that we have just recently developed. This is a very, very long, intensive and real leading position in development of those technologies. But I have great respect for all of our competitors. \n This AI is a great thing for our industry because it is really a multiple of content because of the unique architecture of these products. And we're not going to win 100% of everything, but I can tell you that we certainly get more than our fair share. In terms of new entrants, I mean, look, there can always be new folks who come along, these are among the hardest products that are made in the interconnect industry. \n And I think I already spent some time talking about the economics of those products and how those economics mean that as a customer, you want to be very careful to not use a product that cannot meet the requirements that you need in these high-performance systems. \nOperator: Our next question is from Asiya Merchant with Citigroup. \nAsiya Merchant: Great results. Just incremental gross margins, if I did the calculation here, right, we're -- sorry, operating margins are very strong. Maybe you can talk about how you guys think about the trajectory of those gross -- incremental margins as the quarter progresses or as the year progresses. And especially when you think about rolling in a pretty sizable acquisition in the back half, how we should be modeling for that? \nCraig Lampo: Yes. Thanks, Asiya. Yes. No, we are really proud of the 21% operating margins here in the first quarter. I mean, first quarter typically is the more challenging quarter in the years, given the sequential quarter typical decline we have. And certainly, we always do a good job. But this quarter really, I think, is an outstanding quarter from being able to achieve 21% -- 30% year-over-year and really sequentially about 30%. And that's -- we did 10 acquisitions last year, as you know, and those acquisitions were significantly under our company average. \n So when you really pull out and look at the organic conversion on our 6% growth on a year-over-year basis, it's significantly stronger than the 30% that kind of in the reported numbers. And sequentially, kind of the same dynamic with the acquisitions we did in the fourth quarter, being well under the average profitability of the company. Sequentially, that conversion really is well under that 30% kind of in the face. So really strong execution by the team. \n I mean the team has done an outstanding job of really -- not only the teams that are growing, but also the teams that are impacted on the negative side. As you know, our industrial market is more challenged and a few other markets as well. And they've just done an outstanding job of controlling costs on the downside as well. So the combination of those 2 really has just turned into a really strong profitability for the company. I mean as we look forward, taking out CIT, I'll talk about that in a second. I would expect that, again, more normal profitability levels on incremental kind of revenue. \n If we talk about the 25% longer-term target, I would expect more in that normal range as we kind of get into more of the normal cadence from a pricing cost perspective that we're in right now. But no doubt our teams will continue to manage in a very strong level and do their best to maximize profitability as they have. But I think 25% or so is kind of what I would kind of expect as we kind of go throughout the year. \n Now when we layer in CIT, when CIT does close, we expect here by the end of Q2, there's no doubt that business is well under our average company profitability levels currently and there would be some impact on the profitability, on the margins, slightly from an operating margin perspective. And over time, we would certainly work and the team would work as Adam kind of mentioned earlier, to get those back up to the company average. But certainly, in 2024, we would expect some impact on the second half from a profitability perspective from them. But it's a great team, and certainly, we would expect over time to improve upon that. \nOperator: Our next question is from Andrew Buscaglia with BNP Paribas. \nAndrew Buscaglia: Following up on that question, CIT, I think at a great price. As part of a holding company, you guys alluded to maybe not run optimally. But is this integration, is this company a cost-saving story? Or if you look at CIT, their growth, historically, wasn't all that exciting. Is this more of an opportunity to reaccelerate their growth? Or is it both? And if you could comment like that potential margin dilution in the back half, what might that be at this point? \nR. Norwitt: Yes. I don't know that we have a specific number to give you for the margin dilution. I mean, we'll talk about it when we own the company. In terms of the priorities, I mean, every acquisition we make, we want them to accelerate their growth and make more money doing it. And so you can imagine that with the CIT team we're already talking about, to the extent that we can before closing, we're already talking about how do they both accelerate their growth, expand their market position, take advantage of being part of Amphenol, take advantage of the broader access that we have as a company, take advantage of the broader suite of technologies that we have to grow their business. \n And in turn, how do they take advantage of our low-cost manufacturing? How do they take advantage of the broader relationships we have in the supply chain? Whatever that may be. And also just how do they take advantage of now being part of a high-performance interconnect company like Amphenol? I will tell you, in years past, when we've seen companies improve their performance, some of that was just they came in and they saw, \"Oh my goodness, I didn't realize I could make that much money.\" And they just figured it out and made it happen. And it's not that we parachute in with a bunch of folks from headquarters or otherwise, but there is inside of the company so many great role models of organizations run by entrepreneurs, run by Amphenol and general managers who have just figured it out. \n And that is -- we don't have an Amphenol business system. We don't have an Amphenol way. The Amphenol way is just to liberate people, to give them the authority and to hold them accountable as entrepreneurs. And that mindset is very different from most other companies. And again, Carlisle is a fabulous organization, the parent company, but they're not an interconnect company. And I think CIT, as part of Amphenol with our unique culture, with our uniquely broad suite of products and relationships, I can't tell you exactly how they're going to do it, but I have a lot of confidence that they will. \nOperator: And our last question comes from Joe Giordano with TD Cowen. \nJoseph Giordano: Just curious like with the AI stuff, is there any inherent margin differential between the products that you're selling on these next gen technologies versus more traditional data center or versus like more of the company average? And then if I could, I asked your competitor this morning. But when you think about the CapEx that you need to do and the scale of what these customers of yours are thinking over a multiyear period is massive. How do you like bring that down to your own spend and like rationalize? Is this doable? Like how fast do we want to spend ahead of something that might be a 5-year story, like how do you balance that? \nR. Norwitt: Yes. Look, I may let Craig comment on the margins, except I mean, it's an easy answer. It's just like look, we make margins based on selling value to customers. If we can create value for our customers, then usually there's value for us to be had there. And I think that's basically what I would say in this respect. Relative to scaling and working with our customers, I mean, you can imagine that we have very intensive discussions with our customers in every market. Here, because of the economics behind it, because of the pressure on our customers and the big vision, you can imagine that we're having even more intensive discussions. \n And so this is not just like you get an order and then you say, \"All right, well, I'm going to go invest XYZ. I mean this is a very iterative, interactive discussion. But it's all done under the context of the Amphenol approach. These are -- it's not that we're making decisions here at headquarters and allocating capital. We have general managers making -- and having responsibility for specific products and they're going to figure out how do they satisfy the customer, but also knowing that it's their capital that they're spending.\n And if they spend more than they should, that's going to hit their P&L, not just going to hit Amphenol's P&L, it's going to hit their P&L. And that accountability of sort of from birth to death of a program is something that I think is very unique in our organization. And over time, when I think about why does Amphenol spend what we spend on capital expenditures, it is in large part because the ownership of that, the accountability, the authority for that is resident in individuals who also go to the customer every day, who also are in charge of the factory, who also are in charge of developing the products.\n And when you have that comprehensive authority, you tend to make wiser decisions about this. And it's not like, well, I'm going to overinvest now and let the next person clean it up on my behalf. These folks are there for the long term and they own it all. And I think they're going to make wise decisions accordingly. \nOperator: Thank you. And I'll now turn the call back over to Mr. Norwitt for any closing remarks. \nR. Norwitt: Well, thank you very much. And again, thanks to everybody for your time today. We appreciate everybody's attention. And I wish that everybody has a fabulous spring, and we'll talk to you again in 90 days or so. Take care. \nCraig Lampo: Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you for attending today's conference, and have a nice day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Craig Lampo",
            "content": "Thank you very much. Good afternoon, everyone. This is Craig Lampo, Amphenol's CFO, and I'm here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO. We would like to welcome you to our first quarter 2024 conference call. Our first quarter 2024 results were released this morning and I will provide some financial commentary, and then Adam will give an overview of the business and current market trends. Then we will take questions. \n As a reminder, during the call, we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures and make some forward-looking statements. So please refer to the relevant disclosures in our press release for further information. \n The company closed the first quarter with sales of $3.256 billion and adjusted diluted EPS of $0.80. First quarter sales were up 9% in U.S. dollars, 10% in local currencies and 6% organically compared to the first quarter of 2023. Sequentially, sales were down 2% in U.S. dollars, 2% in local currencies and 4% organically.  \n Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes. Orders in the quarter were $3.348 billion, up 16% compared to the first quarter of 2023 and 66% sequentially, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.03:1. GAAP and adjusted operating income was $685 million, and operating margin was 21% in the first quarter of 2024.  \n On a GAAP basis, operating margin increased by 110 basis points compared to the first quarter of '23 and 30 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of '23. On an adjusted basis, operating margin increased by 90 basis points from the prior year quarter and decreased by 20 basis points sequentially. The year-over-year increase in adjusted operating margin was primarily driven by strong operating leverage on higher sales volumes, which was partially offset by the dilutive impact of acquisitions completed in the prior 12 months.  \n On a sequential basis, the modest decrease in adjusted operating margin reflected better-than-typical conversion on the lower sales levels, partially offset by the dilutive impact of acquisitions made in the fourth quarter. We are very proud of the company's operating margin performance, which reflects the continued strong execution of our teams. \n Breaking down the first quarter results by segment relative to the first quarter of 2023, sales in Harsh Environment Solutions segment were $916 million and increased by 7% in U.S. dollars and 3% organically and segment operating margin was 26.7%. Sales in the Communications Solutions segment were $1.266 billion and increased by 12% in U.S. dollars and 11% organically. Segment operating margin was 22.6%. Sales in the Interconnect and Sensor Systems segment were $1.075 billion increased by 8% in U.S. dollars and 2% organically, and segment operating margin was 18.2%.  \n The company's GAAP effective tax rate for the first quarter was 16.7%, and the adjusted effective tax rate was 24%, which compared to 20.9% and 24% in the first quarter of 2023, respectively. GAAP diluted EPS was $0.87 in the first quarter of '24, up 23% compared to the prior year period. And on an adjusted basis, diluted EPS increased 16% to $0.80 compared to $0.69 in the first quarter of '23. This was an excellent result. Operating cash flow in the first quarter was $599 million or 120% of adjusted net income. And net of capital spending, our free cash flow was $506 million or 101% of adjusted net income.  \n We are pleased to have continued to deliver a strong free cash flow yield in the quarter. I would note here that we may see slightly elevated levels of CapEx in the coming couple of quarters as we invest to support some of the growth that we are seeing in certain markets. From a working capital standpoint, inventory days, days sales outstanding and payable days were 89, 70 and 53 days, respectively, all within the normal levels. During the quarter, the company repurchased 1.4 million shares of common stock at an average price of approximately $108. When combined with our normal quarterly dividend, total capital returned to shareholders in the first quarter of '24 was $286 million.  \n During the month of April, the company repurchased the remaining authorized amount of stock under its existing $2 billion stock repurchase plan, thus completing the plan. And as noted in today's earnings release, the company's Board of Directors has approved a new $2 billion 3-year open-market stock repurchase plan. Total debt on March 31 was $4.3 billion and net debt was $2.3 billion. Total liquidity at the end of the quarter was $5.7 billion, which included cash and short-term investments on hand of $2 billion plus availability under our existing credit facilities.  \n First quarter 2024 EBITDA was $810 million. And at the end of the first quarter of 2024, our net leverage was 0.7x. Following the close of the quarter in April, the company used $350 million in cash on hand to repay its maturing 3.2% U.S. senior notes and our $750 million undrawn term loan matured and was not renewed. In addition in early April, we completed a $1.5 billion U.S. bond offering, and the company intends to use the net proceeds from the bond offering, together with cash on hand and other debt financing to fund the company's pending acquisition of Carlisle Interconnect Technologies, which we continue to expect to close by the end of the second quarter of 2024.  \n As a result of the U.S. bond offering, we do expect quarterly interest expense to increase to approximately $55 million, although until CIT is closed, we also expect interest income generated from the increased cash balance to offset the increase in interest expense. As such, the impact on earnings will be relatively usual until the CIT closing occurs. The company is in a very strong financial position, and we are well positioned to fund future opportunities as they arise.  \n I will now turn the call over to Adam, who will provide some commentary on market trends. Yes. Thanks, Mark. Yes, I think in regards to our capital deployment, we've had a very consistent policy and practice over many years with regard to our capital deployment and over a whole host of years where we've done a significant amount of M&A and less M&A, and we continue to be kind of -- it continues to be a balanced and flexible deployment strategy. \n In the current year with the CIT, I talked about how strong our balance sheet is, the 0.7x net leverage, the strong free cash flow that we generate and continue to generate. And so I wouldn't think even with CIT, I wouldn't say that, that would have any impact ultimately on our capital deployment strategy. And we did just renew or have a new $2 billion 3-year share repurchase program. Certainly, that's one of the legs and a return of capital to shareholders. We, ultimately over time, we want to return about 50% or roughly half of our free cash flow to our shareholders. \n And part of that is our dividend yield, which is roughly 1%, and we continue to target that over time as well as our share repurchase plan. So I would say this new plan is just consistent with that and our dividend -- certainly policy is consistent with that. And ultimately, that M&A continues to be the focus that ultimately over time, we believe that, that will continue to drive strong returns. \n So if there was a time where we generated a significant closing of deals in this particular year, what we think about maybe dialing back share repurchases. But at the end of the day, just considering the significant free cash flow that we generate, we really haven't had to do that and certainly wouldn't expect this year just with CIT to have any adjustment to that. Yes. Thanks, Asiya. Yes. No, we are really proud of the 21% operating margins here in the first quarter. I mean, first quarter typically is the more challenging quarter in the years, given the sequential quarter typical decline we have. And certainly, we always do a good job. But this quarter really, I think, is an outstanding quarter from being able to achieve 21% -- 30% year-over-year and really sequentially about 30%. And that's -- we did 10 acquisitions last year, as you know, and those acquisitions were significantly under our company average. \n So when you really pull out and look at the organic conversion on our 6% growth on a year-over-year basis, it's significantly stronger than the 30% that kind of in the reported numbers. And sequentially, kind of the same dynamic with the acquisitions we did in the fourth quarter, being well under the average profitability of the company. Sequentially, that conversion really is well under that 30% kind of in the face. So really strong execution by the team. \n I mean the team has done an outstanding job of really -- not only the teams that are growing, but also the teams that are impacted on the negative side. As you know, our industrial market is more challenged and a few other markets as well. And they've just done an outstanding job of controlling costs on the downside as well. So the combination of those 2 really has just turned into a really strong profitability for the company. I mean as we look forward, taking out CIT, I'll talk about that in a second. I would expect that, again, more normal profitability levels on incremental kind of revenue. \n If we talk about the 25% longer-term target, I would expect more in that normal range as we kind of get into more of the normal cadence from a pricing cost perspective that we're in right now. But no doubt our teams will continue to manage in a very strong level and do their best to maximize profitability as they have. But I think 25% or so is kind of what I would kind of expect as we kind of go throughout the year. \n Now when we layer in CIT, when CIT does close, we expect here by the end of Q2, there's no doubt that business is well under our average company profitability levels currently and there would be some impact on the profitability, on the margins, slightly from an operating margin perspective. And over time, we would certainly work and the team would work as Adam kind of mentioned earlier, to get those back up to the company average. But certainly, in 2024, we would expect some impact on the second half from a profitability perspective from them. But it's a great team, and certainly, we would expect over time to improve upon that. Thank you."

            "name": "R. Norwitt",
            "content": "Well, thank you very much, Craig, and I'd like to extend my warmest welcome to all of you here from beautiful Wallingford, Connecticut, where spring is certainly in the air. As you know as is typical, I'm going to highlight some of our achievements in the first quarter. I'll then discuss our trends and our progress across our diversified markets. Finally, I'll comment on the outlook for the second quarter. And of course, we'll have time for questions. \n Our results in the first quarter were stronger than expected, exceeding the high end of guidance in sales and adjusted diluted earnings per share. We're very pleased that our sales grew from prior year by 9% in U.S. dollars and 10% in local currencies, reaching $3.256 billion. On an organic basis, our sales increased by 6% with growth in IT datacom, commercial air, automotive, defense and mobile devices markets, somewhat offset by declines in the mobile networks, broadband and industrial markets.  \n And I'll talk about each of those markets here in a few moments. We're very pleased that the company booked $3.348 billion in orders in the first quarter and that, that represented a positive book-to-bill of 1.03:1. Our profitability was very strong in the quarter, and adjusted operating margins reached 21% even in the quarter, a robust 90 basis point increase from last year's levels. And from that profitability, we generated adjusted diluted EPS, which grew 16% from prior year to $0.80.  \n Finally, we generated strong operating and free cash flow of $599 million and $506 million, another clear demonstration of the high quality of the company's earnings. As Craig mentioned, we're very pleased that the Board of Directors has approved a new $2 billion 3-year stock repurchase program, and this represents another important component of the company's balanced capital deployment. I'm extremely proud of our global team of Amphenolians. The company's results this quarter once again reflect the discipline and agility of our entrepreneurial organization who continued to perform very well in the most dynamic of environment.  \n Now as we announced on January 30, just after our Q4 earnings, we're very pleased to have signed an agreement to acquire Carlisle's Interconnect Technologies business for $2 billion in cash. CIT as it is known, is a leading global supplier of harsh environment interconnect solutions primarily to the commercial air, defense and industrial end markets, with approximately 6,000 employees worldwide. The company's wide range of products, including wire and cable, cable assemblies, contacts, connectors and sensors are highly complementary to Amphenol's existing interconnect and sensor solutions.  \n As previously announced, CIT is expected to have annual sales of approximately $900 million in 2024 with an EBITDA margin of approximately 20%. We do continue to anticipate that the transaction will be completed by the end of this second quarter. Accordingly and based on CIT's current operating performance, we do expect this acquisition to add roughly $0.02 to earnings in the second half of 2024, excluding acquisition-related costs.  \n As we look forward to welcoming the outstanding CIT team to Amphenol, I remain confident that our acquisition program will continue to create great value for the company. Our ability to identify and execute upon acquisitions really of all sizes, and to successfully bring these new companies into Amphenol remains a core competitive advantage for the company. As our organization has evolved and scaled, so too has our ability to effectively manage a greater number of acquisitions of all sizes.  \n Now turning to our progress across our served markets. I would just comment that we continue to be pleased that the company's end market exposure remains highly diversified, balanced and broad. This diversification continues to create great value for Amphenol, enabling us to participate across all areas of the global electronics industry while not being disproportionately exposed to the risks associated with any given market or application.  \n So starting out with the defense market. This important market represents 11% of our sales in the quarter and sales grew from prior year by a strong 13% in U.S. dollars and 11% organically, and this was really driven by broad-based growth across most segments within the defense market. Sequentially, our sales were down by 2%, and this was modestly better than our expectations coming into the quarter. Looking into the second quarter. We expect sales to increase modestly from these first quarter levels. And we remain encouraged by the company's strengthened position in the defense market, where we continue to offer the industry's widest range of high-technology interconnect products.  \n Amidst today's dynamic geopolitical environment, countries around the world are expanding their investments in both current and next-generation defense technologies, thereby increasing the long-term demand potential for Amphenol. We're well positioned to accelerate our new product development while also increasing our capacity to support this demand long into the future. The commercial aerospace market represented 4% of our sales in the quarter. Sales increased by a strong 20%, both in U.S. dollars and organically and that was really driven by broad-based strength across virtually all aircraft applications.  \n Sequentially, our sales grew much better than expected, 11% from the fourth quarter. As we look into the second quarter, we do expect a modest reduction in sales versus these very strong first quarter levels. I'm just really proud of our team working in the commercial air market. With the ongoing growth in travel and thus demand for jetliners, our efforts to strengthen our breadth of high-technology interconnect products, while diversifying our market position into next-generation aircraft are paying real dividends for the company. We continue to see great, long-term opportunities for expansion of our technology offering to this important market, including with the CIT acquisition, and look forward to realizing the benefits of our growth initiatives for many years to come. \n The industrial market represented 25% of our sales in the quarter and our sales in this market did decline by 1% in U.S. dollars and 10% organically. During the quarter, we did see some growth in marine, public safety, rail mass transit and oil and gas applications but that was more than offset by moderating performance, particularly in battery and electric heavy vehicles, instrumentation and factory automation. On a sequential basis, we were pleased that sales were up 6% from the fourth quarter, a bit better than our expectations, but that growth was really driven by our acquisitions completed in the fourth quarter. \n Looking into the second quarter. We expect sales in the industrial market to remain at similar levels as here in the first quarter. And despite this near-term positive demand, I remain proud of our outstanding global team working in the industrial market. And I'm confident that our long-term strategy to expand our high-technology interconnect antenna and sensor offering, both organically and through complementary acquisitions, has positioned us to capitalize on the many electronic revolutions that will no doubt continue to occur across the industrial market.  \n The automotive market represented 24% of our sales in the first quarter. And sales in the first quarter grew 18% in U.S. dollars and 17% organically. That was really driven by broad-based strength across most automotive applications, including especially communications-related applications as well as electric and hybrid, electric vehicle drivetrains. Sequentially, our sales declined by 3% from the fourth quarter, which was better than our expectations, and that reflected strong execution by our team working in the automotive market.  \n As we head into the second quarter, we do expect a modest sequential decline in sales. But I'm just so proud of our team working in the automotive market. Our continued and clear outperformance is yet another confirmation of the benefit of our team's focus on driving new design wins with customers who are implementing a wide array of new technologies into their vehicles. And while that includes electrified drivetrains, it also includes a multitude of other exciting applications. And we look forward to benefiting from that strong position for many years to come.  \n The mobile devices market represented 8% of our sales in the quarter. Our sales were flat from prior year in U.S. dollars but grew 2% organically as growth in laptops and smartphones was offset by declines in tablets, wearables and other products. Sequentially, our sales declined by a better-than-expected 29% compared to the fourth quarter. As we head into the second quarter, we now expect a mid-single-digit sales decline from these first quarter levels as customers prepare for new model launches in the second half of 2024.  \n While mobile devices will no doubt always remain one of our most volatile markets, our outstanding and agile team is poised as always to capture any opportunities for incremental sales that may arise in 2024 and beyond. Our leading array of antennas, interconnect products and mechanisms continues to enable a broad range of next-generation mobile devices, which positions us well for the long term. The mobile networks market represented 3% of our sales in the quarter, and sales did decline from prior year by 13% in U.S. dollars and 25% organically as we continue to manage through a broad-based reduction in spending by network operators and wireless equipment manufacturers.  \n Sequentially though, we were pleased to see that our sales did grow by 5% from the fourth quarter, as we had expected, coming into Q1. And as we look into the second quarter, we now expect a high single-digit increase in sales, which does reflect some increased demand that we are seeing from our mobile operator customers. While no doubt the short-term investment environment in the mobile networks market has been challenging, I can just tell you that our team continues to work aggressively to realize the benefits of our efforts to expand our position in next-generation 5G equipment and networks around the world.  \n When customers once again drive renewed wireless investments, we look forward to benefiting from the increased potential that comes from our unique position with both equipment manufacturers and mobile service providers. We're poised to build on that position as wireless technology continues to accelerate long into the future. \n The information technology and data communications market represented 21% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in the first quarter grew by a very strong 29% in U.S. dollars and 28% organically, and this was driven by accelerating demand for our products used in artificial intelligence data centers. On a sequential basis, sales increased by 1% from the fourth quarter, which was substantially better than our expectation for a mid-single-digit decline. \n We continue to experience strong orders for AI-related interconnect products. And accordingly, as we look into the second quarter, we expect sales to grow in the low double-digit range from these first quarter levels. I can tell you that we're more encouraged than ever by the company's position in the global IT datacom market.  \n Our team continues to do a really outstanding job securing future business on next-generation IT systems, particularly those enabling AI. Indeed, this revolution in AI that we're all living through right now has created a unique opportunity for Amphenol given our leading high-speed and power interconnect products. \n With machine learning driving a more intensive usage of these highest technology interconnect products, we're very well positioned for the future. And whether it's high-speed power or fiber optic interconnect, our products are critical components in these next-generation networks, and that just creates a continued long-term growth opportunity for the company. \n The broadband market represented 4% of our sales in the quarter. Sales declined by 19% in U.S. dollars and organically from prior year as broadband operators continued to reduce their procurement levels. On a sequential basis, sales were flat, which was slightly worse than our expectations coming into the quarter. And as we look into the second quarter, we anticipate sales to remain roughly at these first quarter levels.  \n Yes, regardless of the current demand dynamics in broadband, we do remain encouraged by the company's strengthened position. We look forward to continuing to support our service provider customers around the world, all of whom are working to increase their network coverage and bandwidth to support the proliferation of high-speed data applications to homes and businesses.  \n Now turning to our outlook and of course, assuming current market conditions as well as constant exchange rates. For the second quarter, we expect sales in the range of $3.240 billion to $3.300 billion and adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $0.79 to $0.81. This would represent sales growth of 6% to 8% and adjusted diluted EPS growth of 10% to 13% compared to the second quarter of last year.  \n I just wanted to note that as is our usual practice, this guidance does not include acquisitions, which have not yet closed, including CIT. I remain confident in the ability of our outstanding management team to adapt to the many opportunities and challenges in the current environment and to continue to grow our market position while driving sustainable and strong profitability over the long term. And finally, I'd just like to take, again, this opportunity to thank the entire global team of Amphenolians around the world, nearly 100,000 of them worldwide for their truly outstanding efforts here in the first quarter.  \n And with that, operator, we'd be very happy to take any questions. Well, thanks very much, Amit, and really appreciate the question. Look, we're really excited about the renewed and really revolutionary investments that are being made in AI right now. I mean I have to confess that I am a consumer of these products. I've been using them. It's amazing. Last night, my wife made me tacos because, of course, it's Tuesday, and she went on ChatGPT. And she said, \"Give me a great taco recipe.\" And it's just unbelievable what you can do for these things.\n And the underlying magic of these systems is just extraordinary computations, creating essentially probability models that are based on comparing everything to everything else. And to do that, you need the chips, whether they'd be GPUs or TPUs or sensor or whatever the chips that there are. They need to be connected to each other in essentially a fabric network. And these calculations and computations and comparisons have to happen virtually at light speed. And thus, that requires an enormous degree of high-speed, low latency interconnect products that are different in their architecture. \n You have much more use, for example, of cable assemblies than you did in the past using maybe printed circuit boards. You have really direct connecting as close as possible to the chip of those high-speed products. And these are extraordinarily challenging products to build. These are products that we've been working on for so many years. I mean, more than a decade of effort in developing these products. And they're just extremely challenging, extremely high technology and extremely critical to the good performance of those products. \n But it doesn't just start and end with high speed. I think it's been broadly discussed lately, power and what does power mean for AI? And is there even enough power in the world to energize these AI data centers that people are talking about. And so you can imagine that there's an enormous focus as well on the efficiency of the power interconnect in these systems. And that's another area where Amphenol is participating with some of our leading-edge power interconnect whether that's connectors, cable assemblies, bus bars and all the like. \n And then there's, obviously, fiber optics and the fact of using optical interfaces, whether those are active or passive fiber optic products. Those are all things that we can offer to our customers. And we have the broadest deepest highest technology offering into the data center market. We've been working and preparing for kind of this moment for so many years as we've been developing the sort of type of interconnect architecture that needs to be used. \n And fortunately, over the last kind of 5 quarters or so, that's really taken hold. And I think it's -- this AI seems to really have a lot of value for the end users, it seems to draw an enormous amount of investment in capital, maybe, by the way, even a little bit of cannibalizing of capital from more traditional data centers. And it's not just about having the right products. But it's also about being able to ramp up those products and being able to react quickly to our customers who are really having, in many ways, kind of an arms race. \n And when I talked about the IT datacom market, I mentioned all of our growth. And in fact, a little bit more than all of our growth this quarter, which was very substantial growth. 28% organically came from products that are being integrated into AI data centers. And it's something that as we look into next quarter, where we still have a favorable view of that, I think our team is realizing the benefits of really a lot of labors for many years in the past. Well, thanks so much, Luke. First of all, we're really pleased to see the positive book-to-bill, 1.03. I mean, I know during COVID, there were some funny books to bill at a few points where it was like 1.15:1 and then there were some negative book-to-bill. I mean, traditionally, 1.03 is actually a very strong book-to-bill for us because our lead times are not that long. We're a very reactive company, and I think that's a really good sign.\n It shouldn't be surprising that maybe the 2 places where we saw slightly negative book-to-bill would have been in mobile networks and industrial. Otherwise, we saw either flat or positive book-to-bill and probably our strongest bookings on a book-to-bill came out of IT datacom as well as Commercial Air, which were really good books to bill. Well, thank you very much, Saree. I mean first, I just want to complement Carlisle, the corporation. I work closely with the CEO of Carlisle, who's a wonderful guy. It's a fabulous company actually. And it's true, their focus and their stated strategic focus is to be in the building materials industry. And they were a wonderful steward of Carlisle Interconnect for many years. But there's no doubt that interconnect was not where they were focused strategically. And I'm really pleased and happy for the team, the corporate team at Carlisle because I think they've really been able to realize their vision to be a focused building materials company. \n At the same time, Carlisle Interconnect is a fabulous company. I've known this company for most of my quarter century in Amphenol. It's one of those companies that we actually don't compete with them very much. Very little, actually. It's such a complementary company, but I've always admired the company. And we've always admired the company for their great technology fabulous people. \n And I've known some of the people at CIT also for many, many years. And I just can't tell you how happy I am that they're going to be on our side of the table, but they're going to join the Amphenol family. And that's really just -- it's such a fabulous organization inside of CIT. I mean what we really love about this company, they are a true leader in the technologies around wire and cable; in cable assemblies; in contact technologies, which is just so complementary to our leadership position on connectors and other value-add interconnect on things like back shells and the like. \n And when we bring that together, that offering to customers, whether that's in the commercial air market, whether that's in the defense market, whether that's in certain segments of the industrial market where they participate. We will be able to bring a total solution to those customers at a time when those customers really want to have reliable partners. I mean you think about some of the dynamics that are evident, for example, in Commercial Air, the reliability of your partners is an enormous premium in these things. \n I mean you're making critical devices, airplanes that hundreds of passengers go on and being able to go to one company and say, can you bring us a total set of solutions for our interconnect needs, that has a really, really wonderful and comforting dynamic for the customers. In terms of the profitability. CIT is a great company. It is operated in a bit of a holding company structure. I can tell you that we, in Amphenol, have a lot of different sister companies, brother companies around the world who have figured out lots of tricks of the trade of accessing low-cost manufacturing, of helping to reduce the supply chain and all of that. \n And while the CIT team, they're going to still run this company. It's not like we're going to parachute a bunch of folks into CIT and say, \"Go run it on their behalf.\"  It's the quite the contrary. I mean, the existing management team is going to stay running that company as part of Amphenol, but they will be able to avail themselves of experience of collaborative interactions with folks around Amphenol that in our experience, ultimately leads to better performance. \n We've had a good track record and some may call it a great track record of buying companies that were great companies with great technology, great people, that just were maybe part of the wrong parent company. All the way back to early 19 years ago when we acquired Teradyne Connection Systems from Teradyne Corporation. Again, Teradyne is an outstanding company, in the test and measurement industry, but they were not an interconnect company. \n When we acquired the Advanced Sensors business from GE, and again, GE is an outstanding company. And just as you know, they focus now, and it's now GE Aerospace. It's a wonderful company but they were not an interconnect company. And here again, with MTS, the company that we acquired in 2021. Another example of a great company that ultimately was not an interconnect or in that case, a sensor company. I think as part of now an interconnect company where they really belong. I have really high hopes long term for the progress that the CIT team will make. This will not come overnight. There's no doubt about it. That takes time. And we're patient in that respect, but we're very hopeful and we have really a strong vision for the future of this company as part of the Amphenol family. Well, thanks, Wamsi. A lot wrapped up in that question. I mean, look, I guess to the very end of your question, I'm not going to get out ahead of myself and try to give a guidance about this revolutionary thing into 2025. As you know, we give guidance for the quarter ahead of us, and then we try to make sure we're maximizing our position of whatever the market will bring us long term. .\n But I would say this, number one, you mentioned pricing. I mean we are always trying to deliver to our customers' value and so our goal is to deliver the maximum amount of value to our customers at the lowest price that they can get. And if we can deliver enough value to our customers, then there will be some of that value left over for us. \n And I think what you see in AI is the criticality of the interconnect in these systems. I mean there is a direct correlation between the power of these AI learning and inference models and the quality and performance and capability of the interconnect systems because, again, you're talking about speed and latency. \n And so when you think about how long does it take to build a model, well, if you have even the tiniest proportion of higher latency between the chips, then all of a sudden, what may take a month, takes 3 months to build these complex models that are using trillions of learning factors across them. And if you take 3 months and your competitor takes 1 month, and your model is more up-to-date than your competitors, all of a sudden, you as a service provider, are not able to monetize these massive investments that you're making. \n So if you think about that correlation between the speed and the latency and then, in fact, the economics of the models, you can understand that there is a lot of value embedded in our products as it relates to what it creates in terms of functionality for our customers. And whether that's at the chip processor level, whether that's inside the data centers, with the cloud operators, whatever that is. There's no doubt about it that we have to build also our capacity and that these are extremely high-precision products. \n They require intensity of testing. They require intensity of automation. Craig, I think, alluded to in his prepared remarks a little bit that we might see a couple of quarters of a little bit more CapEx, not just for this market, but for other markets as well. But this is one of those areas where we're really building up phenomenal capabilities. And I just have to take one last moment here and answer your question. Like everything that I'm talking about, it's easy for me to say all these things. \n I can't tell you how hard our team is working to execute on these words. I mean again, these are complex products with complex production processes, complex systems, extremely high reliability, a lot at stake because of those underlying economics. And boy, I have rarely been as grateful as I am to those folks who are working 24/7 across Amphenol around the world to really ramp up in support of our customers that are implementing these AI data centers. And Mark, relative to the M&A pipeline. I would just tell you that our pipeline remains strong. Yes, we completed last year, 10 acquisitions. Yes, we announced in January, our largest ever acquisition was CIT. But I can tell you, we have the appetite, the capacity and the ability and agility to continue to make acquisitions, large and small. And I think we continue to demonstrate our ability to do more acquisitions, do bigger acquisitions. And the beauty of this industry and the beauty of this market is that there's just so many great opportunities to find companies with great people and great technology and a very complementary market position to Amphenol. \n We remain extremely disciplined in our acquisition program, and we will walk away for -- if we get a bad feeling up until the last second, before we wire money. But there's no doubt about it that there's great, great opportunities for us for the future. And as Craig mentioned, like our financial condition is in really a fantastic position with 0.7x leverage here at the end of the quarter. Our leverage will just be a touch above 1, following the acquisition of CIT. And so we have really the capacity, the capability and the appetite to continue. Yes. Thanks very much, Steve. And you're right, I don't like counting cars necessarily. I mean, the market is what the market is. But look, we have taken advantage, I think, for a very long time, not of an overall growing auto market. I mean, if you look over, I don't know, 8 years or something, it's still sort of a similar level of total worldwide auto production. But there's no doubt that the content has expanded dramatically over these years.\n And I think we've taken a real advantage of that. So when we think about our opportunities, we talked a lot over the past years about electrified drivetrains, the high-voltage connectors, for example, sensors that go into that. But we've also talked about all the other applications. And so when you think about communications, as I highlighted earlier, there's just more and more communications technology being put into cars. And as a leader in RF technology for cars, as a leader in antennas for cars, as someone who participates really across that whole signal chain of communication, that creates a great opportunity. There's other areas like connectivity, passenger connectivity, engine control. \n By the way, there's still the vast majority of cars that are built are using fuel-based engines or ICE vehicles and those require an enormous amount of different contents as well. Most of actually what we sell into cars is agnostic to the drivetrain. But it's not agnostic to the increase in content in cars. As there's more electronics, there's going to be more opportunities for Amphenol. Yes. I mean just very quickly on industrial. I mean, I think we continue to see the demand in industrial to be somewhat muted. There is no doubt an impact from destocking with distributors. But it's not just destocking. I think distributors'  orders themselves are also down. And so it's not just that they have too much inventory, but the demand in certain pockets of industrial. I would say, in particular, in places like Europe, maybe to a lesser extent in some parts of Asia and then even to a lesser extent, in North America.\n With regards to our comments on CapEx. I mean I talked about it in the context of AI. But you can imagine, we're growing strongly in a number of our markets, including, in particular, in Defense. We grew last year in Defense by 20%. We grew last quarter by 11% organically. We continue to see strong momentum. And the defense industry uses also extremely high-technology products. We have a very vertically integrated capability and offering to our customers. \n And usually, you can't grow by 20% in Defense-related products. It's just impossible to flex. And I think our team has just done a fabulous job of flexing their capacity. But that may require a little bit more. But look, we're not talking about big numbers here. I mean we said we expect a slight elevation in CapEx. Our CapEx is still very, very reasonable. I think, Craig, it was less than 3% last quarter. And so this is not a big deal. We expect to still have very strong and robust free cash flow through the year. Thanks very much, Will. Look, I'm not going to comment on our peers. I have great respect for them. They're fabulous companies. What I will say is that we've been working in this area for a very, very long time. And as the leader in high-speed interconnect technology, you can imagine that we also have a very robust position here. This is not something that we have just recently developed. This is a very, very long, intensive and real leading position in development of those technologies. But I have great respect for all of our competitors. \n This AI is a great thing for our industry because it is really a multiple of content because of the unique architecture of these products. And we're not going to win 100% of everything, but I can tell you that we certainly get more than our fair share. In terms of new entrants, I mean, look, there can always be new folks who come along, these are among the hardest products that are made in the interconnect industry. \n And I think I already spent some time talking about the economics of those products and how those economics mean that as a customer, you want to be very careful to not use a product that cannot meet the requirements that you need in these high-performance systems. Yes. I don't know that we have a specific number to give you for the margin dilution. I mean, we'll talk about it when we own the company. In terms of the priorities, I mean, every acquisition we make, we want them to accelerate their growth and make more money doing it. And so you can imagine that with the CIT team we're already talking about, to the extent that we can before closing, we're already talking about how do they both accelerate their growth, expand their market position, take advantage of being part of Amphenol, take advantage of the broader access that we have as a company, take advantage of the broader suite of technologies that we have to grow their business. \n And in turn, how do they take advantage of our low-cost manufacturing? How do they take advantage of the broader relationships we have in the supply chain? Whatever that may be. And also just how do they take advantage of now being part of a high-performance interconnect company like Amphenol? I will tell you, in years past, when we've seen companies improve their performance, some of that was just they came in and they saw, \"Oh my goodness, I didn't realize I could make that much money.\" And they just figured it out and made it happen. And it's not that we parachute in with a bunch of folks from headquarters or otherwise, but there is inside of the company so many great role models of organizations run by entrepreneurs, run by Amphenol and general managers who have just figured it out. \n And that is -- we don't have an Amphenol business system. We don't have an Amphenol way. The Amphenol way is just to liberate people, to give them the authority and to hold them accountable as entrepreneurs. And that mindset is very different from most other companies. And again, Carlisle is a fabulous organization, the parent company, but they're not an interconnect company. And I think CIT, as part of Amphenol with our unique culture, with our uniquely broad suite of products and relationships, I can't tell you exactly how they're going to do it, but I have a lot of confidence that they will. Yes. Look, I may let Craig comment on the margins, except I mean, it's an easy answer. It's just like look, we make margins based on selling value to customers. If we can create value for our customers, then usually there's value for us to be had there. And I think that's basically what I would say in this respect. Relative to scaling and working with our customers, I mean, you can imagine that we have very intensive discussions with our customers in every market. Here, because of the economics behind it, because of the pressure on our customers and the big vision, you can imagine that we're having even more intensive discussions. \n And so this is not just like you get an order and then you say, \"All right, well, I'm going to go invest XYZ. I mean this is a very iterative, interactive discussion. But it's all done under the context of the Amphenol approach. These are -- it's not that we're making decisions here at headquarters and allocating capital. We have general managers making -- and having responsibility for specific products and they're going to figure out how do they satisfy the customer, but also knowing that it's their capital that they're spending.\n And if they spend more than they should, that's going to hit their P&L, not just going to hit Amphenol's P&L, it's going to hit their P&L. And that accountability of sort of from birth to death of a program is something that I think is very unique in our organization. And over time, when I think about why does Amphenol spend what we spend on capital expenditures, it is in large part because the ownership of that, the accountability, the authority for that is resident in individuals who also go to the customer every day, who also are in charge of the factory, who also are in charge of developing the products.\n And when you have that comprehensive authority, you tend to make wiser decisions about this. And it's not like, well, I'm going to overinvest now and let the next person clean it up on my behalf. These folks are there for the long term and they own it all. And I think they're going to make wise decisions accordingly. Well, thank you very much. And again, thanks to everybody for your time today. We appreciate everybody's attention. And I wish that everybody has a fabulous spring, and we'll talk to you again in 90 days or so. Take care."
