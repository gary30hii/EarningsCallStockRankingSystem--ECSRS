And as a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Darcy Reese. Please go ahead.\nDarcy Reese: Thank you, Cynthia. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Fourth Quarter 2020 Earnings Call for American Electric Power. We appreciate you taking time today to join us. Our earnings release, presentation slides and related financial information are available on our website at aep.com. Today, we will be making forward-looking statements during the call. There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements. Please refer to our SEC filings for a discussion of these factors.\nNicholas Akins: Good. Thanks, Darcy. And Darcy says happy birthday Bette Jo, this one's for you. But welcome, everyone, to the American Electric Power's Fourth Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. 2020 was a year of tremendous challenges, the likes of which we have never seen. It appears that 2021 has thus far had its own set of challenges. Our hearts go out to everyone that has been and are impacted by the ongoing challenges of COVID, and all the customers impacted by the severe cold and ice conditions that precipitated significant outages from Texas to West Virginia and beyond. There will be plenty of opportunities to do a postmortem of the conditions that led to these outages and to address changes to help ensure these kinds of events do not occur again. But as of now, getting customers back and some return to normalcy is paramount in everyone's mind. I'll discuss these issues a little later, but I want to tell you, in the midst of significant challenges, comes tremendous accomplishments that make us even stronger for the future, and AEP has once again delivered. The fourth quarter further illustrate the resiliency of AEP and its employees to deliver and exceed expectations in ensuring the consistent quality of earnings and dividend growth that you would expect from our premium regulated utility. AEP's operating earnings for the quarter came in at $0.87 a share, ending the year at $4.44 per share, which is the top of the operating earnings range that we projected for 2020, an excellent outcome, buoyed by our employees' aggressive moves to control costs during the COVID downturn of the economy, the arbitrage of residential to industrial and commercial loads that we have discussed in previous earnings calls, and certain tax and investment related outcomes that went our way, along with positive regulatory outcomes in several of our cases that concluded in 2020. Given the progress that we have made on cost control with our Achieving Excellence Program and in updating our load forecast for 2021, AEP is now revising our operating earnings guidance range for 2021, upward from a midpoint of $4.61 per share to $4.65 per share, bringing our new guidance range to $4.55 to $4.75 per share. We're also rebasing our 5% to 7% operating earnings growth rate on the new 2021 guidance range and continue in our view that we would be disappointed not to be in the upper half of the guidance range. AEP is reaffirming our $37 billion 5-year capital plan and are committed to our credit ratings quality as we move forward.\nJulia Sloat: Thank you, Nick. Thank you, Darcy, and happy birthday, Bette Jo. It's good to be with everyone this morning. I'm going to walk us through the fourth quarter results, spend a little more time on the full year financial results, share some thoughts on our service territory load and economy, review our balance sheet and liquidity and then we'll finish up with our revised outlook for 2021. So let's go to Slide 6, which shows the comparison of GAAP to operating earnings for the quarter and for the year-to-date periods. GAAP earnings for the fourth quarter were $0.88 per share compared to $0.31 per share in 2019. GAAP earnings for the year were $4.44 per share compared to $3.89 per share in 2019. There's a reconciliation of GAAP to operating earnings on Pages 15 and 16 of the presentation today. So let's walk through our fourth quarter operating earnings performance by segment, which is laid out on Slide 7. Operating earnings for the fourth quarter totaled $0.87 per share compared to $0.60 per share in 2019. The detail by segment is provided in the boxes on the chart. But to summarize, the change in our collective regulated businesses was driven by lower O&M and the return on incremental investment to serve our customers, which more than offset higher depreciation and unfavorable weather. On the generation and marketing side, earnings were up $0.05 from 2019. This was driven by land sales and favorable effects associated with the retirement of plant and the generation business as well as higher wholesale margins. Lower retail margins were offset by the expected timing of income taxes. Corporate and Other was up $0.10 from last year, primarily due to lower taxes relating to state tax adjustments and consolidating items and investment gain on a privately held investment, all of which was partially offset by higher O&M. So let's take a look at our full year results on Page #8. Annual operating earnings for 2020 were $4.44 per share or $2.2 billion compared to $4.24 per share or $2.1 billion in 2019. Looking at the drivers by segment. Operating earnings for Vertically Integrated Utilities were $2.21 per share, up $0.04 year-over-year. Favorable items in this segment included lower O&M, the impact of rate changes across multiple jurisdictions and higher transmission revenue, primarily due to true-ups. Weather was unfavorable due to warmer-than-normal temperatures in 2020 and a warmer summer in 2019. Other decreases included higher depreciation and tax expenses and lower revenue items in AFUDC. Transmission and Distribution Utilities segment earned $1.03 per share, up $0.03 from 2019. Favorable drivers in this segment included higher rate changes, the recovery of increased transmission investment in ERCOT and the impact of the Ohio transmission true-up, both on O&M and transmission revenue. Other O&M was favorable due to the concerted effort to decrease O&M expenditures through onetime and sustainable reductions. These items were partially offset by the 2019 reversal of a regulatory provision in Ohio and higher depreciation associated with the increased investment. Other smaller drivers include things like higher interest and tax expenses. The roll-off of legacy riders in Ohio, prior year Texas carrying charges, unfavorable weather and AFUDC. The transmission - the AEP Transmission Holdco segment contributed $1.03 per share, down $0.02 from 2019 due to the impacts of the annual true-up and prior year FERC settlements. Our fundamental return on investment growth continued as net plant increased by $1.3 billion or 13% since December of 2019. Generation & Marketing produced $0.36 per share, up $0.06 year-over-year. The Renewables business grew with asset acquisitions. Land sales and other onetime items more than offset the impact of weaker wholesale prices on the Generation business and lower retail margins. Finally, Corporate and Other was up $0.09 per share, driven by taxes from lower state taxes and adjustments as well as an investment gain, partially offsetting these items with higher interest expense. Overall, we're pleased with our 2020 financial results as we landed in the upper half of our operating earnings guidance range. So let's take a look at our normalized load for the quarter on Page 9. Starting in the lower right corner, our fourth quarter normalized load came in 0.2% above the fourth quarter of 2019. This was significant, not only because it was the first time we saw positive load growth since the pandemic began, but it was also the strongest quarter for load growth in over 2 years. For the year, AEP's 2020 normalized load finished down 2.2% compared to 2019. Normalized load has continued to improve since bottoming out in the second quarter of 2020 when COVID restrictions were at their highest levels. A strong finish for the year and our retail load is one of the drivers that enabled us to reach the upper end of our guidance range in 2020. I'll talk a little bit more about why this occurred when we get to Slide 11, where we can view some economic data specific to our service territory. But for 2021, we're projecting 0.2% growth in normalized load. While this will be an improvement from the 2.2% decline in 2020, it also shows that our service territory is gradually getting back to its normal growth trajectory. In the upper left quadrant, our normalized residential sales increased by 5.2% in the fourth quarter and ended the year, up 3.2%. For both the quarter and year-to-date comparisons, growth in residential sales was spread across every operating company. Residential loads spiked in the second quarter of 2020 when the COVID restrictions were at their highest and people were spending the majority of their time at home. Looking to this year, while we expect residential sales to decline by 1.1% in 2021 as vaccinations are rolled out and as we migrate to our post-pandemic lives, we are assuming a moderate sustained load benefit from this segment, given the stickiness from work-from-home relationships or arrangements for many office workers across our service territory for the foreseeable future. So let's slide over to commercial sales in the upper right quadrant. Normalized commercial sales decreased by 2.1% in the fourth quarter and finished the year down 4.2%. Even though commercial sales were down across all operating companies in the quarter, we're seeing steady improvement since the pandemic began. In fact, the same sectors that were hardest hit by the shutdowns in the second quarter of 2020 were the most improved sectors in the fourth quarter. Specifically these sectors included schools, churches, restaurants and hotels. As when you look forward to 2021, we expect commercial sales to experience a modest 0.5% decline as the service territory continues to recover, which is still a significant improvement from the record-setting 4.2% decline we saw in 2020. The improvement in commercial sales will likely track with vaccinations and as a service territory population acquires additional immunity, this class of customers should be positioned for a strong recovery. In the lower left chart, industrial sales increased - or decreased by 2% in the quarter, ending the year down 5.7%. Even though industrial sales were down for the quarter in aggregate, we did have a few operating companies, namely I&M, AEP Ohio and AEP Texas post growth in industrial sales compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. Our projection for 2021 assumes industrial sales will continue to recover and end the year, up 1.9%. On Slide 10, we have a little more color on the industrial recovery we saw in the fourth quarter. The blue bar show the growth in sales to our oil and gas customers, led by growth in the pipeline transportation sector. Our total oil and gas sector sales in the fourth quarter came in 1.3% above last year. In fact, the pipeline transportation sector has been the fastest-growing sector since 2018. The orange bars show the growth in industrial sales, excluding oil and gas. While it was still down 3.3% for the quarter, you can see how dramatic the sequential improvement has been since the second quarter. The industrial sectors that are experiencing the strongest growth for the quarter were pipeline transportation and plastics and rubber manufacturing. This is mostly offset by softer demand from oil and gas extraction, mining and primary metals. Overall, we're seeing evidence of faster recovery in the industrial sector, which supports our projected growth in industrial sales for 2021. We anticipate improvements across most sectors with the exception of the coal mining sector as the industry faces headwinds with the shift toward reduced carbon dioxide emissions. So if you join me on Slide 11, I can provide the update, I mentioned a few moments ago, on the latest economic conditions within the AEP footprint. Starting with the chart on the left, you'll notice that AEP service territory experienced a 2% decline in gross regional product compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. This was 40 basis points better than the U.S. The AEP service territory was less impacted by the virus and had fewer restrictions on businesses than other parts of the country, which allowed our territory economy to fare better than the U.S. throughout the pandemic. Looking forward, the AEP service territory is expected to grow by 4.8% in 2021, relatively consistent with the economic recovery in the U.S. Moving to employment on the right, you can see that the job market for the AEP service territory also performed better than the U.S. throughout the pandemic. For the quarter, employment was down 4.6%, which was 1.4% better than the U.S. This is largely the result of the mix of jobs within our local economy, which has a heavier relative concentration of manufacturing and government jobs and a smaller share of leisure and hospitality jobs. Going forward, we expect the job growth of 1.1% in our service territory in 2021. So let's turn over to Page 12 to check on the company's capitalization and liquidity position. Our debt-to-cap ratio increased 0.7% in the fourth quarter to 61.8%. FFO to debt increased by 0.2% during the quarter to 13% on a Moody's basis, primarily due to changes in regulatory assets and working capital. Our liquidity position remains strong at $2.5 billion, supported by our revolving credit facility. I'd like to touch base on a couple of things relating to our financing plan as we receive questions from time to time on this. So our current financing plan does not include an assumption of any asset rotation. I'd like to share that we do believe it is incumbent upon us to engage an analysis of any opportunity within our portfolio that can generate more value for another party than it can generate for us. So to the extent that we engage in such activity that would result in the sale of an asset or a business unit, the associated proceeds would likely supplant some of the planned equity and/or debt financing you see on Page 39 in the appendix of the presentation today. Nick talked about the severe winter weather in Texas, which impacted both SPP and ERCOT. I want to take a moment to provide some quantification exposure details, since that's top of mind for us and also for you. As you know, the winter storm increased the demand for natural gas and limited natural gas supply availability, resulting in unanticipated market prices for natural gas power plants to meet reliability needs for the SPP electric system. PSO's preliminary estimate of natural gas cost and purchases of electricity are approximately $825 million. SWEPCO's preliminary estimate of natural gas cost is $375 million. To provide some perspective, PSO's annual fuel and purchase power costs are roughly $550 million to $600 million. So you get the sense of how big that is. Importantly, PSO and SWEPCO have active fuel clauses that permit recovery of prudently incurred fuel and purchase power expenses. However, we would expect this recovery to likely occur over an extended period of time in an effort to mitigate the impact on customer bills, which is consistent with the filing we submitted yesterday, seeking a regulatory asset and mechanism to recover the costs, inclusive of PSO's weighted average cost of capital. So we're taking this into consideration as it relates to our financing plans since the payments to suppliers are due in March. On that note, we're contemplating the use of long-term debt and the possibility of making funding contributions to PSO and SWEPCO from the parent company. As far as ERCOT exposure goes, as Nick mentioned, this would be related to AEP Texas' receipt of funds from the reps, AEP Renewables' wind generation assets and the wholesale load served by AEP Energy Partners, this exposure should not be significant. Switching gears. Our qualified pension funding increased 5% during the quarter to 101.8%, and our OPEB funding increased 20.4% to 160.9%. Strong equity returns in both plans were the primary driver for the funded status increases during the fourth quarter. The OPEB-planned funded status also benefited from lower-than-expected per capita and Medicare advantage rates, which reduced the liability. So let's go to Slide 13 to do a quick recap of where we've been and where we're going. So we begin 2020 with a proven track record. Our earnings in 2020 - sorry, we began 2021 with a proven track record. Our earnings were strong in 2020, as we continue to invest capital in our businesses and earn a return on this investment in response to expect the decline in sales from the pandemic and early mild weather, we implemented O&M savings from both onetime and sustainable reductions and we also got some help from favorable sales mix shift. We received approval of our North Central Wind project in Oklahoma, and that will be a benefit to our PSO and SWEPCO customers. In addition, over time, we've been able to grow our dividend in line with earnings and expect to be able to do so going forward. Our dividend payout ratio is solidly within our stated target range of 60% to 70%. So as we look forward to 2020, we feel confident in raising our operating earnings guidance range to $4.55 per share to $4.75 per share. This is up from our previously stated 2021 operating earnings guidance range of $4.51 per share to $4.71 per share. There's an operating earnings waterfall on Page 31 of the appendix reflecting the midpoint of this updated guidance. The primary differences from what we shared at EEI relate to normalized load and weather reflecting 2020 actual results as well as continued focus on sustainable O&M savings from lessons learned during the pandemic. Not surprisingly, examples on the O&M front include things like reduced nonessential travel and training since we know now a great deal of this can be done very effectively in a virtual format, sustaining some of the reduction in material and supply expenses, minimizing over time and efficiency modifications in our field crew practices, et cetera, just to name a few. Specifically, we're originally forecasting our 2021 untracked O&M to be $2.7 billion. but now we are forecasting this to be $2.62 billion compared to the $2.68 billion actual for 2020. So as we proceed through 2021, we'll finalize our pending rate cases and move forward with additional opportunities in the renewable space, supporting our ESG focus, as we transition toward a clean energy future. We will continue our disciplined approach to allocating capital, and we're confident there is significant runway in our capital programs to reaffirm our 5% to 7% growth rate of the increased 2021 operating earnings guidance range. So thanks so much for joining us for the call today. With that, I'm going to turn it over to the operator for your questions.\nOperator: . And we will go to the line of Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Securities.\nShahriar Pourreza: Just a couple of questions - just a couple of quick questions here. Nick, just on the Ohio settlement, it seems like you've been kind of close to a resolution for some time now with sort of the procedural schedule being paused to make room for continued dialogue. Is there sort of any pushes and takes we should be sort of thinking about at this juncture? Is the noise in the state, at all, impacting the conversations?\nNicholas Akins: No. The noise - there's no impact there. We continue in discussions with the parties. And the typical issues of distribution riders and ROEs and that kind of thing. So nothing unusual. And like I said, I think some of the discussions are going positively, and the parties continue to engage with one another. And we all know we have March 4 and I think that could actually be 2 or 3 days different as well. But nevertheless, everyone is focused on getting that concluded.\nShahriar Pourreza: Excellent. And then just on the Racine hydro sale, obviously, had an immaterial impact to sort of the financing plan, but it does sort of show kind of your desire to focus on the core business. So how are you sort of thinking about further asset optimization that could potentially offset some of the equity needs related to North Central? Whether we're thinking about a full utility transaction with an underperforming asset, for instance? Or a partial sale transaction may be similar to the Duke-GIC deal? Any sort of updated thoughts here on incremental opportunities you're seeing in the near term?\nNicholas Akins: Yes. There's a lot of creative ways, obviously, and Duke showed one of those, but there's others as well. Yes, we'll continue to look at all of our assets, actually. And as I mentioned in the call, the time for half measures and talk is over. So we've got to get about the process of ensuring that we're making the way to move to that clean energy future. That means we're going to have to make sure that we're rotating capital effectively and dealing with assets from an optimization standpoint in an effective fashion going forward. So that is a prime motivation for us, particularly with maintaining our balance sheet structure the way it is. We want to make absolutely sure that we manage this process actively in all of those ways. So - and that's why Brian is over in the strategy area to focus on some of these activities as well. So we'll continue that approach, and you'll see more to come.\nShahriar Pourreza: Got it. That's helpful. And then lastly for me, just on Rockport 2 and Pirkey. Any sort of additional thoughts there on the replacement generation and potentially what the implications could be sort of this 5-year capital plan you presented this morning?\nNicholas Akins: Yes. The 3,300 megawatts is an incremental 2,400 megawatts of what we had before. And some of that is related to Pirkey obviously. When you talk about Rockport, that's still yet to come. So there's still plenty of analysis getting done of all of our operating jurisdictions. And that's what I've talked about before, where we'll come out with our plans, which will be reflected in our integrated resource plans, and that would accommodate Rockport in any of the other measures that we have in place to move to that clean energy future. So you'll see that, like I said, by the time we get to the first quarter earnings call or before.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Steven Fleishman of Wolfe Research.\nSteven Fleishman: Just, I guess, first question in terms of the 2021 guidance increase. If you go back to the segment, back to EEI. I think a lot of it is in the Corporate and Other segment. Could you clarify better like what's driving that?\nNicholas Akins: Yes. So in 2020, the Corporate and Other investments, there were some tax-related issues around the tax provisions that were put in place relative to COVID. And then also, there was some investment returns that were actually around - we were an early investor in charge point. And certainly, we had some opportunities there to monetize by the end of the year. And there are warrants that we held. So we continue to invest in different technologies. And we have investments that have gone positively. We've had investments that have gone negatively. And this is - this happened to be a year where it was positive from an investment standpoint. So - but from an ongoing perspective, it really is not so much driven. There still is some investment related activity that bleeds over into '21. But I'd say the story of '21 is, when we had - we didn't know exactly where the load was going, didn't know where the economy was going. We're feeling much better about that and the progress in 2021. And also our Achieving Excellence Program. We continue to advance in a very positive way from that perspective. So we felt like - certainly, the confidence level was much more for us to raise guidance, but also continue to encourage that we'll be in the upper half of that guidance range.\nJulia Sloat: And Steve, this is Julie. The items that we're calling out here, obviously, were much more pronounced in the fourth quarter of 2020. And specifically, as it relates to an investment gain and some income tax items, et cetera. And if you look at Page 31 in the slide presentation, you can look again at that full year view, 2020 actual versus 2021 projected or revised projection, and you'll see that we still have a little bit of an investment gain associated with charge point in that particular column around Corporate and Other. And then we'll have a little bit of pickup on the O&M front and offsetting this is going to be some increased interest expense, largely due to continuing to fund the investment program. So we have slightly higher long-term debt balances out there.\nSteven Fleishman: Okay. Just to verify because I just want to...\nNicholas Akins: Go ahead. Go ahead, Steve.\nSteven Fleishman: So yes, I was just looking at the guidance you gave at EEI for 2021 and then the guidance that you're giving now for 2021. And I think the Corporate and Other is $0.08 better. So it sounds like that's mainly due to a mix of interest savings and then the charge point gains or some other things continuing?\nJulia Sloat: As well as some O&M pickup, yes, improvement, I should say.\nSteven Fleishman: That shows up in the - okay. And that's in the Corporate segment?\nJulia Sloat: Yes. Bingo. Yes.\nSteven Fleishman: Got it.\nJulia Sloat: Versus what we showed you at EEI. Yes.\nSteven Fleishman: Okay. Super helpful. And then one other question just on the SWEPCO new renewable megawatts. Do you have a sense how much of those you are going to be able to own? Are those all owned? Are some of those maybe PPA? Or how do we know the mix...\nNicholas Akins: Yes. We would certainly like to own as much of that as possible because I think it's really important for - from a capital structure perspective and these companies to be well funded and have a firm foundation within the states we serve. We feel like that these generation resources, particularly the renewable resources need to be vested within the operating company. So we'll continue that approach. And that - those are the filings that we'll make. And obviously, some portion of it may wind up being PPAs, but I think we have to get the message across that it's important to the vitality of the operating companies and the operating utilities in these states that we continue to flourish from a capital standpoint. And so I think, obviously, too, the weather events in SPP demonstrate that - and I'm going to be probably testifying again on this pretty soon. But I really think it's important for the utility to have a view of what Generation looks like in these particular events, and the interaction and interoperability of these resources with the transmission and distribution system is incredibly important. I started my career in - as an electrical engineer and system operations, and I went through an ice storm, and actually, I'll tell my age now, it was 1984. But mills were tripping with coal, pipeline was freezing, valves were freezing, all these activities were occurring, and it was our ability to redispatch and utilize the ties and those kinds of things that were important for us to be able to manage through that crisis. And that's why I think it's important for there to be control features in place and from an ownership perspective, be able to focus on ensuring those benefits for our customers. You look at even some of the coal-fired generation that was in place that mitigated some of the impact from a fuel cost perspective going forward with natural gas prices going up so much. So there's a reason for each part the portfolio, and I think it's important for the utility to be the party that runs those particular facilities. So that's my view. And certainly, we'll go into these cases with a firm view toward that.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan.\nJeremy Tonet: I just wanted to start off with - on O&M, if I could? Just wanted to see what you guys are seeing there? Because it seems like it's a nice little step down even versus what you guys had at EEI there. And just wondering, if you could provide a bit more color what you see now versus then? And really, the durability of those savings, as you think about 2022 plus, just sticking around all these cost savings that you're pulling out?\nJulia Sloat: Yes. This is Julie. Thanks so much for the question. Yes, O&M was a nice benefit to us in 2020. And we're going to try to hang on to as much of that and maybe a little bit more for 2021, as you can see in our forecast. So the things that we're looking to, would be things that are not only onetime in nature, but then obviously sustainable and try to take the learnings that we were able to glean from the pandemic really and how we had to operate in different ways. So things that we're talking about include things like data analytics, automation, digital tools, drone usage, outsourcing, workforce planning and then other related items, essentially, those types of things that I mentioned in my kind of preamble at the beginning of the call here. So reducing nonessential travel and training. I mean we've been able to be very successful in a virtual format. So that actually brings a fair amount of cost savings into the pocket as well, reduce materials and supplies to the extent that we can continue to rein in on advertising, minimizing overtime, et cetera. So we're looking at this from more of a sustainability or sustainable perspective, and we'll see what else we can kind of pull out of the hat in terms of additional learnings as we go forward. So it's a little bit of everything. So I can't particularly point you at one thing. And in fact, it's a variety of the entire team pooling together to be able to make this stuff come to fruition. And the track records there, we've been able to do it. So we're going to continue to turn the crank.\nJeremy Tonet: That's very helpful. And maybe just pivoting over towards the renewables. I think you mentioned 10 gigawatts of wind and solar generation in regulated states by 2030, you're looking to add there. And just wondering, if you could provide a bit more color on where you think that could fall out jurisdiction wise? It seems like SWEPCO has a good focus here. Just wondering where else you might be seeing the potential over that time frame?\nNicholas Akins: Yes. That's a number that continues to be in play, obviously. We originally had - I think it was like 7,500, 8,000 megawatts of renewables last time we showed and then adding the 2,400 gets to 10,000 or so. And then as we further update this analysis, like I said, by our first quarter earnings you'll see more renewables being placed in as well. So I think it is a work in progress.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. Okay. We'll stay tuned there. And just last one, if I could. Post the elections here, just wondering Biden's plan for 2035, if that impacts you directly? And also with the new FERC - ahead of FERC here, just wondering what that could mean on the transmission side if you see kind of more supportive actions there and what opportunities that could bring to AEP?\nNicholas Akins: Yes, I think we'll see - continue to see supportive actions by FERC-related transmission because obviously, the build-out necessary to support renewables and clean energy is something that the Biden administration is taking on. And I'd be highly surprised if there's any let up on that. As a matter of fact, they're probably more aggressive than what the industry feels like they can do at this point. But certainly, in order to do that and aggressively meet the kind of targets that are being placed out there, transmission will play a critical role and that means AEP.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI.\nDurgesh Chopra: So just, Julie, real quick, I just want to make sure I have this right. The storm - the last week's storm-related costs, I think when you add those numbers up between PSO and SWEPCO, roughly north of $1 billion, $1.2 billion, call it, the financing plan, the interest-related charges. Are those incorporated into your 2021 guidance numbers?\nJulia Sloat: Not yet. No. And so we have not yet updated our financing plan. We're actually holding tight just a bit here until we get a little more clarity on exactly how this stuff is going to roll out, and we have firming up of all those numbers. As I mentioned, we made an application at the commission in Oklahoma. So that's another piece of that as well, and we will update you as we continue to move forward and make those crystallized plans for you. But as I mentioned, what you can largely anticipate is taking on a little bit more debt. Obviously, you're picking up on that with the increased potential interest expense. And obviously looking to be able to be sensitive to the customer needs, as they try to absorb this cost, but then also managing the balance sheet and the metrics that we really need to have to stay at that Baa2 stable type rating and arrangement.\nDurgesh Chopra: Got it. Okay. Understood. So I guess maybe just in terms of the interest charges and other things, looks like, at least, near term, you're going to borrow debt. Is there a sort of plan to offset that with O&M or other savings in the business?\nJulia Sloat: Yes. Yes. As a matter of fact, there are a couple of things that I'd point out. Number one, we're always going to work to mitigate any potential unforeseen risk, right? So plan do check, adjust as we move through the dynamic year. And the other thing that you may recall, me making a statement about, specifically, in my opening comments here, that application that we made at - for PSO in Oklahoma, specifically called out the fact that we were looking for a regulatory asset with a mechanism that included a WACC. And so that's incredibly important to us as well. I know Nick made the comment several times through his opening comments regarding making sure that our balance sheet metrics are intact. Having a WACC helps us do that because we need to be able to preserve the financial integrity of the operating companies as well as the entire enterprise. So those are the things that we'll be looking at. It's early. Yes. It's early.\nDurgesh Chopra: Understood. Understood. And then just 1 quick follow-up on the Ohio rate case - Ohio settlement discussions on the rate case there. The March 4, is that the drop-dead date or can that be extended?\nNicholas Akins: Yes. It can be extended. But obviously, everyone is sort of geared towards March 4, but it could be extended.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Bank of America.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: So Nick, maybe to start here. You seem passionate about it, and I'm quite curious. I mean you guys have a footprint that stretches RTOs here. How do you think about what reforms and weatherization looks like here? And how that could impact your capital budget? I hear your comments about reserve margins, et cetera, I was just curious if you can elaborate a little bit further? What are your lessons learned from 2014 and 1984 here, as you see them being applied perhaps in Texas holistically? And especially as you see your specific dialogues kicking off whether in Texas, or frankly, the other adjacent states as well?\nNicholas Akins: Yes. So in 2014, I really testified over 3 issues. One was capacity markets and understanding the value of capacity and certainly 24/7 baseload generation. But also the second part of it was the - at that point in 2014, it was the dash to gas. And then was gas and renewables, if we're going to depend upon natural gas for substantial part supply in this country, then we really have to reinforce the ability for natural gas to perform during these types of events. And that means someone's going to have to be able to pay for it and markets will have to compensate generators for those kinds of investments. And then for the utility system itself, it really is around infrastructure to support resiliency and hardening of the system. And also, one of the other areas, I talked about in 2014, was how quickly we retire units and what the replacements of those are and how we're changing the nature of the generation mix and those have different factors associated with the planning and operation of the grid. So those are critical areas where I think for really, if I were to opine on Texas, it'd be more around market reform to support weatherization, market reform around communications that exist during crisis times because it's important for operators to know and even T&D operators to know where the generation is coming from to make adjustments from a transmission and distribution standpoint. And so when you think about some of these opportunities that exist for us, it seems projects, on the seams of the RTOs, is particularly important to have interchange capability. Now for Texas, it may be more DC ties, it could be - well, obviously, it could be more transmission in general, but Texas will have to decide that. But I think there's opportunities for more levels of interchange, more ability to put infrastructure in place to support weatherization and then market changes to support the ability for capacity to be valued the way it should be based upon its contribution to the total grid. So those are key points that continue, and really, we sort of see - let me - with California, you sort of see the same thing. I mean they're depending on heavy level of imports from out of state. If out of state has issues, then they have issues internal, within the state. So when you think about all those things, I think the planning and the optimization of what occurs is going to really carry the day in terms of our ability to better take care of these types of situations.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. Excellent. And if I could just quickly could clarify your earlier comments here? To quote you, I think you used the expression, \"no time for half measures and talk is over.\" Can you elaborate a little bit on the timing there, just as you think about it? And obviously, you're already moving, is probably a question for Brian more than Nick. But what's the timing of this, just to make sure we're on the same page here? Whatever it...\nNicholas Akins: Yes. I think you have to see those decisions start this year because when you think about - I think what's crystallized for us is really the path that we're taking. We're moving to a clean energy future. We need to be able to move from a regulatory standpoint to ensure that we're achieving the balance sheet capacity to do the things that need to be done for the transition and the optimization of the grid, and I think it's really important for us to be able to manage internally, not only from an OEM perspective, but also our assets, with generally what the assets are that contribute to not only an improved return for our investors, but also in terms of optimization of the business itself. So that will be part of the path because you have 2 - you really have 2 - maybe 3 forcing functions, but, one of those is the movement to a clean energy economy, the other is the capital structure and balance sheet of the company and then the third is really focused on those 2 objectives, but ensuring that we're moving forward with infrastructure development and grid development to support resiliency and reliability of the grid. Those things, together, along with electrification, I think, are really going to be tailwinds for this industry going forward, but in particular, AEP is the largest transmission provider, we have a large distribution footprint and we have a significant amount, as I said in the last earnings call, we were on the precipice of clean energy transformation. So a lot of opportunity for AEP. We just need to make sure we manage all those throttles to ensure that we're consistently driving forward.\nOperator: Next, we will go to the line of James Thalacker with BMO Capital Markets.\nJames Thalacker: Julie addressed some of the asset rotation to mitigate your financing needs. But yes, Nick, it's been a while since you've kind of, I guess, updated how you're thinking about how you prioritize growth via the different channels that are in front of you. I mean, obviously, Chuck's working on the nonregulated side on renewables, and you've got plenty of opportunities of regulated growth on the renewable side transmission. Just wondering like how are you thinking about inorganic growth maybe on the regulated side? Or how are you prioritizing sort of all those different opportunities in front of you?\nNicholas Akins: Yes. So obviously, our priorities are around transmission, distribution infrastructure, certainly, on the regulated transformation of the resources that are ongoing. Chuck's business is really with AEP Energy and so forth. They've done a great job of managing risk around that business, but they've also done a great job in terms of their allocation of capital and being able to manage it, not only within their own part of the business, but also in total - the entire enterprise. So Chuck is more than willing to turn capital over, if it's a better use anywhere else in the corporation and vice versa. But we like for that business to be less than 10% of the overall business. So - and it continues to track that. And it gives us the ability to, not only further optimize that business, and you're seeing continued - really continued opportunities on that part of the business with AEP OnSite Partners on special relationships with customers around resources that really drive tremendous benefit for us because we can also approach that on the regulated side as well. So I think there's an opportunity there. But certainly, our focus is ensuring that we're able to move forward with this clean energy transformation and all the optimization around the grid and the grid resiliency and the issues there and do it in a very pragmatic way. That means we're going to have to make sure that whoever is progressing better from that perspective, that's where the equity is going to go, and we need to ensure that we're managing that portfolio in that fashion. So we can now look at this business like it's a fully regulated business, and we can make decisions based upon - there obviously are things that we look at, like, what's the quality of the service territory? What's the quality of the regulatory environment? What's the ongoing view of valuation of any particular entity for us, for someone else? And what that means in terms of rotation of capital in terms of optimization? So we are continuing that approach. And I would say that we said in the past that if we - for all of our utilities, if we see the ability to continue sustainable growth and quality growth in those jurisdictions, they make a lot of sense to us. And then, of course, we have to look at also those that are challenged and understand what those challenges are, can we erase those challenges? Are they systemic challenges? Those are the kinds of things we have to look at, and we'll continue to do that, and that's what Brian is doing.\nJames Thalacker: Okay. Great. And just I guess, just 1 last follow-up on that because I know we're running up on time here. But I mean, when you look at like all the opportunities like you just rolled out another 2,400 megawatts of renewables. Transmission has always been something you've had plenty of opportunities, too. Like do you still look at those opportunities like where you can put earning assets in that like 1x rate base as your best opportunities? Or do you see, as you look across the landscape, like inorganic, maybe M&A or regulated properties or something that makes sense? Or is it just better to kind of stick to your point in the jurisdictions where you see the growth, it's visible, and you've got a good regulatory sort of opportunity to achieve your goals?\nNicholas Akins: Yes. I think our primary focus is due to 1x. And with the organic growth that's occurred and that's really why the previous question about whether we want to own the renewable assets or not? The question is, if we own those renewable assets and that gives us more capacity to be able to invest and we can take full advantage of tax benefits and other things that enable us to continue to organically grow. And as I said earlier, we have a very high threshold for M&A because we do feel like that we have plenty of opportunities. We just have to manage the portfolio in a way that optimizes that going forward. And so that's the way we sort of think about it. And then from an M&A perspective, it has to be strategic, it has to be accretive for shareholders, it has to be something that really produces strategic benefit for us in some fashion of what we're trying to do. But again, that's a high threshold.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Weisel with Scotiabank.\nAndrew Weisel: Thanks for all the good detail on renewables. I just want to dig into 1 or 2 relative to your CapEx outlook. You mentioned the incremental capacity at SWEPCO, and then you mentioned that you'll do an AEP-wide regulated renewable plan in the coming months. Would a lot of that be incremental to the $37 billion? I know a lot of the spending will probably come after 2025, but do you think of that as upside to the plan?\nNicholas Akins: Yes. We would - it's early to tell, but we would like it to be incremental. So we'll be working to help support that. And obviously, as you said, some of its 2025, some of its 2028. So as we progress, we want to make sure, okay, if cash flow increases, load continues to improve, optimization of capital deployed makes a lot of - has a lot of benefit associated with that, then there's a lot of parts in the puzzle, sort of like when we did North Central, we didn't know what the financing plan for that was and we continued to focus on that one. And then we'll also continue to focus on trying to make sure that they are seen as incremental. That's our focus. So whether we have to obviate some of that with the redeployment of capital or not remains to be seen, but the target is for it to be incremental.\nAndrew Weisel: Okay. Great. And then on the RFP at SWEPCO, you mentioned that you'd prefer to own those assets. Do you plan to bid in from the contracted renewables business as well as from the regulated utility?\nNicholas Akins: Well, from the contracted renewables business - our contracted renewables business are maybe rules associated with that. But just like with North Central, we did sort of a turnkey-type thing that really allows us to time the recovery with the investment itself. That's always sort of a preferred opportunity for us because it really is handled well from a financial standpoint and also handled well from a risk standpoint relative to the construction and customers, the risk to customers as well. So I think we probably stick with something like that and whether our contracted business is on the back end or not is another question. I mean, obviously, we don't really care if it's our contracted business or someone else as long as at the end of the day, we wind up owning it.\nAndrew Weisel: Yes. Got it. That makes sense. Then one last one, just to clarify. I think you said you still want that contracted renewables to be capped at about 10% of the company, did I hear you right? And given the overall growing demand for renewables across the country and support out of DC, does that mean that you'll be more selective in your projects or look for higher returns at lower risk? How do you think about that dynamic?\nNicholas Akins: Yes. No. Yes, that's exactly right. We've always managed that business around higher returns. We want to be commensurate on a levered basis with our regulated businesses. And we will continue - as a matter of fact, we turn away a lot more projects than what we actually move forward with. And as you probably have seen, I guess, it seems to get more aggressive all the time about what the return levels are. And it's really - the difference is really what people say at the end of a contract, what that terminal value is. And we really don't want to get into that kind of war. We really focus on those relationships with customers and developers that help us move forward with very positive projects, and that's the way we'll continue to look at that business. And then OnSite Partners and others with specific customer-related issues, like, for example, here in Columbus, we have several businesses that we have signed up for a joint renewables project that we continue to focus on, and we do aggregation of customers in Columbus, which was approved by a referendum vote that AEP Energy would be doing. So it's those kinds of things that we can mix and match with the - and tailor the relationship that the customer is looking for. I think that's what we are after.\nJulia Sloat: Just to circle back real quickly, too, if I could, just an additional comment. As it relates to that threshold in terms of business mix, there are a couple of reasons why that 10% makes sense for us. Number one, to a credit profile risk management perspective, that's very important for us. So that's something we keep top of mind. And the other is really on tax shield associated with debt. So we've got a couple of things that we're sensitive to and just continue to high grade the earnings opportunities from our unregulated contracted renewables business. But that gives you probably a little bit more perspective if that wasn't already top of mind for you because it surely is for us.\nNicholas Akins: Yes.\nAndrew Weisel: Okay. Very helpful. And I just want to echo the congrats to Julie and congrats to the team on another strong year.\nNicholas Akins: Thank you.\nJulia Sloat: Thank you.\nOperator: Our final question will come from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.\nPaul Patterson: So just some quick follow-up, just on the Oklahoma filing, I haven't had a chance to look at it. The - how long do you guys expect to - my understanding, if I heard you correctly, that you're asking for a weighted average cost of capital. I was wondering how long do you expect to have the - how long will it take to amortize the asset, I guess, with your filings?\nJulia Sloat: Yes. Well, actually, we haven't been prescriptive in our filings. So we've got a little flexibility there. And so that's another reason why I kind of mentioned, we're thinking about any potential financing in the interim and how that would map to any potential outcome there. I do know that one of our peer companies out in Oklahoma made a similar filing, and I believe that it was 10 years on theirs as well as a WACC to give you a kind of perspective, but we want to be sensitive to customer bills as well as I'm sure you can imagine.\nPaul Patterson: Okay. Sure. And when do you think we'll get some sort of feedback from the commission?\nJulia Sloat: Probably a couple of months. I don't have a time line yet.\nPaul Patterson: Sure. It's all early.\nJulia Sloat: Yes.\nPaul Patterson: And then just on - a really quick one on APCo. As I recall, you guys were granted rehearing in the - yes, the case. And you guys are also currently filing an appeal, and I was just - if you could elaborate a little bit more on that? Because I thought there wasn't a decision on - okay.\nNicholas Akins: Yes. That's right. Yes, we did file for rehearing, and it was granted and the parties are filing briefs and it stands with the commission. But also, we filed in the Virginia Supreme Court. So - because we're not wasting any time.\nPaul Patterson: Okay. Okay. So just to sort of understand it procedurally, do you expect to get sign from the Supreme Court before the commission or the commission, I would think, normally before the Supreme Court?\nNicholas Akins: Yes. It's normally the commission before the Supreme Court. But obviously, we feel like it's such an important issue and a focus on what we believe state law says as they - it's important for the Supreme Court to resolve that issue in case the commission doesn't.\nPaul Patterson: Okay. And do you know when would the commission might come out? Or any - is there a schedule on that? Or is it just whenever they want to?\nNicholas Akins: Yes. I think it's whenever they want.\nOperator: And speakers, do you have any closing comments?\nJulia Sloat: We do. Thank you for joining us on today's call. As always, the IR team will be available to answer any additional questions you may have. Cynthia, would you please give the replay information?\nOperator: Certainly.

        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Nicholas Akins",
            "content": "Good. Thanks, Darcy. And Darcy says happy birthday Bette Jo, this one's for you. But welcome, everyone, to the American Electric Power's Fourth Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. 2020 was a year of tremendous challenges, the likes of which we have never seen. It appears that 2021 has thus far had its own set of challenges. Our hearts go out to everyone that has been and are impacted by the ongoing challenges of COVID, and all the customers impacted by the severe cold and ice conditions that precipitated significant outages from Texas to West Virginia and beyond. There will be plenty of opportunities to do a postmortem of the conditions that led to these outages and to address changes to help ensure these kinds of events do not occur again. But as of now, getting customers back and some return to normalcy is paramount in everyone's mind. I'll discuss these issues a little later, but I want to tell you, in the midst of significant challenges, comes tremendous accomplishments that make us even stronger for the future, and AEP has once again delivered. The fourth quarter further illustrate the resiliency of AEP and its employees to deliver and exceed expectations in ensuring the consistent quality of earnings and dividend growth that you would expect from our premium regulated utility. AEP's operating earnings for the quarter came in at $0.87 a share, ending the year at $4.44 per share, which is the top of the operating earnings range that we projected for 2020, an excellent outcome, buoyed by our employees' aggressive moves to control costs during the COVID downturn of the economy, the arbitrage of residential to industrial and commercial loads that we have discussed in previous earnings calls, and certain tax and investment related outcomes that went our way, along with positive regulatory outcomes in several of our cases that concluded in 2020. Given the progress that we have made on cost control with our Achieving Excellence Program and in updating our load forecast for 2021, AEP is now revising our operating earnings guidance range for 2021, upward from a midpoint of $4.61 per share to $4.65 per share, bringing our new guidance range to $4.55 to $4.75 per share. We're also rebasing our 5% to 7% operating earnings growth rate on the new 2021 guidance range and continue in our view that we would be disappointed not to be in the upper half of the guidance range. AEP is reaffirming our $37 billion 5-year capital plan and are committed to our credit ratings quality as we move forward. No. The noise - there's no impact there. We continue in discussions with the parties. And the typical issues of distribution riders and ROEs and that kind of thing. So nothing unusual. And like I said, I think some of the discussions are going positively, and the parties continue to engage with one another. And we all know we have March 4 and I think that could actually be 2 or 3 days different as well. But nevertheless, everyone is focused on getting that concluded. Yes. There's a lot of creative ways, obviously, and Duke showed one of those, but there's others as well. Yes, we'll continue to look at all of our assets, actually. And as I mentioned in the call, the time for half measures and talk is over. So we've got to get about the process of ensuring that we're making the way to move to that clean energy future. That means we're going to have to make sure that we're rotating capital effectively and dealing with assets from an optimization standpoint in an effective fashion going forward. So that is a prime motivation for us, particularly with maintaining our balance sheet structure the way it is. We want to make absolutely sure that we manage this process actively in all of those ways. So - and that's why Brian is over in the strategy area to focus on some of these activities as well. So we'll continue that approach, and you'll see more to come. Yes. The 3,300 megawatts is an incremental 2,400 megawatts of what we had before. And some of that is related to Pirkey obviously. When you talk about Rockport, that's still yet to come. So there's still plenty of analysis getting done of all of our operating jurisdictions. And that's what I've talked about before, where we'll come out with our plans, which will be reflected in our integrated resource plans, and that would accommodate Rockport in any of the other measures that we have in place to move to that clean energy future. So you'll see that, like I said, by the time we get to the first quarter earnings call or before. Yes. So in 2020, the Corporate and Other investments, there were some tax-related issues around the tax provisions that were put in place relative to COVID. And then also, there was some investment returns that were actually around - we were an early investor in charge point. And certainly, we had some opportunities there to monetize by the end of the year. And there are warrants that we held. So we continue to invest in different technologies. And we have investments that have gone positively. We've had investments that have gone negatively. And this is - this happened to be a year where it was positive from an investment standpoint. So - but from an ongoing perspective, it really is not so much driven. There still is some investment related activity that bleeds over into '21. But I'd say the story of '21 is, when we had - we didn't know exactly where the load was going, didn't know where the economy was going. We're feeling much better about that and the progress in 2021. And also our Achieving Excellence Program. We continue to advance in a very positive way from that perspective. So we felt like - certainly, the confidence level was much more for us to raise guidance, but also continue to encourage that we'll be in the upper half of that guidance range. Go ahead. Go ahead, Steve. Yes. We would certainly like to own as much of that as possible because I think it's really important for - from a capital structure perspective and these companies to be well funded and have a firm foundation within the states we serve. We feel like that these generation resources, particularly the renewable resources need to be vested within the operating company. So we'll continue that approach. And that - those are the filings that we'll make. And obviously, some portion of it may wind up being PPAs, but I think we have to get the message across that it's important to the vitality of the operating companies and the operating utilities in these states that we continue to flourish from a capital standpoint. And so I think, obviously, too, the weather events in SPP demonstrate that - and I'm going to be probably testifying again on this pretty soon. But I really think it's important for the utility to have a view of what Generation looks like in these particular events, and the interaction and interoperability of these resources with the transmission and distribution system is incredibly important. I started my career in - as an electrical engineer and system operations, and I went through an ice storm, and actually, I'll tell my age now, it was 1984. But mills were tripping with coal, pipeline was freezing, valves were freezing, all these activities were occurring, and it was our ability to redispatch and utilize the ties and those kinds of things that were important for us to be able to manage through that crisis. And that's why I think it's important for there to be control features in place and from an ownership perspective, be able to focus on ensuring those benefits for our customers. You look at even some of the coal-fired generation that was in place that mitigated some of the impact from a fuel cost perspective going forward with natural gas prices going up so much. So there's a reason for each part the portfolio, and I think it's important for the utility to be the party that runs those particular facilities. So that's my view. And certainly, we'll go into these cases with a firm view toward that. Yes. That's a number that continues to be in play, obviously. We originally had - I think it was like 7,500, 8,000 megawatts of renewables last time we showed and then adding the 2,400 gets to 10,000 or so. And then as we further update this analysis, like I said, by our first quarter earnings you'll see more renewables being placed in as well. So I think it is a work in progress. Yes, I think we'll see - continue to see supportive actions by FERC-related transmission because obviously, the build-out necessary to support renewables and clean energy is something that the Biden administration is taking on. And I'd be highly surprised if there's any let up on that. As a matter of fact, they're probably more aggressive than what the industry feels like they can do at this point. But certainly, in order to do that and aggressively meet the kind of targets that are being placed out there, transmission will play a critical role and that means AEP. Yes. It can be extended. But obviously, everyone is sort of geared towards March 4, but it could be extended. Yes. So in 2014, I really testified over 3 issues. One was capacity markets and understanding the value of capacity and certainly 24/7 baseload generation. But also the second part of it was the - at that point in 2014, it was the dash to gas. And then was gas and renewables, if we're going to depend upon natural gas for substantial part supply in this country, then we really have to reinforce the ability for natural gas to perform during these types of events.

And then for the utility system itself, it really is around infrastructure to support resiliency and hardening of the system. And also, one of the other areas, I talked about in 2014, was how quickly we retire units and what the replacements of those are and how we're changing the nature of the generation mix and those have different factors associated with the planning and operation of the grid. So those are critical areas where I think for really, if I were to opine on Texas, it'd be more around market reform to support weatherization, market reform around communications that exist during crisis times because it's important for operators to know and even T&D operators to know where the generation is coming from to make adjustments from a transmission and distribution standpoint. And so when you think about some of these opportunities that exist for us, it seems projects, on the seams of the RTOs, is particularly important to have interchange capability. Now for Texas, it may be more DC ties, it could be - well, obviously, it could be more transmission in general, but Texas will have to decide that. But I think there's opportunities for more levels of interchange, more ability to put infrastructure in place to support weatherization and then market changes to support the ability for capacity to be valued the way it should be based upon its contribution to the total grid. So those are key points that continue, and really, we sort of see - let me - with California, you sort of see the same thing. I mean they're depending on heavy level of imports from out of state. If out of state has issues, then they have issues internal, within the state. So when you think about all those things, I think the planning and the optimization of what occurs is going to really carry the day in terms of our ability to better take care of these types of situations.

And then, of course, we have to look at also those that are challenged and understand what those challenges are, can we erase those challenges? Are they systemic challenges? Those are the kinds of things we have to look at, and we'll continue to do that, and that's what Brian is doing. Yes. I think our primary focus is due to 1x. And with the organic growth that's occurred and that's really why the previous question about whether we want to own the renewable assets or not? The question is, if we own those renewable assets and that gives us more capacity to be able to invest and we can take full advantage of tax benefits and other things that enable us to continue to organically grow. And as I said earlier, we have a very high threshold for M&A because we do feel like that we have plenty of opportunities. We just have to manage the portfolio in a way that optimizes that going forward. And so that's the way we sort of think about it. And then from an M&A perspective, it has to be strategic, it has to be accretive for shareholders, it has to be something that really produces strategic benefit for us in some fashion of what we're trying to do. But again, that's a high threshold. Yes. We would - it's early to tell, but we would like it to be incremental. So we'll be working to help support that. And obviously, as you said, some of its 2025, some of its 2028. So as we progress, we want to make sure, okay, if cash flow increases, load continues to improve, optimization of capital deployed makes a lot of - has a lot of benefit associated with that, then there's a lot of parts in the puzzle, sort of like when we did North Central, we didn't know what the financing plan for that was and we continued to focus on that one. And then we'll also continue to focus on trying to make sure that they are seen as incremental. That's our focus. So whether we have to obviate some of that with the redeployment of capital or not remains to be seen, but the target is for it to be incremental. Well, from the contracted renewables business - our contracted renewables business are maybe rules associated with that. But just like with North Central, we did sort of a turnkey-type thing that really allows us to time the recovery with the investment itself. That's always sort of a preferred opportunity for us because it really is handled well from a financial standpoint and also handled well from a risk standpoint relative to the construction and customers, the risk to customers as well. So I think we probably stick with something like that and whether our contracted business is on the back end or not is another question. I mean, obviously, we don't really care if it's our contracted business or someone else as long as at the end of the day, we wind up owning it. Yes. No. Yes, that's exactly right. We've always managed that business around higher returns. We want to be commensurate on a levered basis with our regulated businesses. And we will continue - as a matter of fact, we turn away a lot more projects than what we actually move forward with. And as you probably have seen, I guess, it seems to get more aggressive all the time about what the return levels are. And it's really - the difference is really what people say at the end of a contract, what that terminal value is. And we really don't want to get into that kind of war. We really focus on those relationships with customers and developers that help us move forward with very positive projects, and that's the way we'll continue to look at that business. And then OnSite Partners and others with specific customer-related issues, like, for example, here in Columbus, we have several businesses that we have signed up for a joint renewables project that we continue to focus on, and we do aggregation of customers in Columbus, which was approved by a referendum vote that AEP Energy would be doing. So it's those kinds of things that we can mix and match with the - and tailor the relationship that the customer is looking for. I think that's what we are after. Yes. Thank you. Yes. That's right. Yes, we did file for rehearing, and it was granted and the parties are filing briefs and it stands with the commission. But also, we filed in the Virginia Supreme Court. So - because we're not wasting any time. Yes. It's normally the commission before the Supreme Court. But obviously, we feel like it's such an important issue and a focus on what we believe state law says as they - it's important for the Supreme Court to resolve that issue in case the commission doesn't. Yes. I think it's whenever they want."

            "content": "Thank you, Nick. Thank you, Darcy, and happy birthday, Bette Jo. It's good to be with everyone this morning. I'm going to walk us through the fourth quarter results, spend a little more time on the full year financial results, share some thoughts on our service territory load and economy, review our balance sheet and liquidity and then we'll finish up with our revised outlook for 2021. So let's go to Slide 6, which shows the comparison of GAAP to operating earnings for the quarter and for the year-to-date periods. GAAP earnings for the fourth quarter were $0.88 per share compared to $0.31 per share in 2019. GAAP earnings for the year were $4.44 per share compared to $3.89 per share in 2019. There's a reconciliation of GAAP to operating earnings on Pages 15 and 16 of the presentation today. So let's walk through our fourth quarter operating earnings performance by segment, which is laid out on Slide 7. Operating earnings for the fourth quarter totaled $0.87 per share compared to $0.60 per share in 2019. The detail by segment is provided in the boxes on the chart. But to summarize, the change in our collective regulated businesses was driven by lower O&M and the return on incremental investment to serve our customers, which more than offset higher depreciation and unfavorable weather. On the generation and marketing side, earnings were up $0.05 from 2019. This was driven by land sales and favorable effects associated with the retirement of plant and the generation business as well as higher wholesale margins. Lower retail margins were offset by the expected timing of income taxes. Corporate and Other was up $0.10 from last year, primarily due to lower taxes relating to state tax adjustments and consolidating items and investment gain on a privately held investment, all of which was partially offset by higher O&M. So let's take a look at our full year results on Page #8. Annual operating earnings for 2020 were $4.44 per share or $2.2 billion compared to $4.24 per share or $2.1 billion in 2019. Looking at the drivers by segment. Operating earnings for Vertically Integrated Utilities were $2.21 per share, up $0.04 year-over-year. Favorable items in this segment included lower O&M, the impact of rate changes across multiple jurisdictions and higher transmission revenue, primarily due to true-ups. Weather was unfavorable due to warmer-than-normal temperatures in 2020 and a warmer summer in 2019. Other decreases included higher depreciation and tax expenses and lower revenue items in AFUDC. Transmission and Distribution Utilities segment earned $1.03 per share, up $0.03 from 2019. Favorable drivers in this segment included higher rate changes, the recovery of increased transmission investment in ERCOT and the impact of the Ohio transmission true-up, both on O&M and transmission revenue. Other O&M was favorable due to the concerted effort to decrease O&M expenditures through onetime and sustainable reductions. These items were partially offset by the 2019 reversal of a regulatory provision in Ohio and higher depreciation associated with the increased investment. Other smaller drivers include things like higher interest and tax expenses. The roll-off of legacy riders in Ohio, prior year Texas carrying charges, unfavorable weather and AFUDC. The transmission - the AEP Transmission Holdco segment contributed $1.03 per share, down $0.02 from 2019 due to the impacts of the annual true-up and prior year FERC settlements. Our fundamental return on investment growth continued as net plant increased by $1.3 billion or 13% since December of 2019. Generation & Marketing produced $0.36 per share, up $0.06 year-over-year. The Renewables business grew with asset acquisitions. Land sales and other onetime items more than offset the impact of weaker wholesale prices on the Generation business and lower retail margins. Finally, Corporate and Other was up $0.09 per share, driven by taxes from lower state taxes and adjustments as well as an investment gain, partially offsetting these items with higher interest expense. Overall, we're pleased with our 2020 financial results as we landed in the upper half of our operating earnings guidance range. So let's take a look at our normalized load for the quarter on Page 9. Starting in the lower right corner, our fourth quarter normalized load came in 0.2% above the fourth quarter of 2019. This was significant, not only because it was the first time we saw positive load growth since the pandemic began, but it was also the strongest quarter for load growth in over 2 years. For the year, AEP's 2020 normalized load finished down 2.2% compared to 2019. Normalized load has continued to improve since bottoming out in the second quarter of 2020 when COVID restrictions were at their highest levels. A strong finish for the year and our retail load is one of the drivers that enabled us to reach the upper end of our guidance range in 2020. I'll talk a little bit more about why this occurred when we get to Slide 11, where we can view some economic data specific to our service territory. But for 2021, we're projecting 0.2% growth in normalized load. While this will be an improvement from the 2.2% decline in 2020, it also shows that our service territory is gradually getting back to its normal growth trajectory. In the upper left quadrant, our normalized residential sales increased by 5.2% in the fourth quarter and ended the year, up 3.2%. For both the quarter and year-to-date comparisons, growth in residential sales was spread across every operating company. Residential loads spiked in the second quarter of 2020 when the COVID restrictions were at their highest and people were spending the majority of their time at home. Looking to this year, while we expect residential sales to decline by 1.1% in 2021 as vaccinations are rolled out and as we migrate to our post-pandemic lives, we are assuming a moderate sustained load benefit from this segment, given the stickiness from work-from-home relationships or arrangements for many office workers across our service territory for the foreseeable future. So let's slide over to commercial sales in the upper right quadrant. Normalized commercial sales decreased by 2.1% in the fourth quarter and finished the year down 4.2%. Even though commercial sales were down across all operating companies in the quarter, we're seeing steady improvement since the pandemic began. In fact, the same sectors that were hardest hit by the shutdowns in the second quarter of 2020 were the most improved sectors in the fourth quarter. Specifically these sectors included schools, churches, restaurants and hotels. As when you look forward to 2021, we expect commercial sales to experience a modest 0.5% decline as the service territory continues to recover, which is still a significant improvement from the record-setting 4.2% decline we saw in 2020. The improvement in commercial sales will likely track with vaccinations and as a service territory population acquires additional immunity, this class of customers should be positioned for a strong recovery. In the lower left chart, industrial sales increased - or decreased by 2% in the quarter, ending the year down 5.7%. Even though industrial sales were down for the quarter in aggregate, we did have a few operating companies, namely I&M, AEP Ohio and AEP Texas post growth in industrial sales compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. Our projection for 2021 assumes industrial sales will continue to recover and end the year, up 1.9%. On Slide 10, we have a little more color on the industrial recovery we saw in the fourth quarter. The blue bar show the growth in sales to our oil and gas customers, led by growth in the pipeline transportation sector. Our total oil and gas sector sales in the fourth quarter came in 1.3% above last year. In fact, the pipeline transportation sector has been the fastest-growing sector since 2018. The orange bars show the growth in industrial sales, excluding oil and gas. While it was still down 3.3% for the quarter, you can see how dramatic the sequential improvement has been since the second quarter. The industrial sectors that are experiencing the strongest growth for the quarter were pipeline transportation and plastics and rubber manufacturing. This is mostly offset by softer demand from oil and gas extraction, mining and primary metals. Overall, we're seeing evidence of faster recovery in the industrial sector, which supports our projected growth in industrial sales for 2021. We anticipate improvements across most sectors with the exception of the coal mining sector as the industry faces headwinds with the shift toward reduced carbon dioxide emissions. So if you join me on Slide 11, I can provide the update, I mentioned a few moments ago, on the latest economic conditions within the AEP footprint. Starting with the chart on the left, you'll notice that AEP service territory experienced a 2% decline in gross regional product compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. This was 40 basis points better than the U.S. The AEP service territory was less impacted by the virus and had fewer restrictions on businesses than other parts of the country, which allowed our territory economy to fare better than the U.S. throughout the pandemic. Looking forward, the AEP service territory is expected to grow by 4.8% in 2021, relatively consistent with the economic recovery in the U.S. Moving to employment on the right, you can see that the job market for the AEP service territory also performed better than the U.S. throughout the pandemic. For the quarter, employment was down 4.6%, which was 1.4% better than the U.S. This is largely the result of the mix of jobs within our local economy, which has a heavier relative concentration of manufacturing and government jobs and a smaller share of leisure and hospitality jobs. Going forward, we expect the job growth of 1.1% in our service territory in 2021. So let's turn over to Page 12 to check on the company's capitalization and liquidity position. Our debt-to-cap ratio increased 0.7% in the fourth quarter to 61.8%. FFO to debt increased by 0.2% during the quarter to 13% on a Moody's basis, primarily due to changes in regulatory assets and working capital. Our liquidity position remains strong at $2.5 billion, supported by our revolving credit facility. I'd like to touch base on a couple of things relating to our financing plan as we receive questions from time to time on this. So our current financing plan does not include an assumption of any asset rotation. I'd like to share that we do believe it is incumbent upon us to engage an analysis of any opportunity within our portfolio that can generate more value for another party than it can generate for us. So to the extent that we engage in such activity that would result in the sale of an asset or a business unit, the associated proceeds would likely supplant some of the planned equity and/or debt financing you see on Page 39 in the appendix of the presentation today. Nick talked about the severe winter weather in Texas, which impacted both SPP and ERCOT. I want to take a moment to provide some quantification exposure details, since that's top of mind for us and also for you. As you know, the winter storm increased the demand for natural gas and limited natural gas supply availability, resulting in unanticipated market prices for natural gas power plants to meet reliability needs for the SPP electric system. PSO's preliminary estimate of natural gas cost and purchases of electricity are approximately $825 million. SWEPCO's preliminary estimate of natural gas cost is $375 million. To provide some perspective, PSO's annual fuel and purchase power costs are roughly $550 million to $600 million. So you get the sense of how big that is. Importantly, PSO and SWEPCO have active fuel clauses that permit recovery of prudently incurred fuel and purchase power expenses. However, we would expect this recovery to likely occur over an extended period of time in an effort to mitigate the impact on customer bills, which is consistent with the filing we submitted yesterday, seeking a regulatory asset and mechanism to recover the costs, inclusive of PSO's weighted average cost of capital. So we're taking this into consideration as it relates to our financing plans since the payments to suppliers are due in March. On that note, we're contemplating the use of long-term debt and the possibility of making funding contributions to PSO and SWEPCO from the parent company. As far as ERCOT exposure goes, as Nick mentioned, this would be related to AEP Texas' receipt of funds from the reps, AEP Renewables' wind generation assets and the wholesale load served by AEP Energy Partners, this exposure should not be significant. Switching gears. Our qualified pension funding increased 5% during the quarter to 101.8%, and our OPEB funding increased 20.4% to 160.9%. Strong equity returns in both plans were the primary driver for the funded status increases during the fourth quarter. The OPEB-planned funded status also benefited from lower-than-expected per capita and Medicare advantage rates, which reduced the liability. So let's go to Slide 13 to do a quick recap of where we've been and where we're going. So we begin 2020 with a proven track record. Our earnings in 2020 - sorry, we began 2021 with a proven track record. Our earnings were strong in 2020, as we continue to invest capital in our businesses and earn a return on this investment in response to expect the decline in sales from the pandemic and early mild weather, we implemented O&M savings from both onetime and sustainable reductions and we also got some help from favorable sales mix shift. We received approval of our North Central Wind project in Oklahoma, and that will be a benefit to our PSO and SWEPCO customers. In addition, over time, we've been able to grow our dividend in line with earnings and expect to be able to do so going forward. Our dividend payout ratio is solidly within our stated target range of 60% to 70%. So as we look forward to 2020, we feel confident in raising our operating earnings guidance range to $4.55 per share to $4.75 per share. This is up from our previously stated 2021 operating earnings guidance range of $4.51 per share to $4.71 per share. There's an operating earnings waterfall on Page 31 of the appendix reflecting the midpoint of this updated guidance. The primary differences from what we shared at EEI relate to normalized load and weather reflecting 2020 actual results as well as continued focus on sustainable O&M savings from lessons learned during the pandemic. Not surprisingly, examples on the O&M front include things like reduced nonessential travel and training since we know now a great deal of this can be done very effectively in a virtual format, sustaining some of the reduction in material and supply expenses, minimizing over time and efficiency modifications in our field crew practices, et cetera, just to name a few. Specifically, we're originally forecasting our 2021 untracked O&M to be $2.7 billion. but now we are forecasting this to be $2.62 billion compared to the $2.68 billion actual for 2020. So as we proceed through 2021, we'll finalize our pending rate cases and move forward with additional opportunities in the renewable space, supporting our ESG focus, as we transition toward a clean energy future. We will continue our disciplined approach to allocating capital, and we're confident there is significant runway in our capital programs to reaffirm our 5% to 7% growth rate of the increased 2021 operating earnings guidance range. So thanks so much for joining us for the call today. With that, I'm going to turn it over to the operator for your questions. And Steve, this is Julie. The items that we're calling out here, obviously, were much more pronounced in the fourth quarter of 2020. And specifically, as it relates to an investment gain and some income tax items, et cetera. And if you look at Page 31 in the slide presentation, you can look again at that full year view, 2020 actual versus 2021 projected or revised projection, and you'll see that we still have a little bit of an investment gain associated with charge point in that particular column around Corporate and Other. And then we'll have a little bit of pickup on the O&M front and offsetting this is going to be some increased interest expense, largely due to continuing to fund the investment program. So we have slightly higher long-term debt balances out there. As well as some O&M pickup, yes, improvement, I should say. Yes. Bingo. Yes. Versus what we showed you at EEI. Yes. Yes. This is Julie. Thanks so much for the question. Yes, O&M was a nice benefit to us in 2020. And we're going to try to hang on to as much of that and maybe a little bit more for 2021, as you can see in our forecast. So the things that we're looking to, would be things that are not only onetime in nature, but then obviously sustainable and try to take the learnings that we were able to glean from the pandemic really and how we had to operate in different ways. So things that we're talking about include things like data analytics, automation, digital tools, drone usage, outsourcing, workforce planning and then other related items, essentially, those types of things that I mentioned in my kind of preamble at the beginning of the call here. So reducing nonessential travel and training. I mean we've been able to be very successful in a virtual format. So that actually brings a fair amount of cost savings into the pocket as well, reduce materials and supplies to the extent that we can continue to rein in on advertising, minimizing overtime, et cetera. So we're looking at this from more of a sustainability or sustainable perspective, and we'll see what else we can kind of pull out of the hat in terms of additional learnings as we go forward. So it's a little bit of everything. So I can't particularly point you at one thing. And in fact, it's a variety of the entire team pooling together to be able to make this stuff come to fruition. And the track records there, we've been able to do it. So we're going to continue to turn the crank. Not yet. No. And so we have not yet updated our financing plan. We're actually holding tight just a bit here until we get a little more clarity on exactly how this stuff is going to roll out, and we have firming up of all those numbers. As I mentioned, we made an application at the commission in Oklahoma. So that's another piece of that as well, and we will update you as we continue to move forward and make those crystallized plans for you. But as I mentioned, what you can largely anticipate is taking on a little bit more debt. Obviously, you're picking up on that with the increased potential interest expense. And obviously looking to be able to be sensitive to the customer needs, as they try to absorb this cost, but then also managing the balance sheet and the metrics that we really need to have to stay at that Baa2 stable type rating and arrangement. Yes. Yes. As a matter of fact, there are a couple of things that I'd point out. Number one, we're always going to work to mitigate any potential unforeseen risk, right? So plan do check, adjust as we move through the dynamic year. And the other thing that you may recall, me making a statement about, specifically, in my opening comments here, that application that we made at - for PSO in Oklahoma, specifically called out the fact that we were looking for a regulatory asset with a mechanism that included a WACC. And so that's incredibly important to us as well. I know Nick made the comment several times through his opening comments regarding making sure that our balance sheet metrics are intact. Having a WACC helps us do that because we need to be able to preserve the financial integrity of the operating companies as well as the entire enterprise. So those are the things that we'll be looking at. It's early. Yes. It's early. Just to circle back real quickly, too, if I could, just an additional comment. As it relates to that threshold in terms of business mix, there are a couple of reasons why that 10% makes sense for us. Number one, to a credit profile risk management perspective, that's very important for us. So that's something we keep top of mind. And the other is really on tax shield associated with debt. So we've got a couple of things that we're sensitive to and just continue to high grade the earnings opportunities from our unregulated contracted renewables business. But that gives you probably a little bit more perspective if that wasn't already top of mind for you because it surely is for us. Thank you. Yes. Well, actually, we haven't been prescriptive in our filings. So we've got a little flexibility there. And so that's another reason why I kind of mentioned, we're thinking about any potential financing in the interim and how that would map to any potential outcome there. I do know that one of our peer companies out in Oklahoma made a similar filing, and I believe that it was 10 years on theirs as well as a WACC to give you a kind of perspective, but we want to be sensitive to customer bills as well as I'm sure you can imagine. Probably a couple of months. I don't have a time line yet. Yes. We do. Thank you for joining us on today's call. As always, the IR team will be available to answer any additional questions you may have. Cynthia, would you please give the replay information?"

        "content": "Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the American Electric Power Third Quarter 2020 Earnings Release Conference Call. At this time, all the participant lines are in a listen-only mode. However there will be an opportunity for your questions [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded. I'll turn the call now over to the Managing Director of Investor Relations, Ms. Darcy Reese. Please go ahead.\nDarcy Reese: Thank you, John. Good morning everyone, and welcome to the third quarter 2020 earnings call for American Electric Power. We appreciate you taking the time to join us today. Our earnings release, presentation slides, and related financial information are available on our website at aep.com. Today, we will be making forward-looking statements during the call. There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements. Please refer to our SEC filings for a discussion of these factors. Joining me this morning for opening remarks are Nick Akins, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Brian Tierney, our Chief Financial Officer. We will take your questions following their remarks. I will now turn the call over to Nick.\nNick Akins: Okay. Thanks, Darcy, and welcome, everyone to American Electric Power's third quarter 2020 earnings call. The third quarter has been another strong quarter for AEP. Despite the continued challenges of COVID-19 and its effects on the economy, we continue to be optimistic about our ability to execute and provide the consistent quality of earnings and dividend growth, our shareholders expect, and provide focus on our customers and communities we serve to get past the multiple challenges, we face as a result of the pandemic. I know many of us have had the feeling during 2020 with these multiple challenges that Lenny Kravitz sang about in a song Flyaway singing, Oh, I want to get away, I want to fly away, yeah, yeah, yeah, probably figuratively and literally. But there is light at the end of the tunnel. As we move through this memorable year, AEP continues to drive firmly within the guidance range with targeting the midpoint, as we move to the last quarter. We're accomplishing this by executing on cost control in response to the pandemic, keeping our employees safe through the crisis by taking all the extra precautions, and working with our customers to alleviate the economic pressures during this time. We are also learning a lot during this crisis, the value of efficient work from home environments, the focus on capital and OEM management, the acceleration of our achieving excellence program, and the focus on social issues that drive a cultural brand that brings everyone into the journey of being the premier regulated utility AEP strives to be. In fact, AEP just made the Forbes JUST Capital 100 list for 2021 being the highest ranked utility on the list. We have also been involved with two major storm events, Hurricanes Laura and Delta, and SWEPCO in Louisiana territory. I'm proud of how our employees stepped up during these major weather events in the midst of COVID-19 protocols, to effectively and efficiently return service to our customers in a safe manner, just as they do every day to keep the lights on. And now it's even the more important service during work from home and stay at home environments. Financially, our operating performance continues to be strong in the face of these challenges. AEPs operating earnings for the quarter came in at $1.47 per share versus dollar $1.46 per share last year, bringing us to a $3.56 per share for year-to-date 2020, versus $3.65 per share last year this time. We continue to be firmly within the stated 2020 guidance range of $4.25 to $4.45, and we continue to be optimistic regarding our progress going into 2021. We are reaffirming our current guidance range and our long-term 5% to 7% growth rate. And as I have said previously, I would be disappointed not to be in the upper half of that 5% to 7% range. Our board just approved the dividend increase of approximately 6% in line with our earnings, in the middle of our targeted payout ratio of 60% to 70%, and consistent with our long-term growth rate of 5% to 7%. An incredible accomplishment given the headwinds we expect we are facing in the first quarter and the second quarter of this year. Even with this success in turbulent times, we are not out of the woods yet, but we are seeing improvement in industrial and residential load. However, commercial loads such as churches, restaurants, hotels and schools, not surprisingly, are still challenged. Brian, will get into more detail on the economy later. We could not have achieved the outcome today AEP has achieved thus far during the year, without our employees attention and cutting our costs to compensate for losses from the COVID economy. Our achieving excellence program is going very well and not only has it helped us compensate for the revenue losses due to the pandemic, but it set an excellent catalyst for the future in terms of continued O&M cost control. More to come on this at November EEI. Most economists believe the 2021 economy will improve. And while we are seeing positive progress going in the fourth quarter, industrial and commercial progress has slowed, perhaps until after the election cycle or during the second wave of the COVID cases or during the dependency of upcoming therapeutics and vaccines. With all of that said, it has been a very productive quarter and we expect improvement to continue into 2021. We continue to adhere to COVID pandemic-related protocols of temperature testing, mask requirements, social distancing and hygiene-related activities. Our confirmed cases are increasing with the apparent second wave, and we are doubling down on messaging around practicing safeguards outside of the work environment as much as inside. Thankfully, we have not lost anyone due to the virus, but vigilance and fighting complacency is key here. We also have continued our outreach to employees and the communities we serve regarding racial injustice. As I mentioned last quarter, our Seize the Moment initiative is important to reach a deeper understanding of the racial divides that exist, and gain perspective from one another about actionable next steps. Before I get to the regulatory updates, I'll just head this off at the past questions about HB6 in Ohio. I'll just say flatly that we have nothing new to report from AEP's perspective. Any potential legislative change is not imminent, particularly given a noisy election cycle. So perhaps we'll hear more after the election. As we've said earlier, any change to the existing legislation is likely to be financially insignificant AEP, and we will still be pushing for forward looking legislation regarding clean energy options, energy efficiency and other technology enhancements at grid scale and with our customers. Regarding the legal issues surrounding HB6, also nothing new to report and my previous comment stand on this subject. Now for the regulatory update, if there's one observation that has become apparent through this pandemic, it is the acknowledgement of the criticality of the service that we provide to our customers and communities. This year, we have weathered through the effects of a pandemic and overcome significant storm activity, that have challenged our system and our workforce. As we work with our regulators to position the company to be able to continue to meet the expectations of our customers and communities, we are stressing the fundamentals of a strong balance sheet. Now more than ever, it is essential for our operating companies to be well-positioned to have the cash flows and returns needed to attract the capital necessary to meet the ongoing needs of our customers and communities. And as you all know, we have a number of regulatory proceedings pending before our state regulators this quarter, most of which are needed to conform with previous regulatory stipulations, stay out provisions or to address the timing needs of critical investments. Ohio followed its most recent base case June 1, is required into the terms of our prior ESP for settlement. We are seeking a $41 million rate increase with a 10.15% ROE, a procedural schedule has not been established yet on that case. APCo filed its base rate case in March as required by Virginia law. We have completed hearings and the case has been submitted to the commission for a decision. Our Virginia residential customers have not experienced the rate increase over the past 10 years. In this case, we have asked for $37.9 million net of depreciation with an ROE of 9.9%. We were disappointed with the position taken by both staff and the AG, which fails to recognize our need to have an opportunity to earn our authorized return over the next trien period. We remain confident that the Commission will see through these arguments, and recognize their obligation under the law to allow the company an opportunity to earn a fair return. A decision is expected in November. Kentucky was subject to a stay out provision until June of this year. We subsequently filed our base rate case on June 29, where we asked for a $65 million increase and an ROE of 10%. The company has also sought to use the remaining unprotected AFDIT [ph] funds in Kentucky to offset bills for customers who cannot afford to pay their bills. The commissioner elected to combine this request with a base rate case filing and we expect resolution by yearend. Last but not least, in our SWEPCO jurisdiction, we received approval from the commission to create a regulatory asset for the costs associated with Hurricane Laura. We will ask for similar treatments for the costs associated with Hurricane Delta, and we are hopeful that we can put this year's hurricane season safely behind us. In Texas, SWEPCO made its base rate case filing on October 13, where we are seeking a $90.2 million increase with an ROE of 10.35%. We're also seeking to increase the storm reserve and increase our vegetation management expenditures to minimize the risk of future outages to our Texas customers. We continue to make progress on our North Central Wind projects, which will benefit our customers in Louisiana, Arkansas and Oklahoma. Foundation work is commenced at the Sundance facility, which is expected to be in service by the end of first quarter 2021, Invenergy is currently completing final site preparation on both the Maverick and Traverse locations. We continue to expect to acquire the Maverick facility by December 21, and the Traverse facility into December the first quarter of 2022 timeframe. We have filed our settlement true up in Arkansas and are finalizing our settlement true up in Oklahoma. We're looking forward to the benefits that these projects will bring to our customers, by providing access to some of the nation's richest wind resources and helping SWEPCO and PSO advance a greener energy future. So now to the equalizer chart, I'll talk about that. I think it's on Page 5 of the presentation. So our current ROE is about 9%. And you know we just generally target these returns to be in the 9.5% to 10% range. The ROEs below are not where they normalized. And certainly, keep in mind that we're also thickening equity layers as well. So, I'll talk about AEP Ohio first, I just mentioned the rate case there. It's above authorized primarily due to favorable regulatory items, partially offset by the roll off of the legacy issues that we've been talking about for years, regarding the [indiscernible] and the RSR. But we also expect the yearend ROE to trend around the authorized levels of 10%. For APCo, which I'd mentioned earlier is slightly below authorized, due a lower normalized usage and higher depreciation from increased capital investments, partially offset by continued management of the O&M expenses. Effective January 2020, costs associated with the last 17.5% of Wheeling Power's interest in Mitchell plant became recoverable through APCo and Wheeling rates. And then I've already discussed Virginia's tri-annual review. Kentucky, I already discussed the rate case there, but they're below and as you can see well-below authorized due to loss of load from weak economic conditions and loss of major customers, along with higher expenses during the stay out period. So, we have a lot of work to do there. I&M, the ROE for I&M at the end of third quarter was 10.4%. Its ROE was above authorized due to continued management of O&M expenses, reduced interest expense and rate true ups, partially offset by lower commercial industrial sales. I&M's ROE is projected to trend slightly below 10% by yearend, consistent with authorized ROEs in Michigan and in Indiana. PSO, its ROE is 8%. At the end of third quarter, it was below its authorized level primarily due to lower normalized usage and unfavorable weather in 2020, partially offset by continued management of O&M expenses. PSOs 2019 base case as you recall, approved the transmission track or a partial distribution tracker, and ROE of 9.4% authorized, so we'll continue to make progress there. SWEPCO, the ROE for SWEPCO is about 7.4%, and as you recall, much of that is related to the Turk Plant not being in retail rates in Arkansas, and that impacts by about 110 basis points. SWEPCO received an order in its Arkansas base case settlement in December 2019, and effective 2020 approved a $24 million revenue increase in ROE of 9.45%. In October 2020, we also filed the rate case in Texas, as I mentioned earlier. In AEP Texas, its ROE is around 7.5%, it was below authorized due to lag associated with a tiny of annual cost recovery filings. We did not make those filings during the pendency of the previous rate case, and of course, onetime adjustments from our finalized base rate case itself. Favorable regulatory treatment allows AEP Texas to file annual DCRF and TCOS filings, and we've since filed many of those at this point. I think there's been three cases that have been filed. And while earnings should improve in 2020, with a base rate case finalized and annual filings now resumed continued levels of investment in Texas will impact the ROE. The expectation is for the ROE to trend towards an authorized ROE of 9.4% in the long-term, but be around probably 8% by the end of 2020. As far as the transmission company is concerned, AEP Transmission Holdco was 9.8%, and it was below authorized primarily driven by the annual revenue true up in the second quarter of 2020 to return the over collection of 2019 revenues. Transmission is forecasted an ROE of 9.8% to 10.1% range in 2020. It is also interesting to note, that when you look at the average equity in our operating jurisdictions, The Transmission Holdco is now the largest, which that's happened for the first quarter. This first quarter that has actually occurred. So, making a lot of progress. But at the same time, though the investment is being made relative to transmission is certainly improving the quality of service to our customers. So, very happy with the progress we're making around our T&E investments and its ability to improve customers\u2019 experiences. As I close, I'd be remiss in not thanking our employees at the Oklaunion Power Station that was officially retired from service a couple of weeks ago, after several decades of providing generation resources, and meeting the needs of our customers electricity demands in Texas and Oklahoma. Oklaunion was under construction about the time I joined AEP out of college. And when you see people and assets retiring, it just further illustrates the resiliency of AEP over the last 114 years, but also the change occurs and we have to change with it. Thanks again to all the Oklaunion employees through the years. So, all-in-all, a solid quarter for AEP and I can't resist when thinking about AEPs future post-COVID, with the latent value of the need for resiliency and reliability of the grid to support work from home environments, moving forward with the transformation to clean energy resources, which we had AEP or in the beginning stages of, and the further electrification of the economy. We would say in the words of late Eddie Van Halen, it's about time, this time's our time, and right on, we'll let it shine. I am convinced in overcoming the challenges of 2020. This company will be even stronger as we move into 2021 and beyond. Brian?\nBrian Tierney: Thank you, Nick and good morning, everyone. I will take us through the third quarter and year-to-date financial results, provide some insight on load in the economy, review our balance sheet and liquidity and finish with a preview of what we will present at the EEI conference. Let's start briefly on Slide 6, which shows the comparison of GAAP to operating earnings for the quarter and year-to-date periods. GAAP earnings for the third quarter were $1.51 per share, compared to $1.49 per share in 2019. GAAP earnings through September were $3.56 per share, compared to $3.58 per share last year. There's a reconciliation of GAAP to operating earnings on Pages 15 to 16 of the presentation. Let's turn to Slide 7, and look at the drivers of quarterly operating earnings by segment. Operating earnings for the third quarter were $1.47 per share or $728 million, compared to $1.46 per share or $722 million in 2019. Operating earnings for vertically integrated utilities were $0.85 per share down $0.04. This was driven by unfavorable weather, primarily due to warmer than normal temperatures last year, particularly in September. Other drivers including lower wholesale load and other operating revenue, as well as higher depreciation and taxes, primarily due to timing that were averse in the fourth quarter. Favorable items included lower O&M, favorable rate changes and higher transmission revenue. The transmission and distribution utility segment earned $0.31 per share up $0.04 from last year. Favorable items included higher rate changes in transmission revenue, as well as lower O&M. These favorable items were partially offset by unfavorable weather, depreciation, taxes and interest expense. The AEP Transmission Holdco segment continue to grow, contributing $0.28 per share an improvement of $0.03. This reflected the return on investment growth as net plant increased by $1.5 billion or 16% since September of last year. Generation and marketing produced operating earnings of $0.13 per share, down $0.03 from last year. This was driven by timing around income taxes and lower wholesale margins. Finally, corporate and other was up a penny from last year, primarily driven by lower taxes related to consolidating items that will reverse by year-end. Let's turn to Slide 8, and review our year-to-date results. Operating earnings through September were $3.56 per share or $1.77 billion, compared to $3.65 per share or $1.8 billion in 2019. Looking at the drivers by segment, operating earnings for vertically integrated utilities were $1.90 per share comparable to last year. Favorable items in this segment included lower O&M, the impact of rate changes across multiple jurisdictions and higher transmission revenue primarily due to true ups. Weather was unfavorable due to warmer than normal winter temperatures this year and a warmer summer in 2019. Other decreases included higher depreciation and tax expenses, primarily due to timing and lower revenue items and AFUDC. The transmission and distribution utility segment earned $0.84 per share down a penny from last year. The negative variance was primarily driven by the 2019 reversal of a regulatory provision in Ohio. Other smaller drivers included higher depreciation and interest expense, the roll off of legacy riders in Ohio, prior year Texas carrying charges, unfavorable weather and tax expenses. These items were mostly offset by higher rate changes, the recovery of increased transmission investment in OCA [ph] and the impact of the Ohio transmission true up on both O&M and transmission revenue. Other O&M was also favorable due to the concerted effort to decrease O&M expenditures through one time and sustainable reductions. The AEP Transmission Holdco segment contributed $0.75 per share, down $0.07 from last year due to the impact of the annual true up and prior year FERC settlements. Our fundamental return on investment growth continued. Generation and marketing produced $0.31 per share, up a penny from last year. The Renewables business grew with asset acquisitions more than offsetting lower wholesale and retail margins and timing around income taxes. O&M sales and other onetime items offset the impact of weaker wholesale prices on the generating business. Finally, Corporate & Other was down $0.02 per share due to higher interest in taxes related to consolidating items that were reversed by the yearend, and offset by a prior year income tax adjustment. Partially offsetting these items was lower O&M. Overall, we are pleased with our financial results and are confident in confirming our annual operating earnings guidance of $4.25 to $4.45 per share. Turning to Slide 9, let's review the assumptions we shared during the first quarter earnings call to reaffirm guidance. Starting with the topline, we recently updated our retail sales forecast. Third quarter sales came in higher than previously projected. We now expect 2020 normalized sales to come in 2.7% below last year, which is 0.7% better than the load forecast from the first quarter. While the outlook has improved, it is still below the pre-recession forecast used for our original guidance. The favorable sales mix in 2020 has helped to mitigate the impact on earnings. The second item was the impact of weather. While the first quarter weather produced a significant drag, the second quarter and third quarter weather impacts were slightly favorable. In the second quarter presentation we mentioned that, July's weather was quite favorable. However, August and September weather was mild. As a result, we have revised the weather impact on 2020 earnings and now expect a $0.08 drag to 2020 results. The next item was on track the O&M expense. We had originally planned to drive O&M cost down to $2.8 billion from $3.1 billion in 2019. In response to the expected sales decline, we identified an additional $100 million of savings for both onetime in sustainable reductions and are on track to hit this lower expense target. Finally, we identified approximately $500 million of capital expenditures in the first quarter that could be shifted out of 2020 and in the future years. We made this decision to support our cash position through the expected downturn during the pandemic. As we discussed at the second quarter earnings call, results have come in better than expected and we've reinstated approximately $100 million of the $500 million back into 2020. Given the progress we've made on these key assumptions, we were able to reaffirm our 2020 operating earnings guidance range. Now let\u2019s turn to Slide 10, to provide an update on our normalize load. Starting in the lower right corner, our third quarter normalized load was down 2.6%, this was slightly better than the forecast we shared with you in the first quarter. Through September, our normalized sales were down 3% from last year. In the upper left quadrant, our normalized residential sales increased by 3.8% in the quarter. Year-to-date residential sales were up 2.6%. We saw significant increases in our residential load at the beginning of the pandemic. The growth in residential sales has moderated as people return to work over the summer. Weather normalized residential sales are up across all jurisdictions. Moving clockwise, our normalized commercial sales decreased by 4.6% in the third quarter, bringing the year-to-date decline to 4.9%. As expected, the biggest declines in this class came from schools, churches, restaurants and hotels. Finally in the lower left chart, industrial sales decreased by 7.8% in the quarter, bringing the year-to-date decline to 7%. A number of factors have changed the outlook for this class, but the biggest driver is overall economic activity. The industrial sectors that posted the biggest declines for the quarter were mining, oil and gas extraction and primary metals. By contrast, plastics and rubber manufacturing posted a strong quarter related to the recovery of the automotive industry. Overall, load growth across the service territory followed the pattern we anticipated earlier in the year. During the second quarter, residential sales peaked and commercial and industrial sales hit their lows. Since then, our service territory has been working its way back to a more normalized levels. Because some businesses will continue to work remotely, we expect our residential sales to continue at higher levels for some time. Let's take a deeper look into why we raised our outlook for normalized load on Slide 11. The solid bars represent weather normalized load growth by quarter end 2020. The green lines represent the updated load forecast we shared during the first quarter earnings call. At that time, there was still a lot of uncertainty regarding the depth and duration of the economic slowdown and how customers would respond. While that forecast accurately predicted the depth of the contraction in the second quarter, our third quarter results indicated a better recovery than forecasted. Our latest view, anticipates a continuation of this trend barring another shutdown of the economy. Now let's move on to Slide 12 and review the company's capitalization and liquidity. Our debt to capital ratio remain unchanged in the third quarter and stands at 61.1%. Our FFO to debt ratio decreased 1.3% during the quarter to 12.8% on a Moody's basis, primarily due to timing of fuel recovery, storm cost deferrals and a pension contribution. Importantly, we expect this metric to end the year in the low to mid-teens, consistent with the guidance we have provided. Our liquidity position remains strong at $3.8 billion, supported by a revolving credit facility. Before providing an update on pension funding, I would like to discuss the plan to finance the North Central Wind Project. As a reminder, we have stated that we intend to use equity to finance approximately two-thirds of this $2 billion project. We plan to issue equity in coordination with the completion of the three individual projects that comprise North Central Wind. For this reason, we will take a flexible approach which could include and at the market mechanism, asset rotation, as well as traditional secondary offerings. This approach avoids unnecessary dilution and helps us deliver on the 5% to 7% earnings growth rate. Turning to our pension, I am pleased to report that funding increased 3.6% during the quarter to 97%, and our OPEB Funding increased 5% to 141%. Strong equity returns was the primary driver for the increases. The pension plan also benefited from a company contribution in the amount of the plan's annual service cost of $111.5 million. Let's wrap this up on Slide 13, so we can get to your questions. We are reaffirming our existing 2020 operating earnings guidance of $4.25 to $4.45 per share. Our message at EEI will be that we are leading the way forward as a premium regulated utility with an ESG focus delivering 5% to 7% earnings growth with dividends growing in line with earnings. Our plan includes the $2 billion North Central Wind project in Oklahoma, benefiting our customers in PSO and SWEPCO as we transition to a cleaner energy future. We will provide detailed drivers for 2021 earnings guidance by segment and updates to our capital expenditure and financing plans. We look forward to talking with many of you at the virtual EEI conference in a couple of weeks. One final item, in 2021, we will release 2020 fourth quarter and full year earnings in late February, coincident with the filing of the 2020 10-K, like we did last year. With that, I will turn the call over to the operator for your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. And we will go to Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.\nNick Akins: Good morning, Julien.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey, howdy. Thanks for the time, guys. Perhaps just to kick things off. You talked about rolling out and reaffirming or perhaps preemptively reaffirming in the EEI the 5% to 7%. Can you talk a little bit about what's backstopping that? Specifically, in the last few months, we've seen some pretty substantial changes from some of your peers in Virginia. How can that play into APCo? And perhaps also similarly in Indiana, many of your peers are talking about opportunities. You all have perhaps Rockport. Just curious if you can talk about or perhaps foreshadow some of the conversations here on that role forward, if you don't mind, at the outset.\nBrian Tierney: Julien, I think a lot of the things that we're going to talk about are renewable opportunities in addition to North Central Wind, how we're transitioning from a carbon-based generating fleet much more to a lot of the renewables that the Virginia Clean Energy Act enables and legislation in Indiana enables as well. So we're going to provide a lot more detail on that at EEI and take you through what that looks like. You have the renewable requirement in Virginia. You mentioned APCo. We've got the requirement there. And also Indiana, Michigan, we continue to do renewables in various areas there. We're also doing renewables, we just did fourth sale in Oklahoma. And then we also have renewable applications here in Ohio that are brewing as well. So, we'll have plenty to talk about. And I think, we don't we don't spend and then maybe we should spend more talking about the opportunities we've got available to us from a renewable standpoint. But the way I see it is that, we're just on the precipice of a massive transformation to renewable resources. And AEP, if you look at the runway it's pretty substantial. And that will continue particularly as we do individual relationships with customers, but also in terms of the regulated side as well, through the Integrated Resource Planning process. So we'll certainly talk more about that at November EEI.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. Thanks for entertaining me there. Perhaps, if I can get more detailed here, if you don't mind. I know you all provided a little bit more of you want 23 here, but in tandem, you gave an updated view on FFO to total debt under Moody's definition of low to mid-teens versus perhaps prior characterizations of mid-teens. Is that simply a factor of rolling forward here? Or how are you thinking about this at this point?\nBrian Tierney: Julien, the low to mid-teens is completely consistent with our prior messaging on FFO to debt. And that outlook was incorporated in Moody's when they made their adjustments back in August. And remember that will continue to improve as some of this accumulative deferred income taxes that is being repaid to the regulatory jurisdictions are occurring much more quickly than we thought, maybe we originally thinking 10 years. And it turned out to be five years. And that's occurring more quickly. So that FFO to debt metric will pick up as that rolls off.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. Excellent. Thank you.\nBrian Tierney: Yes.\nOperator: Our next question is from Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nDurgesh Chopra: Hey, good morning. Thanks. Great. Hey, just digging in a little bit into 2021. I appreciate you'll share more color at EEI. But could you quantify for us what that 2%, 2.7% sales degradation was year-to-date, part one? And part two, should we assume some of that $51 million year-to-date O&M savings to be carried forward into the next year?\nBrian Tierney: Yes. So let me start with the 2.7% load degradation. It's what you would expect. It's largely commercial and industrial sales. The decrease is being offset by residential. And so, what we've seen is it takes more than just looking at the raw numbers on residential, commercial and industrial, it's really the mix. You remember, we make more margin on residential sales than we do on commercial and industrial. And that mix has come in better than we had anticipated at the beginning of the pandemic. So, it's not been as dire as what we thought it might be because of what's happened with the sales mix, rather than just the overall decreases. So that's been positive. Looking forward on O&M, we have for a number of years been tightening our belt and been very, very tight around untracked O&M in that $2.8 billion to $3.1 billion range. And with what we're doing with achieving excellence, and everything else we're doing with sustainable and non-sustainable O&M cuts, I'd anticipate us being towards the lower end of that range going forward.\nDurgesh Chopra: Understood.\nNick Akins: When we look at the load forecast, I mean if you assume 2021 is going to be better, which we believe it is. And you look at that mix, we don't see residential. I mean, obviously, it will moderate as the economy comes back on the industrial and commercial side, commercial in particular. But still, you're going to have a continued longstanding remnant of improved residential support just by virtue of what companies have learned from the work from home environment. So, I'm a little bit bullish on the load and then at least a financial picture associated with load. And then when you look at the O&M this achieving excellence program it has truly been a fundamental change for us and augmentation of all the lean activities and other things that we did before. And it really is focused on a regular part of our budget process to ensure that we're capturing savings and every step along the way. So, feeling pretty good about the continual progress year-on-year of achieving excellence.\nDurgesh Chopra: That's great, guys. Thanks for that color. Maybe just initial thoughts and I appreciate that that was going to be in the details, but initial thoughts on elections, taxes, climate plan and implications for AEP?\nNick Akins: Yes, so I guess, well, first of all, it's the election, certainly as a noisy election cycle, and who knows what's going to happen here, we never know. But we've got 114 years history of managing between the goalposts here, so we'll continue to do that. And our focus is on move into that clean energy economy. So really, the only difference obviously, is maybe the pace at which the change will occur if there's a Biden administration versus Trump. But nevertheless, it doesn't change that much for us, because we're focused on moving that clean energy economy as quickly as we can, to ensure that we are making that transition into the future that we know it's going to happen. Now, who knows where technology will go, even for fossil fuels, but nevertheless, we'll continue that transition to renewables and certainly some natural gas to ensure that we are delivering for our customers in the future. So, from a client perspective, we have an excellent record and I think that's why we get seen from the ESG community where they know what we're doing, they know what our message is, we're making continual progress. And we'll continue to make that progress. And then when you think about, as I said, in my original write up, I used the word latent, because it is a somewhat of an undeveloped or emerging activity around electrification of the economy, certainly around O&M and what we find with digitization and automation. And then, of course, as we move forward with the transformation, the generation transformation that we see ahead of us. So that's, that's why I'm feeling pretty good about where this company is heading.\nBrian Tierney: Just a quick update on taxes. If we were to have an increase in taxes, we anticipate that our commissions would handle it. Really, one of two ways and not dissimilar to how they handled tax reform three or four years ago. We anticipate that they would either allow the increase to be deferred until the next rate proceeding, or we anticipate that they'd have kind of a one issue, order come out where they would allow us to adjust rates just to reflect the new expected higher income tax rate. In any event, we wouldn't expect it to be a significant driver to earnings or cash for the company going forward.\nDurgesh Chopra: Great. Thanks. But it could be a modest delve into cash flow, like given sort of a reset in AVIT [ph] and amongst other things.\nNick Akins: I think the [Indiscernible].\nBrian Tierney: Yes. Again, we don't anticipate it to be significant one way or the other.\nDurgesh Chopra: Understood. Thanks, Brian. Thank you, Nick.\nBrian Tierney: Thank you.\nNick Akins: Yep.\nOperator: Our next question is from James Thalacker with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nNick Akins: Good morning, James. Hello?\nJames Thalacker: Hey, thanks, guys. I apologize about the [multiple speakers]. Good morning. Two real quick questions. Just first, I guess, Brian, just addressing, North Central wind, I noticed in the slides that Traverse look like potentially be in service could be pushed out maybe by a quarter or so. Could you talk a little bit about it? Is that just a supply chain issue related to COVID? Or there's something else that was kind of driving that extended outlook?\nBrian Tierney: Yes, a lot of it has to do more so than actual physical things. It's our ability to get permitting and the like done. And so during the shutdown, it was hard to be able to get into the offices, do land acquisitions, title searches and things like that. And that just potentially pushed us back at big teams. We're not in anticipating anything material there. We still anticipate late this year to early next year which is one of the signal that due to some of those unanticipated issues largely associated with COVID that that project could have a range of when it would come online.\nNick Akins: Hey, James, we feel like it's still going to be the end of the summer, but obviously it could fall into that range in the first quarter, we're confident of that particular range. But remember, we're not making any progress payments, either. It's sort of we require it when it's done. So from a financial perspective it's fine.\nJames Thalacker: Okay, great. Thanks. And I guess, just following up on that same issue. Brian, you talked about, three sort of potential ways to finance the final acquisition of those and this has been beat to death. But as you guys look to give 2021 guidance, obviously, an ATM would be something because spread over the full year, but asset rotation or even block equity, really probably something I think, as you were saying, sort of coordinating it with the final close would be something maybe closer to the end of the year. How are you guys, I guess thinking about that from a modeling perspective, as you present 2021?\nBrian Tierney: It kind of matches what Nick was saying is that the projects don't -- we don't get the projects until commercial completion is done, we then get the project. And given the discrete nature of them, we can really time the equity issuance very closely with when the project comes online. And James the reason, we need that flexibility, you look at Sundance, which we're anticipating in the first quarter of 2020, that's about a $300 million project. We'll be able to time the equity issuance, if that's what it is closely with when that project comes online. The next one, which we're anticipating at the end of 2021, is about a $400 million project, Maverick. And then the last one is Traverse, which is about $1.3 billion and we talked about that being late 2021, early 2022. We believe that whether it's an aftermarket program, a follow on issuance or asset rotation, we're going to be able to time those very, very closely with when those discrete projects come online. So from a modeling standpoint, the timing that we're talking about really is going to be insignificant to 2021. And I'd start repeating myself and shaping it in 2021.\nNick Akins: James, Brian mentioned the options we're looking at. And rest assured internally, we're also being at the death. So, we'll make sure that we're making the right decisions relative to the timing associated with those investments.\nJames Thalacker: No worries. I understand the in service space, and it gives you guys a lot of flexibility. The last question, I guess, I just had, and you kind of answered my initial question was going back to the trailing 12 months FFO kind of dip down. You guys were looking for that sort of trend back into kind of where you guys were thinking sort of low to mid-teens, I guess. Are you still targeting that in the sort of '21, '22, '23 timeframe? I know you updated your cash flow forecasts for that recently.\nNick Akins: Yes, we are. It's that timeframe, yes.\nJames Thalacker: Okay, perfect. Thank you so much for the time.\nBrian Tierney: Thanks, James.\nOperator: And next, we'll go to Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nNick Akins: Good morning, Michael.\nMichael Lapides: Good morning, Nick. Thank you guys for taking my question. And Nick, sorry about your LSU Tigers.\nNick Akins: Yes. Alabama is doing good though. I'm sure you're happy with that.\nMichael Lapides: Yes, let's hope they keep coaching. Brian, I want to come back to tax a little bit and who the heck Uncle Sam\u2019s is going to do in the next year or so regarding corporate tax rates. But if there's a change in administration, if there's a higher corporate tax rate, I think we\u2019ve seen numbers floated around 27% or 28%. I get that it's probably not much of an impact on the earnings power one way or another for AEP. But if you're talking to state commissioners or staff at the PSCs, or PUCs or others, it is a rate increase on customers. And it's a double whammy, because the cost of service goes up due to the higher tax rate and that just kind of flows through rates. But also the flow back of assets kind of slows down or declines. And it just strikes me as if I must say utility commissioner for public policy maker and given state, you're asking for what could be pretty decent size rate increases on customers coming out of an economic downturn. How does that get offset? I think about it from the customer standpoint. What's the get [Indiscernible].\nNick Akins: Hey, I think there's no doubt that -- and again, I think there was a lot of advantage taken with it with the tax reductions that occurred. And you're right, there's no doubt that there will be headroom that is reduced, because it is certainly going to be an impact to put those back in. Now, the question is how to put back in or what time frame and that kind of thing. But also that's why it's so important for us to move forward as quickly as possible and accelerate achieving excellence, so that we can mitigate that impact as much as possible. But still, you're looking at it in the face of a definite need for rehabilitation and continued capitalization of the grid to ensure that we have reliability and resiliency of supply, particularly when you're dealing with hurricanes, wildfires, cyber, all those kinds of issues we have to respond to that. So there'll be rate increases associated with the implementation of new taxes. And I think it's unavoidable, but certainly it's incumbent on us to make sure we mitigate that as much as possible with our achieving excellence program and other measures. And we'll have discussions with the commissions, just like we had discussions when tax reform occurred. And, it's unfortunate we didn't do it over a longer period of time like we had suggested, because then it would mitigate even the return of taxes. And if we continue vacillating back and forth like this, that's going to be a continual issue for our industry that our regulators need to recognize. We do have to keep some reserve there to ensure that we're not moving customer rates around, as much as could be as if it becomes pretty volatile. So, your point is well recognized, but we'll do what we can to mitigate the effects and we'll have those conversations. But I think one thing that's also come into play here, though is, is the nature of the importance of the service that we provide, for everyone to be able to watch their Netflix or do all the things they need to do at home, work from home. All those sorts of activities will change the nature of how we look at residential supply. And there's no question that that's going to change going forward. And that's why I'm always troubled by the commission saying that AMR versus AMI, for example, the investments we want to make in AMI, it's not because AMI is you don't just look at the cost of the meters of AMI and the undepreciated balance associated with AMR. You've got to look at what you're leveraging into and that's the customers\u2019 ability to adjust to their own energy picture and be able to drive energy efficiency and all those things and give the customer the opportunity to do that, as opposed to of the system just decide in that forum. So, I think there's just a lot of things we need to have discussions about with our regulators to really focus on what that future actually means. And with electrification of the economy, that's clearly going to be an issue that we need to deal with to make sure our customers are more resilient, more reliable and as economic as possible, but also give them the opportunity to make adjustments on their total bill as opposed to dealing on a headline on rate increases.\nMichael Lapides: Got it. Thank you for that, Nick. And then one other question, totally unrelated. I'm thinking about states where you've not really talked about sizable rate base growth and investment. One of those that stands out a little bit is West Virginia. How do you think about going forward, the pace of generation transformation in a state like West Virginia?\nNick Akins: Yes, I think, we're looking at all of our states now and all our state jurisdictions, and it's really sort of our resource planning on steroids. And even the dogs like it. And I think there's no question that we're in the process of moving forward with that transformation as quickly as possible, making significant T&D investments, but all and you see that based on the changes in capital. But then when you look at states like West Virginia, we will be -- I think the first step is going to be how we run coal fired capacity, for example, where we have other forms of energy coming in and have lower capacity factors on coal units, but still they be available if those times where, you have severe cold weather, or really warm weather in the summer. So, it's a way we run these facilities during the interim, but then it's also that transition that we make going forward. I think that's true for all of the jurisdictions. And our jurisdictions have been fairly conservative in making that transition. I think that pace can quick and though, as a result of the even the bipartisan focus on continuing to lower emissions in our plant. So, I think there's the catalysts are there. And actually, post-election, who knows what'll happen, but I still see, you're already seeing some Republican and Democratic legislation that's being proposed that tries to answer that question. And if you have that from a national standpoint and the states are moving forward with their own resolutions, and then we can be particularly helpful in ensuring that occurs as quickly as possible.\nMichael Lapides: Got it. Thank you, Nick. Sorry about the [Indiscernible], and I both appreciate it. Thanks guys.\nNick Akins: No, that's fine.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Sophie Karp with KeyBanc. Please go ahead.\nSophie Karp: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions.\nNick Akins: Yes, sure thing. Good morning.\nSophie Karp: I'm curious, I want to go back to kind of the load composition and the rate case activity. So, as we roll forward and the load dislocation continues to be persist, where we have this unusual situation where residential, maybe it's higher, but C&I is suppressed. And that's not really a normalized picture. So, if you go through your rate cases now, and the future rate cases where this period becomes your test here, right? How do you address that? Did you attempt to normalize? Do you just go with what they actually look like? So, that's my first question, I guess.\nNick Akins: Yes. So, we have multiple utilities, right. So, we have the opportunity to move around capital investment to time it with relative rate case activity to ensure that we are spinning on the right things at the right time. Not to say that we're trying to load the budgets or anything, what we're saying is that, that when we go through the rate case, filings, it's important to not only have discussions with the Commissions about what we're spending on, but what the results of that spending will be. So, if the load is not increasing, obviously, it exaggerate. It certainly challenges the rate impacts, because the denominator is not growing. If the denominator is growing, obviously, that's helpful. But if it isn't, you're still having to make choices about what the priorities are for each regulatory jurisdiction based on discussions with the Commissions to help us determine, okay, number one, what are we willing to pay for, number two, what are those priorities that exist. And some of those are absolute priorities and some of them are things that yes, we'd like to do, but it may be that we have to work out for a longer period of time before bringing that in. So, there's all kinds of dialogues that occur, relative to what that prioritization should be. And we'll continue doing that with our Commissions. And we have done, whether it's gone, where the economy is going well, or whether the economy has been in a downturn. I think we're moving toward an upturn. So that's going to be helpful.\nBrian Tierney: Sophie, we also have some jurisdictions that have forward looking test years, so we'll be able to incorporate a forward looking view. And then we have places like Ohio, where residential and small commercial are already decoupled. So, there are lots of mitigations to unusual load circumstances that we find ourselves in right now.\nNick Akins: And some of these things are known and reasonable adjustments too, so you have to look at the 2020 test year and say, we had to make these changes because of COVID. And COVID is going to be sort of a unique circumstance and then we had to react. And actually, the Commissions themselves, we had moratoriums on customer cut-offs. So, there is adjustments we all made in that process, and I think we'll make those adjustments coming out of that process as well.\nSophie Karp: Great. Thank you. And then, if I may a quick follow-up on the Central Wind. You mentioned assets rotation, I guess, as a part of the considerations for equity financing there. What might those be? Is this more of a like one-off situation with churn assets in your portfolio? Or could we be looking at something more strategic here? Thank you.\nNick Akins: Well, so when we talk about potential assets, we look at everything, and we look at sources and uses. And obviously, we want the use part of it right now is how do we finance North Central Wind, a major project. And the sources can be anything in our portfolio, and that's where portfolio management is going to be a key part of what we do in the future. So, I'm not going to say, specifically what we're looking at, or anything like that at this point. But what I will say is that it's incumbent on us to be looking at everything from a source perspective, and then focusing on how we deploy capital in the best way and transfer that into really projects like North Central, and be able to fund it in the best way to ensure our shareholder value. And we will continue to do that. So, I think you got what the sort of year play out.\nSophie Karp: Thank you.\nNick Akins: Yep.\nOperator: And with no further questions, yes, I'll turn it back to you.\nDarcy Reese: Great. Thank you for joining us on today's call. As always, the IR team will be available to answer any questions you have. John, please give the replay information.\nOperator: Certainly.

            "name": "Nick Akins",
            "content": "Okay. Thanks, Darcy, and welcome, everyone to American Electric Power's third quarter 2020 earnings call. The third quarter has been another strong quarter for AEP. Despite the continued challenges of COVID-19 and its effects on the economy, we continue to be optimistic about our ability to execute and provide the consistent quality of earnings and dividend growth, our shareholders expect, and provide focus on our customers and communities we serve to get past the multiple challenges, we face as a result of the pandemic. I know many of us have had the feeling during 2020 with these multiple challenges that Lenny Kravitz sang about in a song Flyaway singing, Oh, I want to get away, I want to fly away, yeah, yeah, yeah, probably figuratively and literally. But there is light at the end of the tunnel. As we move through this memorable year, AEP continues to drive firmly within the guidance range with targeting the midpoint, as we move to the last quarter. We're accomplishing this by executing on cost control in response to the pandemic, keeping our employees safe through the crisis by taking all the extra precautions, and working with our customers to alleviate the economic pressures during this time. We are also learning a lot during this crisis, the value of efficient work from home environments, the focus on capital and OEM management, the acceleration of our achieving excellence program, and the focus on social issues that drive a cultural brand that brings everyone into the journey of being the premier regulated utility AEP strives to be. In fact, AEP just made the Forbes JUST Capital 100 list for 2021 being the highest ranked utility on the list. We have also been involved with two major storm events, Hurricanes Laura and Delta, and SWEPCO in Louisiana territory. I'm proud of how our employees stepped up during these major weather events in the midst of COVID-19 protocols, to effectively and efficiently return service to our customers in a safe manner, just as they do every day to keep the lights on. And now it's even the more important service during work from home and stay at home environments. Financially, our operating performance continues to be strong in the face of these challenges. AEPs operating earnings for the quarter came in at $1.47 per share versus dollar $1.46 per share last year, bringing us to a $3.56 per share for year-to-date 2020, versus $3.65 per share last year this time. We continue to be firmly within the stated 2020 guidance range of $4.25 to $4.45, and we continue to be optimistic regarding our progress going into 2021. We are reaffirming our current guidance range and our long-term 5% to 7% growth rate. And as I have said previously, I would be disappointed not to be in the upper half of that 5% to 7% range. Our board just approved the dividend increase of approximately 6% in line with our earnings, in the middle of our targeted payout ratio of 60% to 70%, and consistent with our long-term growth rate of 5% to 7%. An incredible accomplishment given the headwinds we expect we are facing in the first quarter and the second quarter of this year. Even with this success in turbulent times, we are not out of the woods yet, but we are seeing improvement in industrial and residential load. However, commercial loads such as churches, restaurants, hotels and schools, not surprisingly, are still challenged. Brian, will get into more detail on the economy later. We could not have achieved the outcome today AEP has achieved thus far during the year, without our employees attention and cutting our costs to compensate for losses from the COVID economy. Our achieving excellence program is going very well and not only has it helped us compensate for the revenue losses due to the pandemic, but it set an excellent catalyst for the future in terms of continued O&M cost control. More to come on this at November EEI. Most economists believe the 2021 economy will improve. And while we are seeing positive progress going in the fourth quarter, industrial and commercial progress has slowed, perhaps until after the election cycle or during the second wave of the COVID cases or during the dependency of upcoming therapeutics and vaccines. With all of that said, it has been a very productive quarter and we expect improvement to continue into 2021. We continue to adhere to COVID pandemic-related protocols of temperature testing, mask requirements, social distancing and hygiene-related activities. Our confirmed cases are increasing with the apparent second wave, and we are doubling down on messaging around practicing safeguards outside of the work environment as much as inside. Thankfully, we have not lost anyone due to the virus, but vigilance and fighting complacency is key here. We also have continued our outreach to employees and the communities we serve regarding racial injustice. As I mentioned last quarter, our Seize the Moment initiative is important to reach a deeper understanding of the racial divides that exist, and gain perspective from one another about actionable next steps. Before I get to the regulatory updates, I'll just head this off at the past questions about HB6 in Ohio. I'll just say flatly that we have nothing new to report from AEP's perspective. Any potential legislative change is not imminent, particularly given a noisy election cycle. So perhaps we'll hear more after the election. As we've said earlier, any change to the existing legislation is likely to be financially insignificant AEP, and we will still be pushing for forward looking legislation regarding clean energy options, energy efficiency and other technology enhancements at grid scale and with our customers. Regarding the legal issues surrounding HB6, also nothing new to report and my previous comment stand on this subject. Now for the regulatory update, if there's one observation that has become apparent through this pandemic, it is the acknowledgement of the criticality of the service that we provide to our customers and communities. This year, we have weathered through the effects of a pandemic and overcome significant storm activity, that have challenged our system and our workforce. As we work with our regulators to position the company to be able to continue to meet the expectations of our customers and communities, we are stressing the fundamentals of a strong balance sheet. Now more than ever, it is essential for our operating companies to be well-positioned to have the cash flows and returns needed to attract the capital necessary to meet the ongoing needs of our customers and communities. And as you all know, we have a number of regulatory proceedings pending before our state regulators this quarter, most of which are needed to conform with previous regulatory stipulations, stay out provisions or to address the timing needs of critical investments. Ohio followed its most recent base case June 1, is required into the terms of our prior ESP for settlement. We are seeking a $41 million rate increase with a 10.15% ROE, a procedural schedule has not been established yet on that case. APCo filed its base rate case in March as required by Virginia law. We have completed hearings and the case has been submitted to the commission for a decision. Our Virginia residential customers have not experienced the rate increase over the past 10 years. In this case, we have asked for $37.9 million net of depreciation with an ROE of 9.9%. We were disappointed with the position taken by both staff and the AG, which fails to recognize our need to have an opportunity to earn our authorized return over the next trien period. We remain confident that the Commission will see through these arguments, and recognize their obligation under the law to allow the company an opportunity to earn a fair return. A decision is expected in November. Kentucky was subject to a stay out provision until June of this year. We subsequently filed our base rate case on June 29, where we asked for a $65 million increase and an ROE of 10%. The company has also sought to use the remaining unprotected AFDIT [ph] funds in Kentucky to offset bills for customers who cannot afford to pay their bills. The commissioner elected to combine this request with a base rate case filing and we expect resolution by yearend. Last but not least, in our SWEPCO jurisdiction, we received approval from the commission to create a regulatory asset for the costs associated with Hurricane Laura. We will ask for similar treatments for the costs associated with Hurricane Delta, and we are hopeful that we can put this year's hurricane season safely behind us. In Texas, SWEPCO made its base rate case filing on October 13, where we are seeking a $90.2 million increase with an ROE of 10.35%. We're also seeking to increase the storm reserve and increase our vegetation management expenditures to minimize the risk of future outages to our Texas customers. We continue to make progress on our North Central Wind projects, which will benefit our customers in Louisiana, Arkansas and Oklahoma. Foundation work is commenced at the Sundance facility, which is expected to be in service by the end of first quarter 2021, Invenergy is currently completing final site preparation on both the Maverick and Traverse locations. We continue to expect to acquire the Maverick facility by December 21, and the Traverse facility into December the first quarter of 2022 timeframe. We have filed our settlement true up in Arkansas and are finalizing our settlement true up in Oklahoma. We're looking forward to the benefits that these projects will bring to our customers, by providing access to some of the nation's richest wind resources and helping SWEPCO and PSO advance a greener energy future. So now to the equalizer chart, I'll talk about that. I think it's on Page 5 of the presentation. So our current ROE is about 9%. And you know we just generally target these returns to be in the 9.5% to 10% range. The ROEs below are not where they normalized. And certainly, keep in mind that we're also thickening equity layers as well. So, I'll talk about AEP Ohio first, I just mentioned the rate case there. It's above authorized primarily due to favorable regulatory items, partially offset by the roll off of the legacy issues that we've been talking about for years, regarding the [indiscernible] and the RSR. But we also expect the yearend ROE to trend around the authorized levels of 10%. For APCo, which I'd mentioned earlier is slightly below authorized, due a lower normalized usage and higher depreciation from increased capital investments, partially offset by continued management of the O&M expenses. Effective January 2020, costs associated with the last 17.5% of Wheeling Power's interest in Mitchell plant became recoverable through APCo and Wheeling rates. And then I've already discussed Virginia's tri-annual review. Kentucky, I already discussed the rate case there, but they're below and as you can see well-below authorized due to loss of load from weak economic conditions and loss of major customers, along with higher expenses during the stay out period. So, we have a lot of work to do there. I&M, the ROE for I&M at the end of third quarter was 10.4%. Its ROE was above authorized due to continued management of O&M expenses, reduced interest expense and rate true ups, partially offset by lower commercial industrial sales. I&M's ROE is projected to trend slightly below 10% by yearend, consistent with authorized ROEs in Michigan and in Indiana. PSO, its ROE is 8%. At the end of third quarter, it was below its authorized level primarily due to lower normalized usage and unfavorable weather in 2020, partially offset by continued management of O&M expenses. PSOs 2019 base case as you recall, approved the transmission track or a partial distribution tracker, and ROE of 9.4% authorized, so we'll continue to make progress there. SWEPCO, the ROE for SWEPCO is about 7.4%, and as you recall, much of that is related to the Turk Plant not being in retail rates in Arkansas, and that impacts by about 110 basis points. SWEPCO received an order in its Arkansas base case settlement in December 2019, and effective 2020 approved a $24 million revenue increase in ROE of 9.45%. In October 2020, we also filed the rate case in Texas, as I mentioned earlier. In AEP Texas, its ROE is around 7.5%, it was below authorized due to lag associated with a tiny of annual cost recovery filings. We did not make those filings during the pendency of the previous rate case, and of course, onetime adjustments from our finalized base rate case itself. Favorable regulatory treatment allows AEP Texas to file annual DCRF and TCOS filings, and we've since filed many of those at this point. I think there's been three cases that have been filed. And while earnings should improve in 2020, with a base rate case finalized and annual filings now resumed continued levels of investment in Texas will impact the ROE. The expectation is for the ROE to trend towards an authorized ROE of 9.4% in the long-term, but be around probably 8% by the end of 2020. As far as the transmission company is concerned, AEP Transmission Holdco was 9.8%, and it was below authorized primarily driven by the annual revenue true up in the second quarter of 2020 to return the over collection of 2019 revenues. Transmission is forecasted an ROE of 9.8% to 10.1% range in 2020. It is also interesting to note, that when you look at the average equity in our operating jurisdictions, The Transmission Holdco is now the largest, which that's happened for the first quarter. This first quarter that has actually occurred. So, making a lot of progress. But at the same time, though the investment is being made relative to transmission is certainly improving the quality of service to our customers. So, very happy with the progress we're making around our T&E investments and its ability to improve customers' experiences. As I close, I'd be remiss in not thanking our employees at the Oklaunion Power Station that was officially retired from service a couple of weeks ago, after several decades of providing generation resources, and meeting the needs of our customers electricity demands in Texas and Oklahoma. Oklaunion was under construction about the time I joined AEP out of college. And when you see people and assets retiring, it just further illustrates the resiliency of AEP over the last 114 years, but also the change occurs and we have to change with it. Thanks again to all the Oklaunion employees through the years. So, all-in-all, a solid quarter for AEP and I can't resist when thinking about AEPs future post-COVID, with the latent value of the need for resiliency and reliability of the grid to support work from home environments, moving forward with the transformation to clean energy resources, which we had AEP or in the beginning stages of, and the further electrification of the economy. We would say in the words of late Eddie Van Halen, it's about time, this time's our time, and right on, we'll let it shine. I am convinced in overcoming the challenges of 2020. This company will be even stronger as we move into 2021 and beyond. Brian? Good morning, Julien. When we look at the load forecast, I mean if you assume 2021 is going to be better, which we believe it is. And you look at that mix, we don't see residential. I mean, obviously, it will moderate as the economy comes back on the industrial and commercial side, commercial in particular. But still, you're going to have a continued longstanding remnant of improved residential support just by virtue of what companies have learned from the work from home environment. So, I'm a little bit bullish on the load and then at least a financial picture associated with load. And then when you look at the O&M this achieving excellence program it has truly been a fundamental change for us and augmentation of all the lean activities and other things that we did before. And it really is focused on a regular part of our budget process to ensure that we're capturing savings and every step along the way. So, feeling pretty good about the continual progress year-on-year of achieving excellence. Yes, so I guess, well, first of all, it's the election, certainly as a noisy election cycle, and who knows what's going to happen here, we never know. But we've got 114 years history of managing between the goalposts here, so we'll continue to do that. And our focus is on move into that clean energy economy. So really, the only difference obviously, is maybe the pace at which the change will occur if there's a Biden administration versus Trump. But nevertheless, it doesn't change that much for us, because we're focused on moving that clean energy economy as quickly as we can, to ensure that we are making that transition into the future that we know it's going to happen. Now, who knows where technology will go, even for fossil fuels, but nevertheless, we'll continue that transition to renewables and certainly some natural gas to ensure that we are delivering for our customers in the future. So, from a client perspective, we have an excellent record and I think that's why we get seen from the ESG community where they know what we're doing, they know what our message is, we're making continual progress. And we'll continue to make that progress. And then when you think about, as I said, in my original write up, I used the word latent, because it is a somewhat of an undeveloped or emerging activity around electrification of the economy, certainly around O&M and what we find with digitization and automation. And then, of course, as we move forward with the transformation, the generation transformation that we see ahead of us. So that's, that's why I'm feeling pretty good about where this company is heading. I think the [Indiscernible]. Yep. Good morning, James. Hello? Hey, James, we feel like it's still going to be the end of the summer, but obviously it could fall into that range in the first quarter, we're confident of that particular range. But remember, we're not making any progress payments, either. It's sort of we require it when it's done. So from a financial perspective it's fine. James, Brian mentioned the options we're looking at. And rest assured internally, we're also being at the death. So, we'll make sure that we're making the right decisions relative to the timing associated with those investments. Yes, we are. It's that timeframe, yes. Good morning, Michael. Yes. Alabama is doing good though. I'm sure you're happy with that. Hey, I think there's no doubt that -- and again, I think there was a lot of advantage taken with it with the tax reductions that occurred. And you're right, there's no doubt that there will be headroom that is reduced, because it is certainly going to be an impact to put those back in. Now, the question is how to put back in or what time frame and that kind of thing. But also that's why it's so important for us to move forward as quickly as possible and accelerate achieving excellence, so that we can mitigate that impact as much as possible. But still, you're looking at it in the face of a definite need for rehabilitation and continued capitalization of the grid to ensure that we have reliability and resiliency of supply, particularly when you're dealing with hurricanes, wildfires, cyber, all those kinds of issues we have to respond to that. So there'll be rate increases associated with the implementation of new taxes. And I think it's unavoidable, but certainly it's incumbent on us to make sure we mitigate that as much as possible with our achieving excellence program and other measures. And we'll have discussions with the commissions, just like we had discussions when tax reform occurred. And, it's unfortunate we didn't do it over a longer period of time like we had suggested, because then it would mitigate even the return of taxes. And if we continue vacillating back and forth like this, that's going to be a continual issue for our industry that our regulators need to recognize. We do have to keep some reserve there to ensure that we're not moving customer rates around, as much as could be as if it becomes pretty volatile. So, your point is well recognized, but we'll do what we can to mitigate the effects and we'll have those conversations. But I think one thing that's also come into play here, though is, is the nature of the importance of the service that we provide, for everyone to be able to watch their Netflix or do all the things they need to do at home, work from home. All those sorts of activities will change the nature of how we look at residential supply. And there's no question that that's going to change going forward. And that's why I'm always troubled by the commission saying that AMR versus AMI, for example, the investments we want to make in AMI, it's not because AMI is you don't just look at the cost of the meters of AMI and the undepreciated balance associated with AMR. You've got to look at what you're leveraging into and that's the customers' ability to adjust to their own energy picture and be able to drive energy efficiency and all those things and give the customer the opportunity to do that, as opposed to of the system just decide in that forum. So, I think there's just a lot of things we need to have discussions about with our regulators to really focus on what that future actually means. And with electrification of the economy, that's clearly going to be an issue that we need to deal with to make sure our customers are more resilient, more reliable and as economic as possible, but also give them the opportunity to make adjustments on their total bill as opposed to dealing on a headline on rate increases. Yes, I think, we're looking at all of our states now and all our state jurisdictions, and it's really sort of our resource planning on steroids. And even the dogs like it. And I think there's no question that we're in the process of moving forward with that transformation as quickly as possible, making significant T&D investments, but all and you see that based on the changes in capital. But then when you look at states like West Virginia, we will be -- I think the first step is going to be how we run coal fired capacity, for example, where we have other forms of energy coming in and have lower capacity factors on coal units, but still they be available if those times where, you have severe cold weather, or really warm weather in the summer. So, it's a way we run these facilities during the interim, but then it's also that transition that we make going forward. I think that's true for all of the jurisdictions.

And actually, post-election, who knows what'll happen, but I still see, you're already seeing some Republican and Democratic legislation that's being proposed that tries to answer that question. And if you have that from a national standpoint and the states are moving forward with their own resolutions, and then we can be particularly helpful in ensuring that occurs as quickly as possible. No, that's fine. Yes, sure thing. Good morning. Yes. So, we have multiple utilities, right. So, we have the opportunity to move around capital investment to time it with relative rate case activity to ensure that we are spinning on the right things at the right time. Not to say that we're trying to load the budgets or anything, what we're saying is that, that when we go through the rate case, filings, it's important to not only have discussions with the Commissions about what we're spending on, but what the results of that spending will be.

But if it isn't, you're still having to make choices about what the priorities are for each regulatory jurisdiction based on discussions with the Commissions to help us determine, okay, number one, what are we willing to pay for, number two, what are those priorities that exist. And some of those are absolute priorities and some of them are things that yes, we'd like to do, but it may be that we have to work out for a longer period of time before bringing that in. So, there's all kinds of dialogues that occur, relative to what that prioritization should be. And we'll continue doing that with our Commissions. And we have done, whether it's gone, where the economy is going well, or whether the economy has been in a downturn. I think we're moving toward an upturn. So that's going to be helpful. And some of these things are known and reasonable adjustments too, so you have to look at the 2020 test year and say, we had to make these changes because of COVID. And COVID is going to be sort of a unique circumstance and then we had to react. And actually, the Commissions themselves, we had moratoriums on customer cut-offs. So, there is adjustments we all made in that process, and I think we'll make those adjustments coming out of that process as well. Well, so when we talk about potential assets, we look at everything, and we look at sources and uses. And obviously, we want the use part of it right now is how do we finance North Central Wind, a major project. And the sources can be anything in our portfolio, and that's where portfolio management is going to be a key part of what we do in the future. So, I'm not going to say, specifically what we're looking at, or anything like that at this point. But what I will say is that it's incumbent on us to be looking at everything from a source perspective, and then focusing on how we deploy capital in the best way and transfer that into really projects like North Central, and be able to fund it in the best way to ensure our shareholder value. And we will continue to do that. So, I think you got what the sort of year play out. Yep."

            "content": "Thank you, Nick and good morning, everyone. I will take us through the third quarter and year-to-date financial results, provide some insight on load in the economy, review our balance sheet and liquidity and finish with a preview of what we will present at the EEI conference. Let's start briefly on Slide 6, which shows the comparison of GAAP to operating earnings for the quarter and year-to-date periods. GAAP earnings for the third quarter were $1.51 per share, compared to $1.49 per share in 2019. GAAP earnings through September were $3.56 per share, compared to $3.58 per share last year. There's a reconciliation of GAAP to operating earnings on Pages 15 to 16 of the presentation. Let's turn to Slide 7, and look at the drivers of quarterly operating earnings by segment. Operating earnings for the third quarter were $1.47 per share or $728 million, compared to $1.46 per share or $722 million in 2019. Operating earnings for vertically integrated utilities were $0.85 per share down $0.04. This was driven by unfavorable weather, primarily due to warmer than normal temperatures last year, particularly in September. Other drivers including lower wholesale load and other operating revenue, as well as higher depreciation and taxes, primarily due to timing that were averse in the fourth quarter. Favorable items included lower O&M, favorable rate changes and higher transmission revenue. The transmission and distribution utility segment earned $0.31 per share up $0.04 from last year. Favorable items included higher rate changes in transmission revenue, as well as lower O&M. These favorable items were partially offset by unfavorable weather, depreciation, taxes and interest expense. The AEP Transmission Holdco segment continue to grow, contributing $0.28 per share an improvement of $0.03. This reflected the return on investment growth as net plant increased by $1.5 billion or 16% since September of last year. Generation and marketing produced operating earnings of $0.13 per share, down $0.03 from last year. This was driven by timing around income taxes and lower wholesale margins. Finally, corporate and other was up a penny from last year, primarily driven by lower taxes related to consolidating items that will reverse by year-end. Let's turn to Slide 8, and review our year-to-date results. Operating earnings through September were $3.56 per share or $1.77 billion, compared to $3.65 per share or $1.8 billion in 2019. Looking at the drivers by segment, operating earnings for vertically integrated utilities were $1.90 per share comparable to last year. Favorable items in this segment included lower O&M, the impact of rate changes across multiple jurisdictions and higher transmission revenue primarily due to true ups. Weather was unfavorable due to warmer than normal winter temperatures this year and a warmer summer in 2019. Other decreases included higher depreciation and tax expenses, primarily due to timing and lower revenue items and AFUDC. The transmission and distribution utility segment earned $0.84 per share down a penny from last year. The negative variance was primarily driven by the 2019 reversal of a regulatory provision in Ohio. Other smaller drivers included higher depreciation and interest expense, the roll off of legacy riders in Ohio, prior year Texas carrying charges, unfavorable weather and tax expenses. These items were mostly offset by higher rate changes, the recovery of increased transmission investment in OCA [ph] and the impact of the Ohio transmission true up on both O&M and transmission revenue. Other O&M was also favorable due to the concerted effort to decrease O&M expenditures through one time and sustainable reductions. The AEP Transmission Holdco segment contributed $0.75 per share, down $0.07 from last year due to the impact of the annual true up and prior year FERC settlements. Our fundamental return on investment growth continued. Generation and marketing produced $0.31 per share, up a penny from last year. The Renewables business grew with asset acquisitions more than offsetting lower wholesale and retail margins and timing around income taxes. O&M sales and other onetime items offset the impact of weaker wholesale prices on the generating business. Finally, Corporate & Other was down $0.02 per share due to higher interest in taxes related to consolidating items that were reversed by the yearend, and offset by a prior year income tax adjustment. Partially offsetting these items was lower O&M. Overall, we are pleased with our financial results and are confident in confirming our annual operating earnings guidance of $4.25 to $4.45 per share. Turning to Slide 9, let's review the assumptions we shared during the first quarter earnings call to reaffirm guidance. Starting with the topline, we recently updated our retail sales forecast. Third quarter sales came in higher than previously projected. We now expect 2020 normalized sales to come in 2.7% below last year, which is 0.7% better than the load forecast from the first quarter. While the outlook has improved, it is still below the pre-recession forecast used for our original guidance. The favorable sales mix in 2020 has helped to mitigate the impact on earnings. The second item was the impact of weather. While the first quarter weather produced a significant drag, the second quarter and third quarter weather impacts were slightly favorable. In the second quarter presentation we mentioned that, July's weather was quite favorable. However, August and September weather was mild. As a result, we have revised the weather impact on 2020 earnings and now expect a $0.08 drag to 2020 results. The next item was on track the O&M expense. We had originally planned to drive O&M cost down to $2.8 billion from $3.1 billion in 2019. In response to the expected sales decline, we identified an additional $100 million of savings for both onetime in sustainable reductions and are on track to hit this lower expense target. Finally, we identified approximately $500 million of capital expenditures in the first quarter that could be shifted out of 2020 and in the future years. We made this decision to support our cash position through the expected downturn during the pandemic. As we discussed at the second quarter earnings call, results have come in better than expected and we've reinstated approximately $100 million of the $500 million back into 2020. Given the progress we've made on these key assumptions, we were able to reaffirm our 2020 operating earnings guidance range. Now let's turn to Slide 10, to provide an update on our normalize load. Starting in the lower right corner, our third quarter normalized load was down 2.6%, this was slightly better than the forecast we shared with you in the first quarter. Through September, our normalized sales were down 3% from last year. In the upper left quadrant, our normalized residential sales increased by 3.8% in the quarter. Year-to-date residential sales were up 2.6%. We saw significant increases in our residential load at the beginning of the pandemic. The growth in residential sales has moderated as people return to work over the summer. Weather normalized residential sales are up across all jurisdictions. Moving clockwise, our normalized commercial sales decreased by 4.6% in the third quarter, bringing the year-to-date decline to 4.9%. As expected, the biggest declines in this class came from schools, churches, restaurants and hotels. Finally in the lower left chart, industrial sales decreased by 7.8% in the quarter, bringing the year-to-date decline to 7%. A number of factors have changed the outlook for this class, but the biggest driver is overall economic activity. The industrial sectors that posted the biggest declines for the quarter were mining, oil and gas extraction and primary metals. By contrast, plastics and rubber manufacturing posted a strong quarter related to the recovery of the automotive industry. Overall, load growth across the service territory followed the pattern we anticipated earlier in the year. During the second quarter, residential sales peaked and commercial and industrial sales hit their lows. Since then, our service territory has been working its way back to a more normalized levels. Because some businesses will continue to work remotely, we expect our residential sales to continue at higher levels for some time. Let's take a deeper look into why we raised our outlook for normalized load on Slide 11. The solid bars represent weather normalized load growth by quarter end 2020. The green lines represent the updated load forecast we shared during the first quarter earnings call. At that time, there was still a lot of uncertainty regarding the depth and duration of the economic slowdown and how customers would respond. While that forecast accurately predicted the depth of the contraction in the second quarter, our third quarter results indicated a better recovery than forecasted. Our latest view, anticipates a continuation of this trend barring another shutdown of the economy. Now let's move on to Slide 12 and review the company's capitalization and liquidity. Our debt to capital ratio remain unchanged in the third quarter and stands at 61.1%. Our FFO to debt ratio decreased 1.3% during the quarter to 12.8% on a Moody's basis, primarily due to timing of fuel recovery, storm cost deferrals and a pension contribution. Importantly, we expect this metric to end the year in the low to mid-teens, consistent with the guidance we have provided. Our liquidity position remains strong at $3.8 billion, supported by a revolving credit facility. Before providing an update on pension funding, I would like to discuss the plan to finance the North Central Wind Project. As a reminder, we have stated that we intend to use equity to finance approximately two-thirds of this $2 billion project. We plan to issue equity in coordination with the completion of the three individual projects that comprise North Central Wind. For this reason, we will take a flexible approach which could include and at the market mechanism, asset rotation, as well as traditional secondary offerings. This approach avoids unnecessary dilution and helps us deliver on the 5% to 7% earnings growth rate. Turning to our pension, I am pleased to report that funding increased 3.6% during the quarter to 97%, and our OPEB Funding increased 5% to 141%. Strong equity returns was the primary driver for the increases. The pension plan also benefited from a company contribution in the amount of the plan's annual service cost of $111.5 million. Let's wrap this up on Slide 13, so we can get to your questions. We are reaffirming our existing 2020 operating earnings guidance of $4.25 to $4.45 per share. Our message at EEI will be that we are leading the way forward as a premium regulated utility with an ESG focus delivering 5% to 7% earnings growth with dividends growing in line with earnings. Our plan includes the $2 billion North Central Wind project in Oklahoma, benefiting our customers in PSO and SWEPCO as we transition to a cleaner energy future. We will provide detailed drivers for 2021 earnings guidance by segment and updates to our capital expenditure and financing plans. We look forward to talking with many of you at the virtual EEI conference in a couple of weeks. One final item, in 2021, we will release 2020 fourth quarter and full year earnings in late February, coincident with the filing of the 2020 10-K, like we did last year. With that, I will turn the call over to the operator for your questions. Julien, I think a lot of the things that we're going to talk about are renewable opportunities in addition to North Central Wind, how we're transitioning from a carbon-based generating fleet much more to a lot of the renewables that the Virginia Clean Energy Act enables and legislation in Indiana enables as well. So we're going to provide a lot more detail on that at EEI and take you through what that looks like. You have the renewable requirement in Virginia. You mentioned APCo. We've got the requirement there. And also Indiana, Michigan, we continue to do renewables in various areas there. We're also doing renewables, we just did fourth sale in Oklahoma. And then we also have renewable applications here in Ohio that are brewing as well. So, we'll have plenty to talk about. And I think, we don't we don't spend and then maybe we should spend more talking about the opportunities we've got available to us from a renewable standpoint. But the way I see it is that, we're just on the precipice of a massive transformation to renewable resources. And AEP, if you look at the runway it's pretty substantial. And that will continue particularly as we do individual relationships with customers, but also in terms of the regulated side as well, through the Integrated Resource Planning process. So we'll certainly talk more about that at November EEI. Julien, the low to mid-teens is completely consistent with our prior messaging on FFO to debt. And that outlook was incorporated in Moody's when they made their adjustments back in August. And remember that will continue to improve as some of this accumulative deferred income taxes that is being repaid to the regulatory jurisdictions are occurring much more quickly than we thought, maybe we originally thinking 10 years. And it turned out to be five years. And that's occurring more quickly. So that FFO to debt metric will pick up as that rolls off. Yes. Yes. So let me start with the 2.7% load degradation. It's what you would expect. It's largely commercial and industrial sales. The decrease is being offset by residential. And so, what we've seen is it takes more than just looking at the raw numbers on residential, commercial and industrial, it's really the mix. You remember, we make more margin on residential sales than we do on commercial and industrial. And that mix has come in better than we had anticipated at the beginning of the pandemic. So, it's not been as dire as what we thought it might be because of what's happened with the sales mix, rather than just the overall decreases. So that's been positive. Looking forward on O&M, we have for a number of years been tightening our belt and been very, very tight around untracked O&M in that $2.8 billion to $3.1 billion range. And with what we're doing with achieving excellence, and everything else we're doing with sustainable and non-sustainable O&M cuts, I'd anticipate us being towards the lower end of that range going forward. Just a quick update on taxes. If we were to have an increase in taxes, we anticipate that our commissions would handle it. Really, one of two ways and not dissimilar to how they handled tax reform three or four years ago. We anticipate that they would either allow the increase to be deferred until the next rate proceeding, or we anticipate that they'd have kind of a one issue, order come out where they would allow us to adjust rates just to reflect the new expected higher income tax rate. In any event, we wouldn't expect it to be a significant driver to earnings or cash for the company going forward. Yes. Again, we don't anticipate it to be significant one way or the other. Thank you. Yes, a lot of it has to do more so than actual physical things. It's our ability to get permitting and the like done. And so during the shutdown, it was hard to be able to get into the offices, do land acquisitions, title searches and things like that. And that just potentially pushed us back at big teams. We're not in anticipating anything material there. We still anticipate late this year to early next year which is one of the signal that due to some of those unanticipated issues largely associated with COVID that that project could have a range of when it would come online. It kind of matches what Nick was saying is that the projects don't -- we don't get the projects until commercial completion is done, we then get the project. And given the discrete nature of them, we can really time the equity issuance very closely with when the project comes online. And James the reason, we need that flexibility, you look at Sundance, which we're anticipating in the first quarter of 2020, that's about a $300 million project. We'll be able to time the equity issuance, if that's what it is closely with when that project comes online. The next one, which we're anticipating at the end of 2021, is about a $400 million project, Maverick. And then the last one is Traverse, which is about $1.3 billion and we talked about that being late 2021, early 2022. We believe that whether it's an aftermarket program, a follow on issuance or asset rotation, we're going to be able to time those very, very closely with when those discrete projects come online. So from a modeling standpoint, the timing that we're talking about really is going to be insignificant to 2021. And I'd start repeating myself and shaping it in 2021. Thanks, James. Sophie, we also have some jurisdictions that have forward looking test years, so we'll be able to incorporate a forward looking view. And then we have places like Ohio, where residential and small commercial are already decoupled. So, there are lots of mitigations to unusual load circumstances that we find ourselves in right now."

        "content": "Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much for standing by, and welcome to the American Electric Power Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. At this time, all lines are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given to you at that time. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, today\u2019s conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Darcy Reese. Please go ahead.\nDarcy Reese: Thank you, Cynthia. Good morning everyone and welcome to the second quarter 2020 earnings call for American Electric Power. We appreciate you taking the time to join us today. Our earnings release, presentation slides, and related financial information are available on our website at aep.com. Today we will be making forward-looking statements during the call. There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements. Please refer to our SEC filings for a discussion of these factors. Joining me this morning for opening remarks are Nick Akins, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Brian Tierney, our Chief Financial Officer. We will take your questions following their remarks. I will now turn the call over to Nick.\nNick Akins: Okay. Thanks Darcy. And welcome, everyone to American Electric Power's second quarter 2020 earnings call. While, we continue to see the effects of COVID-19 pandemic, AEP has responded well with not only ensuring the safety of our employees and redefining the business processes to accommodate the changed environment and reducing our costs in response to lower revenues, but we also are responding to hurricane and storm activity to ensure the safe and reliable service to our customers. Our team at AEP Texas with support from internal and external resources performed well through Hurricane Hanna to restore power to over 200,000 customers during that recent weather event. And we're now supporting recovery efforts in the Northeast as well. While COVID cases were escalated in some areas, we continue to engage our employees on safe practices to prevent the virus spread both at work and outside of work to set an example in our communities. On the financial front our operating earnings performance has been strong in the face of these challenges. AEP's operating earnings came in for the quarter at $1.08 per share, bringing our year-to-date operating earnings to $2.10 per share versus $1 share for second quarter 2019 and $2.19 per share year-to-date 2019. We are reaffirming our originally stated guidance range of $4.25 to $4.45 per share and our 5% to 7% long-term growth rate. AEP is also adjusting our capital upward during the five-year capital forecast period from $33 billion to $35 billion to accommodate the North Central wind project addition. Also as we stated in the last quarter earnings call, we have continued to evaluate the short-term deferral of $500 million in our 2020 capital program that we talked about last quarter and we are placing $100 million back into the 2020 plan at this point. So all-in-all a constructive quarter given the headwinds of the economy due to COVID. In fact we continue to make progress toward our target of achieving at least the midpoint of the guidance range. As far as load is concerned, we continue to see the arbitrage between residential load and negative industrial and commercial load during the quarter. As we continue to look for leading indicators as to the health of the state economies, we have been pleased to see the new customer connections remain stable and some jurisdictions increasing from 2019 levels. Looking forward, we expect to see a continued shift to a certain degree from residential load back to commercial and industrial, albeit these shifts will be dependent upon the nature of the pandemic recovery. During the COVID-19 crisis, we continue to take all appropriate measures to ensure the safety of our employees both in the field and for those who can work-from-home. Temperature, testing masking requirements, social distancing and hygiene have become the normal course of business in this environment. While our offices are open to employee meetings and certain other activities, we are still asking our employees who can work-from-home to remain home, most likely through the end of the year. This has not slowed the progress, however, toward redefining our business processes going forward. Our Achieving Excellence Program is now back in full swing with the added dimension of work-for-home learnings that will enable us to define even more efficiencies than previously considered. We also late last year, completed an initial analysis of what a 21st century technology framework would look like, and with the addition of Therace Risch former JCPenney EVP, Chief Information Officer to our team. She has by the way hit the ground running. I'm confident the nexus of her efforts around IT and other technologies married with achieving excellence, COVID learnings, and other strategic initiatives will enable us to further define operating efficiencies that will benefit our customers and shareholders. We are on track for the $100 million of cost reductions for this year as we adjust to expectations regarding revenues due to COVID-19 and the first quarter weather deficiencies that we had. And after reviewing our July weather, we have partially made up for the weather issue that we talked about during the first quarter. So we are making progress within the guidance range expectations and we are now targeting the midpoint of our guidance. As we move closer to 2021 and the addition of North Central wind, we will still be disappointed not to be in the upper half of our 5% to 7% long-term growth rate. I would like to spend a little time taking -- talking about steps we are taking to internally consider the effects of the recent and ongoing discussions about race in America. AEP is not only engaged externally with various local and national organizations, but we were also open to very frank and open dialogue internally. We call it our cease-the-moment action plan. This plan includes engagement with our leaders and employees in the organization through internal discussions, external speakers, webcasts including myself now to be posted internally and process changes that will continue to make AEP a strong committed company that enables all of our employees to contribute in an open and transparent fashion. We have a great culture at this company, but we can always do better by understanding the impacts of stereotypes different perspectives based upon life experiences, the burden placed on employees of color in our organization and what systemic racism versus individual racism act actually means. I believe the dialogue will enable a much deeper discussion that will benefit our diversity and inclusion efforts as well as enable AEP to be a better partner to our communities, as we effectuate lasting change. We can't talk about these cultural attributes without also realizing what our brand projects externally. And that brings me to the second issue that we at AEP certainly believe affects our brand. That would be the issue surrounding Ohio House Bill six legislation. Let me start by saying that we are not aware of any information suggesting that AEP's participation in the process was anything other than lawful and ethical. We have a robust code of ethics and regularly communicate our expectations to our employees that they conduct all business including advocacy on public policy issues with integrity, honesty and in compliance with the law. We consistently advocate for policy positions that benefit our customer's, communities and shareholders and our advocacy of HB6 was no different. We ultimately supported the legislation because we believe it maintained important fuel diversity for Ohio including support for investments in renewables, nuclear generation and two coal plants operated by OVEC. We were surprised and disappointed to learn of what federal investigators alleged was a scheme by the speaker of the Ohio House and others to enrich themselves. And we along with you have been trying to educate ourselves about the criminal complaint and the underlying conduct in it. There has been a lot of speculation and media reports about the identity of various unnamed companies described in the affidavit in support of the complaint. Based on the facts that we know, we do not believe that AEP is any of the companies specifically described in the affidavit. We have not been contacted by any authorities conducting the investigation. If at any point we are, we will cooperate fully. I would also like to discuss 501(c)(4) organizations more generally. AEP has contributed to a variety of 501(c)(4) social welfare organizations to promote economic development and educational programs across our service territories. One such organization is Empowering Ohio's Economy, which was organized to promote economic and business development in Ohio. Starting in 2015, AEP contributed a total of $8.7 million to Empowering Ohio's Economy for review of publicly available tax forms filed by Empowering Ohio's Economy shows that it made a number of grants over time to a wide variety of charitable organizations under 501(c)(3) and social welfare organizations under 501(c)(4). Our contributions to Empowering Ohio's Economy to support its mission were appropriate and lawful. Given the ongoing legal proceedings surrounding HB6 that we are still learning about and that we are unaware of any allegations of wrongdoing involving AEP, I'm going to let those proceedings play out rather than commenting further on this subject. We also understand the concerns that some have expressed regarding the lack of transparency surrounding 501(c)(4) organizations which are not required to disclose their donors and amounts donated to them. With that in mind, we will commit to include additional disclosures in our corporate accountability report with respect to contributions that we made to 501(c)(4) organizations in 2020 and going forward. We also are reviewing best practices and working to improve our policies and processes around political contributions and contributions to 501(c)(4) entities. Regarding any repeal and replacement of HB6, we are fully prepared as we have done previously to engage in whatever dialogue needs to occur to chart a path in Ohio toward a balanced energy portfolio that moves toward a clean energy future for Ohio. AEP has been very clear since the beginning of a nuclear debate that we were concerned about forging a path toward the adoption of renewables, such as solar and wind along with other technologies, such as storage to mobile technologies, the big data analytics to enable a smarter and more efficient grid. HB6 has some of that, but we were also following HB247 to move Ohio forward from a clean energy technology perspective. If HB6 is repealed in a way that appropriately reverses its effects, the financial impact is minimal to AEP. We already had several years of recovery for the OVEC units HB6 elongated that. We will continue to recover our energy efficiency contracts entered into before the legislation. AEP Ohio is already decoupled in many respects. And we will continue to pursue bilateral solar and wind projects with customers. As we have said since day one, if our customers are expected to help put the bill for nuclear, they should also have the opportunity to take full benefit of renewables and movement to a clean energy economy and be able to access technologies that will help them to lower their electric bills. Unrelated to HB6, but an item that should not be lost in the Ohio legislature is continued interest in promoting greater broadband access particularly in rural Ohio. This is an area that we are well positioned to help stimulate by providing middle-mile services to ISPs to advance the service for those communities. We are optimistic that the broadband legislation that passed the House with broad support continues forward as the pandemic has shown the digital divide is real and getting more pronounced and the need for broadband access for our customers particularly rural customers is desperately needed and we can leverage into our communication system to make broadband access a reality. We have already begun pilots in Virginia and West Virginia. And certainly with our large amounts of -- need for large amounts of data from the grid for monitoring and analysis purposes tangentially providing mid-mile broadband accessibility is clearly a benefit to our communities. On the regulatory front our base rate case in Ohio was filed earlier this year where we're seeking a net revenue increase of $41 million a 10.15% ROE and continuation of our DOE and Enhanced Service Reliability Rider. We expect a procedural schedule to be set next month. In Kentucky, we filed our base rate case in July which should conclude by year-end. We have sought $65 million with a 10% ROE as well as AMI deployment within the state. We sought to be creative in our use of ADFIT funds to help lessen the rate impacts to customers in the state. I am pleased to report that the Texas Commission approved the AEP Texas DCRF settlement agreement increasing revenue requirement by approximately $39 million which reflects the $440 million of distribution investment placed in service in 2019. Throughout our territory new customer interconnects continue to be strong in much of our service territory in several areas exceeding what we have seen in recent years. While the virus continues to challenge this nation this provides hope in American commitment and ingenuity will continue to help fuel our recovery. Lastly we are extremely pleased to have now received all necessary regulatory approvals to move the full North Central wind investment forward for the benefit of our customers. Although the disappointing PUCT denial of our application results in the project benefits not extending to our Texas customers, we received approvals from the Arkansas Public Service Commission and the Louisiana Public Service Commission in May for their portion and the flex-up option. Approval of flex-up option was designed to enable the full value of the project to go forward even if the state elected not to take advantage of the opportunity. We are pleased that the Arkansas Public Service Commission and the Louisiana Public Service Commission along with the Oklahoma Corporation Commission have recognized the value of these projects. And we look forward to delivering this value to Arkansas, Louisiana and Oklahoma customers. With regards to the project schedule due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we expect a minimal delay in the completion of the 199-megawatt Sundance Project and expect the project to be delivered in the first quarter of 2021 instead of December 2020. The other two projects are currently expected to be delivered by the developer by the end of '21 -- 2021. We are pleased to report in May the RAS provided an extra year to the 4-year continuity safe harbor related to production tax credit eligibility. So we have an additional year of flexibility should there be any delays to deliver these projects and achieve full value for our customers. Now looking at the equalizer graph on Page five of the presentation, our overall regulated operations ROE is currently 9.1%. We like to target a range overall of 9.5% to 10%. So I'll go into some other things around weather and the other things that have come into play. AEP Ohio, the ROE for AEP Ohio at the end of the second quarter was 11.1%. Their ROE was above authorized due to favorable regulatory items and a transmission true-up partially offset by the roll-off of legacy fuel and capacity carrying charge recoveries. We expect the year-end ROE to trend around authorized levels of 10% as we maintain concurrent capital recovery of distribution and transmission investment. In June 2020 as I said earlier, we filed a rate case in Ohio. As far as APCo is concerned the end of the second quarter was 9.3% ROE. That ROE was below authorized due to lower normalized usage and higher depreciation from increased capital investments. Virginia's first tri-annual review was filed in March 2020 and covers the 2017 to 2019 periods and that case is currently ongoing. At Kentucky Power the ROE is down to 5.7%. It was below authorized due to loss of load from weak economic conditions and loss of major customers along with higher expenses. Transmission revenues were also lowered due to the delay of some capital projects. In June 2020 Kentucky Power filed a new base rate case seeking a $65 million revenue increase and an ROE of 10%. I&M came in at 10.6% for the quarter. The ROE was above authorized due to continued management of O&M expenses reduced interest expense and rate true-ups partially offset by lower normalized usage. I&M's ROE is projected to trend towards 10% at year-end consistent with authorized ROEs. PSO came in at 9.4% for the quarter. Their ROE is right in line with the authorized level due to management of O&M expenses offset by lower normalization usage. PSO's 2019 base case approved a transmission tracker, a partial distribution tracker, and an ROE of 9.4%. So, everything is going well there. SWEPCO came in at 8.3%. And again it's below authorized due to loss of load and the continued impact of the Arkansas share of the Turk Plant which accounts for about 110 basis points. SWEPCO received an order in its Arkansas-based settlement in December 2019, that's effective in January 2020 approving a $24 million increase and an ROE of 9.45%. AEP Texas came in the quarter at 7.4%, their ROE was below authorized due to lag associated with the timing. We've discussed this earlier last quarter of the annual cost recovery filings and one-time adjustments from our recently finalized base rate case. Favorable regulatory treatment allows AEP Texas to file annual DCRF and biannual TCOS filings to recover costs on significant capital investments. So, while earnings should improve in 2020 with the base rate case finalized the annual filings now resumed continued levels of investment in Texas will continue to impact the ROE as well. AEP Transmission came in at 9.8%. It was below authorized primarily driven by the annual revenue true-up in the second quarter of 2020 and to return the over-collection of 2019 revenues. Transmission is forecasting an ROE of in the range of 9.9% to 10.3% for 2020. So, that should continue on as the year goes forward. As I've mentioned in the past, our organization has undertaken a comprehensive view of our O&M and capital spending efficiency under a program that we coined Achieving Excellence. I'm excited about this opportunity for our employees because it goes to the heart of how we do work, removing past barriers that may have existed, and looking at our processes through a different lens. We are now moving into the implementation phase of this initiative with opportunities for increased O&M savings and increased efficiencies in our capital spending being implemented over the next three years and beyond. This work will serve as the platform and help to integrate other initiatives around organizational design, digitization, end-to-end process efficiency, and work-from-home initiatives. The program will also be a precursor to our annual budgeting process in the future. We will share more information about these initiatives and the expected O&M savings later this year, but we have recently jump-started this initiative by offering an early retirement incentive program for a targeted set of our employees. The program has recently closed and I'm pleased to say that we have reached our goals of this initiative where about 200 of our employees have selected to take this incentive to retire. I'm thankful to those who will be leaving the company soon for many reasons. One, for their years of service and dedication to AEP and for providing the company an opportunity to take advantage of organizational design changes upon their exit. I'll be providing more detail when we wrap up all these initiatives later this fall. Before I turn this over to Brian, particularly, with the headwinds we all face today, I'd like to paraphrase some of the lyrics from the song Lost in the Echo by the rock group Linkin Park that I think represents AEP today. Now, it may take a little time for you to figure out what I'm saying here. But nevertheless the lyrics say; we don't hold back we hold our own, we can't be mapped we can't be cloned, we can't C-flat, it ain't our tone. What you get from AEP is our consistent focus on being a positive tone attitude and performance that will help our communities and customers get through this pandemic and the culture issues that's scarring our society. We will continue to be uniquely qualified to bring stakeholders together to move toward a clean energy future for our customers and again provide the quality dividends and earnings that our shareholders expect. Brian, I'll turn it over to you.\nBrian Tierney: Thank you, Nick and good morning everyone. I will take us through the second quarter and year-to-date financial results, provide an update on how we were thinking about 2020, including a look at July load, and finish with the review of our balance sheet and liquidity. Let's stop briefly on slide six which shows the comparison of GAAP to operating earnings for the quarter and year-to-date periods. GAAP earnings for the second quarter were $1.05 per share compared to $0.93 per share in 2019. GAAP earnings through June were $2.05 per share compared to $2.10 per share in 2019. There is a reconciliation of GAAP to operating earnings on pages 15 and 16 of the appendix. Let's turn to slide seven and look at the drivers of quarterly operating earnings by segment. Operating earnings for the second quarter were $1.08 per share or $534 million compared to $1 per share or $494 million in 2019. Operating earnings for Vertically Integrated Utilities were $0.55 per share, up $0.17, driven by lower O&M and higher transmission revenue primarily due to true-ups. Normalized retail load was favorable due to higher-margin residential sales more than offsetting significant decreases in industrial and commercial sales. We will talk more -- in more detail about our expectations around normalized load for the year later in the presentation. Other favorable items included weather and rate changes. These positive items were partially offset by higher depreciation and other taxes and lower wholesale load AFUDC and off-system sales. The transmission and distribution utility segment earned $0.29 per share, up $0.02 from last year. Both O&M and transmission revenue were favorable due to the impact of the transmission true-up on this segment. Increased transmission investment in ERCOT was positive as well. Rate changes were also favorable and partially offset by prior-year Texas carrying charges, the roll-off of legacy riders in Ohio, depreciation, lower normalized retail load and higher interest expense. The Transmission Holdco segment contributed $0.19 per share, down $0.12 due to the impacts of the annual true-up and a prior year FERC settlement. Our fundamental return on investment growth continued as net plant increased by $1.5 billion, or 17% since June of last year. Generation & Marketing produced operating earnings of $0.11 per share, up $0.05 from last year. Again on the sale of Conesville and land sales contributed to the increase in generation business and the renewables business grew with the acquisition of multiple renewable assets. These increases along with the timing around income taxes more than offset lower retail margins. Finally, Corporate and Other was down $0.04 per share primarily driven by higher taxes related to consolidating items that were reversed by the year-end and partially offset by lower O&M. Let's turn to slide 8 and review our year-to-date results. Operating earnings through June were $2.10 per share or $1 billion, compared to $2.19 per share or $1.1 billion in 2019. Looking at the drivers by segment. Operating earnings for Vertically Integrated Utilities were $1.05 per share, up $0.04. Earnings in this segment increased due to lower O&M and higher transmission revenue similar to the quarter as well as the impact of rate changes across multiple jurisdictions. Weather was unfavorable, primarily due to warmer than normal winter temperatures. Other decreases included higher depreciation, tax expenses and lower expected wholesale load, AFUDC, normalized retail load and off-system sales. The Transmission & Distribution Utilities segment earned $0.53 per share, down $0.05 from last year, primarily driven by a reversal of a regulatory provision in Ohio. Other smaller drivers, included higher depreciation, the roll-off of legacy riders in Ohio, prior-year Texas carrying charges, higher interest expense and unfavorable weather. These items were partially offset by higher rate changes, the Ohio transmission true-up impact on both O&M and transmission revenue and recovery of increased transmission investment in ERCOT. The AEP Transmission Holdco segment contributed $0.47 per share, down $0.10 from last year for the same reasons identified in the quarterly comparison. Generation & Marketing produced $0.18 per share, up $0.04 from last year. The growth in the renewables business and gains on generation more than offset the lower retail margins and timing around income taxes. Finally, Corporate and Other was down $0.02 per share due to higher interest expense and taxes related to consolidating items that will reverse by the year-end and offset by a prior year income tax adjustment. Partially offsetting these items is lower O&M. Turning to slide 9. Let's review the assumptions we shared during the first quarter earnings call. To reaffirm our 2020 operating earnings guidance range of $4.25 per share to $4.45 per share. As shown on the top line, we revised our retail sales projection from 1.5% growth in 2020 to a 3.4% decline by the end of the year. For the second quarter, our sales growth in total was on target with the revised projections. The mix of sales growth is slightly different than projected, but the date load is closely tracking to the revised forecast. The second item was the impact of weather. While the first quarter weather produced a significant drag, the second quarter weather was slightly favorable. In addition, we experienced warmer than normal weather in July, especially in the East. As a result, we are now assuming less of a negative impact to our 2020 results from weather. The third item was managing our untracked O&M expense. We had originally planned to drive down O&M costs in 2020 to $2.8 billion from $3.1 billion in 2019. During the first quarter call, we shared that in response to the expected decline in sales we now plan to reduce spend by an additional $100 million by aggressively managing O&M. We are on track to hit our projections through both one-time and sustainable reductions. Finally, on the first quarter call, we identified approximately $500 million of capital expenditures that could be shifted out of 2020 and into future years. This was in anticipation of the potential impact of the economic downturn on cash receipts. Through the second quarter, our day's sales outstanding have only marginally increased. We have brought about $100 million of the $500 million back into 2020 and we'll maintain flexibility as we move through the balance of the year. Given the progress made on these key assumptions in the second quarter, we are able to reaffirm our 2020 operating earnings guidance range. There are main items that could positively or negatively impact our projections for the second half of the year, but we are confident in our ability to manage our way through various scenarios. Now let's turn to slide 10 to provide an update on our normalized load for the quarter. Starting in the lower right corner, our second quarter normalized load was down 5.9%. This was consistent with the expectations we shared with you in the first quarter. We anticipated a significant contraction in the second quarter followed by a gradual recovery over the second half of the year. Through June, our normalized sales were down 3.1%. In the upper left quadrant, our normalized residential sales increased by 6.2% in the second quarter. Year-to-date residential sales were up 1.9% compared to last year. We saw significant increases in our residential load during the stay-at-home provisions that were in effect during the quarter. Even after our states began their phased reopenings, we saw strong growth in weather-normalized residential sales across all jurisdictions. This would suggest many of our customers have continued to work from home. We expect the spike in residential growth to moderate as the commercial and industrial sectors improve during the second half of the year. Moving clockwise, our normalized commercial sales decreased by 10.1% in the second quarter bringing the year-to-date decline to 5%. Prior to COVID, we had experienced consistent improvement in our commercial sales over the past year. State and post stay-at-home provisions challenged many of our commercial customers. All of our leading sectors experienced a drop in normalized load in the quarter with the biggest declines coming in schools, churches, restaurants and hotels. Should our states manage without having to shut down businesses again, we expect commercial sales to gradually improve throughout the balance of the year. Finally in the lower left chart, industrial sales decreased by 12.4% in the quarter bringing the year-to-date decline to 6.6%. A number of factors have changed the outlook for this class but the biggest driver is the overall drop in economic activity. The industrial sales \u2013 the industrial sectors that posted the biggest decline for the quarter were transportation, equipment, manufacturing, mining and primary metals. The two sectors that have grown in 2020 were pipeline transportation and petroleum and coal products. Let's take a look at weather-normalized load history and forecast in more detail on Slide 11. The chart on the left shows that for the second quarter actual load very closely tracked our revised forecast. As you can see from the chart, our revised forecast assumed an economic trough in the second quarter that would gradually improve over the course of the year. So far we are on track and we'll keep you updated as we move throughout the year. We wanted the time this call in order to give you the most updated load information through July. The chart on the upper right shows monthly total weather-normalized sales for March through July. Sales for our system were lowest in May and have shown improvement in June and July. Total normalized load for May was down 8.6% versus June, which was down 4.8% versus July, which was down only 2.4%. The monthly macro data for both the business and household surveys show that unemployment rates peaked in April and have improved since. This is consistent with our assumption that the trough is behind us and the economy should continue its gradual improvement through the balance of the year. The bottom right chart shows that for the month of July, the trend that we forecast for the balance of the year is on track. Although there are some differences in load mix to what we have predicted, our overall load is tracking very closely to our revised forecast. Normalized residential sales for July while still very positive at 4.3% were less than for the second quarter. And both commercial and industrial sales show real improvement versus the second quarter as shown on the prior page. Now let's move to Slide 12 and review the company's capitalization and liquidity. Our debt to total capital \u2013 our debt-to-capitalization ratio improved 70 basis points in the second quarter to 61.1%. This was largely attributable to reducing our short-term debt levels in conjunction with fortifying our liquidity position, as we navigated the capital market turbulence in March. In fact, our liquidity position stood strong at $2.9 billion at quarter end. The short-term reduction actions also helped improve our FFO-to-debt ratio when compared to the first quarter moving to 14.1% from 12.5% on a Moody's basis. Our Qualified Pension Funding remained flat at 93% and our OPEB Funding increased approximately 5% to 135%. A falling discount rate increased both plans liabilities during the quarter but strong asset returns especially in equities were able to offset the growth in liabilities. Let's wrap this up on Slide 13 so we can get to your questions. We are reaffirming our existing 2000 operating earnings guidance of $4.25 to $4.45 per share. We are on track to reduce our O&M by the additional $100 million we announced last quarter in response to the economic downturn and revised load implications. Of the $500 million of CapEx that we shifted out of 2020 into later years, we have now returned $100 million into this year. We will maintain our flexibility on this issue as we manage through the balance of the year. We obtained regulatory approvals in Oklahoma, Louisiana, Arkansas and FERC and are moving forward with our $2 billion North Central wind project in Oklahoma, benefiting our customers in PSO and SWEPCO. We have updated our capital plan from 33 \u2013 our five-year capital plan from $33 billion to $35 billion as well as our cash flow and credit metrics which are provided on Page 40 of the appendix. Because of our ability to continue to invest in our own system organically we are reaffirming our stated long-term growth rate of 5% to 7%. With that I will turn the call over to the operator for your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from the line of Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. And your line is open.\nNick Akins: Good morning, Jeremy.\nJeremy Tonet: Hi. Good morning.\nNick Akins: Good morning.\nJeremy Tonet: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions here. I wanted to start-off a couple of, I guess, opposing items influencing AEP going forward here North Central wind getting that over the finish line, obviously, a big positive COVID headwind on the other side here. Just wondering, if you could talk a bit more about how these two factors influence I guess your 5% to 7% range with North Central wind? I think we're just looking to see if that could really help you here, or just want to see how everything is shaking out I guess going forward?\nNick Akins: Yes. So I mean we look at -- and as Brian mentioned on the COVID activity and the load activity, you're seeing residential load be pretty strong. And certainly as you look forward I think residential load is going to continue to look strong with the work-from-home environment and the business cases that are developed afterwards. And then if you have Commercial and Industrial pickup as well, it could be positive from a financial standpoint. The other regarding North Central and other wind projects and solar projects, we have a real opportunity to transition to that clean energy economy going forward in our service territory and that will really makes us \u2013 again, we would be disappointed not to be in the upper part -- upper half of the 5% to 7% range because you have to be bullish about not only where load is going, but also in terms of the transformation from a -- just a pure and simple energy policy perspective regardless of who's in the White House in the next election, we'll continue moving toward a clean energy economy. And then also I think, bolstered by the other opportunities we have whether it's mid-range broadband or other types of activities electric vehicles and so forth that we're going to see the further electrification of this society. So I'm really bullish about this company in particular, but as well the industry.\nJeremy Tonet: That makes sense. That's helpful. Thanks. And maybe just kind of building off that with my second question. I think AEP is guiding to $1.3 billion of equity issuance to fund North Central at this point. Just wondering, if you could update us there on your thoughts with regard to is this definitively the path, or is there the potential for portfolio optimization? Is that still an option? I guess, how do you think about...\nBrian Tierney: It absolutely is still an option. And we're looking at all those options to see how to best finance it. We have plenty of time to make those things happen. Nick said that Sundance might be pushed out to the first quarter of 2021, but we're not going to see the rest of those projects coming in Traverse and Maverick until the end of 2021. So all those things are in play whether it's equity or rotation of capital. But for planning purposes we are guiding people to two-thirds equity for that project in aggregate.\nJeremy Tonet: Got you. That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you.\nNick Akins: Thanks, Jeremy.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Weisel with Scotiabank. And your line is open.\nNick Akins: Good morning, Andrew.\nAndrew Weisel: Good morning. First a question on dividends. So at the end of the deck you showed dividends in 2022 at $1.5 billion versus $1.4 billion previously. I also see the footnote that dividend should grow with earnings. My question is, is that increase of $100 million a function of more shares outstanding after the North Central wind equity, or does it imply a step-up in dividend per share along with a step-up in EPS or perhaps both?\nNick Akins: I think it'd be some of both because obviously with North Central additional equity involved there, but also as you said I mean our dividend will move with our earnings capability. So I'd say both.\nAndrew Weisel: Okay. Great.\nNick Akins: Brian, do you have any comments? Okay.\nAndrew Weisel: Go ahead.\nNick Akins: No, I was just seeing if Brian wanted to just comment on that but he said I covered it.\nAndrew Weisel: Okay. Great. On CapEx you mentioned that you're pulling back $100 million of the deferred CapEx. I just want to understand -- be sure I understand what drove that. Is that a function of specific projects being more necessary or more appealing, or is it more a function of the better-than-expected cash flows?\nNick Akins: Yes, I think that's a positive story. Some of that is related to new customer connections. And so it was clearly evident that we needed to move that forward. But also we have the capability financially to move it forward. We talked about this last time the deferral of the $500 million we weren't changing the five-year capital plan we were going to maintain that level. And the $500 million was merely being deferred so that we could understand what the COVID issues were going to be. And so we're continually looking at our process going forward in terms of putting that 500 back in in various stages. So what you saw this quarter was the first stage of that.\nAndrew Weisel: Very good. If I could just have one more here to clarify the last question from Jeremy. The 5% to 7% range you're pointing to the upper end of that. Is that a function of North Central wind now being included, or is it more that you're pointing to the higher end with or without North Central wind as a one-timer?\nNick Akins: Well, certainly, we looked at North Central, but obviously, we continue to track and we believe that the upper half of that guidance range is certainly achievable and something that we again would be disappointed not to be able to get there. So that's clearly an opportunity for us based on the things that I talked about earlier.\nBrian Tierney: It should \u2013 North Central wind should certainly solidify our position in the upper half.\nNick Akins: Yeah. And keep in mind too at the same time the Achieving Excellence Progam is continuing to grow. So we already have plans in place and you're seeing sort of a crescendo of savings associated with that plan. And the first year 2020 is \u2013 some of it's in there, but not much. And when you look at the future years that continues to grow substantially, and certainly, as I've mentioned earlier the addition of Therace and the focus on digitization automation in combination with the learnings from COVID, I think going to further accentuate the benefits from achieving excellence.\nAndrew Weisel: That all sounds great. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of James Thalacker with BMO Capital Markets. And your line is open.\nNick Akins: Good morning, James.\nJames Thalacker: Hey, good morning, guys. Can you hear me?\nNick Akins: Yep, I'm hearing you yes. Good morning.\nJames Thalacker: Okay. Great. Real quick question. I know you had outlined the bending the cost curve EEI down to kind of $2.8 billion. And as COVID took over we're now down at $2.7 billion. It seems like year-to-date if you just look at it on an after-tax basis you guys are already kind of running above that kind of $100 million sort of run rate. How should, we I guess think about the non-tracked O&M versus the additional O&M that you are actually pulling out in response to COVID? And as we think about 2021, is there any guidance, I guess you could give us on how much of that you think will be retainable as we move into next year?\nBrian Tierney: Yeah. So we're at this point James not able to provide obviously specific guidance on 2021. But I'll say, the incremental $100 million that we're able to garner is a combination of sustainable and one-timers. And I think it's a matter of managing our way through the downturn in normalized load and just working as hard as we can to pull out all the stops to make sure that we meet our commitments to shareholders and really target the middle part of that range without impacting customers. And so far, we've been able to do that. There have been some unexpected things that we've seen maybe some things that aren't line items in O&M that have come out. And I think you have things like travel and expense conventions that people go to things like that meals just buildings expense that you have things that just don't happen when everyone's working from home that, I think are more like one-timers but if people go back to work we'll start to put those things back into place. But you've seen our track record over the last nine or 10 years now and it's been keeping a very, very tight range on untracked O&M and we're using those skills that we've learned over the last several years to make sure that we're able to manage our way through this circumstance.\nNick Akins: Yeah, I would say, and as Brian mentioned I mean, there's a lot of learnings from COVID-19 and the impacts and how we've operated, and the efficiency of which we've operated. And I think it sort of changes, the perspective and changes the threshold of even, what one-timers are and ongoing, because I think the learnings we have from here we're going to be much different in our approach related to many of these activities. And actually, you would be surprised and I'll certainly talk about this more at the end of the year of what achieving excellence is showing us of things that were buried in the organization that we obviously have an opportunity to take advantage of. And so there's no question that you should expect the continued efficiency around the savings of O&M. And that's in the non-tracked area.\nBrian Tierney: You've seen \u2013 on page 34 of the presentation, you've seen the tight range we've been able to keep it in. In terms of bending the curve as we go down to $2.7 billion in non-track, we actually are bending that curve downward at this point.\nNick Akins: Yes. Bending to warping. So that's good.\nJames Thalacker: No, that's great. And I guess just as a follow-up, I mean, obviously the run rate has been very, very good. I mean, you did a heroic job, I guess in 2Q just the bulk of it from a year-to-date perspective that's kind of showed up. But as you move through the rest of the year do you feel like you have additional room whether it be onetime or again Nick like you're talking about through just kind of change in workflow to continue to sort of press that down, if you need to if we get sort of resurgence in COVID again?\nNick Akins: Yeah. I think number one really, I think about \u2013 the processes are in place and the focus of the organization is in place to be able to adjust. And I'm perfectly happy with the foundation that's been put in place for this organization on an ongoing basis. I mean, because if we look at our Achieving Excellence Program, it's not just a onetime program. It's a regular process we're going to go through in budgeting. And it's also a regular process, where they'll go throughout the year, for us to be able to adjust. So we will do what we have to do. And there's no question, that we have the foundation to be able to do it.\nJames Thalacker: Okay. Great.\nNick Akins: Yeah.\nJames Thalacker: Well, thank you for taking my question. And best of luck guys.\nNick Akins: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Next we will go to the line of Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI. And your line is open.\nDurgesh Chopra: Good morning, Nick.\nNick Akins: Hey good morning.\nDurgesh Chopra: Oh! That is down. Hello? Hey can you hear me?\nNick Akins: Yeah. Go ahead.\nDurgesh Chopra: Okay. Great, just -- I wanted to follow-up on the O&M $100 million number. What of that $100 million was actually achieved in the quarter?\nBrian Tierney: It will be the O&M CapEx or the O&M -- I'm sorry O&M caps. It's going to be achieved rateably throughout the balance of the year. So from second quarter, third and fourth, think about it being achieved rateably, as we work our way through that.\nDurgesh Chopra: Understood and I apologize there's like an echo in my -- when I'm speaking. So -- and then, the potential labor initiatives that you outlined is that in addition to the $100 million?\nBrian Tierney: It's all incorporated to get us to that $2.7 billion number.\nDurgesh Chopra: Understood guys. Thank you so much.\nBrian Tierney: Sure. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sophie Karp with KeyBanc. And your line is open.\nBrian Tierney: Good morning, Sophie.\nSophie Karp: Hi good morning guys. Good morning. Congrats on the quarter.\nNick Akins: Thanks.\nSophie Karp: And thanks for the time. I'm just curious about -- maybe I can ask you, more of a high-level question. Given the landscape or market landscape that we are seeing right now. Do you see an opportunity maybe an opening to do some rotation in your portfolio of assets maybe high-graded a little bit if you will and divest some? And is there an opportunity for M&A for a more wires focused or like just asset [Technical Difficulty] \u2026\nNick Akins: Yeah, Sophie.\nSophie Karp: \u2026your puts and thoughts on that.\nNick Akins: Yeah, sure, we've certainly been consistent in the discussion around any M&A activity or in terms of -- what we can do in terms of rotation. That's always an option that's available to us. And this company is moving toward, a portfolio management approach where obviously we have sources and uses and those sources include the assets we have. And certainly we'll continue to look at those, as opportunities in time with investments that we make. So we will continue to do that. Regarding M&A activity we have a high threshold because we certainly have the ability to invest we have the ability to -- we have the largest transmission system in the country. Certainly our investment in our distribution businesses is continuing to grow considerably. And so, if we can invest that out without a premium, that's a good thing for our shareholders. Now that being said, we look at strategic areas that make sense to us but certainly that threshold is high. And we'll continue to evaluate that. But make no mistake that this company is focused on its ability to continue to grow, but grow efficiently for our shareholders. And we'll continue to do that.\nSophie Karp: Thank you.\nNick Akins: Yeah. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. And your line is open.\nNick Akins: Good morning, Paul.\nPaul Patterson: Hey how are you doing?\nNick Akins: All right, how are you?\nPaul Patterson: I am managing. No laugh. So I can do like that. And so, I don't think of you guys, being a primary beneficiary or primarily impacted by HB6, but is there any ancillary or anything we should think about with the potential repeal of HB6 in Ohio, that could impact you guys?\nNick Akins: Well, certainly with the repeal, it's -- how it's replaced is the issue, and obviously how it's repealed. Because there are some things some interconnections that occurred between HB6 and the regulatory process, where we had regulatory recovery for areas that we need to make sure that's a clean transition that occurs. But on its face, the issues that were involved with that for us should be pretty well taken care of. So that's why we're saying it should be a minimal issue for us. I think it's more of an opportunity for us, because if we're able to -- and really if the state focuses on the clean energy economy going forward, that's going to provide us some opportunities to really do this the right way including nuclear for the -- for our customers going forward.\nPaul Patterson: But if it's not replaced, just because we don't know what's going to happen legislatively and who knows, how should we think about the potential impact?\nNick Akins: Yeah. So, if it's not replaced, then it stays the way it is then we should be fine, because there are already...\nPaul Patterson: I mean, it's repealed and they don't -- they repeal it and they don't replace it if you file...\nNick Akins: Okay, okay good. Brian?\nBrian Tierney: So, we'll be fine in that circumstance, Paul. We already had decoupling in place for residential and small commercial customers. We were already getting recovery of OVEC through 2024 through the regulatory process rather than 2030, and it allowed us to enter into bilateral contracts with customers, but we haven't signed any bilaterals to date. So, we think will be absolutely fine, if it's repealed and not replaced. But as Nick said, I think there are opportunities to do it right and replace it with something that's more positive.\nNick Akins: Yes, we've done bilateral contracts just not with that structure. So\u2026\nPaul Patterson: Okay, great. And then just on the PJM 205, end-of-life transmission planning filing. I know you guys are protesting that with almost every other transmission company. Do you have any sense as to what the potential impact would be from a shareholder perspective on transmission CapEx or anything else, if that 205 filing is accepted by FERC?\nBrian Tierney: Paul, we think it would be pretty minimal to us.\nNick Akins: Yeah.\nPaul Patterson: Okay. Good. Awesome, thanks so much.\nBrian Tierney: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And at this time, I'm showing no other questions in queue. Please go ahead with any closing remarks.\nDarcy Reese: Thank you for joining us on today's call. As always, the IR team will be available to answer any additional questions you may have. Cynthia, would you please give the replay information.\nOperator: Certainly. Ladies and gentlemen, today's conference call will be available for replay after 5:30 p.m. today and going until August 14 at 3:55 p.m. You may access the AT&T teleconference replay system by dialing 866-207-1041 and entering the access code of 7269937.

            "content": "Okay. Thanks Darcy. And welcome, everyone to American Electric Power's second quarter 2020 earnings call. While, we continue to see the effects of COVID-19 pandemic, AEP has responded well with not only ensuring the safety of our employees and redefining the business processes to accommodate the changed environment and reducing our costs in response to lower revenues, but we also are responding to hurricane and storm activity to ensure the safe and reliable service to our customers. Our team at AEP Texas with support from internal and external resources performed well through Hurricane Hanna to restore power to over 200,000 customers during that recent weather event. And we're now supporting recovery efforts in the Northeast as well. While COVID cases were escalated in some areas, we continue to engage our employees on safe practices to prevent the virus spread both at work and outside of work to set an example in our communities. On the financial front our operating earnings performance has been strong in the face of these challenges. AEP's operating earnings came in for the quarter at $1.08 per share, bringing our year-to-date operating earnings to $2.10 per share versus $1 share for second quarter 2019 and $2.19 per share year-to-date 2019. We are reaffirming our originally stated guidance range of $4.25 to $4.45 per share and our 5% to 7% long-term growth rate. AEP is also adjusting our capital upward during the five-year capital forecast period from $33 billion to $35 billion to accommodate the North Central wind project addition. Also as we stated in the last quarter earnings call, we have continued to evaluate the short-term deferral of $500 million in our 2020 capital program that we talked about last quarter and we are placing $100 million back into the 2020 plan at this point. So all-in-all a constructive quarter given the headwinds of the economy due to COVID. In fact we continue to make progress toward our target of achieving at least the midpoint of the guidance range. As far as load is concerned, we continue to see the arbitrage between residential load and negative industrial and commercial load during the quarter. As we continue to look for leading indicators as to the health of the state economies, we have been pleased to see the new customer connections remain stable and some jurisdictions increasing from 2019 levels. Looking forward, we expect to see a continued shift to a certain degree from residential load back to commercial and industrial, albeit these shifts will be dependent upon the nature of the pandemic recovery. During the COVID-19 crisis, we continue to take all appropriate measures to ensure the safety of our employees both in the field and for those who can work-from-home. Temperature, testing masking requirements, social distancing and hygiene have become the normal course of business in this environment. While our offices are open to employee meetings and certain other activities, we are still asking our employees who can work-from-home to remain home, most likely through the end of the year. This has not slowed the progress, however, toward redefining our business processes going forward. Our Achieving Excellence Program is now back in full swing with the added dimension of work-for-home learnings that will enable us to define even more efficiencies than previously considered. We also late last year, completed an initial analysis of what a 21st century technology framework would look like, and with the addition of Therace Risch former JCPenney EVP, Chief Information Officer to our team. She has by the way hit the ground running. I'm confident the nexus of her efforts around IT and other technologies married with achieving excellence, COVID learnings, and other strategic initiatives will enable us to further define operating efficiencies that will benefit our customers and shareholders. We are on track for the $100 million of cost reductions for this year as we adjust to expectations regarding revenues due to COVID-19 and the first quarter weather deficiencies that we had. And after reviewing our July weather, we have partially made up for the weather issue that we talked about during the first quarter. So we are making progress within the guidance range expectations and we are now targeting the midpoint of our guidance. As we move closer to 2021 and the addition of North Central wind, we will still be disappointed not to be in the upper half of our 5% to 7% long-term growth rate. I would like to spend a little time taking -- talking about steps we are taking to internally consider the effects of the recent and ongoing discussions about race in America. AEP is not only engaged externally with various local and national organizations, but we were also open to very frank and open dialogue internally. We call it our cease-the-moment action plan. This plan includes engagement with our leaders and employees in the organization through internal discussions, external speakers, webcasts including myself now to be posted internally and process changes that will continue to make AEP a strong committed company that enables all of our employees to contribute in an open and transparent fashion. We have a great culture at this company, but we can always do better by understanding the impacts of stereotypes different perspectives based upon life experiences, the burden placed on employees of color in our organization and what systemic racism versus individual racism act actually means. I believe the dialogue will enable a much deeper discussion that will benefit our diversity and inclusion efforts as well as enable AEP to be a better partner to our communities, as we effectuate lasting change. We can't talk about these cultural attributes without also realizing what our brand projects externally. And that brings me to the second issue that we at AEP certainly believe affects our brand. That would be the issue surrounding Ohio House Bill six legislation. Let me start by saying that we are not aware of any information suggesting that AEP's participation in the process was anything other than lawful and ethical. We have a robust code of ethics and regularly communicate our expectations to our employees that they conduct all business including advocacy on public policy issues with integrity, honesty and in compliance with the law. We consistently advocate for policy positions that benefit our customer's, communities and shareholders and our advocacy of HB6 was no different. We ultimately supported the legislation because we believe it maintained important fuel diversity for Ohio including support for investments in renewables, nuclear generation and two coal plants operated by OVEC. We were surprised and disappointed to learn of what federal investigators alleged was a scheme by the speaker of the Ohio House and others to enrich themselves. And we along with you have been trying to educate ourselves about the criminal complaint and the underlying conduct in it. There has been a lot of speculation and media reports about the identity of various unnamed companies described in the affidavit in support of the complaint. Based on the facts that we know, we do not believe that AEP is any of the companies specifically described in the affidavit. We have not been contacted by any authorities conducting the investigation. If at any point we are, we will cooperate fully. I would also like to discuss 501(c)(4) organizations more generally. AEP has contributed to a variety of 501(c)(4) social welfare organizations to promote economic development and educational programs across our service territories. One such organization is Empowering Ohio's Economy, which was organized to promote economic and business development in Ohio. Starting in 2015, AEP contributed a total of $8.7 million to Empowering Ohio's Economy for review of publicly available tax forms filed by Empowering Ohio's Economy shows that it made a number of grants over time to a wide variety of charitable organizations under 501(c)(3) and social welfare organizations under 501(c)(4). Our contributions to Empowering Ohio's Economy to support its mission were appropriate and lawful. Given the ongoing legal proceedings surrounding HB6 that we are still learning about and that we are unaware of any allegations of wrongdoing involving AEP, I'm going to let those proceedings play out rather than commenting further on this subject. We also understand the concerns that some have expressed regarding the lack of transparency surrounding 501(c)(4) organizations which are not required to disclose their donors and amounts donated to them. With that in mind, we will commit to include additional disclosures in our corporate accountability report with respect to contributions that we made to 501(c)(4) organizations in 2020 and going forward. We also are reviewing best practices and working to improve our policies and processes around political contributions and contributions to 501(c)(4) entities. Regarding any repeal and replacement of HB6, we are fully prepared as we have done previously to engage in whatever dialogue needs to occur to chart a path in Ohio toward a balanced energy portfolio that moves toward a clean energy future for Ohio. AEP has been very clear since the beginning of a nuclear debate that we were concerned about forging a path toward the adoption of renewables, such as solar and wind along with other technologies, such as storage to mobile technologies, the big data analytics to enable a smarter and more efficient grid. HB6 has some of that, but we were also following HB247 to move Ohio forward from a clean energy technology perspective. If HB6 is repealed in a way that appropriately reverses its effects, the financial impact is minimal to AEP. We already had several years of recovery for the OVEC units HB6 elongated that. We will continue to recover our energy efficiency contracts entered into before the legislation. AEP Ohio is already decoupled in many respects. And we will continue to pursue bilateral solar and wind projects with customers. As we have said since day one, if our customers are expected to help put the bill for nuclear, they should also have the opportunity to take full benefit of renewables and movement to a clean energy economy and be able to access technologies that will help them to lower their electric bills. Unrelated to HB6, but an item that should not be lost in the Ohio legislature is continued interest in promoting greater broadband access particularly in rural Ohio. This is an area that we are well positioned to help stimulate by providing middle-mile services to ISPs to advance the service for those communities. We are optimistic that the broadband legislation that passed the House with broad support continues forward as the pandemic has shown the digital divide is real and getting more pronounced and the need for broadband access for our customers particularly rural customers is desperately needed and we can leverage into our communication system to make broadband access a reality. We have already begun pilots in Virginia and West Virginia. And certainly with our large amounts of -- need for large amounts of data from the grid for monitoring and analysis purposes tangentially providing mid-mile broadband accessibility is clearly a benefit to our communities. On the regulatory front our base rate case in Ohio was filed earlier this year where we're seeking a net revenue increase of $41 million a 10.15% ROE and continuation of our DOE and Enhanced Service Reliability Rider. We expect a procedural schedule to be set next month. In Kentucky, we filed our base rate case in July which should conclude by year-end. We have sought $65 million with a 10% ROE as well as AMI deployment within the state. We sought to be creative in our use of ADFIT funds to help lessen the rate impacts to customers in the state. I am pleased to report that the Texas Commission approved the AEP Texas DCRF settlement agreement increasing revenue requirement by approximately $39 million which reflects the $440 million of distribution investment placed in service in 2019. Throughout our territory new customer interconnects continue to be strong in much of our service territory in several areas exceeding what we have seen in recent years. While the virus continues to challenge this nation this provides hope in American commitment and ingenuity will continue to help fuel our recovery. Lastly we are extremely pleased to have now received all necessary regulatory approvals to move the full North Central wind investment forward for the benefit of our customers. Although the disappointing PUCT denial of our application results in the project benefits not extending to our Texas customers, we received approvals from the Arkansas Public Service Commission and the Louisiana Public Service Commission in May for their portion and the flex-up option. Approval of flex-up option was designed to enable the full value of the project to go forward even if the state elected not to take advantage of the opportunity. We are pleased that the Arkansas Public Service Commission and the Louisiana Public Service Commission along with the Oklahoma Corporation Commission have recognized the value of these projects. And we look forward to delivering this value to Arkansas, Louisiana and Oklahoma customers. With regards to the project schedule due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we expect a minimal delay in the completion of the 199-megawatt Sundance Project and expect the project to be delivered in the first quarter of 2021 instead of December 2020. The other two projects are currently expected to be delivered by the developer by the end of '21 -- 2021. We are pleased to report in May the RAS provided an extra year to the 4-year continuity safe harbor related to production tax credit eligibility. So we have an additional year of flexibility should there be any delays to deliver these projects and achieve full value for our customers. Now looking at the equalizer graph on Page five of the presentation, our overall regulated operations ROE is currently 9.1%. We like to target a range overall of 9.5% to 10%. So I'll go into some other things around weather and the other things that have come into play. AEP Ohio, the ROE for AEP Ohio at the end of the second quarter was 11.1%. Their ROE was above authorized due to favorable regulatory items and a transmission true-up partially offset by the roll-off of legacy fuel and capacity carrying charge recoveries. We expect the year-end ROE to trend around authorized levels of 10% as we maintain concurrent capital recovery of distribution and transmission investment. In June 2020 as I said earlier, we filed a rate case in Ohio. As far as APCo is concerned the end of the second quarter was 9.3% ROE. That ROE was below authorized due to lower normalized usage and higher depreciation from increased capital investments. Virginia's first tri-annual review was filed in March 2020 and covers the 2017 to 2019 periods and that case is currently ongoing. At Kentucky Power the ROE is down to 5.7%. It was below authorized due to loss of load from weak economic conditions and loss of major customers along with higher expenses. Transmission revenues were also lowered due to the delay of some capital projects. In June 2020 Kentucky Power filed a new base rate case seeking a $65 million revenue increase and an ROE of 10%. I&M came in at 10.6% for the quarter. The ROE was above authorized due to continued management of O&M expenses reduced interest expense and rate true-ups partially offset by lower normalized usage. I&M's ROE is projected to trend towards 10% at year-end consistent with authorized ROEs. PSO came in at 9.4% for the quarter. Their ROE is right in line with the authorized level due to management of O&M expenses offset by lower normalization usage. PSO's 2019 base case approved a transmission tracker, a partial distribution tracker, and an ROE of 9.4%. So, everything is going well there. SWEPCO came in at 8.3%. And again it's below authorized due to loss of load and the continued impact of the Arkansas share of the Turk Plant which accounts for about 110 basis points. SWEPCO received an order in its Arkansas-based settlement in December 2019, that's effective in January 2020 approving a $24 million increase and an ROE of 9.45%. AEP Texas came in the quarter at 7.4%, their ROE was below authorized due to lag associated with the timing. We've discussed this earlier last quarter of the annual cost recovery filings and one-time adjustments from our recently finalized base rate case. Favorable regulatory treatment allows AEP Texas to file annual DCRF and biannual TCOS filings to recover costs on significant capital investments. So, while earnings should improve in 2020 with the base rate case finalized the annual filings now resumed continued levels of investment in Texas will continue to impact the ROE as well. AEP Transmission came in at 9.8%. It was below authorized primarily driven by the annual revenue true-up in the second quarter of 2020 and to return the over-collection of 2019 revenues. Transmission is forecasting an ROE of in the range of 9.9% to 10.3% for 2020. So, that should continue on as the year goes forward. As I've mentioned in the past, our organization has undertaken a comprehensive view of our O&M and capital spending efficiency under a program that we coined Achieving Excellence. I'm excited about this opportunity for our employees because it goes to the heart of how we do work, removing past barriers that may have existed, and looking at our processes through a different lens. We are now moving into the implementation phase of this initiative with opportunities for increased O&M savings and increased efficiencies in our capital spending being implemented over the next three years and beyond. This work will serve as the platform and help to integrate other initiatives around organizational design, digitization, end-to-end process efficiency, and work-from-home initiatives. The program will also be a precursor to our annual budgeting process in the future. We will share more information about these initiatives and the expected O&M savings later this year, but we have recently jump-started this initiative by offering an early retirement incentive program for a targeted set of our employees. The program has recently closed and I'm pleased to say that we have reached our goals of this initiative where about 200 of our employees have selected to take this incentive to retire. I'm thankful to those who will be leaving the company soon for many reasons. One, for their years of service and dedication to AEP and for providing the company an opportunity to take advantage of organizational design changes upon their exit. I'll be providing more detail when we wrap up all these initiatives later this fall. Before I turn this over to Brian, particularly, with the headwinds we all face today, I'd like to paraphrase some of the lyrics from the song Lost in the Echo by the rock group Linkin Park that I think represents AEP today. Now, it may take a little time for you to figure out what I'm saying here. But nevertheless the lyrics say; we don't hold back we hold our own, we can't be mapped we can't be cloned, we can't C-flat, it ain't our tone. What you get from AEP is our consistent focus on being a positive tone attitude and performance that will help our communities and customers get through this pandemic and the culture issues that's scarring our society. We will continue to be uniquely qualified to bring stakeholders together to move toward a clean energy future for our customers and again provide the quality dividends and earnings that our shareholders expect. Brian, I'll turn it over to you. Good morning, Jeremy. Good morning. Yes. So I mean we look at -- and as Brian mentioned on the COVID activity and the load activity, you're seeing residential load be pretty strong. And certainly as you look forward I think residential load is going to continue to look strong with the work-from-home environment and the business cases that are developed afterwards. And then if you have Commercial and Industrial pickup as well, it could be positive from a financial standpoint. The other regarding North Central and other wind projects and solar projects, we have a real opportunity to transition to that clean energy economy going forward in our service territory and that will really makes us \u2013 again, we would be disappointed not to be in the upper part -- upper half of the 5% to 7% range because you have to be bullish about not only where load is going, but also in terms of the transformation from a -- just a pure and simple energy policy perspective regardless of who's in the White House in the next election, we'll continue moving toward a clean energy economy. And then also I think, bolstered by the other opportunities we have whether it's mid-range broadband or other types of activities electric vehicles and so forth that we're going to see the further electrification of this society. So I'm really bullish about this company in particular, but as well the industry. Thanks, Jeremy. Good morning, Andrew. I think it'd be some of both because obviously with North Central additional equity involved there, but also as you said I mean our dividend will move with our earnings capability. So I'd say both. Brian, do you have any comments? Okay. No, I was just seeing if Brian wanted to just comment on that but he said I covered it. Yes, I think that's a positive story. Some of that is related to new customer connections. And so it was clearly evident that we needed to move that forward. But also we have the capability financially to move it forward. We talked about this last time the deferral of the $500 million we weren't changing the five-year capital plan we were going to maintain that level. And the $500 million was merely being deferred so that we could understand what the COVID issues were going to be. And so we're continually looking at our process going forward in terms of putting that 500 back in in various stages. So what you saw this quarter was the first stage of that. Well, certainly, we looked at North Central, but obviously, we continue to track and we believe that the upper half of that guidance range is certainly achievable and something that we again would be disappointed not to be able to get there. So that's clearly an opportunity for us based on the things that I talked about earlier. Yeah. And keep in mind too at the same time the Achieving Excellence Progam is continuing to grow. So we already have plans in place and you're seeing sort of a crescendo of savings associated with that plan. And the first year 2020 is \u2013 some of it's in there, but not much. And when you look at the future years that continues to grow substantially, and certainly, as I've mentioned earlier the addition of Therace and the focus on digitization automation in combination with the learnings from COVID, I think going to further accentuate the benefits from achieving excellence. Good morning, James. Yep, I'm hearing you yes. Good morning. Yeah, I would say, and as Brian mentioned I mean, there's a lot of learnings from COVID-19 and the impacts and how we've operated, and the efficiency of which we've operated. And I think it sort of changes, the perspective and changes the threshold of even, what one-timers are and ongoing, because I think the learnings we have from here we're going to be much different in our approach related to many of these activities. And actually, you would be surprised and I'll certainly talk about this more at the end of the year of what achieving excellence is showing us of things that were buried in the organization that we obviously have an opportunity to take advantage of. And so there's no question that you should expect the continued efficiency around the savings of O&M. And that's in the non-tracked area. Yes. Bending to warping. So that's good. Yeah. I think number one really, I think about \u2013 the processes are in place and the focus of the organization is in place to be able to adjust. And I'm perfectly happy with the foundation that's been put in place for this organization on an ongoing basis. I mean, because if we look at our Achieving Excellence Program, it's not just a onetime program. It's a regular process we're going to go through in budgeting. And it's also a regular process, where they'll go throughout the year, for us to be able to adjust. So we will do what we have to do. And there's no question, that we have the foundation to be able to do it. Yeah. Thank you. Hey good morning. Yeah. Go ahead. Thanks. Yeah, Sophie. Yeah, sure, we've certainly been consistent in the discussion around any M&A activity or in terms of -- what we can do in terms of rotation. That's always an option that's available to us. And this company is moving toward, a portfolio management approach where obviously we have sources and uses and those sources include the assets we have. And certainly we'll continue to look at those, as opportunities in time with investments that we make. So we will continue to do that. Regarding M&A activity we have a high threshold because we certainly have the ability to invest we have the ability to -- we have the largest transmission system in the country. Certainly our investment in our distribution businesses is continuing to grow considerably. And so, if we can invest that out without a premium, that's a good thing for our shareholders. Now that being said, we look at strategic areas that make sense to us but certainly that threshold is high. And we'll continue to evaluate that. But make no mistake that this company is focused on its ability to continue to grow, but grow efficiently for our shareholders. And we'll continue to do that. Yeah. Thank you. Good morning, Paul. All right, how are you? Well, certainly with the repeal, it's -- how it's replaced is the issue, and obviously how it's repealed. Because there are some things some interconnections that occurred between HB6 and the regulatory process, where we had regulatory recovery for areas that we need to make sure that's a clean transition that occurs. But on its face, the issues that were involved with that for us should be pretty well taken care of. So that's why we're saying it should be a minimal issue for us. I think it's more of an opportunity for us, because if we're able to -- and really if the state focuses on the clean energy economy going forward, that's going to provide us some opportunities to really do this the right way including nuclear for the -- for our customers going forward. Yeah. So, if it's not replaced, then it stays the way it is then we should be fine, because there are already... Okay, okay good. Brian? Yes, we've done bilateral contracts just not with that structure. So... Yeah."

            "name": "Brian Tierney",
            "content": "Thank you, Nick and good morning everyone. I will take us through the second quarter and year-to-date financial results, provide an update on how we were thinking about 2020, including a look at July load, and finish with the review of our balance sheet and liquidity. Let's stop briefly on slide six which shows the comparison of GAAP to operating earnings for the quarter and year-to-date periods. GAAP earnings for the second quarter were $1.05 per share compared to $0.93 per share in 2019. GAAP earnings through June were $2.05 per share compared to $2.10 per share in 2019. There is a reconciliation of GAAP to operating earnings on pages 15 and 16 of the appendix. Let's turn to slide seven and look at the drivers of quarterly operating earnings by segment. Operating earnings for the second quarter were $1.08 per share or $534 million compared to $1 per share or $494 million in 2019. Operating earnings for Vertically Integrated Utilities were $0.55 per share, up $0.17, driven by lower O&M and higher transmission revenue primarily due to true-ups. Normalized retail load was favorable due to higher-margin residential sales more than offsetting significant decreases in industrial and commercial sales. We will talk more -- in more detail about our expectations around normalized load for the year later in the presentation. Other favorable items included weather and rate changes. These positive items were partially offset by higher depreciation and other taxes and lower wholesale load AFUDC and off-system sales. The transmission and distribution utility segment earned $0.29 per share, up $0.02 from last year. Both O&M and transmission revenue were favorable due to the impact of the transmission true-up on this segment. Increased transmission investment in ERCOT was positive as well. Rate changes were also favorable and partially offset by prior-year Texas carrying charges, the roll-off of legacy riders in Ohio, depreciation, lower normalized retail load and higher interest expense. The Transmission Holdco segment contributed $0.19 per share, down $0.12 due to the impacts of the annual true-up and a prior year FERC settlement. Our fundamental return on investment growth continued as net plant increased by $1.5 billion, or 17% since June of last year. Generation & Marketing produced operating earnings of $0.11 per share, up $0.05 from last year. Again on the sale of Conesville and land sales contributed to the increase in generation business and the renewables business grew with the acquisition of multiple renewable assets. These increases along with the timing around income taxes more than offset lower retail margins. Finally, Corporate and Other was down $0.04 per share primarily driven by higher taxes related to consolidating items that were reversed by the year-end and partially offset by lower O&M. Let's turn to slide 8 and review our year-to-date results. Operating earnings through June were $2.10 per share or $1 billion, compared to $2.19 per share or $1.1 billion in 2019. Looking at the drivers by segment. Operating earnings for Vertically Integrated Utilities were $1.05 per share, up $0.04. Earnings in this segment increased due to lower O&M and higher transmission revenue similar to the quarter as well as the impact of rate changes across multiple jurisdictions. Weather was unfavorable, primarily due to warmer than normal winter temperatures. Other decreases included higher depreciation, tax expenses and lower expected wholesale load, AFUDC, normalized retail load and off-system sales. The Transmission & Distribution Utilities segment earned $0.53 per share, down $0.05 from last year, primarily driven by a reversal of a regulatory provision in Ohio. Other smaller drivers, included higher depreciation, the roll-off of legacy riders in Ohio, prior-year Texas carrying charges, higher interest expense and unfavorable weather. These items were partially offset by higher rate changes, the Ohio transmission true-up impact on both O&M and transmission revenue and recovery of increased transmission investment in ERCOT. The AEP Transmission Holdco segment contributed $0.47 per share, down $0.10 from last year for the same reasons identified in the quarterly comparison. Generation & Marketing produced $0.18 per share, up $0.04 from last year. The growth in the renewables business and gains on generation more than offset the lower retail margins and timing around income taxes. Finally, Corporate and Other was down $0.02 per share due to higher interest expense and taxes related to consolidating items that will reverse by the year-end and offset by a prior year income tax adjustment. Partially offsetting these items is lower O&M. Turning to slide 9. Let's review the assumptions we shared during the first quarter earnings call. To reaffirm our 2020 operating earnings guidance range of $4.25 per share to $4.45 per share. As shown on the top line, we revised our retail sales projection from 1.5% growth in 2020 to a 3.4% decline by the end of the year. For the second quarter, our sales growth in total was on target with the revised projections. The mix of sales growth is slightly different than projected, but the date load is closely tracking to the revised forecast. The second item was the impact of weather. While the first quarter weather produced a significant drag, the second quarter weather was slightly favorable. In addition, we experienced warmer than normal weather in July, especially in the East. As a result, we are now assuming less of a negative impact to our 2020 results from weather. The third item was managing our untracked O&M expense. We had originally planned to drive down O&M costs in 2020 to $2.8 billion from $3.1 billion in 2019. During the first quarter call, we shared that in response to the expected decline in sales we now plan to reduce spend by an additional $100 million by aggressively managing O&M. We are on track to hit our projections through both one-time and sustainable reductions. Finally, on the first quarter call, we identified approximately $500 million of capital expenditures that could be shifted out of 2020 and into future years. This was in anticipation of the potential impact of the economic downturn on cash receipts. Through the second quarter, our day's sales outstanding have only marginally increased. We have brought about $100 million of the $500 million back into 2020 and we'll maintain flexibility as we move through the balance of the year. Given the progress made on these key assumptions in the second quarter, we are able to reaffirm our 2020 operating earnings guidance range. There are main items that could positively or negatively impact our projections for the second half of the year, but we are confident in our ability to manage our way through various scenarios. Now let's turn to slide 10 to provide an update on our normalized load for the quarter. Starting in the lower right corner, our second quarter normalized load was down 5.9%. This was consistent with the expectations we shared with you in the first quarter. We anticipated a significant contraction in the second quarter followed by a gradual recovery over the second half of the year. Through June, our normalized sales were down 3.1%. In the upper left quadrant, our normalized residential sales increased by 6.2% in the second quarter. Year-to-date residential sales were up 1.9% compared to last year. We saw significant increases in our residential load during the stay-at-home provisions that were in effect during the quarter. Even after our states began their phased reopenings, we saw strong growth in weather-normalized residential sales across all jurisdictions. This would suggest many of our customers have continued to work from home. We expect the spike in residential growth to moderate as the commercial and industrial sectors improve during the second half of the year. Moving clockwise, our normalized commercial sales decreased by 10.1% in the second quarter bringing the year-to-date decline to 5%. Prior to COVID, we had experienced consistent improvement in our commercial sales over the past year. State and post stay-at-home provisions challenged many of our commercial customers. All of our leading sectors experienced a drop in normalized load in the quarter with the biggest declines coming in schools, churches, restaurants and hotels. Should our states manage without having to shut down businesses again, we expect commercial sales to gradually improve throughout the balance of the year. Finally in the lower left chart, industrial sales decreased by 12.4% in the quarter bringing the year-to-date decline to 6.6%. A number of factors have changed the outlook for this class but the biggest driver is the overall drop in economic activity. The industrial sales \u2013 the industrial sectors that posted the biggest decline for the quarter were transportation, equipment, manufacturing, mining and primary metals. The two sectors that have grown in 2020 were pipeline transportation and petroleum and coal products. Let's take a look at weather-normalized load history and forecast in more detail on Slide 11. The chart on the left shows that for the second quarter actual load very closely tracked our revised forecast. As you can see from the chart, our revised forecast assumed an economic trough in the second quarter that would gradually improve over the course of the year. So far we are on track and we'll keep you updated as we move throughout the year. We wanted the time this call in order to give you the most updated load information through July. The chart on the upper right shows monthly total weather-normalized sales for March through July. Sales for our system were lowest in May and have shown improvement in June and July. Total normalized load for May was down 8.6% versus June, which was down 4.8% versus July, which was down only 2.4%. The monthly macro data for both the business and household surveys show that unemployment rates peaked in April and have improved since. This is consistent with our assumption that the trough is behind us and the economy should continue its gradual improvement through the balance of the year. The bottom right chart shows that for the month of July, the trend that we forecast for the balance of the year is on track. Although there are some differences in load mix to what we have predicted, our overall load is tracking very closely to our revised forecast. Normalized residential sales for July while still very positive at 4.3% were less than for the second quarter. And both commercial and industrial sales show real improvement versus the second quarter as shown on the prior page. Now let's move to Slide 12 and review the company's capitalization and liquidity. Our debt to total capital \u2013 our debt-to-capitalization ratio improved 70 basis points in the second quarter to 61.1%. This was largely attributable to reducing our short-term debt levels in conjunction with fortifying our liquidity position, as we navigated the capital market turbulence in March. In fact, our liquidity position stood strong at $2.9 billion at quarter end. The short-term reduction actions also helped improve our FFO-to-debt ratio when compared to the first quarter moving to 14.1% from 12.5% on a Moody's basis. Our Qualified Pension Funding remained flat at 93% and our OPEB Funding increased approximately 5% to 135%. A falling discount rate increased both plans liabilities during the quarter but strong asset returns especially in equities were able to offset the growth in liabilities. Let's wrap this up on Slide 13 so we can get to your questions. We are reaffirming our existing 2000 operating earnings guidance of $4.25 to $4.45 per share. We are on track to reduce our O&M by the additional $100 million we announced last quarter in response to the economic downturn and revised load implications. Of the $500 million of CapEx that we shifted out of 2020 into later years, we have now returned $100 million into this year. We will maintain our flexibility on this issue as we manage through the balance of the year. We obtained regulatory approvals in Oklahoma, Louisiana, Arkansas and FERC and are moving forward with our $2 billion North Central wind project in Oklahoma, benefiting our customers in PSO and SWEPCO. We have updated our capital plan from 33 \u2013 our five-year capital plan from $33 billion to $35 billion as well as our cash flow and credit metrics which are provided on Page 40 of the appendix. Because of our ability to continue to invest in our own system organically we are reaffirming our stated long-term growth rate of 5% to 7%. With that I will turn the call over to the operator for your questions. It absolutely is still an option. And we're looking at all those options to see how to best finance it. We have plenty of time to make those things happen. Nick said that Sundance might be pushed out to the first quarter of 2021, but we're not going to see the rest of those projects coming in Traverse and Maverick until the end of 2021. So all those things are in play whether it's equity or rotation of capital. But for planning purposes we are guiding people to two-thirds equity for that project in aggregate. It should \u2013 North Central wind should certainly solidify our position in the upper half. Yeah. So we're at this point James not able to provide obviously specific guidance on 2021. But I'll say, the incremental $100 million that we're able to garner is a combination of sustainable and one-timers. And I think it's a matter of managing our way through the downturn in normalized load and just working as hard as we can to pull out all the stops to make sure that we meet our commitments to shareholders and really target the middle part of that range without impacting customers. And so far, we've been able to do that. There have been some unexpected things that we've seen maybe some things that aren't line items in O&M that have come out. And I think you have things like travel and expense conventions that people go to things like that meals just buildings expense that you have things that just don't happen when everyone's working from home that, I think are more like one-timers but if people go back to work we'll start to put those things back into place. But you've seen our track record over the last nine or 10 years now and it's been keeping a very, very tight range on untracked O&M and we're using those skills that we've learned over the last several years to make sure that we're able to manage our way through this circumstance. You've seen \u2013 on page 34 of the presentation, you've seen the tight range we've been able to keep it in. In terms of bending the curve as we go down to $2.7 billion in non-track, we actually are bending that curve downward at this point. It will be the O&M CapEx or the O&M -- I'm sorry O&M caps. It's going to be achieved rateably throughout the balance of the year. So from second quarter, third and fourth, think about it being achieved rateably, as we work our way through that. It's all incorporated to get us to that $2.7 billion number. Sure. Thanks. Good morning, Sophie. So, we'll be fine in that circumstance, Paul. We already had decoupling in place for residential and small commercial customers. We were already getting recovery of OVEC through 2024 through the regulatory process rather than 2030, and it allowed us to enter into bilateral contracts with customers, but we haven't signed any bilaterals to date. So, we think will be absolutely fine, if it's repealed and not replaced. But as Nick said, I think there are opportunities to do it right and replace it with something that's more positive. Paul, we think it would be pretty minimal to us. Thank you."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question and answer session and instructions will be given to you at that time. If you should require assistance during today\u2019s call, please press star then zero and an operator will assist you offline.  I would now like to turn the conference over your first speaker, Ms Darcy Reese. Please go ahead.\nDarcy Reese: Thank you, Perky. Good morning everyone and welcome to the first quarter 2020 earnings call for American Electric Power. Thank you for taking the time today to join us. Our earnings release, presentation slides, and related financial information are available on our website at aep.com. Today we will be making forward-looking statements during the call. There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements. Please refer to our SEC filings for a discussion of these factors.  Our presentation also includes references to non-GAAP financial information. Please refer to the reconciliation of the applicable GAAP measures provided in the appendix of today\u2019s presentation. Joining me this morning for opening remarks are Nick Akins, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Brian Tierney, our Chief Financial Officer. We will take your questions following their remarks. I will now turn the call over to Nick.\nNick Akins: Okay, thank you Darcy. Welcome and thank you all for joining AEP\u2019s first quarter 2020 earnings call. I want to take a moment to extend our sympathies to all those who have been personally impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. At AEP, we understand that we are all in this together.  The AEP Foundation has contributed to charities across our footprint to ensure that we are part of the solution for the customers and communities. In addition to providing our employees with the personal protective equipment they need to do their jobs, we have donated masks, gloves, and other essential items needed by hospitals across our service territory. To further assist those in need within our communities, our customer service representatives have provided assistance in fielding questions on how to secure small business loans.  Throughout these challenging times, I continue to be extremely proud of our employees who have done an outstanding job demonstrating their capacity for being adaptable and exercising the agility needed to meet the challenges of a rapidly changing situation. As we continue to adapt to the ongoing challenges imposed by COVID-19, we remain committed to keeping our employees safe and keeping America powered through these unprecedented times. Certainly as we headed into March during the first quarter, the story for the quarter would have been one in which we have all heard before, mild weather impacted the first quarter, but as we\u2019ve also heard before, a quarter does not a year to make [ph] and there is plenty of time to recover from a mild winter. We adjust to these types of issues all the time.  But I\u2019m sure you\u2019re more interested in the last half of March and what April tells us about the future. I\u2019ll get into all that in a minute, but first let\u2019s just do the headlines, the financial headlines for the quarter. For the first quarter, we came in with operating earnings of $1.02 per share. We are reaffirming our 2020 operating earnings guidance range of $4.25 to $4.45 per share and our 5% to 7% long term growth rate. AEP is doing this because, regardless of whether we forecast a V-shaped, a U-shaped or W-shaped COVID-19 recovery, we see our service territory as an arbitrage between residential load and commercial industrial load that is defined really by a pendulum between the financial characteristics of working from home versus the restart of commercial and industrial businesses. With all of this considered along with capital, O&M, credit metrics and updated load forecasts and actions we have taken, we expect to be the lower half of our guidance range. We are shifting $500 million of capital spending, substantially contracted renewable business and corporate-related capital for the time being to maintain our commitments to solid credit ratings. We are reaffirming our $33 billion of capital over the five-year period, however. We believe this to be the smart play given our ability to adjust capital quickly to respond to market conditions. We give all of this guidance insight given an exhaustive review county by county of our service territory from a load perspective through April, weather impacts thus far in the year, and expense control measures already put in place to respond to present conditions.  We will continue to refine these assumptions as data become available. Certainly weather, customer load mix, pace of economic recovery and continued O&M related actions will dictate further positive progress within the guidance range. Brian will get into more detail about these assumptions, but I want to reaffirm for you that our balance sheet is strong, credit metrics are good, and liquidity is secure as we move forward. Let\u2019s move on to the specifics related to COVID-19 and its implications to our operations and our financials as we see the year progressing. As many have heard, there is famous boxing quote from Iron Mike Tyson that is truly appropriate here: \u201cEveryone has a plan until they get punched in the mouth.\u201d Well, that\u2019s what we have faced in the end of this quarter and will face probably for the rest of the year, but I\u2019m here to tell you, yes, we\u2019ve been challenged a little bit but we are very much still in the match because of our quick responses and agility to be in the position to reaffirm our existing guidance range.  I\u2019ll start by discussing our employees\u2019 commitments to our customers, communities, and our shareholders as we move through the crisis that I referred to at the beginning of my presentation. First, I want to recognize all the healthcare and first responders who have put themselves in the line of fire to help us all to be more safe and healthy. As a critical infrastructure service company, the frontline employees of our utility have also taken on risk by ensuring we are out in the field responding to substantial storm activity to ensure the resiliency and reliability of electric service so that our hospitals, critical businesses, and customers who are under stay-at-home provisions can continue to benefit at least from some degree of comfort in these challenging times. We have instituted protection measures for these employees that reflect CDC guidance regarding physical distancing, including smaller work teams, proper hygiene, and appropriate PPE and testing to minimize risk of contact with the virus.  Approximately 12,000, over 70% of AEP\u2019s employees have been working from home for several weeks now and will continue to work from home even after stay-at-home provisions are lifted to ensure further precautions are taken both at home and at the office for employees who must return for various reasons. We have instituted specific COVID-19 adjustments to our health plans and benefits for employees, and as a critical infrastructure business have continued to pay our employees as they work from home. For most field-level employees, we have also awarded additional days off with pay to enable more time with their families during this time. We have over 82% of our call center employees working from home, and as they not only answer customer questions, they are also helping our small businesses get back on their feet by helping them navigate through the SBA loan provisions of the Cares Act. Regarding our customers, we recognize the hardships that this pandemic has brought on and have temporarily suspended all service disconnects for non-payment, and our team of call center professionals have been working diligently to administer more flexible payment arrangements for our commercial and residential customers. Some states have mandated this, but we do so voluntarily and our state commissions have fully supported these actions through the establishment of deferred accounting and other measures, which I want to take the time to thank them for addressing these issues. Regarding our communities, the AEP Foundation has donated over $3 million to support basic human needs to help address hardships from food security, housing, clothing, and other issues during this time. We have donated over 9,000 N95 masks, 110,000 gloves and disposable surgical masks, and 1,200 face shields from our warehouse stocks and 3D printing facilities within our innovation labs.  In my 37 years of being in this business, I have never seen the level of coordination and concern by multiple agencies to do the right thing for our customers, our employees, our businesses and communities. While much focus on this call is on the financials, it is important to remember the part we play in the broader social fabric as a critical infrastructure business. Our effectiveness is defined by the level of cooperation and support from all of the agencies that we deal with: our state commissions and governors\u2019 offices, federal and state legislators, FERC, NERC, DoE, DHS, NRC and others. They all have answered the call, and we at AEP thank them. There is much work yet to do, but I believe all have embraced the capital-S for social from an ESG investor perspective.  From the operational side, we have had no disruptions to plant or grid operations while storm activity has been exceptional, given the significant storm activity in several of our operating company territories and considering the additional COVID-19 related safety precautions. There has not been a delay in the north central wind facilities construction and the regulatory cases regarding this project have continued on schedule. As well, future rate cases are on track to be filed, including in Ohio and Kentucky. On the regulatory front, it has been a busy quarter. In fact, we have already received approvals for 96% of the budgeted regulatory recovery for 2020. In March, the Indiana Regulatory Commission authorized a $77 million revenue increased based on a 9.7% ROE. The Commission approved IN\u2019s proposed distribution system investments and full tracking of FERC transmission costs. The company had also sought an adjustment to reflect the reallocation of capacity costs associated with termination of certain wholesale contracts which was denied by the Commission. We have filed for re-hearing on this matter. In January, the Michigan Commission approved the settlement of the base rate case resulting in an increase of $36 million based on a 9.86% ROE. In April, the PUCT - Public Utility Commission of Texas issued a final order approving the settlement agreement in the AEP Texas base rate case, allowing for a 9.4% ROE with a 42.5% equity layer on the company\u2019s $5 billion asset base. Also in April, we filed a DCRF - distribution cost recovery factor to add approximately $440 million in assets to the rate base for distribution investments we made to benefit our customers in AEP Texas. A T-cost filing - transmission cost filing was also made to recover $800 million in transmission investments made over a similar time frame. The company also filed a required base rate case in Virginia as part of the state\u2019s annual review. In that filing, the company asked for a 9.9% ROE on a 50/50 cap structure on a $2.5 billion base, resulting in an increase of $64.9 million. Rates would be effective at the end of January 2021.  There is no question that these are unprecedented times. I think it goes without saying that we will need to ensure that utilities and commissions work together to devise creative solutions to the challenges we all face.  Tony Clark, former Commissioners at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission prepared and submitted a white paper to NERUC recognizing the unique challenges the energy industry is facing and the need for regulators to be creative to new solutions. In that article, he called for policymakers at both the federal and state level to be proactive in both the short and long term by targeting measures that support both customers and utilities. Collectively with our legislators and our commissions, we need to work together to recognize the importance of protecting customers and ensuring utilities are able to invest in their systems and maintain the level of service that our communities depend upon, whether through deferrals or preferably riders or forward-looking test years, because cash is king again for utilities to be able to adequately invest in critical infrastructure.  Two examples within our service territory where the Commissions have taken a proactive view have been in Texas and Ohio. We believe both are steps in the right direction. In Texas, the Commission approved the COVID-19 Electricity Relief Program for residential consumers who are having difficulty paying their bills. A rider has been put in place to fund the ERP that enables AEP Texas to access cash to begin the program cost. In Ohio, Commission staff recommended approval of the regulatory asset deferral for future recovery and recovery of the demand ratchet program costs through the existing economic development rider. This will help lessen the impact to industrials who are key employers within the state and protect utilities. We believe both are examples of progressive moves by states to help mitigate the risk associated with COVID-19 to both customers and provide certainty for utilities. Moving on to the North Central project, we continue to make progress on this landmark project that provides significant benefits for our 1.1 million customers in our PSO and SWEPCO states. We received approval of the unanimous settlement in Oklahoma as well as FERC approval in the first quarter. We expected May to be an important month for the project for the remaining jurisdictions, and I\u2019m pleased to report that yesterday the Arkansas Public Service Commission approved the 155 megawatts, or approximately 10% of the total project along with the flex-up option. As you recall, the flex-up option allows Arkansas to increase the megawatt allocation should another SWEPCO state reject the application. The Commission in that order determined that SWEPCO should use it\u2019s formulative rate rider to recover its costs.  In early March, we filed the unanimous settlement in Louisiana for 268 megawatts or approximately 18% of the total project, which also included the flex-up option. We expect a decision by the Louisiana Public Service Commission in the May or June time frame. Lastly, after concluding our hearings in February, we expect a proposal for commission decision for the Texas ALJs in late May. With approvals in Oklahoma, Arkansas and FERC under our belt, the project has what it needs to go forward at 846 megawatts of the 1,485 megawatt project. Of course, the project can move forward with even more savings for customers and the full $2 billion investment opportunity if either the LPSC approves with the flex-up option or the LPSC and the Public Utility Commission of Texas approves their portion of the full project. Now let\u2019s talk to the equalizer chart. Most of these are weather related, but for AEP Ohio we\u2019ve had the roll-off of some of the legacy fuel and capacity carrying charges. They rolled off, so we expect the trend for the ROE to be at the authorized levels of around 10%. Presently, it\u2019s at 9.9% for quarter 2020. In APCO, the ROE for APCO at the end of first quarter is 8.7%, and that\u2019s driven by lower normalized usage and higher depreciation from increased capital investments, and of course unfavorable weather. Virginia\u2019s first triannual review was filed in March 2020, as I mentioned earlier, and it covers the 2017 to 2019 periods. An ROE of 9.42% would be used for the triannual review with 70 basis point bandwidth of 8.72% to 10.12% ROE.  Kentucky Power, the ROE for Kentucky Power at the end of first quarter was 6.7%, and that\u2019s primarily driven by loss of load from weak economic conditions, loss of major customers along with higher expenses and unfavorable weather. We also have been in a stay out provision associated with rate filings, but that goes away here soon and we expect to be filing in Kentucky in the July time frame. I&M, the ROE at I&M is at 10.5%, and we\u2019ve been implementing new rates for Indianan which will take place in the second quarter, but we fully expect to be at the authorized areas of around 9.7% to 9.86%. Then for PSO, PSO is at 9.2% primarily driven by unfavorable weather. SWEPCO at the end of first quarter was 6.2%, and that was because of a loss of load, unfavorable weather, and continued impact of the Arkansas share of the Turk plant, which accounts for about 112 basis points. The Arkansas base case settlement went in place in December 2019 and is effective January 2020, approved a $24 million revenue increase there.  In AEP Texas, it\u2019s at 8% and that\u2019s due to a lag associated with the timing of annual filings and one-time adjustments from our recently finalized base rate case. Favorable regulatory treatment has historically allowed us to file annual DCRF and biannual T-cost filings to recover our cost, and I mentioned those earlier, so there\u2019s a lag associated with those but we should see a pick-up there and drive more toward a 9.4% ROE in the long term. Then the transmission holdco at the end of the first quarter was 11.5% and it was driven by higher revenues due to differences between actual and forecasted revenues, so we fully expect the transmission ROE to be in the mid-10% range in 2020. With that, when there is a pandemic like the one we\u2019re experiencing today that has not occurred in 100 years, and this nation\u2019s economy has been effectively shut down for months, there is no question that everyone is challenged and AEP is no exception. We are up to the challenge to recognize not only the role that this company has in the resiliency and restart of our economy as well as the provision of electric service no matter where our customers are working or living, but also the importance of the consistency and quality of earnings and dividends to our shareholders that makes our work possible. We will strike that balance, respond to challenges, and I\u2019ll stick with a boxing analogy with a Sylvester Stallone movie, Rocky, where the music is playing, the theme from Rocky and he\u2019s running up the steps that represent the adversity of reaching a goal. I believe at the end of the year, we all - AEP, the communities we serve, our customers and our shareholders - will be at the summit, raising our arms in victory.  Brian?\nBrian Tierney: Thank you Nick, and good morning everyone. I will take us through the financial results for the quarter, provide some insight in how we\u2019re thinking about 2020, including an update on April load, and finish with a review of our balance sheet and liquidity. Let\u2019s stop briefly on Slide 7, which shows the comparison of GAAP to operating earnings for the quarter. GAAP earnings were $1.00 per share compared to $1.16 per share in 2019. There is a reconciliation of GAAP to operating earnings in the appendix.  Let\u2019s turn to Slide 8 and look at the drivers of quarterly operating earnings. Operating earnings for the first quarter were $1.02 per share or $504 million, compared to $1.19 per share of $585 million in 2019. Looking at the drivers by segment, operating earnings for vertically integrated utilities were $0.50 per share, down $0.13. Earnings in this segment declined primarily due to warmer than normal winter weather and lower normalized retail load. Other small decreases included higher depreciation, higher tax expense and lower wholesale load, AFUDC, and off-system sales. Favorable drivers included rate changes and higher transmission revenue. The transmission and distribution utilities segment earned $0.24 per share, down $0.08 from last year primarily driven by the 2019 reversal of a regulatory provision in Ohio. Other smaller drivers included higher depreciation, the roll-off of legacy riders in Ohio, and unfavorable weather. These items were partially offset by higher rate changes, normalized retail load, and recovery of increased transmission investment in ERCOT, as well as lower O&M.  The AEP transmission holdco segment continued to grow, contributing $0.28 per share, an improvement of $0.03 over last year. Net plant increased by $1.5 billion or 18% since March of last year.  Generation and marketing produced earnings of $0.07 per share, down $0.02 from last year. The renewables business grew with the acquisition of multiple renewable assets. Increases in retail margins were more than offset by timing around income taxes and lower generation sales due to lower energy prices and plant retirements. Finally, corporate and other was up $0.03 per share primarily driven by lower taxes relating to a prior year income tax adjustment and other consolidating items that were reversed by year end, other variances related to higher interest expense, and lower O&M.  Earlier in the call, Nick indicated that we are reaffirming our 2020 operating earnings guidance range of $4.25 per share to $4.45 per share and would likely be in the lower half of that range. Let me give you some of the detail that leads us to that outcome on Slide 9 and then I\u2019ll provide more detail on each of the key assumptions in the following slides. Our economic forecasting group uses Moody\u2019s analytics as a key input to our models. In April, Moody\u2019s published a county-level forecast that included the projected impact of COVID-19 on our service territory. We used this new data along with updated assumptions from our customer service engineers to come up with revised retail sales projections for the year. We now expect residential sales to increase 3% over 2019 levels largely driven by all of the activity that has taken place in residences rather than in places of work or in the classroom. Conversely, we are anticipating commercial sales contractions of 5.6% and industrial sales declines of 8% over 2019 levels.  Many businesses have shifted their operations to a mostly online platform while other employers have had to make the difficult decision to furlough or reduce employee headcount until market demand is restored. These retail forecasts lead us to expect an overall decline in sales of 3.4%. This updated load would impact our prior forecast negatively by $0.15 per share. We have already discussed our year to date negative impact from mild weather of $0.11 per share. In response to these circumstances, we have taken action to reduce untracked operations and maintenance expenses by an additional $100 million, resulting in a positive expectation of $0.17 per share for the year. The net result of load, weather and O&M reductions would have a negative $0.09 per share impact for the year, leaving us inside but in the lower half of the original operating earnings guidance range. We realize moratoriums on disconnects and the economic impact to our customers may have on our cash receipts. In response to this, we have initiated a shift of $500 million of capital expenditures out of 2020 to be placed into the future years of 2021 to 2024. As we made these deferrals, we were mindful of customer and reliability impacts. In fact, about $200 million of these investments were in our competitive renewables business and about $100 million were corporate investments. The shifts can be ramped up or down going forward in response to how events play out in real time. With this moderate level of capital shifting, we are able to reaffirm our 5% to 7% long term growth rate off of our original 2019 operating earnings guidance range.  Regarding potential increases in bad debt across our jurisdictions, we have already received orders in Texas, Arkansas, Louisiana and Virginia to set up regulatory assets related to COVID-19 costs. Other states where we have filed for recovery of COVID-related deferrals include Ohio, Michigan, Tennessee, and Oklahoma. We have tried on this slide to provide some of the detail for how the coronavirus and oil and gas events will impact AEP\u2019s operating earnings for 2020. Instead of taking you through the details of our scenario planning, let me highlight some of the items that could positively and negatively impact our view as we make our way through the year. On the positive side, a sharp V-shape recovery that is more dramatic than the gradual recovery from the second quarter low point that we have assumed would improve results. Additionally, mitigation of coronavirus infection rates leading the economy to open up sooner than we have assumed would improve results. A greater increase in residential sales and an improvement in commercial and industrial sales would further improve our outlook. We have experienced a mild winter. If that carried forward into a warmer than normal summer, that would have positive earnings implications. Another positive would be if we could garner incremental savings to what we have assumed at the $2.7 billion level of untracked O&M expenses. The items that would create negative impacts to our assumptions are largely the opposite of the positives. A prolonged U-shaped or a dramatic L-shaped recovery would be more negative than our assumptions. Increased coronavirus infection rates could lead to weaker economic conditions for longer periods than we have assumed, potential impairing our outlook for the year. In addition, continued mild weather and/or O&M expenses beyond our control, like for storms, could negatively impact the outlook for 2020.  We have tried our best using data, experience and judgment to update and share our outlook with you for 2020. We have tried not to be unreasonably optimistic nor pessimistic. This outlook allows us to reaffirm our 2020 operating earnings guidance range with a view that we are likely to be in the lower half of the range. Now let\u2019s turn to Slide 10 and provide an update on our system load, focusing on our outlook for the balance of the year. Our first quarter normalized load was down seven-tenths of a percent compared to last year. Our residential and industrial sales were both down for the quarter while commercial sales were essentially flat. Our original guidance for the year assumed half a percent normalized load growth. Clearly a lot has changed since that forecast was developed. Since then, we have taken a fresh look at our forecast and now expect our total load to end the year down 3.4% on a weather normalized basis, with meaningful changes in customer mix and related margins. For 2020, we anticipate a significant contraction in the second quarter followed by a gradual recovery over the balance of the year. In the upper left quadrant, we raised our residential outlook for 2020 to 3%. We are seeing significant increases in our residential load during the stay-at-home period. Even after our states begin to reopen their economies in the second quarter, it is our expectation that many employees will continue to work from home. Having said this, we expect the strongest residential growth in the second quarter with some tapering off during the second half of the year. Moving clockwise, our commercial sales outlook is now assuming a 5.6% decline from 2019 levels. Prior to the COVID outbreak, we experienced consistent improvement in our commercial sales class over the past year; however, once the stay-at-home provisions were in place, we experienced significant declines in our sales to traditional retail stores, hotels, restaurants, churches and schools. However, not all commercial load was negatively impacted by the outbreak. Sales to hospitals and government support offices were up substantially in the first quarter. When you consider the challenges many businesses will face trying to introduce social distancing protocols into their normal operations, we are projecting a difficult second quarter for commercial sales with modest improvement through the remainder of the year. Finally, in the lower left chart the outlook for industrial sales has changed significantly. We now expect 2020 industrial sales to come in 8% below 2019 levels. A number of factors have changed the outlook for this class, but the biggest driver is the overall drop in economic activity. Over the past several weeks, we have learned a number of large industrial customers that were either idling their production or reducing their output temporarily until market conditions improve. In addition, a number of expansions we had previously assumed to come online later this year have been delayed or postponed. These delays should be reversed as the economy gradually recovers. Since nearly 30% of our industrial sales come from the oil and gas sectors, let me explain recent sales trends in this sector. Surprisingly, sales to the oil and gas sectors in the first quarter increased by 9.7%, which was the strongest quarter we\u2019ve experienced since 2016. Most of that growth came from the pipeline transportation sector which was up 28% for the first quarter. Going forward, we expect some reduction in oil and gas extraction that will be offset by growth in the midstream and downstream operations. We don\u2019t normally report on monthly load numbers, but since we had the data, let\u2019s take a look at April load on Slide 11. Total normalized retail load for April was down 4.3% with the relationship between the retail classes being similar to what we assumed for the balance of the year. Not surprising given the number of people relegated to their homes, normalized residential sales were up 6% for the month. Equally not surprising, normalized commercial sales were down 7.7% for the month, with the biggest declines being in schools, churches, restaurants and hotels. Industrial sales were down 10% for the month. The biggest decline was in sectors that support the automotive industry, while we experienced strong sales growth in pipeline transportation and food manufacturing sectors.  Looking at April\u2019s results, the relationship between the classes, also know as sales mix, as well as the levels of sales in each class are consistent with the assumptions we have made for the second quarter of our balance of year assumptions. Moving on to Slide 12, let\u2019s discuss some load sensitivities and highlight some of our rate recovery mechanisms. The three pie charts show that by segment and in total, about half of our non-fuel revenues come from the residential class. Applying the 3% growth we are now projecting for residential sales in total to the sensitivities we provided at last year\u2019s EEI financial conference, we would pick up $0.12 a share from higher residential sales. Repeating the same calculations for the projected load loss in the commercial and industrial classes would produce a drag of approximately $0.11 and $0.16 per share respectively. When you add these three impacts together, you get the $0.15 per share impact we identified on Slide 9. Finally, retail rate design has a couple of features that stabilize our revenues during an economic downturn. First, most of our large industrial tariffs include demand provisions designed to cover the fixed portion of utility costs. These provisions remain in place even when volumes are down. Second, in our residential customer class we have had some success over the years better aligning the fixed portion of customer rates with fixed costs. Together these rate considerations provide a stabilizing effect on our revenues even when sales volumes decline. Turning to Slide 13, another key assumption is the weather. As mentioned earlier, weather in the first quarter was extremely mild. The green bar in the first quarter shows that mild weather cost us $71 million compared to normal, which was $65 million worse than the first quarter of last year. While our outlook assumes normal weather for the remainder of the year, this chart shows that weather can change significantly, as evidenced by last year\u2019s experience. If we were to have another warm summer like we did in 2019, it could offset the $0.11 drag for weather in the first quarter that we showed you on Slide 9. Our management team has a proven track record of adapting our plans to changing conditions as necessary. In years when the weather has provided a tailwind, we have accelerated spending to provide stability to our earnings in line with our 5% to 7% growth targets. In years where weather has been less accommodating, we have been able to shift our spending to future years to achieve the same goal. You can expect this management team will react similarly this year. Turning to Slide 14, you can see that for nine years now, we have maintained O&M discipline and kept spending net of offsets in a tight range of between $2.8 billion and $3.1 billion. We had originally planned to drive down O&M costs in 2020 to $2.8 billion. In response to the expected decline in sales, we now plan to reduce O&M spend by an additional $100 million. Plans like the Achieving Excellence program and additional one-time and extraordinary reductions will help us to achieve those reductions. Now let\u2019s move on to Slide15 and review the company\u2019s capitalization and liquidity. Our debt to total capital ratio increased during the quarter from 59.8% to 61.8%. The increase in the debt component is attributable to financings to support our ongoing investment program and to fortify our liquidity position to ensure smooth operational financing during this period of market volatility. As you would expect, the increase in debt combined with the ongoing pressure associated with the flow back of ADIT resulted in pressure on our FFO to debt metric, which at quarter end stood at 12.5% on a Moody\u2019s basis.  The decline in the metric is also temporarily influenced by the $1 billion 364-day term loan the company proactively obtained in late March. Despite the temporary decline in this metric, rating agencies view this enhanced liquidity as credit positive. Adjusting for this facility and associated cash balances, the metric would be 13%. Our liquidity at the end of the quarter remained strong at $2.8 billion. Since then, our commercial paper balances have dropped to $1.6 billion and our liquidity position has increased to $3.1 billion.  Our qualified pension funding increased approximately 4% to 93%, and our OPEB funding decreased approximately 15% to 130%. Pension and OPEB equity returns were negative 23% and negative 22% respectively for the quarter and were the primary reasons pensions and OPEB funding decreased. Fixed income returns of approximately 7% and 6% in the pension and OPEB respectively served to offset some of the equity losses. We have worked hard over the years to focus on pension and OPEB funding and are pleased with how the asset portfolios have performed in spite of recent market volatility. Let\u2019s wrap this up on Slide 16 so we can quickly get to your questions. In response to the economic downturn and related implications, AEP has responded to quickly reduce our O&M spending by an additional $100 million for 2020. This action combined with our updated load forecast allows us to reaffirm our existing operating earnings guidance of 2020 from $4.25 to $4.45 per share. In addition, in response to uncertainties about cash flows related to reduced customer demand and potential delays in customer receipts, we are shifting about $500 million in capital expenditures out of 2020 and into the period 2021 to 2024. We can adjust the timing and size of this shift in reaction to how events play out relative to our assumptions. Because of our ability to continue to invest in our own system organically, we are confident in our ability to grow the company at our stated long term growth rate of 5% to 7%. We continue to make progress on obtaining approvals for our $2 billion North Central wind project in Oklahoma and plan to proceed when approvals are obtained. With that, I will turn the call over to the operator for your questions.\nOperator: [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Steve Byrd with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nSteve Byrd: Hi, good morning. Hope you all are doing well. \nNick Akins: Morning Steve.\nSteve Byrd: Thanks for the update on a lot of topics. Wanted to talk first just about two of your rate cases, Indiana and Michigan, where I believe the test year is going to be a 2020 test year. How do you think about that sort of test year in light of COVID - you know, load adjustments, COVID-related expenses as you think through that rate case, and sort of how to approach 2020 given it\u2019s such an unusual year?\nNick Akins: In at least Indiana, we have forward test year views, and I think it\u2019s probably going to be particularly important as we go in for these cases for there to be an understanding that we are dealing with a COVID-related year if it is a test year. Wherever you have forward test years, though, you can account for that going forward in the rate making, but we\u2019d be tuned into the process whether you pro forma in or do other things. I think there\u2019s probably at least opportunities for discussion about that because COVID--you know, 2020 is going to be an usual year and to be used for test years would be particularly challenging. You have to really go to some form of pro forma view that has the level of investments, the level of business activity that you would normally see. So, I would expect our commissions to be reasonable in that approach. \nBrian Tierney: You know, in both those cases, Steve, we had forward-looking test years and we do have orders effective in both of those jurisdictions.\nSteve Byrd: Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Yes, it makes sense that you\u2019d sort of try to work to the adjustments. It makes sense.  On North Central wind, some great progress there. That\u2019s really encouraging. I guess I had sort of two related questions on North Central. If you do get those additional approvals that you\u2019re waiting for, such as in Louisiana, Texas, can you quickly flex the plan to go to the higher megawatt level? Then relatedly, you\u2019ve obviously deferred some capex. Do you have that flexibility to deploy whatever capital you need to, to make this a bigger project, or does your capital position caution against significant ramp-up in capex this year? Just thinking through the growth at North Central.\nNick Akins: Yes, so originally North Central was not in our capital plan, and so when we get approval for that, that\u2019d be dealing with a different financing model associated with that. As far as the megawatt level and the amount of investment, yes, if we get approval for Louisiana for example, and Louisiana also approves the up rate which is in a settlement arrangement, then we would have the full $2 billion investment opportunity there. We already know we\u2019re going forward with the project - that was the importance of Arkansas approval, so the project is moving forward. The question is what size, and then when Louisiana approves that, and hopefully with a flex-up as well, then that\u2019s the full $2 billion, or if Texas takes their portion, then all operating jurisdictions will be taking their particular portions as we go forward. Now, there is additional opportunity for renewables in those areas. The integrated resource plans have the capability for that, but we felt like, as we originally said about this project, there is sort of a break point between the opportunities that existed around the wind farm project and the pricing, and we wanted to make absolutely sure that the pricing was very effective and produced very positive savings for our customers. So, we can always go out for a bid again to fill the rest of that from a resource planning perspective. \nBrian Tierney: Steve, we\u2019ll be full speed ahead on the capex associated with North Central wind one way or the other. Nick mentioned that it\u2019s not in the $33 billion that we had previously identified for the five years, 2020 to 2024, and we previously said that we anticipate an equity component of that investment to be between 50% and 66%. \nSteve Byrd: That\u2019s super helpful. I\u2019ll let others ask questions. Thank you. \nNick Akins: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Durgesh Chopra with Evercore. Please go ahead.\nDurgesh Chopra: Hey, good morning guys. Thanks for taking my question. I have two. The first one on 2020 guidance range here, the $0.15 EPS hit, what are you assuming in terms of decline trends for the rest of the year? I guess what I\u2019m asking is are you--as you make some amount of recovery in Q3 or Q4, just curious as to what you\u2019re assuming in terms of profiling for the rest of the year.\nBrian Tierney: Sure, so we are assuming that the second quarter would be the lowest quarter for load, and that there would be a gradual recovery over the balance of 2020 and into the first quarter of 2021.\nDurgesh Chopra: Got it, perfect. Then, can you comment on just your--you know, assuming that you hit your lower half of the EPS guidance range for this year, where would that put you in terms of credit metrics [indiscernible] debt versus your targeted metrics? Then any color that you can provide us with your recent conversations that you have had with Moody\u2019s on some of the changes that you\u2019ve made to your plan?\nBrian Tierney: We\u2019ve really been--we anticipate year end being FFO to debt in that 13% to 14% range. We\u2019ve communicated that with S&P and Moody\u2019s, had dialogues with them as late as yesterday. They understand where we are and what we\u2019re doing. I think they were encouraged to see us flex a little bit our capex for the balance of the year in response to anticipated lower cash flows than what we had anticipated, and they\u2019re supportive of that. They were--they viewed what Julie and her team did around the term loan facility as being credit positive, and they are fully aware and apprised of what we\u2019re doing. You should ask them, but I think their answer would be supportive.\nDurgesh Chopra: Great, that\u2019s all I had, guys. Thank you very much.\nNick Akins: Thank you, Durgesh.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nJulien Dumoulin: Hey, good morning team. I hope you\u2019re all well. Perhaps just to pick up where the last question left off to start here. On guidance and the 2020 lower half, how do you think about the reduction in capex? I just want to reconcile this. It seems as if you\u2019re not really changing FFO to debt expectations as you are bringing down capex altogether, but why do that relative to no change in earnings? Can you walk through the thought process there?  Then also, it seems as if it doesn\u2019t necessarily have too much of an earnings impact given the corporate nature of some of the capex, so I just want to make sure we\u2019re thinking about that correctly as well.\nBrian Tierney: Sure Julien, thanks for the question. We are anticipating there to be some reduction in cash flow this year associated with two things: one, lower customer demand, and then two, we have eliminated disconnects currently, and so we think that customers will pay us slower than what they have in the past. We\u2019re not seeing the impact of that in a significant way yet - it\u2019s too early, but in anticipation of lower cash flows to maintain those FFO to debt metrics, we felt it was prudent to at least engage the motor on our ability to scale back capex.  In regards to the no impact on future earnings, we tried to do it in places that have either lower regulatory lag or the increase in earnings isn\u2019t as great. Nick mentioned that some of that reduction is in the competitive renewables space and some of that reduction is also at corporate capital, things like IT and things like that, that are much slower to flow into customer rates during rate cases. Things that we are careful not to cut were things like transmission, where we\u2019re spending on customer resilience and reliability and we have those formula-based rates to update and get that capex into rates on a fairly efficient basis. We were really thoughtful about how we cut that or shifted that small amount of capex, and made sure that it wasn\u2019t impacting earnings.\nNick Akins: Julien, I think you\u2019re reading it right, though - we\u2019re being as transparent as we possibly can be through this process using the latest information. Matter of fact, we got the load information, April load information yesterday, so we\u2019re trying to be as transparent as possible, but also taking the right, smart, appropriate steps to ensure that we\u2019re able to be agile enough to do what we need to do. I think you\u2019re reading that right.  We obviously would put that capital back in as quickly as possible and then, as Brian mentioned, we\u2019re not only mitigating any impacts to the earnings capability but also thinking ahead in terms of where we deploy that capital in the future. Then we also have North Central coming about, so those things are occurring. We\u2019re trying to manage through this year in a very positive fashion and really a defensive posture, and then set ourselves up for the future years, in \u201921 and beyond.  We\u2019ll continue that approach, and obviously if we get a hot summer, for example, we\u2019ll throw capital back in - there\u2019s all kinds of things we can adjust, and then from a residential standpoint, you heard our residential load for April was 6%, and we\u2019re saying 3%, so we don\u2019t know exactly how this is going to play out, particularly with changing dynamics of business cases themselves changing. I mean, we had Nationwide recently come out and say that their people are going to be working from home, and we have 17,000 employees and 12,000 are working from home. We may be looking through our Achieving Excellence program, which we have already accelerated, to look at how you look at people working from home and maybe the whole business cases changes from that perspective and also reduces O&M further.  So we\u2019re in the process of doing all that, but we\u2019re just trying to be as transparent as possible. But you\u2019re reading the tea leaves right.\nJulien Dumoulin: Got it, excellent. Let me just clarify this from the transcript - you all reaffirmed intentions to file rate cases in various geographies. This doesn\u2019t shift timing necessarily, it sounds like, nor--at the same time, I don\u2019t want to tie one to the other, does it shift any expectations with respect to asset sales, disposals, strategic reviews? Just want to make sure we\u2019re on the same page there, and there could be some further capital needs.\nNick Akins: No, it doesn\u2019t change. As a matter of fact, we\u2019ll continue those cases. Obviously, as I mentioned, in Kentucky we have a stay out provision. We need to file a case, and we\u2019ll do that when that stay out provision is lifted, and then that would be effective January 1 of 2021. Then for Ohio, obviously we\u2019re due to file a case there as well. It\u2019s a pretty moderate case, but nevertheless.  As far as we can tell, everything is going exactly like we had planned. Now, you may see some procedural schedules change, but the end result and the end dates aren\u2019t changing, so that\u2019s where we\u2019re at today.\nJulien Dumoulin: Great, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nNick Akins: Morning Michael.\nMichael Lapides: She did a better job pronouncing my last name than most people do. \nNick Akins: I have the same problem.\nMichael Lapides: I had a handful of questions. One, I\u2019m going to be a little more specific on capex, so $500 million cut, $200 million is at the non-regulated renewable--\nNick Akins: Michael, $500 million shifted. \nMichael Lapides: Shifted - my bad. \nNick Akins: We\u2019re sensitive about that!\nMichael Lapides: Five hundred shifted, 200 is at the non-regulated renewable, 100 is at corporate. What\u2019s the other 200?\nBrian Tierney: There\u2019s another $75 million to $100 million that is in our distribution at our opcos, and then the other $100 million is spread across our organizations but not in the transmission side of the business. \nMichael Lapides: Got it, okay. That\u2019s fine.  The other question is, is there any scenario where you could delay, given all that\u2019s going on in the world, all the uncertainty about demand, about the impact of disconnects, is there any regulatory scenario where you could actually postpone or push out the AEP Ohio rate case?\nNick Akins: No, we don\u2019t see that happening because obviously we\u2019re required to file a case, and actually it\u2019s a pretty moderate case, so I think that there really isn\u2019t any reason to delay it at this point.\nBrian Tierney: Michael, I think Nick\u2019s answer earlier was there could be a delay in the procedural schedule. We would still expect to get the result of the case when we originally had.\nNick Akins: Yes.\nMichael Lapides: Got it. Then final question--\nNick Akins: And everybody knows about it as well, so it won\u2019t be a surprise to anybody. There\u2019s a pretty negligible impact on customers too in that case.\nMichael Lapides: Yes, that makes a ton of sense. Then last question, you all have done a great job in managing down O&M for the last four years, and you\u2019ve taken a lot of O&M out of the company. It saves the customers money, it\u2019s good for shareholders. At what point do you think the long term rate of change in O&M management starts to flatten out, meaning the curve, the ability to keep taking out more or become more efficient just starts to flatten out, the pace of change slows.\nNick Akins: You know, we\u2019ve had a lot of conversations about that, but every day you\u2019re surprised by some new innovation or something that can change the trajectory of O&M expense. We spend $4 billion a year, I think $2.8 billion is not tracked, and when you look at some of the opportunities that are available, and actually I think if there is a silver lining in the coronavirus pandemic, it is that we can really re-evaluate what it means to get our business done, because we\u2019ve been very effective at the people working from home and actually productivity has not suffered as a result. We still have obviously the field employees that are still out there working as well, but you see the innovations that are occurring. I think we have years ahead of us to continue to optimize O&M expense, and when you think it\u2019s going to level out, something new comes about and I think that\u2019s going to be a continual opportunity for us. We actually--and you probably we announced we have a new senior vice president over our--actually, the digital experience, our Chief Information and Technology Officer who is joining the company, we wanted to make sure that we put technology and the customer experience, and certainly our charge innovation hub and those kinds of things together to really focus the organization on what the future holds and what it can mean in terms of O&M in the future. I think we don\u2019t know the answer to that, and really you don\u2019t want to know, you want to just keep pressing forward, and we\u2019ll do that.\nMichael Lapides: Got it, thank you Nick. Much appreciated.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeremy Hulme [ph] with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.\nJeremy Hulme: Hi, good morning. Thanks for having me here. I could be wrong, but I think in the past you might have provided a multi-year view of financing needs in the earnings deck. I think I might have missed that here, so didn\u2019t know if there any changes to how you\u2019re thinking about funding capex going forward here, and is there any interplay with where Moody\u2019s is at right now as you think about this?\nBrian Tierney: Jeremy, there\u2019s really no change in how we\u2019re funding capex. I think the big thing we did really with the last call was give some insight into how we were going to fund more Central wind and the idea that we\u2019d be doing that between 50% and 60% equity. We\u2019ve always been fairly conservative in our balance sheet management, and we\u2019re going to continue that going forward. \nJeremy Hulme: Got it. That\u2019s it for me. Thanks for taking my question.\nBrian Tierney: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of James Thalacker with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nJames Thalacker: Hey, how are you guys? Thanks for taking my call.\nNick Akins: Sure. \nJames Thalacker: Just following up on Jeremy\u2019s question, just wondering, Brian and Nick, as you guys are getting closer to North Central wind approvals, have you sharpened your idea on how you\u2019re thinking about financing that, and especially have you looked a little bit more maybe some cycling some current assets, as opposed to accessing the capital markets specifically? \nBrian Tierney: James, we do have a little bit of time for that, right? The smaller portion of North Central wind is going to come, about $300 million at the end of \u201920, which would really make the financing of that a \u201921 event. Then we have really until the end of \u201921 to go forward with that, so how we come up with the equity portion of that, whether it\u2019s capital rotation or whether it\u2019s the equity capital markets, are still things that we have plenty of time to work through. I think the important assumption was the range of percentage of equity that we\u2019d use for that project, and that\u2019s where we talked about being in the 50% to 66% of the project.\nNick Akins: Yes, and really probably the main message is all the options that were available to us before are still on the table and still being considered. There hasn\u2019t been any change from a timing perspective in our ability to get that done, so I\u2019d say we\u2019re still at the same place we were and we\u2019re ready to execute. I think it\u2019s just a matter of us getting the ducks all in a row to ensure that we\u2019re at the right place at the right time.\nJames Thalacker: Sure. I just wasn\u2019t sure if you guys were looking at the potential for augmenting some of the equity with the recycling of assets, if there became a regulatory proceeding or something like that, that would have to be taken into consideration ahead of time just because of--\nNick Akins: Yes, and we\u2019ve said for really over a year now that with capital rotation, but also sale of assets is on the table as part of that process. We\u2019re obligated to do that from a shareholder perspective, and we will certainly do that.\nJames Thalacker: Got it. Thank you very much. Appreciate the time.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sophia Karp with Keybanc.\nNick Akins: Morning Sophia.\nSophia Karp: Hi. Good morning, thank you for taking my question. A couple of questions here for me. Can you remind us if North Central wind was contemplating tax equity financing as part of the plan?\nBrian Tierney: It is not. \nSophia Karp: Okay, so then maybe another one for me. I know you guys have a pretty decent chunk of your workforce that was on track to retire within the next, call it five, seven years maybe. Are you contemplating offering them, these folks some sort of voluntary early retirement, maybe in an effort to cut O&M? Is that something that we could see on the table?\nNick Akins: Well, I usually get that question from employees. As we look at the O&M and the issues that we\u2019re dealing with to try to reduce O&M to the $2.7 billion level and beyond, we look at a lot of things; but one thing we have to be very careful about is certainly if you offer things like that, you usually lose people you don\u2019t want to lose. In this day and age certainly in our frontline employee ranks, we need every individual that\u2019s working, and there\u2019s a lot of competition going on for the professionals in those industries. That\u2019s something we have to be really careful about. Now obviously if it\u2019s part of the--as part of our regular operations that if we evaluate groups and there\u2019s efficiencies in terms of resources, whether it\u2019s vacancies or retirements or even where severance is offered, we\u2019ll continually manage our resource based upon the work that\u2019s in front of us, and we typically do that on a surgical basis rather than some generalized approach. I suspect that we\u2019ll continue that approach.\nSophia Karp: Got it, thank you. One more from me, if I may. On the volumes, first, to what do you attribute the jump in oil and gas volumes? What kind of dynamic on the ground is driving that, and should we expect a reversal of that? As the states begin to sort of reopen, if you call it that, which ones of your service territories would you expect to reopen and maybe be on a faster trajectory sooner than the others [indiscernible]?\nBrian Tierney: What\u2019s really driving our results for oil and gas has been midstream and downstream, so I attribute a lot of that--it\u2019s pipeline transportation, really, was up 28% for the quarter. What you\u2019re seeing there is sort of a lag effect associated with all the increases that we\u2019ve seen in oil and gas extraction and then it\u2019s been moving that product from the oil patch to refineries and places where it can be used. That lag effect is finally catching up with us as we\u2019ve seen people putting in electric compression on pipelines and our having to service that, and so that trend has continued well into the first quarter and even into the month of April. We\u2019ve continued to see increases in pipeline transportation and downstream as well. The downstream might fall off a little bit as we\u2019re seeing some reductions in refining, and certainly oil and gas extraction itself will be down as people shut in wells and don\u2019t take as much as they previously had. But it\u2019s really been the midstream part of that that\u2019s been driving the growth in oil and gas that we\u2019ve seen. \nNick Akins: Just to go back on your earlier question too, just an example, I probably have the opportunity for a call-out, our Conesville plant is retiring, the plant is retiring this month after over 60 years of service, and that\u2019s typically what we\u2019ve done. As plants retire, as employees shift from one plant to another and optimize across plants, we\u2019ve enabled that through severance programs and those types of things, so that\u2019s just an example of what you were mentioning before.\nBrian Tierney: Then to our service territories as they open, all 11 of our traditional footprint states anticipate opening in May, and they generally have staged reopenings as we go through the month, but all of ours anticipate opening during this month.\nSophia Karp: Awesome, let\u2019s hope that happen. Thank you.\nBrian Tierney: Yes, I think our service territory, and it\u2019s really interesting to me because we serve midsized cities and smaller - Columbus, Tulsa are our largest cities, but they\u2019re obviously not New York or Chicago or other areas like that, San Francisco. That has actually improved the resilience because people are more spread out, and so our states have been able to methodically go through the shut-down provisions and now are methodically going through the restart provisions, and it\u2019s been, I would say, probably more helpful to the recovery process for our service territory.\nSophia Karp: Thank you.\nDarcy Reese: Perky, I just want to let you know, we have time for one more question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question is from the line of Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim and Partners. Please go ahead.\nShar Pourreza: Hey, good morning guys. \nNick Akins: Morning Shar.\nShar Pourreza: Just one or two questions, more just clarification. Nick, you obviously reiterated guidance, the long term growth rate, 5% to 7% off the original base. I know in prior remarks, you\u2019ve highlighted that you\u2019d be disappointed if you weren\u2019t in the upper end. Is that still the case, or have the issues around COVID and some of the moving pieces walked you back down a little bit from that?\nNick Akins: Yes, I guess I would still be disappointed, but obviously you have to look at it realistically, and based on the information we have today, I think we\u2019re well placed in terms of that, and we\u2019ll continually update it. Obviously I\u2019d like to think there\u2019s more upside than downside because we have looked very conservatively and very pragmatically at what we face relative to the business and customer base that we serve, but as we get North Central, I\u2019m still optimistic about those future years where that gets fully layered in, starting in \u201921. So 2020 may be a tread year for the guidance range and then we get the engine back fully on the tracks and get moving again. \nShar Pourreza: Got it. Then just one last on North Central, if you take the $2 billion spending around that project and you look at your $33 billion of opportunities in your base plan, as you guys look to layer in North Central spend and you\u2019re looking at different financing opportunities, is there any spending opportunities within the core $33 billion that could be maybe secondary in nature of offsetting with North Central coming online, or should we think about $2 billion from North Central additive to $33 billion? I\u2019m just trying to figure if we\u2019re modeling this, how we should think about that.\nBrian Tierney: And that\u2019s why we\u2019ve kept it outside. It\u2019s additive to the $33 billion.\nShar Pourreza: Got it. Terrific, guys. Thanks so much for everything.\nBrian Tierney: Thank you Shar.\nDarcy Reese: Thank you for joining us on today\u2019s call. As always, the IR team will be available to answer any additional questions you may have.  Perky, will you please give the replay information?\nOperator: Certainly. Ladies and gentlemen, this conference is available for replay starting today. Please dial 1-866-207-1041 and enter the access code of 3291585. You may also dial 402-970-0847 and enter the access code of 3291585. Those numbers again, 866-207-1041 and 402-970-0847 and entering the access code of 3291585.

            "name": "Nick Akins",
            "content": "Okay, thank you Darcy. Welcome and thank you all for joining AEP's first quarter 2020 earnings call. I want to take a moment to extend our sympathies to all those who have been personally impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. At AEP, we understand that we are all in this together.  The AEP Foundation has contributed to charities across our footprint to ensure that we are part of the solution for the customers and communities. In addition to providing our employees with the personal protective equipment they need to do their jobs, we have donated masks, gloves, and other essential items needed by hospitals across our service territory. To further assist those in need within our communities, our customer service representatives have provided assistance in fielding questions on how to secure small business loans.  Throughout these challenging times, I continue to be extremely proud of our employees who have done an outstanding job demonstrating their capacity for being adaptable and exercising the agility needed to meet the challenges of a rapidly changing situation. As we continue to adapt to the ongoing challenges imposed by COVID-19, we remain committed to keeping our employees safe and keeping America powered through these unprecedented times. Certainly as we headed into March during the first quarter, the story for the quarter would have been one in which we have all heard before, mild weather impacted the first quarter, but as we've also heard before, a quarter does not a year to make [ph] and there is plenty of time to recover from a mild winter. We adjust to these types of issues all the time.  But I'm sure you're more interested in the last half of March and what April tells us about the future. I'll get into all that in a minute, but first let's just do the headlines, the financial headlines for the quarter. For the first quarter, we came in with operating earnings of $1.02 per share. We are reaffirming our 2020 operating earnings guidance range of $4.25 to $4.45 per share and our 5% to 7% long term growth rate. AEP is doing this because, regardless of whether we forecast a V-shaped, a U-shaped or W-shaped COVID-19 recovery, we see our service territory as an arbitrage between residential load and commercial industrial load that is defined really by a pendulum between the financial characteristics of working from home versus the restart of commercial and industrial businesses. With all of this considered along with capital, O&M, credit metrics and updated load forecasts and actions we have taken, we expect to be the lower half of our guidance range. We are shifting $500 million of capital spending, substantially contracted renewable business and corporate-related capital for the time being to maintain our commitments to solid credit ratings. We are reaffirming our $33 billion of capital over the five-year period, however. We believe this to be the smart play given our ability to adjust capital quickly to respond to market conditions. We give all of this guidance insight given an exhaustive review county by county of our service territory from a load perspective through April, weather impacts thus far in the year, and expense control measures already put in place to respond to present conditions.  We will continue to refine these assumptions as data become available. Certainly weather, customer load mix, pace of economic recovery and continued O&M related actions will dictate further positive progress within the guidance range. Brian will get into more detail about these assumptions, but I want to reaffirm for you that our balance sheet is strong, credit metrics are good, and liquidity is secure as we move forward. Let's move on to the specifics related to COVID-19 and its implications to our operations and our financials as we see the year progressing. As many have heard, there is famous boxing quote from Iron Mike Tyson that is truly appropriate here: \u201cEveryone has a plan until they get punched in the mouth.\u201d Well, that's what we have faced in the end of this quarter and will face probably for the rest of the year, but I'm here to tell you, yes, we've been challenged a little bit but we are very much still in the match because of our quick responses and agility to be in the position to reaffirm our existing guidance range.  I'll start by discussing our employees' commitments to our customers, communities, and our shareholders as we move through the crisis that I referred to at the beginning of my presentation. First, I want to recognize all the healthcare and first responders who have put themselves in the line of fire to help us all to be more safe and healthy. As a critical infrastructure service company, the frontline employees of our utility have also taken on risk by ensuring we are out in the field responding to substantial storm activity to ensure the resiliency and reliability of electric service so that our hospitals, critical businesses, and customers who are under stay-at-home provisions can continue to benefit at least from some degree of comfort in these challenging times. We have instituted protection measures for these employees that reflect CDC guidance regarding physical distancing, including smaller work teams, proper hygiene, and appropriate PPE and testing to minimize risk of contact with the virus.  Approximately 12,000, over 70% of AEP's employees have been working from home for several weeks now and will continue to work from home even after stay-at-home provisions are lifted to ensure further precautions are taken both at home and at the office for employees who must return for various reasons. We have instituted specific COVID-19 adjustments to our health plans and benefits for employees, and as a critical infrastructure business have continued to pay our employees as they work from home. For most field-level employees, we have also awarded additional days off with pay to enable more time with their families during this time. We have over 82% of our call center employees working from home, and as they not only answer customer questions, they are also helping our small businesses get back on their feet by helping them navigate through the SBA loan provisions of the Cares Act. Regarding our customers, we recognize the hardships that this pandemic has brought on and have temporarily suspended all service disconnects for non-payment, and our team of call center professionals have been working diligently to administer more flexible payment arrangements for our commercial and residential customers. Some states have mandated this, but we do so voluntarily and our state commissions have fully supported these actions through the establishment of deferred accounting and other measures, which I want to take the time to thank them for addressing these issues. Regarding our communities, the AEP Foundation has donated over $3 million to support basic human needs to help address hardships from food security, housing, clothing, and other issues during this time. We have donated over 9,000 N95 masks, 110,000 gloves and disposable surgical masks, and 1,200 face shields from our warehouse stocks and 3D printing facilities within our innovation labs.  In my 37 years of being in this business, I have never seen the level of coordination and concern by multiple agencies to do the right thing for our customers, our employees, our businesses and communities. While much focus on this call is on the financials, it is important to remember the part we play in the broader social fabric as a critical infrastructure business. Our effectiveness is defined by the level of cooperation and support from all of the agencies that we deal with: our state commissions and governors' offices, federal and state legislators, FERC, NERC, DoE, DHS, NRC and others. They all have answered the call, and we at AEP thank them. There is much work yet to do, but I believe all have embraced the capital-S for social from an ESG investor perspective.  From the operational side, we have had no disruptions to plant or grid operations while storm activity has been exceptional, given the significant storm activity in several of our operating company territories and considering the additional COVID-19 related safety precautions. There has not been a delay in the north central wind facilities construction and the regulatory cases regarding this project have continued on schedule. As well, future rate cases are on track to be filed, including in Ohio and Kentucky. On the regulatory front, it has been a busy quarter. In fact, we have already received approvals for 96% of the budgeted regulatory recovery for 2020. In March, the Indiana Regulatory Commission authorized a $77 million revenue increased based on a 9.7% ROE. The Commission approved IN's proposed distribution system investments and full tracking of FERC transmission costs. The company had also sought an adjustment to reflect the reallocation of capacity costs associated with termination of certain wholesale contracts which was denied by the Commission. We have filed for re-hearing on this matter. In January, the Michigan Commission approved the settlement of the base rate case resulting in an increase of $36 million based on a 9.86% ROE. In April, the PUCT - Public Utility Commission of Texas issued a final order approving the settlement agreement in the AEP Texas base rate case, allowing for a 9.4% ROE with a 42.5% equity layer on the company's $5 billion asset base. Also in April, we filed a DCRF - distribution cost recovery factor to add approximately $440 million in assets to the rate base for distribution investments we made to benefit our customers in AEP Texas. A T-cost filing - transmission cost filing was also made to recover $800 million in transmission investments made over a similar time frame. The company also filed a required base rate case in Virginia as part of the state's annual review. In that filing, the company asked for a 9.9% ROE on a 50/50 cap structure on a $2.5 billion base, resulting in an increase of $64.9 million. Rates would be effective at the end of January 2021.  There is no question that these are unprecedented times. I think it goes without saying that we will need to ensure that utilities and commissions work together to devise creative solutions to the challenges we all face.  Tony Clark, former Commissioners at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission prepared and submitted a white paper to NERUC recognizing the unique challenges the energy industry is facing and the need for regulators to be creative to new solutions. In that article, he called for policymakers at both the federal and state level to be proactive in both the short and long term by targeting measures that support both customers and utilities. Collectively with our legislators and our commissions, we need to work together to recognize the importance of protecting customers and ensuring utilities are able to invest in their systems and maintain the level of service that our communities depend upon, whether through deferrals or preferably riders or forward-looking test years, because cash is king again for utilities to be able to adequately invest in critical infrastructure.  Two examples within our service territory where the Commissions have taken a proactive view have been in Texas and Ohio. We believe both are steps in the right direction. In Texas, the Commission approved the COVID-19 Electricity Relief Program for residential consumers who are having difficulty paying their bills. A rider has been put in place to fund the ERP that enables AEP Texas to access cash to begin the program cost. In Ohio, Commission staff recommended approval of the regulatory asset deferral for future recovery and recovery of the demand ratchet program costs through the existing economic development rider. This will help lessen the impact to industrials who are key employers within the state and protect utilities. We believe both are examples of progressive moves by states to help mitigate the risk associated with COVID-19 to both customers and provide certainty for utilities. Moving on to the North Central project, we continue to make progress on this landmark project that provides significant benefits for our 1.1 million customers in our PSO and SWEPCO states. We received approval of the unanimous settlement in Oklahoma as well as FERC approval in the first quarter. We expected May to be an important month for the project for the remaining jurisdictions, and I'm pleased to report that yesterday the Arkansas Public Service Commission approved the 155 megawatts, or approximately 10% of the total project along with the flex-up option. As you recall, the flex-up option allows Arkansas to increase the megawatt allocation should another SWEPCO state reject the application. The Commission in that order determined that SWEPCO should use it's formulative rate rider to recover its costs.  In early March, we filed the unanimous settlement in Louisiana for 268 megawatts or approximately 18% of the total project, which also included the flex-up option. We expect a decision by the Louisiana Public Service Commission in the May or June time frame. Lastly, after concluding our hearings in February, we expect a proposal for commission decision for the Texas ALJs in late May. With approvals in Oklahoma, Arkansas and FERC under our belt, the project has what it needs to go forward at 846 megawatts of the 1,485 megawatt project. Of course, the project can move forward with even more savings for customers and the full $2 billion investment opportunity if either the LPSC approves with the flex-up option or the LPSC and the Public Utility Commission of Texas approves their portion of the full project. Now let's talk to the equalizer chart. Most of these are weather related, but for AEP Ohio we've had the roll-off of some of the legacy fuel and capacity carrying charges. They rolled off, so we expect the trend for the ROE to be at the authorized levels of around 10%. Presently, it's at 9.9% for quarter 2020. In APCO, the ROE for APCO at the end of first quarter is 8.7%, and that's driven by lower normalized usage and higher depreciation from increased capital investments, and of course unfavorable weather. Virginia's first triannual review was filed in March 2020, as I mentioned earlier, and it covers the 2017 to 2019 periods. An ROE of 9.42% would be used for the triannual review with 70 basis point bandwidth of 8.72% to 10.12% ROE.  Kentucky Power, the ROE for Kentucky Power at the end of first quarter was 6.7%, and that's primarily driven by loss of load from weak economic conditions, loss of major customers along with higher expenses and unfavorable weather. We also have been in a stay out provision associated with rate filings, but that goes away here soon and we expect to be filing in Kentucky in the July time frame. I&M, the ROE at I&M is at 10.5%, and we've been implementing new rates for Indianan which will take place in the second quarter, but we fully expect to be at the authorized areas of around 9.7% to 9.86%. Then for PSO, PSO is at 9.2% primarily driven by unfavorable weather. SWEPCO at the end of first quarter was 6.2%, and that was because of a loss of load, unfavorable weather, and continued impact of the Arkansas share of the Turk plant, which accounts for about 112 basis points. The Arkansas base case settlement went in place in December 2019 and is effective January 2020, approved a $24 million revenue increase there.  In AEP Texas, it's at 8% and that's due to a lag associated with the timing of annual filings and one-time adjustments from our recently finalized base rate case. Favorable regulatory treatment has historically allowed us to file annual DCRF and biannual T-cost filings to recover our cost, and I mentioned those earlier, so there's a lag associated with those but we should see a pick-up there and drive more toward a 9.4% ROE in the long term. Then the transmission holdco at the end of the first quarter was 11.5% and it was driven by higher revenues due to differences between actual and forecasted revenues, so we fully expect the transmission ROE to be in the mid-10% range in 2020. With that, when there is a pandemic like the one we're experiencing today that has not occurred in 100 years, and this nation's economy has been effectively shut down for months, there is no question that everyone is challenged and AEP is no exception. We are up to the challenge to recognize not only the role that this company has in the resiliency and restart of our economy as well as the provision of electric service no matter where our customers are working or living, but also the importance of the consistency and quality of earnings and dividends to our shareholders that makes our work possible. We will strike that balance, respond to challenges, and I'll stick with a boxing analogy with a Sylvester Stallone movie, Rocky, where the music is playing, the theme from Rocky and he's running up the steps that represent the adversity of reaching a goal. I believe at the end of the year, we all - AEP, the communities we serve, our customers and our shareholders - will be at the summit, raising our arms in victory.  Brian? Morning Steve. In at least Indiana, we have forward test year views, and I think it's probably going to be particularly important as we go in for these cases for there to be an understanding that we are dealing with a COVID-related year if it is a test year. Wherever you have forward test years, though, you can account for that going forward in the rate making, but we'd be tuned into the process whether you pro forma in or do other things. I think there's probably at least opportunities for discussion about that because COVID--you know, 2020 is going to be an usual year and to be used for test years would be particularly challenging. You have to really go to some form of pro forma view that has the level of investments, the level of business activity that you would normally see. So, I would expect our commissions to be reasonable in that approach. Yes, so originally North Central was not in our capital plan, and so when we get approval for that, that'd be dealing with a different financing model associated with that. As far as the megawatt level and the amount of investment, yes, if we get approval for Louisiana for example, and Louisiana also approves the up rate which is in a settlement arrangement, then we would have the full $2 billion investment opportunity there. We already know we're going forward with the project - that was the importance of Arkansas approval, so the project is moving forward. The question is what size, and then when Louisiana approves that, and hopefully with a flex-up as well, then that's the full $2 billion, or if Texas takes their portion, then all operating jurisdictions will be taking their particular portions as we go forward. Now, there is additional opportunity for renewables in those areas. The integrated resource plans have the capability for that, but we felt like, as we originally said about this project, there is sort of a break point between the opportunities that existed around the wind farm project and the pricing, and we wanted to make absolutely sure that the pricing was very effective and produced very positive savings for our customers. So, we can always go out for a bid again to fill the rest of that from a resource planning perspective. Thank you. Thank you, Durgesh. Julien, I think you're reading it right, though - we're being as transparent as we possibly can be through this process using the latest information. Matter of fact, we got the load information, April load information yesterday, so we're trying to be as transparent as possible, but also taking the right, smart, appropriate steps to ensure that we're able to be agile enough to do what we need to do. I think you're reading that right.  We obviously would put that capital back in as quickly as possible and then, as Brian mentioned, we're not only mitigating any impacts to the earnings capability but also thinking ahead in terms of where we deploy that capital in the future. Then we also have North Central coming about, so those things are occurring. We're trying to manage through this year in a very positive fashion and really a defensive posture, and then set ourselves up for the future years, in '21 and beyond.  We'll continue that approach, and obviously if we get a hot summer, for example, we'll throw capital back in - there's all kinds of things we can adjust, and then from a residential standpoint, you heard our residential load for April was 6%, and we're saying 3%, so we don't know exactly how this is going to play out, particularly with changing dynamics of business cases themselves changing. I mean, we had Nationwide recently come out and say that their people are going to be working from home, and we have 17,000 employees and 12,000 are working from home. We may be looking through our Achieving Excellence program, which we have already accelerated, to look at how you look at people working from home and maybe the whole business cases changes from that perspective and also reduces O&M further.  So we're in the process of doing all that, but we're just trying to be as transparent as possible. But you're reading the tea leaves right. No, it doesn't change. As a matter of fact, we'll continue those cases. Obviously, as I mentioned, in Kentucky we have a stay out provision. We need to file a case, and we'll do that when that stay out provision is lifted, and then that would be effective January 1 of 2021. Then for Ohio, obviously we're due to file a case there as well. It's a pretty moderate case, but nevertheless.  As far as we can tell, everything is going exactly like we had planned. Now, you may see some procedural schedules change, but the end result and the end dates aren't changing, so that's where we're at today. Morning Michael. I have the same problem. Michael, $500 million shifted. We're sensitive about that! No, we don't see that happening because obviously we're required to file a case, and actually it's a pretty moderate case, so I think that there really isn't any reason to delay it at this point. Yes. And everybody knows about it as well, so it won't be a surprise to anybody. There's a pretty negligible impact on customers too in that case. You know, we've had a lot of conversations about that, but every day you're surprised by some new innovation or something that can change the trajectory of O&M expense. We spend $4 billion a year, I think $2.8 billion is not tracked, and when you look at some of the opportunities that are available, and actually I think if there is a silver lining in the coronavirus pandemic, it is that we can really re-evaluate what it means to get our business done, because we've been very effective at the people working from home and actually productivity has not suffered as a result. We still have obviously the field employees that are still out there working as well, but you see the innovations that are occurring. I think we have years ahead of us to continue to optimize O&M expense, and when you think it's going to level out, something new comes about and I think that's going to be a continual opportunity for us. We actually--and you probably we announced we have a new senior vice president over our--actually, the digital experience, our Chief Information and Technology Officer who is joining the company, we wanted to make sure that we put technology and the customer experience, and certainly our charge innovation hub and those kinds of things together to really focus the organization on what the future holds and what it can mean in terms of O&M in the future. I think we don't know the answer to that, and really you don't want to know, you want to just keep pressing forward, and we'll do that. Sure. Yes, and really probably the main message is all the options that were available to us before are still on the table and still being considered. There hasn't been any change from a timing perspective in our ability to get that done, so I'd say we're still at the same place we were and we're ready to execute. I think it's just a matter of us getting the ducks all in a row to ensure that we're at the right place at the right time. Yes, and we've said for really over a year now that with capital rotation, but also sale of assets is on the table as part of that process. We're obligated to do that from a shareholder perspective, and we will certainly do that. Morning Sophia. Well, I usually get that question from employees. As we look at the O&M and the issues that we're dealing with to try to reduce O&M to the $2.7 billion level and beyond, we look at a lot of things; but one thing we have to be very careful about is certainly if you offer things like that, you usually lose people you don't want to lose. In this day and age certainly in our frontline employee ranks, we need every individual that's working, and there's a lot of competition going on for the professionals in those industries. That's something we have to be really careful about. Now obviously if it's part of the--as part of our regular operations that if we evaluate groups and there's efficiencies in terms of resources, whether it's vacancies or retirements or even where severance is offered, we'll continually manage our resource based upon the work that's in front of us, and we typically do that on a surgical basis rather than some generalized approach. I suspect that we'll continue that approach. Just to go back on your earlier question too, just an example, I probably have the opportunity for a call-out, our Conesville plant is retiring, the plant is retiring this month after over 60 years of service, and that's typically what we've done. As plants retire, as employees shift from one plant to another and optimize across plants, we've enabled that through severance programs and those types of things, so that's just an example of what you were mentioning before. Morning Shar. Yes, I guess I would still be disappointed, but obviously you have to look at it realistically, and based on the information we have today, I think we're well placed in terms of that, and we'll continually update it. Obviously I'd like to think there's more upside than downside because we have looked very conservatively and very pragmatically at what we face relative to the business and customer base that we serve, but as we get North Central, I'm still optimistic about those future years where that gets fully layered in, starting in '21. So 2020 may be a tread year for the guidance range and then we get the engine back fully on the tracks and get moving again."

            "name": "Brian Tierney",
            "content": "Thank you Nick, and good morning everyone. I will take us through the financial results for the quarter, provide some insight in how we're thinking about 2020, including an update on April load, and finish with a review of our balance sheet and liquidity. Let's stop briefly on Slide 7, which shows the comparison of GAAP to operating earnings for the quarter. GAAP earnings were $1.00 per share compared to $1.16 per share in 2019. There is a reconciliation of GAAP to operating earnings in the appendix.  Let's turn to Slide 8 and look at the drivers of quarterly operating earnings. Operating earnings for the first quarter were $1.02 per share or $504 million, compared to $1.19 per share of $585 million in 2019. Looking at the drivers by segment, operating earnings for vertically integrated utilities were $0.50 per share, down $0.13. Earnings in this segment declined primarily due to warmer than normal winter weather and lower normalized retail load. Other small decreases included higher depreciation, higher tax expense and lower wholesale load, AFUDC, and off-system sales. Favorable drivers included rate changes and higher transmission revenue. The transmission and distribution utilities segment earned $0.24 per share, down $0.08 from last year primarily driven by the 2019 reversal of a regulatory provision in Ohio. Other smaller drivers included higher depreciation, the roll-off of legacy riders in Ohio, and unfavorable weather. These items were partially offset by higher rate changes, normalized retail load, and recovery of increased transmission investment in ERCOT, as well as lower O&M.  The AEP transmission holdco segment continued to grow, contributing $0.28 per share, an improvement of $0.03 over last year. Net plant increased by $1.5 billion or 18% since March of last year.  Generation and marketing produced earnings of $0.07 per share, down $0.02 from last year. The renewables business grew with the acquisition of multiple renewable assets. Increases in retail margins were more than offset by timing around income taxes and lower generation sales due to lower energy prices and plant retirements. Finally, corporate and other was up $0.03 per share primarily driven by lower taxes relating to a prior year income tax adjustment and other consolidating items that were reversed by year end, other variances related to higher interest expense, and lower O&M.  Earlier in the call, Nick indicated that we are reaffirming our 2020 operating earnings guidance range of $4.25 per share to $4.45 per share and would likely be in the lower half of that range. Let me give you some of the detail that leads us to that outcome on Slide 9 and then I'll provide more detail on each of the key assumptions in the following slides. Our economic forecasting group uses Moody's analytics as a key input to our models. In April, Moody's published a county-level forecast that included the projected impact of COVID-19 on our service territory. We used this new data along with updated assumptions from our customer service engineers to come up with revised retail sales projections for the year. We now expect residential sales to increase 3% over 2019 levels largely driven by all of the activity that has taken place in residences rather than in places of work or in the classroom. Conversely, we are anticipating commercial sales contractions of 5.6% and industrial sales declines of 8% over 2019 levels.  Many businesses have shifted their operations to a mostly online platform while other employers have had to make the difficult decision to furlough or reduce employee headcount until market demand is restored. These retail forecasts lead us to expect an overall decline in sales of 3.4%. This updated load would impact our prior forecast negatively by $0.15 per share. We have already discussed our year to date negative impact from mild weather of $0.11 per share. In response to these circumstances, we have taken action to reduce untracked operations and maintenance expenses by an additional $100 million, resulting in a positive expectation of $0.17 per share for the year. The net result of load, weather and O&M reductions would have a negative $0.09 per share impact for the year, leaving us inside but in the lower half of the original operating earnings guidance range. We realize moratoriums on disconnects and the economic impact to our customers may have on our cash receipts. In response to this, we have initiated a shift of $500 million of capital expenditures out of 2020 to be placed into the future years of 2021 to 2024. As we made these deferrals, we were mindful of customer and reliability impacts. In fact, about $200 million of these investments were in our competitive renewables business and about $100 million were corporate investments. The shifts can be ramped up or down going forward in response to how events play out in real time. With this moderate level of capital shifting, we are able to reaffirm our 5% to 7% long term growth rate off of our original 2019 operating earnings guidance range.  Regarding potential increases in bad debt across our jurisdictions, we have already received orders in Texas, Arkansas, Louisiana and Virginia to set up regulatory assets related to COVID-19 costs. Other states where we have filed for recovery of COVID-related deferrals include Ohio, Michigan, Tennessee, and Oklahoma. We have tried on this slide to provide some of the detail for how the coronavirus and oil and gas events will impact AEP's operating earnings for 2020. Instead of taking you through the details of our scenario planning, let me highlight some of the items that could positively and negatively impact our view as we make our way through the year. On the positive side, a sharp V-shape recovery that is more dramatic than the gradual recovery from the second quarter low point that we have assumed would improve results. Additionally, mitigation of coronavirus infection rates leading the economy to open up sooner than we have assumed would improve results. A greater increase in residential sales and an improvement in commercial and industrial sales would further improve our outlook. We have experienced a mild winter. If that carried forward into a warmer than normal summer, that would have positive earnings implications. Another positive would be if we could garner incremental savings to what we have assumed at the $2.7 billion level of untracked O&M expenses. The items that would create negative impacts to our assumptions are largely the opposite of the positives. A prolonged U-shaped or a dramatic L-shaped recovery would be more negative than our assumptions. Increased coronavirus infection rates could lead to weaker economic conditions for longer periods than we have assumed, potential impairing our outlook for the year. In addition, continued mild weather and/or O&M expenses beyond our control, like for storms, could negatively impact the outlook for 2020.  We have tried our best using data, experience and judgment to update and share our outlook with you for 2020. We have tried not to be unreasonably optimistic nor pessimistic. This outlook allows us to reaffirm our 2020 operating earnings guidance range with a view that we are likely to be in the lower half of the range. Now let's turn to Slide 10 and provide an update on our system load, focusing on our outlook for the balance of the year. Our first quarter normalized load was down seven-tenths of a percent compared to last year. Our residential and industrial sales were both down for the quarter while commercial sales were essentially flat. Our original guidance for the year assumed half a percent normalized load growth. Clearly a lot has changed since that forecast was developed. Since then, we have taken a fresh look at our forecast and now expect our total load to end the year down 3.4% on a weather normalized basis, with meaningful changes in customer mix and related margins. For 2020, we anticipate a significant contraction in the second quarter followed by a gradual recovery over the balance of the year. In the upper left quadrant, we raised our residential outlook for 2020 to 3%. We are seeing significant increases in our residential load during the stay-at-home period. Even after our states begin to reopen their economies in the second quarter, it is our expectation that many employees will continue to work from home. Having said this, we expect the strongest residential growth in the second quarter with some tapering off during the second half of the year. Moving clockwise, our commercial sales outlook is now assuming a 5.6% decline from 2019 levels. Prior to the COVID outbreak, we experienced consistent improvement in our commercial sales class over the past year; however, once the stay-at-home provisions were in place, we experienced significant declines in our sales to traditional retail stores, hotels, restaurants, churches and schools. However, not all commercial load was negatively impacted by the outbreak. Sales to hospitals and government support offices were up substantially in the first quarter. When you consider the challenges many businesses will face trying to introduce social distancing protocols into their normal operations, we are projecting a difficult second quarter for commercial sales with modest improvement through the remainder of the year. Finally, in the lower left chart the outlook for industrial sales has changed significantly. We now expect 2020 industrial sales to come in 8% below 2019 levels. A number of factors have changed the outlook for this class, but the biggest driver is the overall drop in economic activity. Over the past several weeks, we have learned a number of large industrial customers that were either idling their production or reducing their output temporarily until market conditions improve. In addition, a number of expansions we had previously assumed to come online later this year have been delayed or postponed. These delays should be reversed as the economy gradually recovers. Since nearly 30% of our industrial sales come from the oil and gas sectors, let me explain recent sales trends in this sector. Surprisingly, sales to the oil and gas sectors in the first quarter increased by 9.7%, which was the strongest quarter we've experienced since 2016. Most of that growth came from the pipeline transportation sector which was up 28% for the first quarter. Going forward, we expect some reduction in oil and gas extraction that will be offset by growth in the midstream and downstream operations. We don't normally report on monthly load numbers, but since we had the data, let's take a look at April load on Slide 11. Total normalized retail load for April was down 4.3% with the relationship between the retail classes being similar to what we assumed for the balance of the year. Not surprising given the number of people relegated to their homes, normalized residential sales were up 6% for the month. Equally not surprising, normalized commercial sales were down 7.7% for the month, with the biggest declines being in schools, churches, restaurants and hotels. Industrial sales were down 10% for the month. The biggest decline was in sectors that support the automotive industry, while we experienced strong sales growth in pipeline transportation and food manufacturing sectors.  Looking at April's results, the relationship between the classes, also know as sales mix, as well as the levels of sales in each class are consistent with the assumptions we have made for the second quarter of our balance of year assumptions. Moving on to Slide 12, let's discuss some load sensitivities and highlight some of our rate recovery mechanisms. The three pie charts show that by segment and in total, about half of our non-fuel revenues come from the residential class. Applying the 3% growth we are now projecting for residential sales in total to the sensitivities we provided at last year's EEI financial conference, we would pick up $0.12 a share from higher residential sales. Repeating the same calculations for the projected load loss in the commercial and industrial classes would produce a drag of approximately $0.11 and $0.16 per share respectively. When you add these three impacts together, you get the $0.15 per share impact we identified on Slide 9. Finally, retail rate design has a couple of features that stabilize our revenues during an economic downturn. First, most of our large industrial tariffs include demand provisions designed to cover the fixed portion of utility costs. These provisions remain in place even when volumes are down. Second, in our residential customer class we have had some success over the years better aligning the fixed portion of customer rates with fixed costs. Together these rate considerations provide a stabilizing effect on our revenues even when sales volumes decline. Turning to Slide 13, another key assumption is the weather. As mentioned earlier, weather in the first quarter was extremely mild. The green bar in the first quarter shows that mild weather cost us $71 million compared to normal, which was $65 million worse than the first quarter of last year. While our outlook assumes normal weather for the remainder of the year, this chart shows that weather can change significantly, as evidenced by last year's experience. If we were to have another warm summer like we did in 2019, it could offset the $0.11 drag for weather in the first quarter that we showed you on Slide 9. Our management team has a proven track record of adapting our plans to changing conditions as necessary. In years when the weather has provided a tailwind, we have accelerated spending to provide stability to our earnings in line with our 5% to 7% growth targets. In years where weather has been less accommodating, we have been able to shift our spending to future years to achieve the same goal. You can expect this management team will react similarly this year. Turning to Slide 14, you can see that for nine years now, we have maintained O&M discipline and kept spending net of offsets in a tight range of between $2.8 billion and $3.1 billion. We had originally planned to drive down O&M costs in 2020 to $2.8 billion. In response to the expected decline in sales, we now plan to reduce O&M spend by an additional $100 million. Plans like the Achieving Excellence program and additional one-time and extraordinary reductions will help us to achieve those reductions. Now let's move on to Slide15 and review the company's capitalization and liquidity. Our debt to total capital ratio increased during the quarter from 59.8% to 61.8%. The increase in the debt component is attributable to financings to support our ongoing investment program and to fortify our liquidity position to ensure smooth operational financing during this period of market volatility. As you would expect, the increase in debt combined with the ongoing pressure associated with the flow back of ADIT resulted in pressure on our FFO to debt metric, which at quarter end stood at 12.5% on a Moody's basis.  The decline in the metric is also temporarily influenced by the $1 billion 364-day term loan the company proactively obtained in late March. Despite the temporary decline in this metric, rating agencies view this enhanced liquidity as credit positive. Adjusting for this facility and associated cash balances, the metric would be 13%. Our liquidity at the end of the quarter remained strong at $2.8 billion. Since then, our commercial paper balances have dropped to $1.6 billion and our liquidity position has increased to $3.1 billion.  Our qualified pension funding increased approximately 4% to 93%, and our OPEB funding decreased approximately 15% to 130%. Pension and OPEB equity returns were negative 23% and negative 22% respectively for the quarter and were the primary reasons pensions and OPEB funding decreased. Fixed income returns of approximately 7% and 6% in the pension and OPEB respectively served to offset some of the equity losses. We have worked hard over the years to focus on pension and OPEB funding and are pleased with how the asset portfolios have performed in spite of recent market volatility. Let's wrap this up on Slide 16 so we can quickly get to your questions. In response to the economic downturn and related implications, AEP has responded to quickly reduce our O&M spending by an additional $100 million for 2020. This action combined with our updated load forecast allows us to reaffirm our existing operating earnings guidance of 2020 from $4.25 to $4.45 per share. In addition, in response to uncertainties about cash flows related to reduced customer demand and potential delays in customer receipts, we are shifting about $500 million in capital expenditures out of 2020 and into the period 2021 to 2024. We can adjust the timing and size of this shift in reaction to how events play out relative to our assumptions. Because of our ability to continue to invest in our own system organically, we are confident in our ability to grow the company at our stated long term growth rate of 5% to 7%. We continue to make progress on obtaining approvals for our $2 billion North Central wind project in Oklahoma and plan to proceed when approvals are obtained. With that, I will turn the call over to the operator for your questions. You know, in both those cases, Steve, we had forward-looking test years and we do have orders effective in both of those jurisdictions. Steve, we'll be full speed ahead on the capex associated with North Central wind one way or the other. Nick mentioned that it's not in the $33 billion that we had previously identified for the five years, 2020 to 2024, and we previously said that we anticipate an equity component of that investment to be between 50% and 66%. Sure, so we are assuming that the second quarter would be the lowest quarter for load, and that there would be a gradual recovery over the balance of 2020 and into the first quarter of 2021. We've really been--we anticipate year end being FFO to debt in that 13% to 14% range. We've communicated that with S&P and Moody's, had dialogues with them as late as yesterday. They understand where we are and what we're doing. I think they were encouraged to see us flex a little bit our capex for the balance of the year in response to anticipated lower cash flows than what we had anticipated, and they're supportive of that. They were--they viewed what Julie and her team did around the term loan facility as being credit positive, and they are fully aware and apprised of what we're doing. You should ask them, but I think their answer would be supportive. Sure Julien, thanks for the question. We are anticipating there to be some reduction in cash flow this year associated with two things: one, lower customer demand, and then two, we have eliminated disconnects currently, and so we think that customers will pay us slower than what they have in the past. We're not seeing the impact of that in a significant way yet - it's too early, but in anticipation of lower cash flows to maintain those FFO to debt metrics, we felt it was prudent to at least engage the motor on our ability to scale back capex.  In regards to the no impact on future earnings, we tried to do it in places that have either lower regulatory lag or the increase in earnings isn't as great. Nick mentioned that some of that reduction is in the competitive renewables space and some of that reduction is also at corporate capital, things like IT and things like that, that are much slower to flow into customer rates during rate cases. Things that we are careful not to cut were things like transmission, where we're spending on customer resilience and reliability and we have those formula-based rates to update and get that capex into rates on a fairly efficient basis. We were really thoughtful about how we cut that or shifted that small amount of capex, and made sure that it wasn't impacting earnings. There's another $75 million to $100 million that is in our distribution at our opcos, and then the other $100 million is spread across our organizations but not in the transmission side of the business. Michael, I think Nick's answer earlier was there could be a delay in the procedural schedule. We would still expect to get the result of the case when we originally had. Jeremy, there's really no change in how we're funding capex. I think the big thing we did really with the last call was give some insight into how we were going to fund more Central wind and the idea that we'd be doing that between 50% and 60% equity. We've always been fairly conservative in our balance sheet management, and we're going to continue that going forward. Thank you. James, we do have a little bit of time for that, right? The smaller portion of North Central wind is going to come, about $300 million at the end of '20, which would really make the financing of that a '21 event. Then we have really until the end of '21 to go forward with that, so how we come up with the equity portion of that, whether it's capital rotation or whether it's the equity capital markets, are still things that we have plenty of time to work through. I think the important assumption was the range of percentage of equity that we'd use for that project, and that's where we talked about being in the 50% to 66% of the project. It is not. What's really driving our results for oil and gas has been midstream and downstream, so I attribute a lot of that--it's pipeline transportation, really, was up 28% for the quarter. What you're seeing there is sort of a lag effect associated with all the increases that we've seen in oil and gas extraction and then it's been moving that product from the oil patch to refineries and places where it can be used. That lag effect is finally catching up with us as we've seen people putting in electric compression on pipelines and our having to service that, and so that trend has continued well into the first quarter and even into the month of April. We've continued to see increases in pipeline transportation and downstream as well. The downstream might fall off a little bit as we're seeing some reductions in refining, and certainly oil and gas extraction itself will be down as people shut in wells and don't take as much as they previously had. But it's really been the midstream part of that that's been driving the growth in oil and gas that we've seen. Then to our service territories as they open, all 11 of our traditional footprint states anticipate opening in May, and they generally have staged reopenings as we go through the month, but all of ours anticipate opening during this month. Yes, I think our service territory, and it's really interesting to me because we serve midsized cities and smaller - Columbus, Tulsa are our largest cities, but they're obviously not New York or Chicago or other areas like that, San Francisco. That has actually improved the resilience because people are more spread out, and so our states have been able to methodically go through the shut-down provisions and now are methodically going through the restart provisions, and it's been, I would say, probably more helpful to the recovery process for our service territory. And that's why we've kept it outside. It's additive to the $33 billion. Thank you Shar."

At this time, all lines are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session.  And as a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Darcy Reese. Please go ahead.\nDarcy Reese: Thank you, Cynthia. Good morning, everyone. And welcome to the fourth quarter 2021 earnings call for American Electric Power. We appreciate you taking the time to join us today. Our earnings release, presentation slides and related financial information are available on our website at aep.com. Today, we will be making forward-looking statements during the call. There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements. Please refer to our SEC filings for a discussion of these factors. Joining me this morning for opening remarks are Nick Akins, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Julie Sloat, our Chief Financial Officer. We will take your questions following their remarks. I will now turn the call over to Nick.\nNick Akins: Okay. Thanks, Darcy. Welcome, everyone, to American Electric Power's fourth quarter 2021 earnings call. I'm sure you all had time to read the earnings release and have seen all that we were able to accomplish in 2021. As we saw the results of several regulatory-related cases, it actually came in after the financial last November. AEP has come into 2022 flying high. The lyrics of a song by Lionel Richie and the Commodores actually the first concert or actually catered backstage when I was younger. Flying High says, I knew we could make it from the beginning. AEP has now moved from 4% to 6% to 5% to 7% to 6% to 7% long-term growth rate because of our purposeful steps to enhance growth opportunities and derisk the AEP portfolio. This process will continue. We so have so much to look forward to in 2022. But for the purpose of today's call, I'm going to start by providing a brief recap of our financial performance and then I want to talk about the evolution and the next steps we are taking in the execution of our business strategy, as well as the impact on our financing targets as we hone in on both our regulated generation transformation and our energy delivery infrastructure investments. These are continued refinements that we believe will not only allow us to better serve our customers, but will generate enhanced value for our investors as well. Finally, I will provide an update on the various strategic and regulatory initiatives that are already underway. Starting with the recap of financial highlights, we reported strong results for the fourth quarter, navigating difficult macro headwinds while maintaining our balance sheet and increasing our quarterly dividend. In fact, this quarter was our strongest ever fourth quarter, coming in above consensus estimates with fourth quarter GAAP earnings of $1.07 per share and operating earnings of $0.98 per share bringing our GAAP and operating earnings to $4.97 per share and $4.74 per share year-to-date, respectively. Our strong financial performance in the quarter generated regulated ROE of 9.2% with improved equity layers and enabled us to increase the quarter's dividend from $0.74 to $0.78 per share as announced in October of '21. Our performance rests firmly on the regulatory foundations laid this past year with a series of rate case activity across our jurisdictions. Since EEI, we've received constructive base case orders in Ohio and Oklahoma and we reached a settlement in Indiana that the commission approved yesterday and we anticipate shortly finalizing our other base rate cases in SWEPCO and PSO. Our management team continues to make significant headway in our strategic growth plan and transformation. In 2021, the comprehensive strategic review of our Kentucky operations resulted in an agreement to sell Kentucky Power and AEP Kentucky Transco for more than $2.8 billion. After receiving the necessary regulatory approvals, we expect this sale to close in the second quarter of 2022, notwithstanding the recent withdrawal of our FERC-related - FERC filing related to the Mitchell operating agreement. The completion of this transaction is expected to net AEP approximately $1.45 billion in cash after taxes and transaction fees, proceeds we will use to invest in regulated renewables and transmission. AEP is building on a strong record of actively managing our portfolio to support our growth as we invest in a clean energy future while delivering increased returns to shareholders. An integral part of our long-term strategy is the prioritization of AEP's regulated investment opportunities and the optimization of our assets. To that end, today, we are announcing the elimination of growth capital allocated to the contracted renewables in our 2022 to 2026 forecast and our intent to ultimately sell all or a portion of our contracted renewables portfolio in our Generation & Marketing business segment to help fund our growing capital requirements in our regulated portfolio. In making this decision, our team carefully considered the renewable opportunities in the context of our competitive business, existing competition in the space, our ability to efficiently monetize the PTC's ITC tax credits as regulated opportunities come to fruition, the attention needed to manage the size of this business relative to our overall regulated business and the potential value this business represents to others who are committed to contracted renewable development and operations. We are fully confident that the sale of this portfolio will both simplify and derisk our business while allowing us to allocate proceeds and assign additional capital to our regulated business where we see a meaningful pipeline of investment opportunities to better serve our customers and participate in the energy transition. This shift in direction enables us to recalibrate our 2022 to 2026 capital plan shifting approximately $1.5 billion of investment capital to transmission and raising it to $14.4 billion of the $38 billion 5 year plan. The capital originally allocated to the unregulated generation in the marketing segment will drop from $1.7 billion of the $38 billion 5-year plan to $400 million. The remaining $400 million in the Generation & Marketing segment will be largely allocated to maintenance capital and distributed generation assets. Our investment opportunities remain dynamic. And AEP operating companies will continue to develop integrated resource plans and grid enhancement plans over the near and long term in collaboration with stakeholders. This process continues to make substantial progress as shown on slide 43 of the earnings deck. Overall, we are targeting wind additions of approximately 8.6 gigawatts of solar additions of approximately 6.6 gigawatts by 2030. For which we have allocated $8.2 billion in our current 5 year capital plan. This - the migration from contracted renewables to significant increases in regulated renewables will ensure that AEP maintains the talent and resources to execute this plan. The capital plan also includes $24.8 billion allocated to grid investments. With the changes discussed and the expected completion of the sale of Kentucky Power, we plan on an Analyst Day presentation soon after the sale is completed to further update on all of these important initiatives. Now shifting gears to our regulated renewables opportunity. AEP has a positive record of actively managing its portfolio to support the growth of the company as we invest in our regulated business and renewable generation to transform and build a cleaner, more modern energy system, and we made significant progress on our regulated renewables opportunity in 2021. Our plan is to reduce carbon emissions by 80% by 2030 and achieve net 0 by 2050 is well underway. The 998-megawatt Traverse project, the largest single wind farm built at one time in North America is in the final stages of commissioning, and we expect the facility to go on launch soon. The combined investment in the Traverse project along with Maverick and Sundance, which both became operational in 2021 represent investment in renewable energy of approximately $2 billion and will save PSO and SWEPCO customers in Arkansas, Louisiana and Oklahoma an estimated $3 billion in electricity costs over the next 30 years. These three projects add 1,484 megawatts of regulated renewable energy to our portfolio, and we recently issued RFPs for renewable resources for 1.1 gigawatts at APCo and 1.3 gigawatts at I&M. We expect to make regulatory filings and obtain the necessary approvals for projects selected from RFP processes at APCo, I&M, PSO and SWEPCO. We are truly transforming the energy grid to better integrate renewable resources, delivering the low-cost, reliable energy that our customers rely on while simultaneously empowering positive social, economic and environmental change in the communities we serve, and we believe we can successfully enhance shareholder returns in the process. Finally and significantly, I'd like to speak to a few developments that highlight the economic vitality and prospects of the communities we serve. Our economic development team has been focusing on working collaboratively with our states to drive expansion within our service territory. As you know, in January, Intel announced plans to build 2 new leading-edge chip manufacturing facilities in Ohio for an initial investment of more than $20 billion. Over in West Virginia, Nucor announced in January they will build its new $2.7 billion state of the art facility in Mason County, West Virginia. Further, TAT Technologies will be moving its thermal components activities from Israel to Tulsa bringing 900 jobs to the region. In total, our economic development team reported 1,900 megawatts of new load, supporting over 20,000 new jobs announced in 2021 and thus far in 2022. As evidenced by these wins, we are proud to play a vital part in the infrastructure that enables job-creating projects of this kind in our service territories. Moreover, in today's environment, especially in today's environment, as companies in our country focus on energy and supply chain security, our service territory is primed to benefit. We are committed to remaining a good steward for the communities in which we operate as we transition to a clean energy future. Through our just transition effort, we support affected communities through coal plants retirement, by providing job placement services for displaced workers, fact based replacement and funding sources to support diversification. This just transition program has been applied as a model for the country and enabling positive social and economic transitions for affected communities. As I said at the outset, we have a lot to look forward to in 2022. As we recast our capital allocation and derisk the business, we feel confident in lifting and tightening our earnings growth target range from 5% to 7% to 6% to 7%. It has always been my preference to be in the upper half of the 5% to 7% range. And since we have demonstrated a track record of being able to deliver on these projections year in and year out, we are electing to revise the range to 6% to 7%. Accordingly, we will be lifting our 2022 operating earnings guidance range by $0.02 to $4.87 to $5.07 per share, with a midpoint of $4.97 to reflect the increase in growth rate target range. Lastly, we are increasing our funds from operations to debt target to a range of 14% to 15% from 13.5% to 15%, which we mentioned at November EEI. Throughout this process and beyond, we will be committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet. We discussed this at November EEI and can confirm that our FFO to debt and credit metrics have improved markedly as we expected. Over the past decade, AEP has achieved impressive and sustained long-term growth, consistently meeting and exceeding earnings projections while continuing to raise guidance. Our highly qualified Board and management team are executing a strategic plan that leverages AEP's scale, financial strength, effective portfolio management and diversity of regulatory jurisdictions to deliver safe, clean and reliable services for our customers while creating significant value for all AEP shareholders. We are also committed to examining and looking beyond the traditional forms of equity to fund the growth going forward, and our track record since 2015 in asset sales have been active and produce accretive opportunities for our shareholders. Our transformation strategy is working, and the investments we are making will continue to support our solid earnings growth and results. AEP stands poised to make great headway in 2022. And continue to capitalize on this momentum. Our organic growth opportunities for the next decade and our consistent ability to execute against our plan, make it possible to set our sights high for this year and beyond. Before I hand things over to Julie, I just want to take a moment to acknowledge the unwavering commitment and dedication of our employees. In the midst of another storm-filled winter, our employees have continued to prioritize the safety and security of our customers across all of our jurisdictions with significant ice storms impacting most of our territory in the past few weeks. I have been truly humbled by their tireless efforts to deliver on our initiatives and provide for our communities. Ultimately, their passion for the work we do is what makes our business so extraordinary. With that, I'll turn things over to Julie, who is going to walk you through the financial results for the quarter. Julie?\nJulie Sloat: Thanks, Nick. Thank you very much. Thanks, Darcy. It's good to be with everyone this morning. Thanks for everyone - thanks, everyone, for dialing in. I'm going to walk us through the fourth quarter and full year results and then share some updates on our service territory load and then finish with some commentary on our financing plans, credit metrics and liquidity as well, some thoughts on our revised guidance, financial targets and portfolio management. So let's go to slide 10, which shows the comparison of GAAP to operating earnings for the quarter and year-to-date periods. GAAP earnings for the fourth quarter were $1.07 per share $0.88 per share in 2020. GAAP earnings for the year were $4.97 per share compared to $4.44 per share in 2020. There's a reconciliation of GAAP to operating earnings on Pages 17 and 18 of the presentation today. Let's walk through our quarterly operating earnings performance by segment, which is on Slide 11. Operating earnings for the fourth quarter totaled $0.98 per share or $496 million compared to $0.87 per share or $433 million in 2020. Operating earnings for the vertically integrated utilities were $0.39 per share, up $0.08. Favorable drivers included rate changes across multiple jurisdictions, increased transmission revenue and lower income tax. These items were somewhat offset by lower normalized growth and higher depreciation. I'll talk about load a little bit more here in a minute. The Transmission and Distribution Utilities segment earned $0.25 per share, up $0.06 compared to last year. Favorable drivers in this segment included rate changes, normalized load and transmission revenues. Offsetting these favorable items were unfavorable December weather and increased depreciation. The AEP Transmission Holdco segment continued to grow, contributing $0.33 per share, which was an improvement of $0.06 driven by the return on the investment growth. Generation and Marketing produced $0.06 per share, up $0.01 from last year, largely due to favorable income taxes, wholesale margins, offset by lower generation in land sales. Finally, Corporate and Other was down $0.10 per share, driven by lower investment gains and unfavorable income taxes. The lower investment gains are largely related to charge point gains that we had in the fourth quarter of last year. Let's have a look at our year-to-date results on Slide 12. Operating earnings for 2021 totaled $4.74 or $2.4 billion compared to $4.44 per share or $2.2 billion in 2020. Looking at the drivers by segment. Operating earnings for the vertically integrated utilities were $2.26 per share, up $0.05 due to rate changes across multiple or various operating companies, favorable weather and increased transmission revenue. Offsetting these favorable variances were higher O&M as we return to a more normal level of O&M, increased depreciation expense and lower normalized retail load primarily in the residential class. On the transmission and distribution utilities segment, they earned $1.10 per share, up $0.07 from last year. Earnings in this segment were up due to higher transmission revenue, rate changes and increased normalized retail load which is mainly in the residential and commercial classes. Offsetting these favorable variances were increases in O&M, depreciation and other taxes, essentially property taxes related to the increased investment levels. The AEP Transmission Holdco segment contributed $1.35 per share, up $0.32 from last year related to investment growth and a favorable year-over-year true-up. Generation and Marketing produced $0.26 per share, down $0.10 last - from last year, largely due to favorable onetime items in the prior year associated with the downward revision of the Oklaunion ARO liability in contemplation of the plant shut down and the sale of the Conesville plant. Additionally, while we had land sales in both years, the level of sales was lower in 2021 versus 2020. Finally, Corporate and Other was down $0.04 per share. You'll notice that we aren't talking about investment gains in the year-to-date as we had a lot of timing differences across the quarters between 2020 and 2021, but net-net, we're flat for the year. The year-over-year decline in this segment was primarily driven by slightly higher O&M, interest expense and income taxes. Let's go to slide 13 and I'll update you on our normalized load performance for the quarter. Let me begin by providing you with a couple of interesting stats that highlight the status of the recovery throughout the AEP service territory. The first is the fact that we ended the year within 0.2% of our pre-pandemic sales levels and fully expect to exceed those levels in 2022. AEP's normalized load growth in 2021 was the strongest we've experienced in over a decade driven by the historic economic recovery throughout the service territory. And to build on that, our current projection suggests that 2022 will be the second strongest year for load growth over the past decade following behind 2021. So let's start in the upper left corner. Normalized residential sales were down 1.9% compared to the fourth quarter of 2020, bringing the annual decrease in residential sales in 2021 to 1.1%. The decline was spread across every operating company. However, the decline in residential sales in 2021 was largely driven by the comparison basis of 2020 when COVID restrictions were at their highest levels even though residential sales were down compared to 2020, they were still 2% above their pre-pandemic levels in 2019. In addition, residential customer accounts increased by 0.7% in 2021, which was the second strongest year for customer growth in over a decade. Customer growth was nearly twice as strong in the West, up 0.9% when compared to the East territory, which was up 0.5%. The last item to point out on the residential chart is that you'll notice that we added the projected 2022 growth to the right of the chart. We're projecting a modest decrease in residential sales in 2022, recognizing that there will not be likely another fiscal stimulus to boost the economy in 2022, like we had in the past 2 years. So moving over to the right, weather normalized commercial sales increased by 4.3% for both the quarter and the annual comparison. This made 2021 the strongest year for commercial sales in AEP history. 2021 included a strong bounce back in the sectors most impacted by the pandemic, such as schools, churches and hotels. But the strongest growth in commercial sales came from the growth in data centers, especially in Central Ohio. Looking forward, we expect a modest decline in commercial sales growth in 2022, recognizing the challenging conditions businesses are managing with inflation, the labor shortages and higher interest rates expected in 2022. So if we move to the lower left corner, you'll see that the industrial sales also posted a very strong quarter. Industrial sales for the quarter increased by 2.4%, bringing the annual growth up to 3.7%. Industrial sales were up at most operating companies in the quarter and mainly - in many of the largest sectors. Looking forward, we're projecting 5.7% growth in the industrial sales in 2022. This is mostly the result of the number of new large customer expansions that will be coming online as a result of our continued focus on economic development. Finally, when you pull it all together in the lower right corner, you'll see that AEP's normalized retail sales increased by 1.4% for the quarter and ended the year up 2.1% above 2020 levels. By all indications, the recovery from the pandemic has locked a year and our service territory is positioned to benefit from the future economic growth. Let's have a quick look at the company's capitalization and liquidity position beginning on Page 14. On a GAAP basis, our debt-to-capital ratio increased 0.1% from the prior quarter to 62.1%. When adjusted for the Storm Uri event, the ratio is slightly lower than it was at year-end 2020 and now stands at 61.4%. Let's talk about our FFO to debt metric. The impact of Storm Uri continues to have a temporary and noticeable impact on this metric. Taking a look at the upper right quadrant of this page, you'll see our FFO to debt metric based on the traditional Moody's and GAAP calculated basis as well as on an adjusted Moody's and GAAP calculated basis. On an unadjusted Moody's basis, our FFO to debt ratio decreased by 0.3% during the quarter to 9.9%. As you know, the rating agencies continue to take the anticipated recovery into consideration as it relates to our credit rating. On an adjusted basis, the Moody's FFO to debt metric is 13.3%. As mentioned in prior calls, this 13.3% figure removes or adjusts the calculation to eliminate the impact of approximately $1.2 billion of cash outflows associated with covering the unplanned Uri-driven fuel and purchase power costs in the SPP region directly impacting PSO and SWEPCO in particular. The metric is also adjusted to remove the effect of the associated debt we used to fund the unplanned payments. This should give you a sense of where we are or where we would be from a business as usual perspective. As Nick mentioned, we're now targeting an FFO to debt metric in the 14% to 15% range, which is commensurate with the Baa2, BBB flat stable rating. We expect to see this metric to begin to trend toward this new range of 14% to 15% in the latter half of 2022 as we make progress on the regulatory matters that are underway, including the recovery of Uri costs. As you know, we're in frequent contact with the rating agencies to keep them apprised of all aspects of our business and in the presentation today on Page 48, you'll see our financing plan. And aside from some modifications around the capital allocation and refinements on cash flows, everything remains intact as well as the general gist of the financing plan, including equity. Let's quickly visit our liquidity summary on the lower right side of this slide. Between our bank revolver capacity and cash balance, our liquidity position remains strong at $4 billion. And in the lower left, you can see our qualified pension funding continues to be strong, increasing 1.2% during the quarter to 104.8%. So let's go to slide 15. The initiatives that we talked about today set a strong foundation for 2022 and beyond, all of which I would submit to you include a commitment to a boost in our earnings power, credit position and high grading of our asset portfolio while derisking and simplifying our business profile. So to quickly recap of particular interest to our investor community, our equity investor community, we are lifting and tightening our long-term earnings growth rate to 6% to 7%. Consequently, we're increasing our 2022 earnings guidance range to $4.87 to $5.07 per share, up $0.02 from the original guidance. Of particular interest to our fixed income lender and credit rating agency community in addition to our equity investors, we're lifting and tightening our FFO to debt target range to 14% to 15%, which is consistent with a Baa2 stable and BBB flat stable rating. And of interest to all of our financial stakeholders, we are committed to the active management, high-grading and simplification of our asset portfolio to support our growth and transition to a clean energy future as a regulated utility holding company. The sale of our Kentucky operations is on track to close in the second quarter of this year and is reflected in our earnings guidance assumptions for 2022. And as we announced today, we've eliminated the growth capital in the contracted renewables area, moved that capital transmission and announced the sale process of all or a portion of the unregulated contract renewable portfolio with the goal of maximizing value. We've already begun to reflect a portion of this asset rotation in our 5-year $38 billion CapEx guidance as evidenced by the $1.5 billion increase in transmission investment and the $1.3 billion reduction in the unregulated generation and marketing segment. While the reallocation of capital is now assumed in the guidance range we have updated for you, the utilization of sales proceeds is not yet reflected in the multiyear financing plan. And therefore, what you can anticipate hearing or seeing from us is that we will operate within the increased earnings growth and credit metric financial targets we provided to you today, working within those targets, funds from the sale activities will be directed to our regulated business as we continue our efforts to enhance the transmission infrastructure and to effectuate our generation transformation. Additionally, depending on the timing of the sale of our unregulated contract renewables portfolio or any future asset optimization activities, we will have a bias toward reducing and/or avoiding future equity needs. As you would expect, we'll update our guidance details once we have announcements so we can share with you. We're confident in our ability to deliver on our new and improved promises to you, given our focus on disciplined capital allocation, solid execution and positive regulatory outcomes. We really appreciate your time today. I'm going to hand it back to the operator now so we can get your questions.\nOperator: Thank you.  Our first question, we'll go to the line of Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. And your line is open.\nSteve Fleishman: Hey, good morning. Can you hear me okay, Nick?\nNick Akins: Yes. I can hear you fine.\nSteve Fleishman: Okay. Great, thanks. Just on the renewables assets that you're selling, could you give us maybe a little info if you have it, maybe for 2021 actuals, even just the earnings or the EBITDA, cash flow of those - that business, those assets?\nNick Akins: Yes. And it's around $0.15.\nJulie Sloat: Yes, Steve, this is Julie. I'll jump in here with some financial details, and I know Nick will jump in with some additional color. Let me talk about how we're thinking about this for 2022 because, as you know, 2021 was a bit of an anomaly with Storm Uri. So that kind of led to some different earnings streams that probably are not indicative of the asset base. So for 2022, what we're thinking is - and there's a little bit of wiggle room in here, talk about mid-teens in terms of sense, in terms of contribution to 2022 earnings. So if you want to kind of put a band around it, I don't know, $0.13 to $0.17 associated with those assets in particular, that gives you a little order of magnitude there.\nSteve Fleishman: That's helpful. And do you have a sense of kind of EBITDA?\nJulie Sloat: I don't have something to share with you today. And as you know, the renewable portfolio in terms of contracted assets is comprised of about, what, 1,600 megawatts of capacity, and that obviously varies from project to project. And as we said in our opening comments, we would be looking to monetize a portion or all of that over a period of time. So obviously, that will vary by asset and in projects specifically. So that's the only reason I'm being a little opaque on the EBITDA statistics.\nNick Akins: And you'll see some sales occur probably in 2022 and then more in 2023.\nSteve Fleishman: Okay. Okay. That's helpful. And then the - can you just - one last financial question on that. Can you just remind me what the -- if there's any debt directly on those assets or not?\nJulie Sloat: Yes. Steve, again, this is Julie. There is a project specific debt, and there's a tax equity on obligation component to it as well. So as of 12/31/21, the debt component was around $252 million, tax equity about $123 million. So all in, you're talking about $375 million.\nSteve Fleishman: That's super helpful. Thanks. And then one other question, I'll leave it to others, please. Just the - curious just on the renewables, there's been a lot of cost inflation pressure on renewables. Obviously, there's inflation pressure on conventional as well, maybe even more. But just how are you feeling about kind of managing that within your RFPs and still showing that economically, this makes sense for your key states?\nNick Akins: Yes. We actually feel good about it because with Traverse coming online, that's really the last major physical addition for this year. And then most of the renewables that are being applied for are in that '24 and '25 range. So you still have time for supply chain to pick up and certainly from a pricing perspective to be able to adjust. So we feel really good about our position because we're not in the middle of something where we're having to adjust. And then -- so that's - we're in a good position going forward.\nSteve Fleishman: Great. That\u2019s helpful. Congrats on the announcements.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. And your line is open.\nShar Pourreza: Good morning, guys. Just one - Nick, you went kind of fast through the 1 point in the prepared remarks. But I guess, can you elaborate again, how you're thinking about additional asset optimization opportunities should the IRPs at the various states kind of work in your favor? I mean, I guess, strategics, privates infrastructure seem to continue to want to pay up for assets. which we're obviously again seeing this morning. Did I hear you right that the message is, is that as you're thinking about incremental capital opportunities to fund the renewables through the IRPs that issuing traditional equity as a last resort.\nNick Akins: Yes. And actually, and I've said this, we're - we have two pinnacles of growth. We've got the transmission side, which we have plenty of capability relative to project flow to be able to check and adjust along the way. It's huge. And then, of course, on the renewable side of things, we have approximately in there about 50% estimate for ownership, which is sort of a view going into it. But I can say that because of after Storm Uri, after many of the effects in terms of utility ownership, we believe that ownership level is going to be higher than that. Matter of fact, in the Virginia side, it looks like 75% of it is owned and the other filings we're making is primarily 100% owned. So - and that really says to us that you're seeing a continual progression of really the standard view of portfolio management going forward. I think you're in the age of that and asset optimization to ensure that we're putting our capital in the right places. And that says there's a prioritization scheme as we go forward. Now I can't say today what that prioritization scheme looks like. But certainly, Kentucky was an example of that. First, it was the unregulated generation. Before that, it was the - I guess it was the barge line facilities. And you're seeing that step toward clarification, simplification and making sure that we are optimizing the capital in the right places. And today, we have, as I said earlier, the transmission in particular, we will not give up our position as being the largest transmission provider in this country by far. We have the bandwidth. We have the ability to move projects forward. And then on the renewable side, we're at the leading front edge of a major transformation that's going to benefit our ability to not only help in terms of customer rates because the renewables being brought in, but also to be able to deploy the capital necessary to make that happen. So you're going to see a continual process of moving forward with those kinds of activities. And the fact of the matter is, our renewables are now focused on capacity replacements, and so that's a natural progression of what occurs within the regulated framework. And for us, it puts us in great shape to make sure that these projects are actually needed. They actually produce benefits for consumers, and we have the backup capacity to provide for the demand periods. We're in a great position for this transformation. That's why we want to take advantage of it. So for those jurisdictions that meet those areas where transmission, the ability to participate in the clean energy transformation, those will be the high priority assets that we look at going forward.\nShar Pourreza: Okay. Perfect. That's helpful. And then Nick, just lastly on the growth rate ticking up to 6 7%. On one hand, it's consistent with your past comments about being in the top half of the trajectory. But on the other hand, you are basically telling the market, you don't see any situations where you see growth at 5%, right, which is great. As we think about sort of your wind and solar opportunity set through '26, which hasn't really changed from prior disclosures. How do we think about these in the context of your updated growth trajectory? Could they be accretive or simply extend the runway? And then are you assuming any sort of win assumptions in that updated growth guidance? Thank you.\nNick Akins: Yes. The way it sits right now, we look for sustainability when we make these adjustments associated with the growth rate, particularly the long-term growth rate. We would not have made this long-term growth rate if we didn't see a solid progression of the sustainability of the 6% to 7%. And actually, the project flow that you're seeing the - certainly, the reallocation of capital and actually - this is sort of an aside, but certainly, when we go from contracted renewables to the migration to a full suite of regulated renewables, it's -- we want to keep the talent that we have too, to make that transition and really focus on that effort. So I would say that the fundamentals are in place for continued optimization, solidification of 6% to 7%, validation of a midpoint that's higher than our previous midpoint and confirms to investors that we feel really good about the position that we're in. And as we go along, we'll see what happens, but we always look at -- when we make guidance changes and long-term growth changes, we look at the sustainability of that for years to come because consistency and quality of earnings and dividend are paramount to us.\nShar Pourreza: Terrific. Congrats, guys. Thank you very much.\nNick Akins: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeremy Tonet JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nJeremy Tonet: Hi, good morning.\nNick Akins: Morning, Jeremy.\nJeremy Tonet: Just wanted to bring a finer point to the equity question, if I could. It seems like the asset sale timing could be kind of in pieces here. I'm just wondering, does this line up where really kind of completely removes equity from the plan at this point? Just trying to get a finer point on what equity needs could look like post a successful sale here?\nNick Akins: Yes. I think it would be great if we could map it exactly to what the equity needs are in the future. But I can say that certainly, this is a big part of our ability to manage the portfolio so that we obviate the need for new equity, but you still have ATMs, you still have the convertibles that are coming on during that period of time. But at this point, we sit really good. I don't know if you want to go...\nJulie Sloat: Yes. So Jeremy, you're right on. In an ideal situation, we would like to pick the landing on every equity issuance and be able to kind of sidestep that and have a really strong balance sheet in conjunction with that. We'll see how ultimately the timing goes, as I mentioned in my opening comments, there will be a bias toward trying to alleviate that pressure that you might otherwise perceive around equity issuances. But as you know, if you look at our financing plan, there's not a lot out there, $100 million of DRIP in 2023. And as Nick mentioned, we've got the convertibles that convert this year and next year. So we're in good shape. But to the extent that we can maximize value of asset sales and time those, yes, that would be definitely something we'd be interested in doing. But again, the idea is to hit on all of those objectives. 6% to 7% earnings growth hit nicely and comfortably in the guidance range that we give to you for 2022. And make sure that we're right alongside with the solid balance sheet metrics of 14% to 15% for that FFO to debt statistic. So we'll thread the needle.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. That's very helpful there. And I just want to come back to bending the curve if you could on O&M. And just updated thoughts there on, I guess, how you see that progressing in this kind of inflationary environment? Any incremental thoughts you could share there?\nNick Akins: Yes. So - and obviously, we're taking a good hard look at that. Our achieving excellence program has been in place for a couple 3 years now. And it's really showing the value of our organization completely going through. And actually, it should be known, one of the silver linings of COVID if there is a silver lining of COVID is that made us think about what was truly needed for the company going forward, particularly when you made all these adjustments to compensate for what we thought would be a really negative approach to the economy during that period. So we're going to take those learnings and continue to focus on bending the O&M curve. And of course, that becomes even more of a challenge given labor rates, given certainly if there is supply chain-related activities on the long term. But we feel really confident in our ability to continue to bend that curve or at least hold it flat, but we'll certainly continue to focus on that. And that's a huge part of what we're doing because all these pieces sort of fit together where every dollar of O&M we're able to put $7 of capital in place with the reduction. So we have the focus on reducing the O&M as much as possible, and it's advantageous to us because we have a huge pipeline of additional capital opportunities that we could take advantage of for the betterment of customer service and so forth. And it's all sort of ties together. The load forecast has clearly been positive recently, and it looks like it's going to continue to be positive. That's good for cash flow and good for our ability to invest. And then certainly, all those things sort of fit together, but we'll continue to focus in on all of those activities going forward.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. That\u2019s very helpful. Leave it there, thanks.\nNick Akins: Yeah.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey, good morning, team. Thanks for the time. If I could follow up a little bit on the last couple of questions here. Just to the extent which that you're successful in, shall we say, fully offsetting equity here, where does that put you again? I know you're taking the moment now to raise your guidance ranges. But how do you think about being within that range to the context that you removed this equity as well? It would seem like this is a likely fairly accretive move to divest renewables given where the transaction multiples have been.\nNick Akins: Yes. Obviously, we're going to have to get in that process and understand what the actual benefits are. And of course, you're dealing with PTCs, ITCs, the value of those, the timing of those kinds of activities as well. And so we're going to have to sort of fill our way through that part of it. But certainly, the stage is set. And -- there's some -- and we're looking at somewhat of a phased approach, which that not only matches the equity needs, but also matches the business valuation itself. And I think that that's going to be a clear issue for us to focus on as we go forward. But Julie, anything you want to add?\nJulie Sloat: No, I think you're hitting on it. I mean the other thing that we'll make sure that we're sensitive to Julien is obviously, customer rate is always sensitive to that. But to Nick's point, this allows us to set the runway, again, gives us confidence in the boost to the growth rate of 6% to 7% for the obvious reasons. And then the objective is to, again, maintain the balance sheet, continue to derisk and simplify the business portfolio and make sure that we're hitting comfortably in the guidance range that we give to you as we give that to you sequentially. Every year, we come out with a new guidance range for the upcoming year, and we'll continue to fine-tune that.\nNick Akins: The ability that we have to accelerate and deaccelerate is of tremendous value. And certainly from the contracted renewables process that we go through, that's going to be a benefit. Our ability to accelerate and deaccelerate, whether it's transmission, whether it's renewables, those are clear options that we have available to us that we didn't have before. And when you think about the progress that we're going to make and the ability to focus on even continuing to advance the capital needs. That's something that all these things are going to have to come together, but I can tell you that the foundation and the clear optimism around that continues to benefit us. And it will be a process, and that's why I mentioned the Analyst Day. I think it's going to be important in the Analyst Day for us to not only obviously celebrate the sale of Kentucky, but also to focus in on what the transactions are going to look like, what the structure of these deals are going to look like, the timing and be able to also talk about what capital looks like in the future based on what we're seeing relative to load and everything else.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: And if I can, just one more quick one. I mean, why now is maybe the question, right? I mean I appreciate the guidance rates altogether, but just curious on the timing. Obviously, you all make sort of an annual update of EEI, you talked about in Analyst Day, prospectively. Just curious on what gave you the confidence now. I mean appreciative of the asset sale.\nNick Akins: No, thanks for the question because at November EEI, there was a lot still outstanding. We had 10 cases going on out there. I know we got a lot of questions about, okay, why has it taken so long in Ohio? Is your relationship? What's it like in Ohio? And it was like 2 weeks after that, that we got both cases done and they were clean orders. And our relationship is great with the regulators in Ohio and with legislature. So it was -- and then you had all the other cases that were still outstanding that came through I&M on Rockport. Certainly, there was a PSO base case that was done right at the end of the year. So you had all these things going on. But the other thing too is Kentucky transaction is still ongoing. And the process -- and it's -- like I said, it started with unregulated generation and certainly everything we knew before and that we need to solidify the consistency of our earnings going forward. Well, Kentucky was the first of the primary business units that we really took a look at. And now that, that process is ongoing, okay, what's the next step in our evolution? And when you think about those 2 pinnacles of growth, everything that we're going to be doing supports that ability to move that forward. We know -- and it wasn't lost on us that during November EEI when we reduced the transmission investment, there was an unintended message that, that somehow the transmission pipeline was ending or there were challenges associated with projects, and that was not the case. I mean we said that then, and we continue to fortify that measure. I think it was important for us to come out at this earnings call and set the record straight on what the firmness of the foundation of this company and its ability to move forward in a very, very positive way. And I just -- I wasn't going to let November EEI stand.\nJulie Sloat: I can jump in another statistic that might be helpful to Julien as well. So when we look back at 2021, the rate relief we had assumed in guidance was something like $230 million as we got and then closed in on the end of the year, we had already secured something like 112% of that. So we were over what we had anticipated. So that gave us some momentum. And looking at 2022, so there's an updated 2022 waterfall for guidance in the presentation today that's got the actualization for 2021 and then some refinements for 2022 in conjunction with the growth rate uplift. But we're assuming about $381 million of rate relief. And this is before the Indiana settlement that was approved yesterday. We had already secured 55% of that. So we're north of 55%. I need to go back and do the math to boost that number up to accommodate the order that we got for Indiana. But again, validating and giving us confidence that now is the time to do this obviously, came in with a strong year in 2021, giving us the momentum and assurance around those regulatory recoveries that we had anticipated and a little bit more. So that's to give you a little bit of statistics to match what Nick just shared with you.\nNick Akins: Yes. And as I said at the beginning of the call, this process is not over. I mean we are continuing the process of really fine-tuning the optimization around all of our assets. And certainly, from a resource perspective to be able to take the contracted renewables and the talent that's there and be able to migrate that over to a massive build-out associated with regulated renewables is a great opportunity for us and certainly everyone involved with it because this process is going to continue. And certainly, we want to register that we will and have been a participant in that process. But the why now question is important. I mean the why now question is that we're at the precipice and I sort of presage this, I guess it was third quarter last year, but we're at the precipice of substantial movement toward a clean energy economy. You can do it with the transformation of renewables, you can do it with -- certainly with other types of technologies that are developing, but it also requires transmission. And certainly, just the refurbishment of transmission and distribution, by the way, we have a huge pipeline relative to distribution, too, that's been identified. That's really -- all of those are opportunities for us to focus in on what's truly important to our customers, but also to our shareholders.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nDurgesh Chopra: Just Julie, quickly to follow-up on the economics of the potential renewable sale. Should we be expecting a tax leakage there? Or you have enough NOLs and other tax to offset that?\nJulie Sloat: Yes. Yes. We would expect a little tax leakage there. But as you know, we're not entirely efficient with our tax credits. So we've got a little bit of wiggle room because we've got some tax credits sitting on the bench. So I wouldn't necessarily look to that being as a stumbling block or a material gating item for us. So we'll be able to manage through that.\nDurgesh Chopra: Okay. And just one, all the other questions were asked and answered. Just one, Nick, what's the confidence level in getting sort of the Kentucky sale done in Q2? We sort of saw the headlines of you sort of kind of withdrawing the petition from on the plants. So maybe just talk to that, what drove that decision of withdrawing that petition and the confidence level of closing that transaction in Q2.\nNick Akins: Yes, sure thing. Well, obviously, the state of Kentucky was concerned about the FERC case and the timing of it and how it would impact their schedule. So certainly, we recognize that and wanted to accommodate the Kentucky Commission. So we pulled down the FERC filing, and we'll certainly refile the FERC filing after Kentucky does their review. And of course, with the state approvals at that particular time, we may get a quicker response from FERC. So -- and that's -- I think they have 60 days, but it could happen earlier than that. But still, that keeps us in the second quarter. It'd be May to June time frame, but still in the second quarter. So that's not an issue for us. And I know that -- there's certainly a lot of dialogue will occur. It already has relative to Mitchell and how it works and then also in terms of what interveners may think about the transaction, but that's a typical -- any time you get into a sale of in a transaction. That kind of thing will occur and there'll be discussions and we'll get it all resolved. So we're still very confident that we're going to get that done because actually, the new owner has made commitments of jobs and those types of activities within the state of Kentucky. And I think it's really important for anyone looking at this transaction to recognize that you're putting this utility in the hands of a reputable operator. They'll do a good job managing the investments, but also a good job in the communities, and they're very focused on that. So really, the -- this process should be a forward-looking process, not a past process -- past-looking process. So I really think that that's going to carry the day.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Weisel with Scotiabank. Your line is open.\nAndrew Weisel: First question. Forgive me if I missed it, but the new 6% to 7% growth range, is that anchored off the midpoint of the new 2022 guidance? And am I right that 2022 guidance includes contributions from contracted renewables, but not from Kentucky?\nJulie Sloat: That's -- you've got that exactly right on all fronts, right on.\nNick Akins: Yes. It is 2022, new rebases.\nAndrew Weisel: Okay. Would there be a rebase assuming the contracted renewables business does get sold? In other words, would -- if I take 6.5% off the new 2022 midpoint, would I need to lower that after an asset sale?\nNick Akins: I think you should look at the contracted renewables is supporting the 6% to 7% with the base of '22.\nJulie Sloat: To add a finer point to that as well. To get right to the heart of your question, we do not expect to rebase our earnings when we take action on selling these assets in particular. And as we mentioned, it will take a little bit of an accordion feature to it in the sense that over time, these transactions will occur so we've got some flexibility there. And then with the redeployment of the cash coming in the door back to regulated utilities, so whether it's transmission or a combination of transmission and regulated renewables we feel confident that we'll be able to maintain the guidance ranges and continue along the trajectory.\nAndrew Weisel: Okay. Great. And that makes sense given you said it was about $0.15 of EPS versus $5 or so for the business overall. And then lastly, just to confirm, can you comment on dividends, given the change to the EPS growth outlook and the potential asset sales? How should we think about the dividend growth outlook from here?\nNick Akins: Yes. No change there. Dividends will be commensurate with the earnings growth.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Nick Campanella with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nNick Campanella: Just looking at the 14% to 15% of total debt on the funding slides. Just curious what the feedback then from the agencies and the potential to sell some of the nonregulated stuff and the fact that your business mix is increasing to more regulated earnings. Do you expect any change in your minimum thresholds here?\nJulie Sloat: Actually, we are having conversations. And as I mentioned earlier, we keep them apprised of all aspects of our business. So from a credit risk profile perspective, this should be viewed as a favorable step, again, as a commitment and continued twist towards traditional regulated portfolio of assets. So I can't speak for them as it relates to what those thresholds would be, but 14% to 15% is most definitely within the wicket as it relates to a solid and strong balance sheet, I would submit to you again, BAA2 stable, BBB flat, stable. That's where we expect to be with that 14% to 15%. And please do reach out to the credit rating agencies to make sure that they're armed with everything we know so that they can take care of you all.\nNick Campanella: Absolutely, absolutely. Yes. And then just regarding the sales forecast and your comments regarding economic growth. For this year, it seems like industrial is really driving overall consolidated weather normalized growth higher. Can you just kind of speak to what's baked into the long-term forecast here? And if we remain in a higher commodity price environment into '23, '24, how could that change things for AEP?\nNick Akins: We -- any long-term forecast, we tend to temper. We're actually getting in the process of a new forecast. But right now, we've estimated about 1% increase. And I think you'll see that this -- what was overall 1.5 or something like that.\nJulie Sloat: 1.6%.\nNick Akins: Yes, 1.6%. So we're going into the year, assuming 1%. And with the investments being made by these large customers, industrial is always a leading edge relative to commercial and residential. So -- and then also when you look at the numbers, 1 year over another, it isn't quite apples and apples because of COVID and the impacts there. So you'll see a reduction in the residential. But if you look at pre COVID, it's more, it's higher because the stay-at-home environment has continued, work-from-home environment has continued. So we get the benefits of a more robust residential and at the same time, industrial picking up. And in fact, when you look at our service territory in relation to what's going on internationally, we do have strong energy growth and energy-related activities in our territories and manufacturing activities. And with onshoring around security, the point I was making earlier, we're going to wind up working pretty well from a growth perspective from a load standpoint.\nJulie Sloat: To give you a little more color if this is helpful. I'm on Page 13 of the slide presentation today, and I'm looking at the industrial quadrant in the lower left side of that slide. As you point out, we are looking at a 5% -- 5.7% uplift in that particular weather normalized load. And it's really driven by previous economic development activities. As Nick pointed out today, those economic development opportunities really set the foundation for the future. So we're reaping the benefits of stuff that we've done in the past as you look at that forecast and that covers many sectors, metals, chemicals, paper, oil and gas, but about 99% of the load expansion in 2022 comes from our T&D segment in Texas and Ohio. Just to give you a little bit more color. And then that obviously drives you over to the right side of the slide, looking at 2022 estimated across the entire Board a 1.6% lift is what we're assuming. And then as Nick mentioned, beyond to the extent that we can push it to 1% on an ongoing basis, that would be fantastic, and that would be our hope and expectation.\nOperator: We will go to the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Your line is open.\nPaul Patterson: Great -- great presentation. I'm sorry if I missed this, but is the -- I assume that there's probably going to be gains on the sale of renewables. Are those gains going to be part of the 6% to 7% growth?\nJulie Sloat: I guess let me ask or answer it this way. So we will have gains on the sales. And typically, when we have gains on sales of assets, capture those and the reconciliation gap to operating earnings, so we would kind of offset those. But asked another way or another question we got earlier, Paul, I don't know if you asked or heard this, but we were asked, would we be in a taxable gain situation. So I'll answer that question too. The answer would be yes. But we do have tax credits sitting on the bench that we'd be able to utilize against that. So what we don't want folks to do is worry about that being a real material gating item, we'd be able to manage through that.\nPaul Patterson: Yes, I heard that, I guess. So just to clarify, it's not going to be part of operating earnings or adjusted earnings going forward?\nJulie Sloat: Correct. That's correct. Yes. That will get captured in the reconciliation. Yes. you got it, not in operating earnings.\nPaul Patterson: Okay, great. And then just the -- and I apologize if I missed this, but the average length of the contracts that are on these assets? Are there different vintages and stuff? I'm just wondering where that sort of stands?\nJulie Sloat: Yes. average PPA length is around 11 years.\nPaul Patterson: Okay, right now. Okay. And then just finally, on the Kentucky Power, you guys talked about the Mitchell plant sale, but the Kentucky PSC, as you know, on Tuesday, filed a protest not at FERC, not on the transaction itself, but on the application for the transaction, saying they felt that they need more information. And I was just sort of -- I was wondering if you could provide a little clarity. I mean they have their own proceeding, as you guys know, and they have -- and there's obviously this proceeding. I'm talking about the M&A via the transaction proceeding at FERC. And I'm just sort of wondering why they are -- or if you can give any insight as to why -- as to this protest that they filed saying, hey, the application is deficient. We're concerned about rates and we want more information. And sort of what -- how that might unfold or how we should think about that in the context of the proceeding?\nNick Akins: Yes. Well, certainly, there's going to be all kinds of activity around getting the transaction through. And Kentucky, as I said earlier, I mean Kentucky is thoughtfully going through the areas that it wants to take a look at relative to the transaction. And certainly, that's something that we're going to make sure it happens in the process. And as I mentioned earlier on the FERC thing, we'll file FERC as soon as Kentucky gets through that. But at this point, though, there's nothing certainly, nothing that we can address. Do you have anything you want to add to that?\nJulie Sloat: No. that was fine.\nPaul Patterson: Well, I guess what I'm sort of asking is, is that I'm talking about specifically the Tuesday filing, not the Mitchell plant sales. So I mean, in other words, they were saying, hey, they want more information. It just seems to me that being a regulator that's going to be reviewing the actual transaction, it seems at least to me to be somewhat -- I was a little bit confused by the fact that they're saying to FERC hey, with respect to the transaction proceeding that docket, the EC dock is saying, hey, hold off, provide us more please. Please get them to give us more information when I would think that given that you guys filed this months ago, that information, they could be asking you within the context of the Kentucky review. Do you follow what I'm saying. I don't want to go into great, (inaudible) if you follow me, but that's what sort of seems to me to be a little bit strange about the FERC, the FERC request from Tuesday or we're not requesting the protest.\nNick Akins: Yes. So -- well, you had the intervenors that came in. And -- and they're really trying to adjudicate issues that were already resolved by the Kentucky Commission. And so we'll go through that process of discussions with them. As far as Kentucky is concerned, obviously, they're looking to try to hold customers harmless during the transaction and really, as we look at this transaction, they're in good shape going forward. So I think, obviously, we'll have those discussions as we go along.\nOperator: And with that, I'd like to turn it back over to the speakers for any closing comments.\nDarcy Reese: Thank you for joining us on today's call. As always, the IR team will be available to answer any additional questions you may have. Cynthia, would you please give the replay information?\nOperator: Certainly.

        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Nick Akins",
            "content": "Okay. Thanks, Darcy. Welcome, everyone, to American Electric Power's fourth quarter 2021 earnings call. I'm sure you all had time to read the earnings release and have seen all that we were able to accomplish in 2021. As we saw the results of several regulatory-related cases, it actually came in after the financial last November. AEP has come into 2022 flying high. The lyrics of a song by Lionel Richie and the Commodores actually the first concert or actually catered backstage when I was younger. Flying High says, I knew we could make it from the beginning. AEP has now moved from 4% to 6% to 5% to 7% to 6% to 7% long-term growth rate because of our purposeful steps to enhance growth opportunities and derisk the AEP portfolio. This process will continue. We so have so much to look forward to in 2022. But for the purpose of today's call, I'm going to start by providing a brief recap of our financial performance and then I want to talk about the evolution and the next steps we are taking in the execution of our business strategy, as well as the impact on our financing targets as we hone in on both our regulated generation transformation and our energy delivery infrastructure investments. These are continued refinements that we believe will not only allow us to better serve our customers, but will generate enhanced value for our investors as well. Finally, I will provide an update on the various strategic and regulatory initiatives that are already underway. Starting with the recap of financial highlights, we reported strong results for the fourth quarter, navigating difficult macro headwinds while maintaining our balance sheet and increasing our quarterly dividend. In fact, this quarter was our strongest ever fourth quarter, coming in above consensus estimates with fourth quarter GAAP earnings of $1.07 per share and operating earnings of $0.98 per share bringing our GAAP and operating earnings to $4.97 per share and $4.74 per share year-to-date, respectively. Our strong financial performance in the quarter generated regulated ROE of 9.2% with improved equity layers and enabled us to increase the quarter's dividend from $0.74 to $0.78 per share as announced in October of '21. Our performance rests firmly on the regulatory foundations laid this past year with a series of rate case activity across our jurisdictions. Since EEI, we've received constructive base case orders in Ohio and Oklahoma and we reached a settlement in Indiana that the commission approved yesterday and we anticipate shortly finalizing our other base rate cases in SWEPCO and PSO. Our management team continues to make significant headway in our strategic growth plan and transformation. In 2021, the comprehensive strategic review of our Kentucky operations resulted in an agreement to sell Kentucky Power and AEP Kentucky Transco for more than $2.8 billion. After receiving the necessary regulatory approvals, we expect this sale to close in the second quarter of 2022, notwithstanding the recent withdrawal of our FERC-related - FERC filing related to the Mitchell operating agreement. The completion of this transaction is expected to net AEP approximately $1.45 billion in cash after taxes and transaction fees, proceeds we will use to invest in regulated renewables and transmission. AEP is building on a strong record of actively managing our portfolio to support our growth as we invest in a clean energy future while delivering increased returns to shareholders. An integral part of our long-term strategy is the prioritization of AEP's regulated investment opportunities and the optimization of our assets. To that end, today, we are announcing the elimination of growth capital allocated to the contracted renewables in our 2022 to 2026 forecast and our intent to ultimately sell all or a portion of our contracted renewables portfolio in our Generation & Marketing business segment to help fund our growing capital requirements in our regulated portfolio. In making this decision, our team carefully considered the renewable opportunities in the context of our competitive business, existing competition in the space, our ability to efficiently monetize the PTC's ITC tax credits as regulated opportunities come to fruition, the attention needed to manage the size of this business relative to our overall regulated business and the potential value this business represents to others who are committed to contracted renewable development and operations. We are fully confident that the sale of this portfolio will both simplify and derisk our business while allowing us to allocate proceeds and assign additional capital to our regulated business where we see a meaningful pipeline of investment opportunities to better serve our customers and participate in the energy transition. This shift in direction enables us to recalibrate our 2022 to 2026 capital plan shifting approximately $1.5 billion of investment capital to transmission and raising it to $14.4 billion of the $38 billion 5 year plan. The capital originally allocated to the unregulated generation in the marketing segment will drop from $1.7 billion of the $38 billion 5-year plan to $400 million. The remaining $400 million in the Generation & Marketing segment will be largely allocated to maintenance capital and distributed generation assets. Our investment opportunities remain dynamic. And AEP operating companies will continue to develop integrated resource plans and grid enhancement plans over the near and long term in collaboration with stakeholders. This process continues to make substantial progress as shown on slide 43 of the earnings deck. Overall, we are targeting wind additions of approximately 8.6 gigawatts of solar additions of approximately 6.6 gigawatts by 2030. For which we have allocated $8.2 billion in our current 5 year capital plan. This - the migration from contracted renewables to significant increases in regulated renewables will ensure that AEP maintains the talent and resources to execute this plan. The capital plan also includes $24.8 billion allocated to grid investments. With the changes discussed and the expected completion of the sale of Kentucky Power, we plan on an Analyst Day presentation soon after the sale is completed to further update on all of these important initiatives. Now shifting gears to our regulated renewables opportunity. AEP has a positive record of actively managing its portfolio to support the growth of the company as we invest in our regulated business and renewable generation to transform and build a cleaner, more modern energy system, and we made significant progress on our regulated renewables opportunity in 2021. Our plan is to reduce carbon emissions by 80% by 2030 and achieve net 0 by 2050 is well underway. The 998-megawatt Traverse project, the largest single wind farm built at one time in North America is in the final stages of commissioning, and we expect the facility to go on launch soon. The combined investment in the Traverse project along with Maverick and Sundance, which both became operational in 2021 represent investment in renewable energy of approximately $2 billion and will save PSO and SWEPCO customers in Arkansas, Louisiana and Oklahoma an estimated $3 billion in electricity costs over the next 30 years. These three projects add 1,484 megawatts of regulated renewable energy to our portfolio, and we recently issued RFPs for renewable resources for 1.1 gigawatts at APCo and 1.3 gigawatts at I&M. We expect to make regulatory filings and obtain the necessary approvals for projects selected from RFP processes at APCo, I&M, PSO and SWEPCO. We are truly transforming the energy grid to better integrate renewable resources, delivering the low-cost, reliable energy that our customers rely on while simultaneously empowering positive social, economic and environmental change in the communities we serve, and we believe we can successfully enhance shareholder returns in the process. Finally and significantly, I'd like to speak to a few developments that highlight the economic vitality and prospects of the communities we serve. Our economic development team has been focusing on working collaboratively with our states to drive expansion within our service territory. As you know, in January, Intel announced plans to build 2 new leading-edge chip manufacturing facilities in Ohio for an initial investment of more than $20 billion. Over in West Virginia, Nucor announced in January they will build its new $2.7 billion state of the art facility in Mason County, West Virginia. Further, TAT Technologies will be moving its thermal components activities from Israel to Tulsa bringing 900 jobs to the region. In total, our economic development team reported 1,900 megawatts of new load, supporting over 20,000 new jobs announced in 2021 and thus far in 2022. As evidenced by these wins, we are proud to play a vital part in the infrastructure that enables job-creating projects of this kind in our service territories. Moreover, in today's environment, especially in today's environment, as companies in our country focus on energy and supply chain security, our service territory is primed to benefit. We are committed to remaining a good steward for the communities in which we operate as we transition to a clean energy future. Through our just transition effort, we support affected communities through coal plants retirement, by providing job placement services for displaced workers, fact based replacement and funding sources to support diversification. This just transition program has been applied as a model for the country and enabling positive social and economic transitions for affected communities. As I said at the outset, we have a lot to look forward to in 2022. As we recast our capital allocation and derisk the business, we feel confident in lifting and tightening our earnings growth target range from 5% to 7% to 6% to 7%. It has always been my preference to be in the upper half of the 5% to 7% range. And since we have demonstrated a track record of being able to deliver on these projections year in and year out, we are electing to revise the range to 6% to 7%. Accordingly, we will be lifting our 2022 operating earnings guidance range by $0.02 to $4.87 to $5.07 per share, with a midpoint of $4.97 to reflect the increase in growth rate target range. Lastly, we are increasing our funds from operations to debt target to a range of 14% to 15% from 13.5% to 15%, which we mentioned at November EEI. Throughout this process and beyond, we will be committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet. We discussed this at November EEI and can confirm that our FFO to debt and credit metrics have improved markedly as we expected. Over the past decade, AEP has achieved impressive and sustained long-term growth, consistently meeting and exceeding earnings projections while continuing to raise guidance. Our highly qualified Board and management team are executing a strategic plan that leverages AEP's scale, financial strength, effective portfolio management and diversity of regulatory jurisdictions to deliver safe, clean and reliable services for our customers while creating significant value for all AEP shareholders. We are also committed to examining and looking beyond the traditional forms of equity to fund the growth going forward, and our track record since 2015 in asset sales have been active and produce accretive opportunities for our shareholders. Our transformation strategy is working, and the investments we are making will continue to support our solid earnings growth and results. AEP stands poised to make great headway in 2022. And continue to capitalize on this momentum. Our organic growth opportunities for the next decade and our consistent ability to execute against our plan, make it possible to set our sights high for this year and beyond. Before I hand things over to Julie, I just want to take a moment to acknowledge the unwavering commitment and dedication of our employees. In the midst of another storm-filled winter, our employees have continued to prioritize the safety and security of our customers across all of our jurisdictions with significant ice storms impacting most of our territory in the past few weeks. I have been truly humbled by their tireless efforts to deliver on our initiatives and provide for our communities. Ultimately, their passion for the work we do is what makes our business so extraordinary. With that, I'll turn things over to Julie, who is going to walk you through the financial results for the quarter. Julie? Yes. I can hear you fine. Yes. And it's around $0.15. And you'll see some sales occur probably in 2022 and then more in 2023. Yes. We actually feel good about it because with Traverse coming online, that's really the last major physical addition for this year. And then most of the renewables that are being applied for are in that '24 and '25 range. So you still have time for supply chain to pick up and certainly from a pricing perspective to be able to adjust. So we feel really good about our position because we're not in the middle of something where we're having to adjust. And then -- so that's - we're in a good position going forward. Yes. And actually, and I've said this, we're - we have two pinnacles of growth. We've got the transmission side, which we have plenty of capability relative to project flow to be able to check and adjust along the way. It's huge. And then, of course, on the renewable side of things, we have approximately in there about 50% estimate for ownership, which is sort of a view going into it. But I can say that because of after Storm Uri, after many of the effects in terms of utility ownership, we believe that ownership level is going to be higher than that. Matter of fact, in the Virginia side, it looks like 75% of it is owned and the other filings we're making is primarily 100% owned. So - and that really says to us that you're seeing a continual progression of really the standard view of portfolio management going forward. I think you're in the age of that and asset optimization to ensure that we're putting our capital in the right places. And that says there's a prioritization scheme as we go forward. Now I can't say today what that prioritization scheme looks like. But certainly, Kentucky was an example of that. First, it was the unregulated generation. Before that, it was the - I guess it was the barge line facilities. And you're seeing that step toward clarification, simplification and making sure that we are optimizing the capital in the right places. And today, we have, as I said earlier, the transmission in particular, we will not give up our position as being the largest transmission provider in this country by far. We have the bandwidth. We have the ability to move projects forward. And then on the renewable side, we're at the leading front edge of a major transformation that's going to benefit our ability to not only help in terms of customer rates because the renewables being brought in, but also to be able to deploy the capital necessary to make that happen. So you're going to see a continual process of moving forward with those kinds of activities. And the fact of the matter is, our renewables are now focused on capacity replacements, and so that's a natural progression of what occurs within the regulated framework. And for us, it puts us in great shape to make sure that these projects are actually needed. They actually produce benefits for consumers, and we have the backup capacity to provide for the demand periods. We're in a great position for this transformation. That's why we want to take advantage of it. So for those jurisdictions that meet those areas where transmission, the ability to participate in the clean energy transformation, those will be the high priority assets that we look at going forward. Yes. The way it sits right now, we look for sustainability when we make these adjustments associated with the growth rate, particularly the long-term growth rate. We would not have made this long-term growth rate if we didn't see a solid progression of the sustainability of the 6% to 7%. And actually, the project flow that you're seeing the - certainly, the reallocation of capital and actually - this is sort of an aside, but certainly, when we go from contracted renewables to the migration to a full suite of regulated renewables, it's -- we want to keep the talent that we have too, to make that transition and really focus on that effort. So I would say that the fundamentals are in place for continued optimization, solidification of 6% to 7%, validation of a midpoint that's higher than our previous midpoint and confirms to investors that we feel really good about the position that we're in. And as we go along, we'll see what happens, but we always look at -- when we make guidance changes and long-term growth changes, we look at the sustainability of that for years to come because consistency and quality of earnings and dividend are paramount to us. Thanks. Morning, Jeremy. Yes. I think it would be great if we could map it exactly to what the equity needs are in the future. But I can say that certainly, this is a big part of our ability to manage the portfolio so that we obviate the need for new equity, but you still have ATMs, you still have the convertibles that are coming on during that period of time. But at this point, we sit really good. I don't know if you want to go... Yes. So - and obviously, we're taking a good hard look at that. Our achieving excellence program has been in place for a couple 3 years now. And it's really showing the value of our organization completely going through. And actually, it should be known, one of the silver linings of COVID if there is a silver lining of COVID is that made us think about what was truly needed for the company going forward, particularly when you made all these adjustments to compensate for what we thought would be a really negative approach to the economy during that period. So we're going to take those learnings and continue to focus on bending the O&M curve. And of course, that becomes even more of a challenge given labor rates, given certainly if there is supply chain-related activities on the long term. But we feel really confident in our ability to continue to bend that curve or at least hold it flat, but we'll certainly continue to focus on that. And that's a huge part of what we're doing because all these pieces sort of fit together where every dollar of O&M we're able to put $7 of capital in place with the reduction. So we have the focus on reducing the O&M as much as possible, and it's advantageous to us because we have a huge pipeline of additional capital opportunities that we could take advantage of for the betterment of customer service and so forth. And it's all sort of ties together. The load forecast has clearly been positive recently, and it looks like it's going to continue to be positive. That's good for cash flow and good for our ability to invest. And then certainly, all those things sort of fit together, but we'll continue to focus in on all of those activities going forward. Yeah. Yes. Obviously, we're going to have to get in that process and understand what the actual benefits are. And of course, you're dealing with PTCs, ITCs, the value of those, the timing of those kinds of activities as well. And so we're going to have to sort of fill our way through that part of it. But certainly, the stage is set. And -- there's some -- and we're looking at somewhat of a phased approach, which that not only matches the equity needs, but also matches the business valuation itself. And I think that that's going to be a clear issue for us to focus on as we go forward. But Julie, anything you want to add? The ability that we have to accelerate and deaccelerate is of tremendous value. And certainly from the contracted renewables process that we go through, that's going to be a benefit. Our ability to accelerate and deaccelerate, whether it's transmission, whether it's renewables, those are clear options that we have available to us that we didn't have before. And when you think about the progress that we're going to make and the ability to focus on even continuing to advance the capital needs. That's something that all these things are going to have to come together, but I can tell you that the foundation and the clear optimism around that continues to benefit us. And it will be a process, and that's why I mentioned the Analyst Day. I think it's going to be important in the Analyst Day for us to not only obviously celebrate the sale of Kentucky, but also to focus in on what the transactions are going to look like, what the structure of these deals are going to look like, the timing and be able to also talk about what capital looks like in the future based on what we're seeing relative to load and everything else. No, thanks for the question because at November EEI, there was a lot still outstanding. We had 10 cases going on out there. I know we got a lot of questions about, okay, why has it taken so long in Ohio? Is your relationship? What's it like in Ohio? And it was like 2 weeks after that, that we got both cases done and they were clean orders. And our relationship is great with the regulators in Ohio and with legislature. So it was -- and then you had all the other cases that were still outstanding that came through I&M on Rockport. Certainly, there was a PSO base case that was done right at the end of the year. So you had all these things going on. But the other thing too is Kentucky transaction is still ongoing. And the process -- and it's -- like I said, it started with unregulated generation and certainly everything we knew before and that we need to solidify the consistency of our earnings going forward. Well, Kentucky was the first of the primary business units that we really took a look at. And now that, that process is ongoing, okay, what's the next step in our evolution? And when you think about those 2 pinnacles of growth, everything that we're going to be doing supports that ability to move that forward. We know -- and it wasn't lost on us that during November EEI when we reduced the transmission investment, there was an unintended message that, that somehow the transmission pipeline was ending or there were challenges associated with projects, and that was not the case. I mean we said that then, and we continue to fortify that measure. I think it was important for us to come out at this earnings call and set the record straight on what the firmness of the foundation of this company and its ability to move forward in a very, very positive way. And I just -- I wasn't going to let November EEI stand. Yes. And as I said at the beginning of the call, this process is not over. I mean we are continuing the process of really fine-tuning the optimization around all of our assets. And certainly, from a resource perspective to be able to take the contracted renewables and the talent that's there and be able to migrate that over to a massive build-out associated with regulated renewables is a great opportunity for us and certainly everyone involved with it because this process is going to continue. And certainly, we want to register that we will and have been a participant in that process. But the why now question is important. I mean the why now question is that we're at the precipice and I sort of presage this, I guess it was third quarter last year, but we're at the precipice of substantial movement toward a clean energy economy. You can do it with the transformation of renewables, you can do it with -- certainly with other types of technologies that are developing, but it also requires transmission. And certainly, just the refurbishment of transmission and distribution, by the way, we have a huge pipeline relative to distribution, too, that's been identified. That's really -- all of those are opportunities for us to focus in on what's truly important to our customers, but also to our shareholders. Yes, sure thing. Well, obviously, the state of Kentucky was concerned about the FERC case and the timing of it and how it would impact their schedule. So certainly, we recognize that and wanted to accommodate the Kentucky Commission. So we pulled down the FERC filing, and we'll certainly refile the FERC filing after Kentucky does their review. And of course, with the state approvals at that particular time, we may get a quicker response from FERC. So -- and that's -- I think they have 60 days, but it could happen earlier than that. But still, that keeps us in the second quarter. It'd be May to June time frame, but still in the second quarter. So that's not an issue for us. And I know that -- there's certainly a lot of dialogue will occur. It already has relative to Mitchell and how it works and then also in terms of what interveners may think about the transaction, but that's a typical -- any time you get into a sale of in a transaction. That kind of thing will occur and there'll be discussions and we'll get it all resolved. So we're still very confident that we're going to get that done because actually, the new owner has made commitments of jobs and those types of activities within the state of Kentucky. And I think it's really important for anyone looking at this transaction to recognize that you're putting this utility in the hands of a reputable operator. They'll do a good job managing the investments, but also a good job in the communities, and they're very focused on that. So really, the -- this process should be a forward-looking process, not a past process -- past-looking process. So I really think that that's going to carry the day. Yes. It is 2022, new rebases. I think you should look at the contracted renewables is supporting the 6% to 7% with the base of '22. Yes. No change there. Dividends will be commensurate with the earnings growth. We -- any long-term forecast, we tend to temper. We're actually getting in the process of a new forecast. But right now, we've estimated about 1% increase. And I think you'll see that this -- what was overall 1.5 or something like that. Yes, 1.6%. So we're going into the year, assuming 1%. And with the investments being made by these large customers, industrial is always a leading edge relative to commercial and residential. So -- and then also when you look at the numbers, 1 year over another, it isn't quite apples and apples because of COVID and the impacts there. So you'll see a reduction in the residential. But if you look at pre COVID, it's more, it's higher because the stay-at-home environment has continued, work-from-home environment has continued. So we get the benefits of a more robust residential and at the same time, industrial picking up. And in fact, when you look at our service territory in relation to what's going on internationally, we do have strong energy growth and energy-related activities in our territories and manufacturing activities. And with onshoring around security, the point I was making earlier, we're going to wind up working pretty well from a growth perspective from a load standpoint. Yes. Well, certainly, there's going to be all kinds of activity around getting the transaction through. And Kentucky, as I said earlier, I mean Kentucky is thoughtfully going through the areas that it wants to take a look at relative to the transaction. And certainly, that's something that we're going to make sure it happens in the process. And as I mentioned earlier on the FERC thing, we'll file FERC as soon as Kentucky gets through that. But at this point, though, there's nothing certainly, nothing that we can address. Do you have anything you want to add to that? Yes. So -- well, you had the intervenors that came in. And -- and they're really trying to adjudicate issues that were already resolved by the Kentucky Commission. And so we'll go through that process of discussions with them. As far as Kentucky is concerned, obviously, they're looking to try to hold customers harmless during the transaction and really, as we look at this transaction, they're in good shape going forward. So I think, obviously, we'll have those discussions as we go along."

            "content": "Thanks, Nick. Thank you very much. Thanks, Darcy. It's good to be with everyone this morning. Thanks for everyone - thanks, everyone, for dialing in. I'm going to walk us through the fourth quarter and full year results and then share some updates on our service territory load and then finish with some commentary on our financing plans, credit metrics and liquidity as well, some thoughts on our revised guidance, financial targets and portfolio management. So let's go to slide 10, which shows the comparison of GAAP to operating earnings for the quarter and year-to-date periods. GAAP earnings for the fourth quarter were $1.07 per share $0.88 per share in 2020. GAAP earnings for the year were $4.97 per share compared to $4.44 per share in 2020. There's a reconciliation of GAAP to operating earnings on Pages 17 and 18 of the presentation today. Let's walk through our quarterly operating earnings performance by segment, which is on Slide 11. Operating earnings for the fourth quarter totaled $0.98 per share or $496 million compared to $0.87 per share or $433 million in 2020. Operating earnings for the vertically integrated utilities were $0.39 per share, up $0.08. Favorable drivers included rate changes across multiple jurisdictions, increased transmission revenue and lower income tax. These items were somewhat offset by lower normalized growth and higher depreciation. I'll talk about load a little bit more here in a minute. The Transmission and Distribution Utilities segment earned $0.25 per share, up $0.06 compared to last year. Favorable drivers in this segment included rate changes, normalized load and transmission revenues. Offsetting these favorable items were unfavorable December weather and increased depreciation. The AEP Transmission Holdco segment continued to grow, contributing $0.33 per share, which was an improvement of $0.06 driven by the return on the investment growth. Generation and Marketing produced $0.06 per share, up $0.01 from last year, largely due to favorable income taxes, wholesale margins, offset by lower generation in land sales. Finally, Corporate and Other was down $0.10 per share, driven by lower investment gains and unfavorable income taxes. The lower investment gains are largely related to charge point gains that we had in the fourth quarter of last year. Let's have a look at our year-to-date results on Slide 12. Operating earnings for 2021 totaled $4.74 or $2.4 billion compared to $4.44 per share or $2.2 billion in 2020. Looking at the drivers by segment. Operating earnings for the vertically integrated utilities were $2.26 per share, up $0.05 due to rate changes across multiple or various operating companies, favorable weather and increased transmission revenue. Offsetting these favorable variances were higher O&M as we return to a more normal level of O&M, increased depreciation expense and lower normalized retail load primarily in the residential class. On the transmission and distribution utilities segment, they earned $1.10 per share, up $0.07 from last year. Earnings in this segment were up due to higher transmission revenue, rate changes and increased normalized retail load which is mainly in the residential and commercial classes. Offsetting these favorable variances were increases in O&M, depreciation and other taxes, essentially property taxes related to the increased investment levels. The AEP Transmission Holdco segment contributed $1.35 per share, up $0.32 from last year related to investment growth and a favorable year-over-year true-up. Generation and Marketing produced $0.26 per share, down $0.10 last - from last year, largely due to favorable onetime items in the prior year associated with the downward revision of the Oklaunion ARO liability in contemplation of the plant shut down and the sale of the Conesville plant. Additionally, while we had land sales in both years, the level of sales was lower in 2021 versus 2020. Finally, Corporate and Other was down $0.04 per share. You'll notice that we aren't talking about investment gains in the year-to-date as we had a lot of timing differences across the quarters between 2020 and 2021, but net-net, we're flat for the year. The year-over-year decline in this segment was primarily driven by slightly higher O&M, interest expense and income taxes. Let's go to slide 13 and I'll update you on our normalized load performance for the quarter. Let me begin by providing you with a couple of interesting stats that highlight the status of the recovery throughout the AEP service territory. The first is the fact that we ended the year within 0.2% of our pre-pandemic sales levels and fully expect to exceed those levels in 2022. AEP's normalized load growth in 2021 was the strongest we've experienced in over a decade driven by the historic economic recovery throughout the service territory. And to build on that, our current projection suggests that 2022 will be the second strongest year for load growth over the past decade following behind 2021. So let's start in the upper left corner. Normalized residential sales were down 1.9% compared to the fourth quarter of 2020, bringing the annual decrease in residential sales in 2021 to 1.1%. The decline was spread across every operating company. However, the decline in residential sales in 2021 was largely driven by the comparison basis of 2020 when COVID restrictions were at their highest levels even though residential sales were down compared to 2020, they were still 2% above their pre-pandemic levels in 2019. In addition, residential customer accounts increased by 0.7% in 2021, which was the second strongest year for customer growth in over a decade. Customer growth was nearly twice as strong in the West, up 0.9% when compared to the East territory, which was up 0.5%. The last item to point out on the residential chart is that you'll notice that we added the projected 2022 growth to the right of the chart. We're projecting a modest decrease in residential sales in 2022, recognizing that there will not be likely another fiscal stimulus to boost the economy in 2022, like we had in the past 2 years. So moving over to the right, weather normalized commercial sales increased by 4.3% for both the quarter and the annual comparison. This made 2021 the strongest year for commercial sales in AEP history. 2021 included a strong bounce back in the sectors most impacted by the pandemic, such as schools, churches and hotels. But the strongest growth in commercial sales came from the growth in data centers, especially in Central Ohio. Looking forward, we expect a modest decline in commercial sales growth in 2022, recognizing the challenging conditions businesses are managing with inflation, the labor shortages and higher interest rates expected in 2022. So if we move to the lower left corner, you'll see that the industrial sales also posted a very strong quarter. Industrial sales for the quarter increased by 2.4%, bringing the annual growth up to 3.7%. Industrial sales were up at most operating companies in the quarter and mainly - in many of the largest sectors. Looking forward, we're projecting 5.7% growth in the industrial sales in 2022. This is mostly the result of the number of new large customer expansions that will be coming online as a result of our continued focus on economic development. Finally, when you pull it all together in the lower right corner, you'll see that AEP's normalized retail sales increased by 1.4% for the quarter and ended the year up 2.1% above 2020 levels. By all indications, the recovery from the pandemic has locked a year and our service territory is positioned to benefit from the future economic growth. Let's have a quick look at the company's capitalization and liquidity position beginning on Page 14. On a GAAP basis, our debt-to-capital ratio increased 0.1% from the prior quarter to 62.1%. When adjusted for the Storm Uri event, the ratio is slightly lower than it was at year-end 2020 and now stands at 61.4%. Let's talk about our FFO to debt metric. The impact of Storm Uri continues to have a temporary and noticeable impact on this metric. Taking a look at the upper right quadrant of this page, you'll see our FFO to debt metric based on the traditional Moody's and GAAP calculated basis as well as on an adjusted Moody's and GAAP calculated basis. On an unadjusted Moody's basis, our FFO to debt ratio decreased by 0.3% during the quarter to 9.9%. As you know, the rating agencies continue to take the anticipated recovery into consideration as it relates to our credit rating. On an adjusted basis, the Moody's FFO to debt metric is 13.3%. As mentioned in prior calls, this 13.3% figure removes or adjusts the calculation to eliminate the impact of approximately $1.2 billion of cash outflows associated with covering the unplanned Uri-driven fuel and purchase power costs in the SPP region directly impacting PSO and SWEPCO in particular. The metric is also adjusted to remove the effect of the associated debt we used to fund the unplanned payments. This should give you a sense of where we are or where we would be from a business as usual perspective. As Nick mentioned, we're now targeting an FFO to debt metric in the 14% to 15% range, which is commensurate with the Baa2, BBB flat stable rating. We expect to see this metric to begin to trend toward this new range of 14% to 15% in the latter half of 2022 as we make progress on the regulatory matters that are underway, including the recovery of Uri costs. As you know, we're in frequent contact with the rating agencies to keep them apprised of all aspects of our business and in the presentation today on Page 48, you'll see our financing plan. And aside from some modifications around the capital allocation and refinements on cash flows, everything remains intact as well as the general gist of the financing plan, including equity. Let's quickly visit our liquidity summary on the lower right side of this slide. Between our bank revolver capacity and cash balance, our liquidity position remains strong at $4 billion. And in the lower left, you can see our qualified pension funding continues to be strong, increasing 1.2% during the quarter to 104.8%. So let's go to slide 15. The initiatives that we talked about today set a strong foundation for 2022 and beyond, all of which I would submit to you include a commitment to a boost in our earnings power, credit position and high grading of our asset portfolio while derisking and simplifying our business profile. So to quickly recap of particular interest to our investor community, our equity investor community, we are lifting and tightening our long-term earnings growth rate to 6% to 7%. Consequently, we're increasing our 2022 earnings guidance range to $4.87 to $5.07 per share, up $0.02 from the original guidance. Of particular interest to our fixed income lender and credit rating agency community in addition to our equity investors, we're lifting and tightening our FFO to debt target range to 14% to 15%, which is consistent with a Baa2 stable and BBB flat stable rating. And of interest to all of our financial stakeholders, we are committed to the active management, high-grading and simplification of our asset portfolio to support our growth and transition to a clean energy future as a regulated utility holding company. The sale of our Kentucky operations is on track to close in the second quarter of this year and is reflected in our earnings guidance assumptions for 2022. And as we announced today, we've eliminated the growth capital in the contracted renewables area, moved that capital transmission and announced the sale process of all or a portion of the unregulated contract renewable portfolio with the goal of maximizing value. We've already begun to reflect a portion of this asset rotation in our 5-year $38 billion CapEx guidance as evidenced by the $1.5 billion increase in transmission investment and the $1.3 billion reduction in the unregulated generation and marketing segment. While the reallocation of capital is now assumed in the guidance range we have updated for you, the utilization of sales proceeds is not yet reflected in the multiyear financing plan. And therefore, what you can anticipate hearing or seeing from us is that we will operate within the increased earnings growth and credit metric financial targets we provided to you today, working within those targets, funds from the sale activities will be directed to our regulated business as we continue our efforts to enhance the transmission infrastructure and to effectuate our generation transformation. Additionally, depending on the timing of the sale of our unregulated contract renewables portfolio or any future asset optimization activities, we will have a bias toward reducing and/or avoiding future equity needs. As you would expect, we'll update our guidance details once we have announcements so we can share with you. We're confident in our ability to deliver on our new and improved promises to you, given our focus on disciplined capital allocation, solid execution and positive regulatory outcomes. We really appreciate your time today. I'm going to hand it back to the operator now so we can get your questions. Yes, Steve, this is Julie. I'll jump in here with some financial details, and I know Nick will jump in with some additional color. Let me talk about how we're thinking about this for 2022 because, as you know, 2021 was a bit of an anomaly with Storm Uri. So that kind of led to some different earnings streams that probably are not indicative of the asset base. So for 2022, what we're thinking is - and there's a little bit of wiggle room in here, talk about mid-teens in terms of sense, in terms of contribution to 2022 earnings. So if you want to kind of put a band around it, I don't know, $0.13 to $0.17 associated with those assets in particular, that gives you a little order of magnitude there. I don't have something to share with you today. And as you know, the renewable portfolio in terms of contracted assets is comprised of about, what, 1,600 megawatts of capacity, and that obviously varies from project to project. And as we said in our opening comments, we would be looking to monetize a portion or all of that over a period of time. So obviously, that will vary by asset and in projects specifically. So that's the only reason I'm being a little opaque on the EBITDA statistics. Yes. Steve, again, this is Julie. There is a project specific debt, and there's a tax equity on obligation component to it as well. So as of 12/31/21, the debt component was around $252 million, tax equity about $123 million. So all in, you're talking about $375 million. Yes. So Jeremy, you're right on. In an ideal situation, we would like to pick the landing on every equity issuance and be able to kind of sidestep that and have a really strong balance sheet in conjunction with that. We'll see how ultimately the timing goes, as I mentioned in my opening comments, there will be a bias toward trying to alleviate that pressure that you might otherwise perceive around equity issuances. But as you know, if you look at our financing plan, there's not a lot out there, $100 million of DRIP in 2023. And as Nick mentioned, we've got the convertibles that convert this year and next year. So we're in good shape. But to the extent that we can maximize value of asset sales and time those, yes, that would be definitely something we'd be interested in doing. But again, the idea is to hit on all of those objectives. 6% to 7% earnings growth hit nicely and comfortably in the guidance range that we give to you for 2022. And make sure that we're right alongside with the solid balance sheet metrics of 14% to 15% for that FFO to debt statistic. So we'll thread the needle. No, I think you're hitting on it. I mean the other thing that we'll make sure that we're sensitive to Julien is obviously, customer rate is always sensitive to that. But to Nick's point, this allows us to set the runway, again, gives us confidence in the boost to the growth rate of 6% to 7% for the obvious reasons. And then the objective is to, again, maintain the balance sheet, continue to derisk and simplify the business portfolio and make sure that we're hitting comfortably in the guidance range that we give to you as we give that to you sequentially. Every year, we come out with a new guidance range for the upcoming year, and we'll continue to fine-tune that. I can jump in another statistic that might be helpful to Julien as well. So when we look back at 2021, the rate relief we had assumed in guidance was something like $230 million as we got and then closed in on the end of the year, we had already secured something like 112% of that. So we were over what we had anticipated. So that gave us some momentum. And looking at 2022, so there's an updated 2022 waterfall for guidance in the presentation today that's got the actualization for 2021 and then some refinements for 2022 in conjunction with the growth rate uplift. But we're assuming about $381 million of rate relief. And this is before the Indiana settlement that was approved yesterday. We had already secured 55% of that. So we're north of 55%. I need to go back and do the math to boost that number up to accommodate the order that we got for Indiana. But again, validating and giving us confidence that now is the time to do this obviously, came in with a strong year in 2021, giving us the momentum and assurance around those regulatory recoveries that we had anticipated and a little bit more. So that's to give you a little bit of statistics to match what Nick just shared with you. Yes. Yes. We would expect a little tax leakage there. But as you know, we're not entirely efficient with our tax credits. So we've got a little bit of wiggle room because we've got some tax credits sitting on the bench. So I wouldn't necessarily look to that being as a stumbling block or a material gating item for us. So we'll be able to manage through that. That's -- you've got that exactly right on all fronts, right on. To add a finer point to that as well. To get right to the heart of your question, we do not expect to rebase our earnings when we take action on selling these assets in particular. And as we mentioned, it will take a little bit of an accordion feature to it in the sense that over time, these transactions will occur so we've got some flexibility there. And then with the redeployment of the cash coming in the door back to regulated utilities, so whether it's transmission or a combination of transmission and regulated renewables we feel confident that we'll be able to maintain the guidance ranges and continue along the trajectory. Actually, we are having conversations. And as I mentioned earlier, we keep them apprised of all aspects of our business. So from a credit risk profile perspective, this should be viewed as a favorable step, again, as a commitment and continued twist towards traditional regulated portfolio of assets. So I can't speak for them as it relates to what those thresholds would be, but 14% to 15% is most definitely within the wicket as it relates to a solid and strong balance sheet, I would submit to you again, BAA2 stable, BBB flat, stable. That's where we expect to be with that 14% to 15%. And please do reach out to the credit rating agencies to make sure that they're armed with everything we know so that they can take care of you all. 1.6%. To give you a little more color if this is helpful. I'm on Page 13 of the slide presentation today, and I'm looking at the industrial quadrant in the lower left side of that slide. As you point out, we are looking at a 5% -- 5.7% uplift in that particular weather normalized load. And it's really driven by previous economic development activities. As Nick pointed out today, those economic development opportunities really set the foundation for the future. So we're reaping the benefits of stuff that we've done in the past as you look at that forecast and that covers many sectors, metals, chemicals, paper, oil and gas, but about 99% of the load expansion in 2022 comes from our T&D segment in Texas and Ohio. Just to give you a little bit more color. And then that obviously drives you over to the right side of the slide, looking at 2022 estimated across the entire Board a 1.6% lift is what we're assuming. And then as Nick mentioned, beyond to the extent that we can push it to 1% on an ongoing basis, that would be fantastic, and that would be our hope and expectation. I guess let me ask or answer it this way. So we will have gains on the sales. And typically, when we have gains on sales of assets, capture those and the reconciliation gap to operating earnings, so we would kind of offset those. But asked another way or another question we got earlier, Paul, I don't know if you asked or heard this, but we were asked, would we be in a taxable gain situation. So I'll answer that question too. The answer would be yes. But we do have tax credits sitting on the bench that we'd be able to utilize against that. So what we don't want folks to do is worry about that being a real material gating item, we'd be able to manage through that. Correct. That's correct. Yes. That will get captured in the reconciliation. Yes. you got it, not in operating earnings. Yes. average PPA length is around 11 years. No. that was fine."

At this time, your telephone lines are in a listen-only mode. Later there will be an opportunity for questions and answers. If you would like to ask a question during the call,  You have an indication you've been placed into queue, and you will move yourself from the queue by repeating the one as we command.  Now as a reminder, your conference call today is being recorded. I will now turn the conference call over to your host, Vice President of Investor Relations, Darcy Reese. Go ahead please.\nDarcy Reese: Thank you, Allen. Good morning, everyone and welcome to the Third Quarter 2021 earnings call for American Electric Power. We appreciate you taking the time to join us today. Our earnings release, presentation slides and related financial information are available on our website at www. aep.com. Today we will be making Forward-looking statements during the call. There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements. Please refer to our SEC filings for a discussion of these factors. Joining me this morning for opening remarks are Nick Akins, our Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer and Julie Sloat our Chief Financial Officer. We will take your questions following their remarks. I will now turn the call over to Nick.\nNick Akins: Okay. Thanks, Darcy. Welcome again, everyone to American Electric Power's third quarter 2021 earnings call. Today we're pleased to report a strong third quarter operating earnings of a $1.43 per share for the third quarter, this brings our year-to-date operating earnings to 376 per share versus 356 per share last year, which gives us confidence in raising the midpoint of our guidance range for 2021.  AEP service territory continues to prove us with resiliency and stability with continued economic recovery experienced in the third quarter. In fact, AEP posted the strongest sales quarter in over a decade, and the gross regional product for the AEP footprint of third quarter was the highest on record, as well as job growth being the strongest since 1984. The strength and diversity of our portfolio, the robustness of our organic growth opportunities, and our consistent ability to execute against our plan places AEP among what we believe should be one of the country's premium regulated utilities.  Our strength -- our strong performance this quarter, coupled with the level of economic recovery experienced within our footprint, provides us, once again, the confidence needed to raise our midpoint to 470 per share and nearer, the 2021 guidance range to 465 to 475 while reaffirming our 5% to 7% long-term earnings growth rate. And as I've stated previously, I would still be disappointed if we were not in that upper half of our long-term growth rate. The driver of our strong performance is the talent and commitment of our employees.  Our front line of central service work teams has continued to adapt to ensure the needs of our customers and communities are met day in day -- day in and day out throughout the pandemic. Like many industries, the face of work for AEP will never be the same. As employees return to the office, we have taken actions to ensure the safe return to the workplace environment. I remain appreciative of the dedication of our employees and have the utmost confidence in their continuing ability to successfully check and adjust as we adapt to the future.  We believe that this new work environment will continue to enable more efficiency, flexibility, and creativity, that will contribute to the culture to excel in meeting our strategic objectives. This new future of work along with digitization and automation will continue to provide benefits for our Achieving Excellence program. Our growth opportunities over the next decade are significant driven by our future forward renewables plan, that over 16 gigawatts of new renewables resources by 2030, and the transmission distribution investments needed to support the needs of a clean energy economy for our customers and communities.  Additionally, the completion of a strategic review of our Kentucky Companies and our decision to move forward with the sale delivered utilities enables us to focus our attention on executing that transaction and delivering on our gross strategy. So, let's cover the announced sale of Kentucky Power. Earlier this week, on Tuesday at market close, we announced the sale of Kentucky Power and Kentucky Transco to Liberty Utilities, the regulated utility operation of Algonquin Power.  The sale was a result of the strategic review that we launched back in April. The sale was subject to regulatory approvals, including approvals from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission which is within a 180 days, and the Kentucky Public Service Commission, within a 120 days. The transaction was also subject to federal clearance pursuant to Hart-Scott-Rodino, which typically is within 30 to 60 days, and the clearance from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., within 90 and a 120 days for that approval.  We anticipate making these regulatory filings in late November and early December. Separately, we will file -- with both the Kentucky, West Virginia and full commissions with necessary changes to the metro plant operating agreement to accommodate the ELG investments recently approved by the West Virginia Commission. The following will include a plan to resolve the question of Mitchell ownership post 2028. Both state commissions are expecting these filings as both issued recent orders directing us to do so.  These filings will be made in the mid to late November time frame. We're also very pleased with the outcome of the strategic review and know that the future owner of our Kentucky assets will be a great steward for all stakeholders in Kentucky, our value employees, customers, and certainly the communities. Lastly, I want to thank all the Kentucky employees and the corporate support employees for their patience, during this review and for their continued focus on safety and operational excellence during this period, and as the transaction is completed. Now, moving to several of the regulatory activities.  In Ohio, we expect an order in the fourth quarter on the settlement reached and filed with the Commission earlier this year. As a reminder of the settlement has broad support from the settling parties, including the commission staff, Ohio consumers\u2019 counsel, Industrial companies, commercial companies, and other entities like Ohio Hospital Association. Additionally, AEP Ohio's grid smart Phase III settlement was filed yesterday and paves the way to continue our deployment of advanced smart grid technologies, including completion of our AMR meter rollout, the remaining 475,000 rollout customers.  The unopposed settlement with support from commission staff allows consumer's counsel and several of our largest customers demonstrates that AEP Ohio continues to maintain a great working relationship with our regulator and interested parties. Public Service Company of Oklahoma reached a settlement in the rate case with the Oklahoma staff and other parties. The settlement was presented to the commission on October 5th. The black-box settlement includes 50.7 million net increase in rates while adding another 102.7 million in base rates.  In addition to continuing the practice of allowing some interim recovery of Capex riders, the rider collecting for Maverick and Sundance North-Central wind assets was also included, in orders expected by year-end with rates reflected in November bills. In Indiana, the unfollowed base rate case on the July 1st based on a future test year model seeking 97 million in net revenue increase with a 10% ROE.  Major items included recognition of over 500 million in capital investment per year in Indiana continuation of the transmission tracker a federal tax rider in the event of a change in federal tax rates and the advancement of AMI to provide customers greater control insight into their usage. The hearing was set before the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission on December 2nd, with an order expected by April of '22. In a Southwestern Electric Power Company's jurisdictions cases are pending in Louisiana, Texas, and Arkansas.  The SWEPCO Texas Commission deliberations set for November 18th. Parties filed exceptions to the preliminary draft order issued by the hearing  and replies. So those exceptions were filed yesterday. SWEPCO is seeking a net revenue increase of $73 million with an ROE of 10.35%. Our file includes investments made from February 2018, accelerated depreciation for  plant, a strong reserve, increased vegetation management.  We expect an order in the fourth quarter with rates being retroactive back to March of '21. In SWEPCO Louisiana testimony has been filed a hearing scheduled for January of '22. A case $6 million to $73 million net revenue increase and a 10.35% ROE in order to expect between the second third quarter of '22. And so, at Arkansas, we were seeking a $56 million net revenue increase with a 10.35 ROE. The following contains with formula rate plan for subsequent years and considers the pending retirement of previously announced call net assets.  This fall, we used time to align with the North-Central in-service dates and the provided mechanism both for recovery of costs associated with the investment and flow through of the PTC in SWEPCO customers. The hearing is set for March of '22. Both SWEPCO and PSO continue to make progress to recognize the Storm Uri expenditures. As a reminder, we filed for recovery of a lack returned over 5 years in Louisiana, Arkansas, Oklahoma, and Texas.  PSO is moving forward with the state on the securitization of costs as premiering under Oklahoma law. We are continuing our efforts to secure approvals and clear clarity regarding investments necessary to with the EPA, CCR, ELG requirements. We received  to construct the CCR compliance plans in Virginia, West Virginia, and Kentucky. While West Virginia approved ELG investments, Virginia, and Kentucky did not.  West Virginia has since determined it was in the public interest to move forward with EOG investments for all 3 plans and has issued an order regarding in support of West Virginia investing to preserve the option for these plants to run past 2028, approving both the investment inward cost recovery from West Virginia customers. We'll be working with our commissions to implement the West Virginia decision and making the necessary adjustments to respect each state's decision.  The Virginia Commission ask us to come back with more information, so we'll do that. We plan to lay out all the options before them, on how to satisfy their capacity needs. The Virginia PSC were approved the first-year revenue requirement of 4.8 million for broadband, which means we now have recovery for our world broadband efforts in both Virginia, and West Virginia.  We continue to engage legislators and commissions, and other states and stand ready, to invest in synergistic mid-model broadband, to support advanced group technologies, and rural broadband for our communities. We also understand, it's all about execution. On September 10th, AEP began commercial operation of the 287-megawatt Maverick Wind Energy Center in North Central Oklahoma.  Maverick was one of three wind projects that composed the North Central energy facilities, which will provide 1485 megawatts of clean energy to customers of our PSO and SWEPCO subsidiaries. The Traverse project, the largest single site wind farm in North America is well under construction and will come online in the January to April 2022 time frame. Transforming the way energy is generated, delivered, and consumed is necessary to support the needs of a clean energy economy and AEP continues to drive that transformation for the benefit of our customers and communities.  With the success of doors central setting the foundation of our future forward regulated renewables platform, we are diligently working on securing additional renewable opportunities for our customers. RFP filings are going -- are ongoing and planned in multiple states. So more to come on this as we file for approval, after resources, as a result of the RFP that were out in the market for which some of you probably have heard of, we will be able to provide greater detail on the progress being made.  Further, if federal efforts through the various tax proposals to extend and expand PTCs, ITCs for Clean Energy Resources succeed, even more benefits will be enjoyed by our customers. So now, we move quickly to the equalizer char now at this point, and I'll go quickly through this. So far, the average with the overall regulated operations is currently 9%. We generally target in the 9.5% to 10% range. So obviously we continue to work on that. AP Ohio came in at 9.3% for the third quarter, as blow authorized primarily due to timely recovery of capital investments, partially offset by higher O&M expenses.  We expect that ROE to trend around authorized levels, as we maintain concurrent capital recovery of distribution, transmission investments. We also, as I mentioned earlier, expect the commission order here in the fourth quarter of '21. After it came in at 7.3%, as below authorized due to higher amortization, primarily related to what's hard coal-fired-generating assets, and higher depreciation from increase Virginia depreciation rates and capital investment. And as you know, we are still at the Appeals Court appealing -- the Virginia Supreme Court, which is currently outstanding.  We filed appeal with that Virginia Supreme Court, so we're still waiting on that. As far as Kentucky is concerned, 6.9% below authorized due to loss of load from weak economic conditions and loss of major customers. Transmission revenues were also lower due to the delay in some capital projects. I&M came in at 10.3%. It's rare that's authorized ROE primarily due to increase in sales, partially offset by increased OEM and depreciation expenses associated with items continued capital investment programs. As far as PSO is concerned, came in at 7.6%.  It's below its authorized level primarily due to increased capital investment currently not in base rates and higher than anticipated equity due to the extreme February winter weather event. And of course, we expect the commission order here on the rate case in the fourth quarter of '21. SWEPCO came in at 8.2% as well authorized due to increased capital investment currently not in base rates and the continued impact of the Arkansas share of the Turk plant that is not in retail rates.  The Turkish, you again, accounts for about 110 basis points that we're not recovering in Arkansas. Again, as I mentioned earlier, we expect various commission orders, and particularly in Texas, in the fourth quarter of 2021, it's retroactive back to March. API Texas came in at 8.2% as below authorized primarily due to the significant level of investment in Texas. And of course, we have favorable regulatory treatment there with that annual DCOS and bi-annual TCOS filings to recover rates.  So significant levels of investment in Texas will continue to impact the ROE. But the expectation is for the ROE to trend towards an authorized 9.4% in the longer-term. AEP Transmission Holdco came in at 11.2%. It was above authorized primarily driven by differences between actual and forecasted expenses. The transfer will benefit from a forward-looking formula rate mechanism, which helps minimize regulatory lag, and that forecasted dollar rate is around 11% in 2021. So overall, continue to make progress.  Cases, obviously, we're waiting to hear the results of several cases that should provide some additional benefits, but that work continues. So, in closing, we are executing all  and continue to drive the results expected of a premium regulated utility. The AEP portfolio is one that has enabled our investments in the wire side of the business supporting our transmission investments, including the $0.33 per share this quarter, through our AEP trends -- transmission Holdco investments.  Our plan to transition our generation fleet and reduce carbon emissions by 80% by 2030 and net 0 by 2050 is well underway with 2 of our 3 wind facilities of our 2 billion investment in North-Central land under our belt, providing a solid foundation for the next decade of growth. Throughout this transition, we remain engaged in a trusted voice on energy transformation efforts, helping to ensure responsible transition to clean energy economy.  And we will continue to support Federal efforts in that regard and State efforts as well. Finally, our strong quarter performance gives us the confidence again, to set our midpoint at 470, or the range of 465 to 475. And we continue to have all 17,000 employees dedicated to our customers and communities to enable the strong performance. Our discipline and controlling cost, our progress to manage the portfolio, and the significance of our future organic growth opportunities provides us with a confidence needed, in raising the midpoint and nearing the guidance range.  Two weeks ago, I was really struck by the half time performance of the Ohio State Buckeyes marching band. They set their goals in my opinion, really high. Never do I expect to see a marching band dedicate their halftime show to the music of Rash (ph), to hear Tom saw your yyz(ph), the limelight and others, was truly amazing when they are difficult to even play. even though they were also marching while designing guitar players, drones, and other choreography on the field. The creativity and the execution came through to deliver a truly remarkable show.  It made me think of our team at AEP, on November 11th, I've been AEP CEO for 10-years, I'm fortunate to lead a great Company with great people who have an outstanding track record of delivering on the promises made to investors and customers consistently year in and year out. And we fully expect to continue our drive to take this Company to the next level toward the clean energy economy and a solid infrastructure foundation bucks-rating aggressive goals and delivering with creativity and solid execution. With that, I will turn it over to Julie.\nJulie Sloat : Thanks so much, Nick. Thanks, Darcy. And Nick I love your Buckeye reference. Go Bucks.\nNick Akins: I love that.\nJulie Sloat : Thank you very much. Big game this weekend. Anyway, it's good to be with everybody this morning. I'm going to walk us through the third quarter and year-to-date financial results. I'll share some updates on our service territory load, and finish with some commentary on financing plans, credit metrics, and liquidity. Let's go to slide six, which shows the comparison of GAAP top rating earnings for the quarter and year-to-date periods.  GAAP earnings for the third quarter were $1.59 per share, compared to a $1.51 per share in 2020. GAAP earnings through September were $3.90 per share compared to $3.56 per share in 2020. There's a reconciliation of GAAP to operating earnings on Pages 14 and 15 of the presentation today. Let's go to Slide 7 where we can talk about our quarterly operating earnings performance by segment.  Operating earnings for the third quarter totaled $1.43 per share or $717 million compared to $1.47 per share or $728 million in 2020. Operating earnings from the vertically integrated utilities were $0.87 per share, up $0.02. Favorable drivers included, rate changes across multiple jurisdictions, weather primarily in the West, transmission revenue and lower income tax.  These items were offset somewhat by higher O&M expenses to in part to lower prior year O&M, which included actions we took to adjust to the pandemic and higher depreciation expense, as well as lower normalized margins and lower AFUDC. The Transmission and Distribution Utilities segment earned $0.31 per share flat to last year. Favorable drivers in this segment included rate changes, transmission revenue, and income taxes.  Offsetting these favorable items were O&M expenses again, a function of lower prior year O&M associated with pandemic growing efforts, depreciation, and property taxes. The AEP Transmission Holdco segment continued to grow, contributing $0.33 per share, that was an improvement of $0.05, driven by the return-on-investment growth. Generation and Marketing produced $0.04 per share, down $0.09 from last year, includes by the prior-year land sales, lower retail volumes and margins, generation and income taxes.  Finally, Corporate and other was down $0.02 per share driven by lower investment gains, and unfavorable net interest expense, which was partially offset by lower income taxes. The lower investment gains, are related to a pullback of some of the ChargePoint related gains, we've talked about on prior quarters. Let's have a look at our year-to-date results on slide number 8. Operating earnings through September totaled $3.76 per share, or $1.9 billion compared to $3.56 per share, or $1.8 billion in 2020.  Looking at the drivers by segment, operating earnings for vertically integrated utilities, were $1.87 per share down $0.03, due to higher O&M and depreciation expenses. Other smaller decreases included lower normalized sales and wholesale load, higher other taxes, and a prior period fuel adjustment. Offsetting these unfavorable variances were weight changes across various operating companies and the impact of weather due to warmer than normal temps in the winter of 2020 and the summer 2021, which created a favorable year-over-year comp for us.  Other favorable items in this segment included higher off-system sales, transmission revenue, net interest expense, and income taxes. The transmission and distribution utilities segments earned $0.85 per share, up a penny from last year. Earnings in this segment were up due to higher transmission revenue, rate changes, weather, normalized load, and income taxes. Partially offsetting these favorable items were increased depreciation, O&M, other taxes, and interest expenses.  AEP Transmission Holdco segment contributed $1.02 per share up $0.27 from last year, related to investment growth and favorable year-over-year true-up. Generation and marketing produced $0.20 per share down $0.11 from last year due to favorable one-time items in the prior year relating to an Oklaunion ARO adjustment in the sale of Conesville and reduced land sales in 2021.  Higher energy margins and low expenses in the generation business offset the unfavorable  marketplaces on the wholesale business during storm yearly in February. We also saw an unfavorable result in retail due to lower power and gas margins. Income taxes were also unfavorable. Finally, Corporate matter was up $0.06 per share driven by investment gains and lower taxes and partially offset by higher O&M. Let me take a quick minute here to talk about the investment gain, which is predominantly a function of our direct and indirect Investment ChargePoint. As you'll see on the waterfall, was produced a $0.06 benefit year-to-date in 2021, as compared to the corresponding 2020 period. You may recall that in the fourth quarter at full-year 2020, this investment produced a $0.05 contribution, and we would expect the year-over-year bids to be more pronounced at this point in 2021, as we have no benefit during the same period in 2020.  Turning to Page 9, I'll update you on our normalized low performance for the quarter. We, then, get into the specifics. Let me start by reminding everyone that everything you see on the slide is showing year-over-year growth. That means these numbers can be influenced by what was going on last year or what is happening now in 2021. Given all that occurred in the economy last year, it's obvious that these growth rates are at least partially being influenced by the comparison basis. This leads to the natural follow-up question like, how does today's low compare to pre -pandemic level? And I'll get to that question on the next slide. But before I do, let's take a look what a -- at what our normalized low growth was for the quarter. Starting in the upper left corner, normalized residential sales were down 1.6% compared to last year, bringing the year-to-date declined down to 9/10 of a percent.  That means that last year, residential sales were up 3.8% in the third quarter when the economy was just starting to reopen. One year later, they're down only 1.6%, which suggests there has been a shift up in residential sales, as more businesses have embraced a remote workforce for jobs that can be performed at home. The last item to point out on the residential charges that you'll notice that we added a new bar to the right, showing our latest projection for 2021 based on the load forecast update.  The original guidance assumed residential sales would decrease by 1.1% in 2021. The latest update showed an improvement as we now expect residential to end the year down 9/10 of a percent. Moving right, weather-normalized commercial sales increased by 5%, bringing the year-to-date growth up to 4.3%. Last year's third quarter commercial sales were down 4.6%. So again, we're seeing a net positive stories of commercial sales classes bouncing back faster than expected.  And while we're seeing a strong bounce back and the sector's most impacted by the pandemic such as schools, churches, and hotels, we're actually seeing the strongest growth in commercial sales this year from growth in data centers, especially in the Central Ohio. To give you some perspective, last year, the sector was the 9th largest commercial sector across the AP system. Today, it's the 6th largest, and will likely move further up in the rankings as more data center loads are expected to come in online over the next several years.  You will also notice that our latest load forecast update now suggests that commercial sales were end-year up 3.7% as opposed to the 0.5% decline assumed in the original guidance forecast. The economy has recovered much faster than we originally assumed, which is one of the reasons why we've updated the forecast and ensuring an improvement in that regard. In the lower left corner, you'll see that industrial sales also had a very strong quarter.  Industrial sales for the quarter increased by 7%, bringing the year-to-date up to 4.2%. Industrial sales were up at every operating Company in nearly every sector. I point out, however, that the 7% growth in the third quarter this year did not quite offset the 7.8% decline experienced last year. Which means we still have a little more room to grow before the industrial class fully recovers from the pandemic recession. The good news is we have a lot of momentum to work with.  The latest node update now projects industrial sales will end the year up 4.3%, which is 2.4% higher than assumed in the original guidance forecast. Finally, when you put it all together in the lower left corner, you'll see that normalized retail sales increased by 3% for the quarter and were up 2.3% for the first 9 months. But all indications that recovery from the pandemic and recession is happening faster than expected and our service territory is positioned to benefit from future economic growth. You'll recall that the original guidance forecast assumed normalized load growth of 2/10 of a percent in 2021. Based on our latest update, we're now expecting to end the year up 2.2%, which is a supporting factor in narrowing our earnings guidance range, and raising the midpoint for 2021. Turning to Slide 10, I want to answer the question from earlier, that asked how our current low performance compares to pre -pandemic levels. This bar chart is designed to answer that question. The blue bars are the same year-to-date bars that we shared on the prior page. As a reminder, these represent growth versus 2020, which was influenced by the restrictions implemented to manage the public health crisis.  The orange bars here show how the year-to-date sales in 2021 compared to 2019, which was the most recent pre - pandemic year for comparison. These bars tell us how close we are to a full recovery from the pandemic. Starting at the left, you'll notice that a reported residential sales are down 9/10 of a percent compared to last year, but they're actually up 1.6% compared to our pre -pandemic levels. This is a gauge for how our customers behaviors have changed since the pandemic, with more people working from home.  The next bar shows that while commercial sales are up 4.3% compared to last year. There are still 8/10 of the percent below the pre -pandemic levels. Given the recent growth we're seeing, especially in the data center nodes, we would expect commercial sales to fully recover nearly soon. Moving further, right, you can notice that while the industrial sales were up 4.2% compared to last year, they are still 3% lower than pre -pandemic levels.  Given some of the headwinds for manufacturing today with supply chain disruptions, later shortages, et cetera, it may take a little longer before the industrial quest fully recovers from the pandemic recession. But we do expect to eclipse the pre -pandemic levels in 2022. In total, our normalized load is up 2.3% compared to last year and is now within 7/10 of a percent of being fully recovered from the pandemic, so it's safe to say that we're pleased with the strength and balance of this recovery in the AEP system. Let's check on the Company's capitalization and liquidity on Page 11.  On a GAAP basis, our debt-to-capital ratio decreased 0.4% from the prior quarter to 62.2%. When adjusted for the storm during event, the ratio is slightly lower than it was at year-end 2022, sorry 2020, and now stands at 61.5%. Let's talk about our FFO to debt metric, as in the first and second quarter. Effective storm yearly continues to have a temporary and noticeable impact, on this 2021 metric. Taking a look at the upper right quadrant on this page, you'll see our FFO to debt metrics based on traditional Moody's and GAAP calculated basis. As well as an adjusted Moody's and GAAP calculated basis. On a traditional unadjusted basis, our FFO - to -debt ratio increased by 0.9% during the quarter to 10.2% on a Moody's basis. And just, again, reiterate, radio agencies continue to take the anticipated recovery into consideration as it relates to our credit ratings. So very important to note that. On an adjusted basis, the Moody's FFO-to-debt metric is 13.6%.  This figure removes or adjusts the calculation to eliminate the impact of approximately 1.2 billion of cash outflows associated with covering the unplanned urine-driven fuel and purchase power in the SPP region, directly impacting PSO and SWEPCO in particular. The metric is also adjusted to remove the effect of the associated debt we used to fund the unplanned payments. This should give you a sense of where we would be from a business - as -usual perspective with that 13.6%.  Importantly, as Nick mentioned, the recovery of the  fuel and purchase power expense in the PSO and SWEPCO jurisdictions is well underway and we're making progress. As a result, inconsistent with what we have previously communicated, we still anticipate our cash flow metrics to return to below the mid-teens target range next year. Obviously, we are trying to push towards the mid-teens range, but that will take us a little while longer, but we're definitely on our way there.  And as you know, we'll keep you posted on our progress. Before we leave the Balance Sheet topic, I do want to make note of the intended change to our 2022 financing plan, in light of our announced sale of Kentucky Power and Kentucky Transco. You may recall that we had planned to issue $1.4 billion of equity in 2022, that's inclusive of $100 million dividend reinvestment plan to fund our growth Capex program, where we will provide our typical 3-year forward annual review of our cash flows and financial metrics at the upcoming EEI Conference, where we can expect to see is that the 2022 forecast will be adjusted to eliminate the previously planned $1.4 billion of equity financing that I just mentioned with any residual proceeds being used to reduce a small portion of the 2022 debt financing that we had planned.  These actions will have no impact on our previously stated credit metric targets or messaging in that regard. On the slide deck today, on page 39, you'll see our current cash flow forecast, with which you are already familiar, We've included a note on the side to reflect the fact that the numbers have not been updated for the announced Kentucky transaction, along with the red circle around the 2022 financing -- equity financing amount that will be changed and updated when we roll out the new view in a couple of weeks in conjunction with the EEI conference.  So, while we're talking about the Kentucky transaction, I can also share that we expect that the sale will be $0.01 to $0.02 accretive in 2022, and we will reflect this in our 2022 earnings guidance that we provide to you at the EEI Conference. Okay. So back to our regularly-scheduled earnings call programming and commentary. Let's take a quick moment to visit our liquidity summary on the lower right slot -- side of Slide 11.  Our 5-year $4 billion bank revolver and 2-year $1 billion revolving credit facility, along with proceeds from the quarter-end debt issuance, support our liquidity position, which means we were strong at $5.1 billion. If you look at the lower left side of the page, you will see that our qualified pension continues to be well funded at a 104%. Additionally, our OPEB is funded at a 173.9%. Let's go slide 12 and I'll do a quick wrap up and we can get to your questions.  Our performance through the first 3 quarters of this year gives us confidence to narrow our operating guidance to the upper half of our current range, resulting in the new range of $4.65 per share to $4.75 per share with a midpoint of $4.70 per share. As we stated, we are committed to our long-term growth, rate target of 5% to 7%. Today's 2021 earnings guidance revision is yet another demonstration of our drive to deliver performance in the upper half of our guidance range. From a strategic perspective, we're making significant progress in addressing items that are top of mind for our current and perspective investors.  We're mounting contract to sell Kentucky Power and Kentucky Transco, which we expect to complete in the second quarter of 2022. This transaction enables us to avoid the 1.4 billion equity issuance, that was part of our original forecast, would share with you for 2022. Therefore, alleviates the overhang, the equity overhang. Also allows us to deliver transaction that we estimate to be 1 to 2  in 2022.  We will be more able to do this, while concurrently preserving our ability to get our FFO to debt metrics comfortably, into that mid to low teens range by 2022, which is commensurate with a Moody's BAAT stabilizing, as we continue to target that. The intention is to remain in this credit metric range. Again, with a preference to try to get closer to that midpoint, as we move along in time. All of this positions us to continue our generation transformation, which is underpinned by the renewable investment opportunity we have shared with you in complemented by our ongoing energy delivery investment.  So here you can expect to see from us at the upcoming EEI Conference in early November. In addition to the updated 3-year forward cash flow and financing plan, we'll be introducing and sharing the details behind our 2022 Earnings Guidance and our longer-term capital plan, we typically got out 5 years, all of which will incorporate the effects of the announced Kentucky sales. So, with that, surely, we do appreciate your time and attention and I'm going to turn it over to the operator so we can get to your questions.\nOperator: Thank you.  Also please, take up your handset before pressing any buttons. We will go first to the line of Julien Dumoulin Smith. Your line is open. Go ahead, please. I'm sorry. I'm having some technical difficulty, one moment while we open your line. Your line is open. Go ahead, please.\nJulien Dumoulin Smith : Thank you. Can you hear me now?\nNick Akins : Hey you doing and how you?\nJulien Dumoulin Smith : Hey, quite well. Thank you. Congratulations on the transaction there. Nicely done.\nNick Akins : Yeah, I'm angst.\nJulien Dumoulin Smith : Absolutely. So perhaps just to dive into that one a little bit more, can you talk about what happens with the Mitchell plant here, just as a function of the sale, will it get transferred to Wheeling, how are you thinking about that vis -a - vis liberty, and any kind of pricing there, and in terms of transfer, what have you?\nNick Akins : Yes. That's why the operating agreement is being followed. Wheeling would become the operator and it does get transferred to Wheeling in 2028. And so that's really -- we're continuing with Kentucky being half-owner of Mitchell until that period of time. So, the Wheeling will take over the operations of the plant, the employees will move over to wheeling as well. And then we'll continue working with the West Virginia and Kentucky commission to get resolved the operating agreement and related issues.  And then, of course, at the end -- at 2028, it transfers over at fair market value . So that's the plan. And that will get followed here in November and December time frame and we'll go through that. And actually, both commissions have the incentive to get this resolved because we do have various views of the ELG piece of it. So regardless of whether we had this transaction or not, we would be needing to fall for the operating agreement change out just because the different directions of the commissions have gone. So, we'll get that resolved as part of process to the overall approvals.\nJulien Dumoulin Smith : Excellent. Nicely said -- nicely done. Fair market value it is. And then just vis -a - vis, ongoing transactions in portfolio evaluation of really a review with the equity means here in the very near-term, how do you think about just continued evaluation a portfolio? I mean, clearly, it's not necessarily a near-term dynamic, but want to give you the opportunity to speak to that a little bit further.\nNick Akins : Yes, sure. I said over and over, I guess for a couple of years now but even beyond that. We do have to get to portfolio management to enable us to look at the sources and uses of the capital needs that we have. And to manage the balance sheet, as Julie has mentioned. We target the mid-teens, and we want to get there, and obviously, we're well on our way of getting there. So, we want to do that, but at the same time, be able to fund the capital growth.  And when you think about it, we've sold the unregulated generation, we sold Rover Rob's, we sold some hydro-related facilities. With Kentucky, we're talking about 6 billion of assets that have been sold, but they fueled substantial growth. I mean, to the tune of 7 billion a year in capital. It's part of the process to determine what the portfolio, needs to be in the future and we will continue to do that.  Certainly, we have Chuck, and Julie, and others will continue to review that portfolio, and we will manage it in a proper way. I'll say this, Kentucky Power, you think about the threshold -- at one point we talked about we always invested in coal units no matter what. And, obviously, we've changed that focus to make sure it's more deliveries of in terms of the decision points that are made. It's quite a move for AEP to get to a point where we're managing our portfolio in a way that, first of all, we became fully regulate, and then we start to look at that portfolio to determine what's the best approach to fuel 20 billion in potential renewables investment.  So, when you think about that, we have to consider it. And I can tell you, the last time we sold a regulated utility was, I guess, the Scranton Pennsylvania System, and then the Pennsylvania -- in Pennsylvania and the New Jersey system back in the 1940s and 50s. So, it's a pretty substantial change. And when you think about Kentucky Power sales, it was one of the first acquisitions of American Gas and Electric in 1922. So, by the time we get through this, it's been 100 years. So, when you think about the threshold level of portfolio management that has occurred in this Company, it really should show a lot on terms of our seriousness of making sure that we're managing that portfolio in the proper way. That's probably longer answer than what you asked for, but I want ed to at least get all that out there.\nJulien Dumoulin Smith : Very much appreciate it. I'll leave it there. Speak with you guys soon.\nNick Akins : Okay.\nOperator: We'll next go to the line of Shahriar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Go ahead, please.\nNick Akins : Good morning, Shahriar.\nShahriar Pourreza : Good morning, guys and congrats on Kentucky.\nNick Akins : Yes.\nShahriar Pourreza : Just a follow-up on Julien's question a little bit more. As we think about trigger points for another asset sale what's kind of a catalyst because the 10-gigawatts of solar wind that you're looking to build through '25. I mean, even if you assume a 50-50 on PPA structure could yield an incremental $3 billion rate of spending opportunities. And you obviously have a slope of IRP. So do you need to see affirmations with the various filings or actual approvals in GRC. So how should we think about how these could be funded, especially in light of where the stock trades. So, yes.\nNick Akins : When you think about the way we're approaching the renewables fees, that the process has been, that we term the need for equity associated with those particular investments, when they actually come online and we get regulated recovery. So, we get the cash flow to support, those investments at the time they come online. That means, obviously our FFO to debt doesn't suffer as a result of that. So, if we continue that approach, and keep in mind too, I've always said that, for us to take a look at a regulated entity or other parts of our portfolio, doesn't match the future needs in terms of, where we are and where we're going as a Company.  Is there, if we have a chronically under-performing part of the portfolio, then it's important for us to take a look at. That may be temporary, it could be long term, but certainly we have to make sure that we're evaluating each one of these assets in a way that says, okay. It doesn't matter where it's located, as long as we're getting certainly the return expectation and also the forward view of the utility is positive as compared to with others. So, we have to compare in various parts of our service territories and that's where we make those decisions.\nShahriar Pourreza : Perfect. And then just Nick, appreciate we're going to head into EEI we'll get an update here. But do you see the current renewable additions at least through '25 the 10 gigawatts, right, between solar and wind swinging materially with some of these counteractive items like federal policy benefits versus the input cost pressures we're seeing in the space impacting some project timings. So, do you see any of this swinging at all?\nNick Akins : Yeah, I do. And in your -- when we'd actually go do the analysis and we've done analysis for all the jurisdictions, but conditions changed, low changes certainly PTCs, ITCs can change as a result, which changed the business cases were some may have been on the margins particularly in the east now become benefits to customers. So, I think those numbers will continue to change and I can tell you from what I've seen so far. Those numbers will change. And some will go out, some will go down. But overall, normally, it should be on path, what we've talked about.  And we'll have more to report on that. Probably during first quarter '22, because we'll have the integrated resource plans. And when those integrated resource plans are filed, that's where I mentioned today is you will have a more definitive view of what those projects look like because there will be the results of RFPs and there will be the results of actual projects that are put in for regulated approval. So, more definition, but I would certainly say that normally they will be in that category we've previously discussed.\nJulie Sloat : And sure. What you should anticipate is when we go to EEI, you'll see a refreshed 5-year forward Capex plan, so '22 through '26, and you'll start to begin to see a little bit more of this renewable opportunity dropped in. So, stay tuned for that, and we'll be able to talk more granularly with you here in a couple of weeks.\nNick Akins : Yeah. And I would say that when you see that, it certainly will reflect, I don't know if you call it a risk-adjusted approach or whatever, but it's a nominal view for us to make financing plans, and then just like with North Central, we make decisions on whether it goes up or down based upon our ownership.\nShahriar Pourreza : Got it. Cheers to you guys. Congrats on the results. See you soon.\nNick Akins : Thank you.\nOperator: We will next go to the line of Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Go ahead, please.\nSteve Fleishman : Hey, good morning. Can you hear me, Nick?\nNick Akins : Yes. Yes. I hear you.\nSteve Fleishman : Okay, great. Thanks. Okay. One question that might be a bit premature, but there's obviously a lot going on in DC with the reconciliation bill and the like, and one of the provisions that's gotten more focused on this few days is the minimum tax provision. And I just be curious, how you're thinking -- for larger companies like yourself, how you're thinking if that has any impact for largely regulated utility like you or does it not really have much of an impact?\nNick Akins : Well, I would say, and we've been vocal about this and the industry has been vocal about it, if you put a minimum 15% tax and a lot of us are, as you know, heavy on capital, and its growth capital, and it's also infrastructure-related capital. So, an increase with the minimum tax would certainly have an accruing effect on our ability to continue with not only development of infrastructure and having effect on that, not to mention customers\u2019 bills ultimately because the taxes were passed through to our customers.  But also, the administration has a focus on green energy and it will have an effect on renewables transformation that's existing as well. So, I think I think they'll put a pail over all the utilities\u2019 ability to continue invest in capital in the way that we are. Now, if we do that, then obviously there's customer impact associated with it. And again, it's a hidden tax on our customers. So, we're not for that provision. I think actually, we've been very worthwhile about this and trying to be an honest broker when we're talking about CEBP and all the other things that -- it was important for us to be able to make this transformation from a clean energy standpoint.  Certainly, the PTCs, ITCs with expansion of long-term storage, nuclear, and certainly in terms of wind and solar, are very important to continue those process, to move to clean energy economy, and we can go a long way there. This industry is very focused on doing that, and any kind of tax headwind that goes the other direction is not helpful. I think you probably hear that across-the-board.\nSteve Fleishman : Okay. More to direct AP things. Just on the approval for the Kentucky sale, could you remind us what the standard for approval is in Kentucky? Is it just in the public interest or that benefits?\nNick Akins : Yes. But it's in the public interest, obviously. Because they have to look at the suitor and determine is that the right route approach. And as I've done in the proper way and actually there has been some discussions in Kentucky previously. I think it's probably gone past some of that now that -- I want to make sure we were operating Kentucky the way we should. And we've been operating it the way we always have.  So, we've been investing, we've been doing the things that we need to do. Whether we owned it or not. And I think certainly the buyer has recognized that and during the transition, we will continue to support a smooth transition to ensure that the services provided and things that need to be done to make Kentucky Power successful, we'll be there to do it. And of course, we'll support Liberty Utilities in Algonquin in doing that.\nSteve Fleishman : Great. And then one just quick question maybe for Julie. The proceeds from the Kentucky sale look like they're matching up one for one with reducing the equity need. But obviously when you sell an asset, you lose some cash flow, albeit Kentucky maybe wasn't having the best cash flow. So, are there offsets in other businesses that are making up for the lost cash flow from the asset sale?\nJulie Sloat : Yes, thanks for the question, Steve. You're right. I mean, we do lose the funds from operations that relates to Kentucky and Kentucky Transco. Although, we got to keep in mind that we also eliminate about $1.3 billion of debt associated with those assets to because that goes away. And the marathon that we think through, just to take it a step further is if we avoid issuing equity, we avoid having to cover off additional dividends that were in our original plan.  So, another to a sidestep that as well. And that comes with, maybe also having some additional dollars to reduce debt. As I mentioned in my opening comments, anything above and beyond that $1.4 billion which channeled toward debt reduction that was otherwise planned for 2022. And then also, keep in mind that Kentucky Power had barely strained FFO - to -debt to begin with. So, to eliminate that piece of, I guess, drag to the overall average FFO -to-debt for their organization is also a net positive for us.  So, we are able to put these numbers together. And quite frankly, from an FFO - to -debt perspective, it is mildly beneficial and obviously a little bit of a cost on the debt-to-cap because we're not issuing additional equity. But the numbers all do hang together and coincidentally we'll be able to take literally that $1.4 billion of planned equity out of the plan, and again, you'll see that at EEI when we'll refresh the forecast.\nSteve Fleishman : Great. Thanks so much.\nNick Akins : Thanks, Steve.\nOperator: Well let's go to the line of Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI. Go ahead, please.\nNick Akins : Morning, Durgesh.\nDurgesh Chopra : Hey, good morning, Nick. Maybe just along the FFO-to-debt lines, my first question is to Julie. In terms of 2024, I'm thinking about your equity needs in my model shift used to target for FFO to debt. Actually, is it mid-teens or is it low to your ? Because, obviously, that's going to dictate, right, how much equity you might need in 2024. So, any color you could share there?\nJulie Sloat : Got you. You'll see 2024 when we rollout our EEI guidance, so 3 years forward. But, as we continue to say, we are talking about mid - to -low teens. And the reason I say that is, as I mentioned today, if you look at our FFO to debt on an adjusted basis, so backing out the yearly consequence, we have something like 13.6% on a Moody's basis. As you know, our target has been to be around that Baa2 stable rating.  That's why we talk about mid - to -low teens or low - to -mid teens. Obviously, our preference and our expectation are to start to push more towards what I would characterize as mid. It'd be nice to have at least a 14 handle on that FFO to debt, and that is absolutely the plan, but we'll be able to share more with you as we get to EEI and build that forecast, but I wouldn't change how you're thinking about it. So, thinking about mid to low teens as it relates to Moody's BAAT, with a preference towards 14 plus percent.\nDurgesh Chopra : Got it. So, some of that moment to low teens through 2024 yeah. A big picture question, we've talked in depth about natural gas prices. So maybe just talk about your gas generation portfolio, fuel costs, any hedges in impacting customer bills?\nJulie Sloat : I will take this from a customer rate perspective as I could, because that's how we think about it. Because ultimately this impacts our customers. When we think about, for example, a decent sensitivity analyses around, let's say a 10% hike in natural gas prices as we all know, they've gone up substantially. The impact to customer rates varies significantly from 1 operating Company to the next, depending on the field mix.  So, for example, if I looked at Appalachian Power Company, the average residential impact price in terms of the 10% hiking gas prices would equate to about a 0.9% increase in the customer's rate. Let's compare and contrast that to say PSO or SWEPCO, whether there's much more gas concentration. So PSO, we'd be talking about 1.6% increase in customer rates. SWEPCO, 1.5%. So, this is something we're very sensitive to, because as you know, overall, we're extremely sensitive to customer rate increases and the aggregate as we continue to execute on our general Capex program. I don't know if -- Nick, you had any additional comments.\nNick Akins : I'd say certainly, your question actually shows the reinforcement of our renewable\u2019s transformation because it's a perfect edge to natural gas of North Central were in place during the time of storm Yuri. It would have saved customers $225 million. So, when you think about the process we're going through, it's great to have natural gas it's -- and certainly -- but at the times where you can layer in renewables to do that, it turns out to be a significant benefit to consumers. So, it reinforces that. And I think probably this winter will show it.\nDurgesh Chopra : Understood. Thanks, guys. I appreciate the time.\nJulie Sloat : Thank you.\nOperator: We'll next go to the line of Andrew Weisel with Deutsche Bank. Go ahead, please.\nNick Akins : Good morning, Andrew.\nAndrew Weisel : Hey, good morning. Thanks for a lot of good updates here. One remaining question I had was after a few rate case settlements and expectations for several other outstanding cases to be resolved in the coming months, can you share your expectations around which sub we might file new rate cases over the next 12 months or so?\nNick Akins : We are -- I'm trying to think of what else will you be filling because just down here with jurisdiction we got a case that we expect approval of and certainly a lot of cases they're still ongoing and just about all the jurisdictions. So, I'd say we're always reviewing that on a regular basis at this point. We are playing with active cases that we got to get across the finish line and then determine where we are at.  The other part here is looking at what happens with denominator because Julie mentioned, low is changing significantly and it continues to do that as we emerge from hopefully a post-COVID world. And if that's the case, then that would be a determinant in terms of when we would file for any case. I think, of course, if we do have tax changes that occur, then that'll force a whole new view going forward to many of these cases. Just like it did when we got tax reform last time around, except this one, maybe, on the upside.\nAndrew Weisel : Okay, great. So, would it be fair to say that '22 at least the other second half of '22 might be a quieter year as far as the regulatory calendar than what we currently have?\nNick Akins : Probably quieter in terms of filings, but probably noisy in terms of results.\nAndrew Weisel : Alright. Thank you very much.\nOperator:  We will go on next, one, please. We'll go next to the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Go ahead, please.\nMichael Lapides : My name  I'm fine. Rough year for your -- by you being goals this year. A lot of change. Hey, got a couple of questions for you. What the Kentucky sale and you guys have -- your slide number five. I think it says, over the years has done a good job of detailing how hard it's been on authorized in Kentucky.  Now that Kentucky will be offshore play, when you look at the other jurisdictions, what are the ones that we say, hey, we still struggle to own authorize here? What are the structural changes? Whether it's legislation and we've seen lots of utilities in places like North Carolina, Kansas, Missouri, go in and make structural changes via legislation. What are the structural changes you are going to seek, outside of just normal rate case filings, that could help improve authorized versus  in those jurisdictions.\nNick Akins : You're seeing a fundamental shift and all the remaining operating companies. We made a lot of progress on Ryder's and we have a lot of focus on getting concurrent recovery in cash in the door and what you're seeing really in terms of a lot of these lags, is the amount of investment that we're placing in these companies. But as well as you make the transition from certainly from wires related activities with Ryder's and then the renewables conversion that occurs, the way we're doing the renewables is commensurate with the recovery.  So, we should see the authorized -- our returns be closer to the authorized as time goes forward. We don't see any fundamental issues in any of the jurisdictions that are left that says that we have significant headwinds. I mean, the only thing you could probably point to is the Turk issue at SWEPCO, but other than that -- and actually, when you think about Arkansas, we keep saying we're not recovering the Arkansas portion of the Turk. That's not because of the commission. That is because of the Supreme Court of Arkansas.  So, we've got very good relations with the commissions and all the jurisdictions, and we feel like the fundamentals are there for continued improvement relative to that regulatory lag that exists. And because we're spending on more areas and our generation is really renewables, and that's helping out, every time we put an investment in, and the timing of the investment improves the FFO-to-debt, improves the returns of the individual companies. And I think we'll continue to make progress in that regard. So, I would be -- I'm pretty optimistic that we'll continue to make progress in all of these jurisdictions.\nMichael Lapides : Got it. And just a quick follow-up, and just maybe a Julie one. Just curious when we think about your multi-year -- your guidance growth rate and the language around wanting to be at the high end, outside of the transmission segment, the standalone segment, what does that embed as an earned ROE at the rest of the regulated businesses?\nJulie Sloat : Michael, we always -- as Nick mentioned, we strive to be in the upper half of the guidance range, not necessary the upper end, although that 'd be very nice. So just a point of clarification there. And as it relates to returns, as you can see, we've kind of been hovering around the 9% ROE return level. I think that's a safe place for you to assume that we'll kind of hang out there for a while until we get a little more traction.  And the other thing if I could, circling back to your original question, when we look at the equalizer chart, often times we get questions around AEP taxes and why the lower  we relative to authorize there, and so back to your question around growth and how do you manage the business, AEP Texas, we continue to invest a significant amount of capital on an annualized basis.  And while we have very progressive rate recovery mechanisms in place that we really enjoy, I can tell you this, while the ROE may look a touch depressed relative to authorize, that Company continues to produce earnings growth and to save the 8% to 10% range. So that certifies our ability, back to your original point, getting that upper 1/2 of the range. So again, ROE, our system-wide average, assume roughly around 9% - ish and trending upward over time. And then around AEP Texas, k keeps in mind, the capital is intentional there as we continue to try to take care of the customer and grow that business. And it's paying dividends in 8% to 10% EPS growth out of it.\nNick Akins : And another thing if we look at is, we haven't gone that pages is actually the increase in equity layers as well. So, you see improvement in the equity layers and then, we're still investing and still meeting the 5% to 7% and being the upper half and that kind of thing. And of course, we continue to manage the FFO to debt towards the mid-teens. So that -- all of the pieces are starting to fit together. And there's a lot of optimization that will occur for us to -- how to execute on to ensure that we're continuing to meet the earnings objectives. But at the same time investing in the right things and enable us to bridge that gap on the regulatory lag.\nMichael Lapides : Got it. Thank you, guys. Much appreciated. Congrats to have Kentucky.\nNick Akins : Yeah. Sure thing.\nJulie Sloat : Thanks.\nOperator: All right. Speakers, we have no one else in queue at this time.\nDarcy Reese: Thank you for joining us on today's call. As always, the IR team will be available to answer any additional questions you may have. Allen, would you please give the replay information?\nOperator: Absolutely. Ladies and gentlemen, this conference will be made available for replay beginning at 05:30 PM today, October 28th, 2021 and lasting until November 4th, 2021 at midnight.  \nOperator: That will conclude your conference call for today.

        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Nick Akins",
            "content": "Okay. Thanks, Darcy. Welcome again, everyone to American Electric Power's third quarter 2021 earnings call. Today we're pleased to report a strong third quarter operating earnings of a $1.43 per share for the third quarter, this brings our year-to-date operating earnings to 376 per share versus 356 per share last year, which gives us confidence in raising the midpoint of our guidance range for 2021.  AEP service territory continues to prove us with resiliency and stability with continued economic recovery experienced in the third quarter. In fact, AEP posted the strongest sales quarter in over a decade, and the gross regional product for the AEP footprint of third quarter was the highest on record, as well as job growth being the strongest since 1984. The strength and diversity of our portfolio, the robustness of our organic growth opportunities, and our consistent ability to execute against our plan places AEP among what we believe should be one of the country's premium regulated utilities.  Our strength -- our strong performance this quarter, coupled with the level of economic recovery experienced within our footprint, provides us, once again, the confidence needed to raise our midpoint to 470 per share and nearer, the 2021 guidance range to 465 to 475 while reaffirming our 5% to 7% long-term earnings growth rate. And as I've stated previously, I would still be disappointed if we were not in that upper half of our long-term growth rate. The driver of our strong performance is the talent and commitment of our employees.  Our front line of central service work teams has continued to adapt to ensure the needs of our customers and communities are met day in day -- day in and day out throughout the pandemic. Like many industries, the face of work for AEP will never be the same. As employees return to the office, we have taken actions to ensure the safe return to the workplace environment. I remain appreciative of the dedication of our employees and have the utmost confidence in their continuing ability to successfully check and adjust as we adapt to the future.  We believe that this new work environment will continue to enable more efficiency, flexibility, and creativity, that will contribute to the culture to excel in meeting our strategic objectives. This new future of work along with digitization and automation will continue to provide benefits for our Achieving Excellence program. Our growth opportunities over the next decade are significant driven by our future forward renewables plan, that over 16 gigawatts of new renewables resources by 2030, and the transmission distribution investments needed to support the needs of a clean energy economy for our customers and communities.  Additionally, the completion of a strategic review of our Kentucky Companies and our decision to move forward with the sale delivered utilities enables us to focus our attention on executing that transaction and delivering on our gross strategy. So, let's cover the announced sale of Kentucky Power. Earlier this week, on Tuesday at market close, we announced the sale of Kentucky Power and Kentucky Transco to Liberty Utilities, the regulated utility operation of Algonquin Power.  The sale was a result of the strategic review that we launched back in April. The sale was subject to regulatory approvals, including approvals from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission which is within a 180 days, and the Kentucky Public Service Commission, within a 120 days. The transaction was also subject to federal clearance pursuant to Hart-Scott-Rodino, which typically is within 30 to 60 days, and the clearance from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., within 90 and a 120 days for that approval.  We anticipate making these regulatory filings in late November and early December. Separately, we will file -- with both the Kentucky, West Virginia and full commissions with necessary changes to the metro plant operating agreement to accommodate the ELG investments recently approved by the West Virginia Commission. The following will include a plan to resolve the question of Mitchell ownership post 2028. Both state commissions are expecting these filings as both issued recent orders directing us to do so.  These filings will be made in the mid to late November time frame. We're also very pleased with the outcome of the strategic review and know that the future owner of our Kentucky assets will be a great steward for all stakeholders in Kentucky, our value employees, customers, and certainly the communities. Lastly, I want to thank all the Kentucky employees and the corporate support employees for their patience, during this review and for their continued focus on safety and operational excellence during this period, and as the transaction is completed. Now, moving to several of the regulatory activities.  In Ohio, we expect an order in the fourth quarter on the settlement reached and filed with the Commission earlier this year. As a reminder of the settlement has broad support from the settling parties, including the commission staff, Ohio consumers' counsel, Industrial companies, commercial companies, and other entities like Ohio Hospital Association. Additionally, AEP Ohio's grid smart Phase III settlement was filed yesterday and paves the way to continue our deployment of advanced smart grid technologies, including completion of our AMR meter rollout, the remaining 475,000 rollout customers.  The unopposed settlement with support from commission staff allows consumer's counsel and several of our largest customers demonstrates that AEP Ohio continues to maintain a great working relationship with our regulator and interested parties. Public Service Company of Oklahoma reached a settlement in the rate case with the Oklahoma staff and other parties. The settlement was presented to the commission on October 5th. The black-box settlement includes 50.7 million net increase in rates while adding another 102.7 million in base rates.  In addition to continuing the practice of allowing some interim recovery of Capex riders, the rider collecting for Maverick and Sundance North-Central wind assets was also included, in orders expected by year-end with rates reflected in November bills. In Indiana, the unfollowed base rate case on the July 1st based on a future test year model seeking 97 million in net revenue increase with a 10% ROE.  Major items included recognition of over 500 million in capital investment per year in Indiana continuation of the transmission tracker a federal tax rider in the event of a change in federal tax rates and the advancement of AMI to provide customers greater control insight into their usage. The hearing was set before the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission on December 2nd, with an order expected by April of '22. In a Southwestern Electric Power Company's jurisdictions cases are pending in Louisiana, Texas, and Arkansas.  The SWEPCO Texas Commission deliberations set for November 18th. Parties filed exceptions to the preliminary draft order issued by the hearing  and replies. So those exceptions were filed yesterday. SWEPCO is seeking a net revenue increase of $73 million with an ROE of 10.35%. Our file includes investments made from February 2018, accelerated depreciation for  plant, a strong reserve, increased vegetation management.  We expect an order in the fourth quarter with rates being retroactive back to March of '21. In SWEPCO Louisiana testimony has been filed a hearing scheduled for January of '22. A case $6 million to $73 million net revenue increase and a 10.35% ROE in order to expect between the second third quarter of '22. And so, at Arkansas, we were seeking a $56 million net revenue increase with a 10.35 ROE. The following contains with formula rate plan for subsequent years and considers the pending retirement of previously announced call net assets.  This fall, we used time to align with the North-Central in-service dates and the provided mechanism both for recovery of costs associated with the investment and flow through of the PTC in SWEPCO customers. The hearing is set for March of '22. Both SWEPCO and PSO continue to make progress to recognize the Storm Uri expenditures. As a reminder, we filed for recovery of a lack returned over 5 years in Louisiana, Arkansas, Oklahoma, and Texas.  PSO is moving forward with the state on the securitization of costs as premiering under Oklahoma law. We are continuing our efforts to secure approvals and clear clarity regarding investments necessary to with the EPA, CCR, ELG requirements. We received  to construct the CCR compliance plans in Virginia, West Virginia, and Kentucky. While West Virginia approved ELG investments, Virginia, and Kentucky did not.  West Virginia has since determined it was in the public interest to move forward with EOG investments for all 3 plans and has issued an order regarding in support of West Virginia investing to preserve the option for these plants to run past 2028, approving both the investment inward cost recovery from West Virginia customers. We'll be working with our commissions to implement the West Virginia decision and making the necessary adjustments to respect each state's decision.  The Virginia Commission ask us to come back with more information, so we'll do that. We plan to lay out all the options before them, on how to satisfy their capacity needs. The Virginia PSC were approved the first-year revenue requirement of 4.8 million for broadband, which means we now have recovery for our world broadband efforts in both Virginia, and West Virginia.  We continue to engage legislators and commissions, and other states and stand ready, to invest in synergistic mid-model broadband, to support advanced group technologies, and rural broadband for our communities. We also understand, it's all about execution. On September 10th, AEP began commercial operation of the 287-megawatt Maverick Wind Energy Center in North Central Oklahoma.  Maverick was one of three wind projects that composed the North Central energy facilities, which will provide 1485 megawatts of clean energy to customers of our PSO and SWEPCO subsidiaries. The Traverse project, the largest single site wind farm in North America is well under construction and will come online in the January to April 2022 time frame. Transforming the way energy is generated, delivered, and consumed is necessary to support the needs of a clean energy economy and AEP continues to drive that transformation for the benefit of our customers and communities.  With the success of doors central setting the foundation of our future forward regulated renewables platform, we are diligently working on securing additional renewable opportunities for our customers. RFP filings are going -- are ongoing and planned in multiple states. So more to come on this as we file for approval, after resources, as a result of the RFP that were out in the market for which some of you probably have heard of, we will be able to provide greater detail on the progress being made.  Further, if federal efforts through the various tax proposals to extend and expand PTCs, ITCs for Clean Energy Resources succeed, even more benefits will be enjoyed by our customers. So now, we move quickly to the equalizer char now at this point, and I'll go quickly through this. So far, the average with the overall regulated operations is currently 9%. We generally target in the 9.5% to 10% range. So obviously we continue to work on that. AP Ohio came in at 9.3% for the third quarter, as blow authorized primarily due to timely recovery of capital investments, partially offset by higher O&M expenses.  We expect that ROE to trend around authorized levels, as we maintain concurrent capital recovery of distribution, transmission investments. We also, as I mentioned earlier, expect the commission order here in the fourth quarter of '21. After it came in at 7.3%, as below authorized due to higher amortization, primarily related to what's hard coal-fired-generating assets, and higher depreciation from increase Virginia depreciation rates and capital investment. And as you know, we are still at the Appeals Court appealing -- the Virginia Supreme Court, which is currently outstanding.  We filed appeal with that Virginia Supreme Court, so we're still waiting on that. As far as Kentucky is concerned, 6.9% below authorized due to loss of load from weak economic conditions and loss of major customers. Transmission revenues were also lower due to the delay in some capital projects. I&M came in at 10.3%. It's rare that's authorized ROE primarily due to increase in sales, partially offset by increased OEM and depreciation expenses associated with items continued capital investment programs. As far as PSO is concerned, came in at 7.6%.  It's below its authorized level primarily due to increased capital investment currently not in base rates and higher than anticipated equity due to the extreme February winter weather event. And of course, we expect the commission order here on the rate case in the fourth quarter of '21. SWEPCO came in at 8.2% as well authorized due to increased capital investment currently not in base rates and the continued impact of the Arkansas share of the Turk plant that is not in retail rates.  The Turkish, you again, accounts for about 110 basis points that we're not recovering in Arkansas. Again, as I mentioned earlier, we expect various commission orders, and particularly in Texas, in the fourth quarter of 2021, it's retroactive back to March. API Texas came in at 8.2% as below authorized primarily due to the significant level of investment in Texas. And of course, we have favorable regulatory treatment there with that annual DCOS and bi-annual TCOS filings to recover rates.  So significant levels of investment in Texas will continue to impact the ROE. But the expectation is for the ROE to trend towards an authorized 9.4% in the longer-term. AEP Transmission Holdco came in at 11.2%. It was above authorized primarily driven by differences between actual and forecasted expenses. The transfer will benefit from a forward-looking formula rate mechanism, which helps minimize regulatory lag, and that forecasted dollar rate is around 11% in 2021. So overall, continue to make progress.  Cases, obviously, we're waiting to hear the results of several cases that should provide some additional benefits, but that work continues. So, in closing, we are executing all  and continue to drive the results expected of a premium regulated utility. The AEP portfolio is one that has enabled our investments in the wire side of the business supporting our transmission investments, including the $0.33 per share this quarter, through our AEP trends -- transmission Holdco investments.  Our plan to transition our generation fleet and reduce carbon emissions by 80% by 2030 and net 0 by 2050 is well underway with 2 of our 3 wind facilities of our 2 billion investment in North-Central land under our belt, providing a solid foundation for the next decade of growth. Throughout this transition, we remain engaged in a trusted voice on energy transformation efforts, helping to ensure responsible transition to clean energy economy.  And we will continue to support Federal efforts in that regard and State efforts as well. Finally, our strong quarter performance gives us the confidence again, to set our midpoint at 470, or the range of 465 to 475. And we continue to have all 17,000 employees dedicated to our customers and communities to enable the strong performance. Our discipline and controlling cost, our progress to manage the portfolio, and the significance of our future organic growth opportunities provides us with a confidence needed, in raising the midpoint and nearing the guidance range.  Two weeks ago, I was really struck by the half time performance of the Ohio State Buckeyes marching band. They set their goals in my opinion, really high. Never do I expect to see a marching band dedicate their halftime show to the music of Rash (ph), to hear Tom saw your yyz(ph), the limelight and others, was truly amazing when they are difficult to even play. even though they were also marching while designing guitar players, drones, and other choreography on the field. The creativity and the execution came through to deliver a truly remarkable show.  It made me think of our team at AEP, on November 11th, I've been AEP CEO for 10-years, I'm fortunate to lead a great Company with great people who have an outstanding track record of delivering on the promises made to investors and customers consistently year in and year out. And we fully expect to continue our drive to take this Company to the next level toward the clean energy economy and a solid infrastructure foundation bucks-rating aggressive goals and delivering with creativity and solid execution. With that, I will turn it over to Julie. I love that. Hey you doing and how you? Yeah, I'm angst. Yes. That's why the operating agreement is being followed. Wheeling would become the operator and it does get transferred to Wheeling in 2028. And so that's really -- we're continuing with Kentucky being half-owner of Mitchell until that period of time. So, the Wheeling will take over the operations of the plant, the employees will move over to wheeling as well. And then we'll continue working with the West Virginia and Kentucky commission to get resolved the operating agreement and related issues.  And then, of course, at the end -- at 2028, it transfers over at fair market value . So that's the plan. And that will get followed here in November and December time frame and we'll go through that. And actually, both commissions have the incentive to get this resolved because we do have various views of the ELG piece of it. So regardless of whether we had this transaction or not, we would be needing to fall for the operating agreement change out just because the different directions of the commissions have gone. So, we'll get that resolved as part of process to the overall approvals. Yes, sure. I said over and over, I guess for a couple of years now but even beyond that. We do have to get to portfolio management to enable us to look at the sources and uses of the capital needs that we have. And to manage the balance sheet, as Julie has mentioned. We target the mid-teens, and we want to get there, and obviously, we're well on our way of getting there. So, we want to do that, but at the same time, be able to fund the capital growth.  And when you think about it, we've sold the unregulated generation, we sold Rover Rob's, we sold some hydro-related facilities. With Kentucky, we're talking about 6 billion of assets that have been sold, but they fueled substantial growth. I mean, to the tune of 7 billion a year in capital. It's part of the process to determine what the portfolio, needs to be in the future and we will continue to do that.  Certainly, we have Chuck, and Julie, and others will continue to review that portfolio, and we will manage it in a proper way. I'll say this, Kentucky Power, you think about the threshold -- at one point we talked about we always invested in coal units no matter what. And, obviously, we've changed that focus to make sure it's more deliveries of in terms of the decision points that are made. It's quite a move for AEP to get to a point where we're managing our portfolio in a way that, first of all, we became fully regulate, and then we start to look at that portfolio to determine what's the best approach to fuel 20 billion in potential renewables investment.  So, when you think about that, we have to consider it. And I can tell you, the last time we sold a regulated utility was, I guess, the Scranton Pennsylvania System, and then the Pennsylvania -- in Pennsylvania and the New Jersey system back in the 1940s and 50s. So, it's a pretty substantial change. And when you think about Kentucky Power sales, it was one of the first acquisitions of American Gas and Electric in 1922. So, by the time we get through this, it's been 100 years. So, when you think about the threshold level of portfolio management that has occurred in this Company, it really should show a lot on terms of our seriousness of making sure that we're managing that portfolio in the proper way. That's probably longer answer than what you asked for, but I want ed to at least get all that out there. Okay. Good morning, Shahriar. Yes. When you think about the way we're approaching the renewables fees, that the process has been, that we term the need for equity associated with those particular investments, when they actually come online and we get regulated recovery. So, we get the cash flow to support, those investments at the time they come online. That means, obviously our FFO to debt doesn't suffer as a result of that. So, if we continue that approach, and keep in mind too, I've always said that, for us to take a look at a regulated entity or other parts of our portfolio, doesn't match the future needs in terms of, where we are and where we're going as a Company.  Is there, if we have a chronically under-performing part of the portfolio, then it's important for us to take a look at. That may be temporary, it could be long term, but certainly we have to make sure that we're evaluating each one of these assets in a way that says, okay. It doesn't matter where it's located, as long as we're getting certainly the return expectation and also the forward view of the utility is positive as compared to with others. So, we have to compare in various parts of our service territories and that's where we make those decisions. Yeah, I do. And in your -- when we'd actually go do the analysis and we've done analysis for all the jurisdictions, but conditions changed, low changes certainly PTCs, ITCs can change as a result, which changed the business cases were some may have been on the margins particularly in the east now become benefits to customers. So, I think those numbers will continue to change and I can tell you from what I've seen so far. Those numbers will change. And some will go out, some will go down. But overall, normally, it should be on path, what we've talked about.  And we'll have more to report on that. Probably during first quarter '22, because we'll have the integrated resource plans. And when those integrated resource plans are filed, that's where I mentioned today is you will have a more definitive view of what those projects look like because there will be the results of RFPs and there will be the results of actual projects that are put in for regulated approval. So, more definition, but I would certainly say that normally they will be in that category we've previously discussed. Yeah. And I would say that when you see that, it certainly will reflect, I don't know if you call it a risk-adjusted approach or whatever, but it's a nominal view for us to make financing plans, and then just like with North Central, we make decisions on whether it goes up or down based upon our ownership. Thank you. Yes. Yes. I hear you. Well, I would say, and we've been vocal about this and the industry has been vocal about it, if you put a minimum 15% tax and a lot of us are, as you know, heavy on capital, and its growth capital, and it's also infrastructure-related capital. So, an increase with the minimum tax would certainly have an accruing effect on our ability to continue with not only development of infrastructure and having effect on that, not to mention customers' bills ultimately because the taxes were passed through to our customers.  But also, the administration has a focus on green energy and it will have an effect on renewables transformation that's existing as well. So, I think I think they'll put a pail over all the utilities' ability to continue invest in capital in the way that we are. Now, if we do that, then obviously there's customer impact associated with it. And again, it's a hidden tax on our customers. So, we're not for that provision. I think actually, we've been very worthwhile about this and trying to be an honest broker when we're talking about CEBP and all the other things that -- it was important for us to be able to make this transformation from a clean energy standpoint.  Certainly, the PTCs, ITCs with expansion of long-term storage, nuclear, and certainly in terms of wind and solar, are very important to continue those process, to move to clean energy economy, and we can go a long way there. This industry is very focused on doing that, and any kind of tax headwind that goes the other direction is not helpful. I think you probably hear that across-the-board. Yes. But it's in the public interest, obviously. Because they have to look at the suitor and determine is that the right route approach. And as I've done in the proper way and actually there has been some discussions in Kentucky previously. I think it's probably gone past some of that now that -- I want to make sure we were operating Kentucky the way we should. And we've been operating it the way we always have.  So, we've been investing, we've been doing the things that we need to do. Whether we owned it or not. And I think certainly the buyer has recognized that and during the transition, we will continue to support a smooth transition to ensure that the services provided and things that need to be done to make Kentucky Power successful, we'll be there to do it. And of course, we'll support Liberty Utilities in Algonquin in doing that. Thanks, Steve. Morning, Durgesh. I'd say certainly, your question actually shows the reinforcement of our renewable's transformation because it's a perfect edge to natural gas of North Central were in place during the time of storm Yuri. It would have saved customers $225 million. So, when you think about the process we're going through, it's great to have natural gas it's -- and certainly -- but at the times where you can layer in renewables to do that, it turns out to be a significant benefit to consumers. So, it reinforces that. And I think probably this winter will show it. Good morning, Andrew. We are -- I'm trying to think of what else will you be filling because just down here with jurisdiction we got a case that we expect approval of and certainly a lot of cases they're still ongoing and just about all the jurisdictions. So, I'd say we're always reviewing that on a regular basis at this point. We are playing with active cases that we got to get across the finish line and then determine where we are at.  The other part here is looking at what happens with denominator because Julie mentioned, low is changing significantly and it continues to do that as we emerge from hopefully a post-COVID world. And if that's the case, then that would be a determinant in terms of when we would file for any case. I think, of course, if we do have tax changes that occur, then that'll force a whole new view going forward to many of these cases. Just like it did when we got tax reform last time around, except this one, maybe, on the upside. Probably quieter in terms of filings, but probably noisy in terms of results. You're seeing a fundamental shift and all the remaining operating companies. We made a lot of progress on Ryder's and we have a lot of focus on getting concurrent recovery in cash in the door and what you're seeing really in terms of a lot of these lags, is the amount of investment that we're placing in these companies. But as well as you make the transition from certainly from wires related activities with Ryder's and then the renewables conversion that occurs, the way we're doing the renewables is commensurate with the recovery.  So, we should see the authorized -- our returns be closer to the authorized as time goes forward. We don't see any fundamental issues in any of the jurisdictions that are left that says that we have significant headwinds. I mean, the only thing you could probably point to is the Turk issue at SWEPCO, but other than that -- and actually, when you think about Arkansas, we keep saying we're not recovering the Arkansas portion of the Turk. That's not because of the commission. That is because of the Supreme Court of Arkansas.  So, we've got very good relations with the commissions and all the jurisdictions, and we feel like the fundamentals are there for continued improvement relative to that regulatory lag that exists. And because we're spending on more areas and our generation is really renewables, and that's helping out, every time we put an investment in, and the timing of the investment improves the FFO-to-debt, improves the returns of the individual companies. And I think we'll continue to make progress in that regard. So, I would be -- I'm pretty optimistic that we'll continue to make progress in all of these jurisdictions. And another thing if we look at is, we haven't gone that pages is actually the increase in equity layers as well. So, you see improvement in the equity layers and then, we're still investing and still meeting the 5% to 7% and being the upper half and that kind of thing. And of course, we continue to manage the FFO to debt towards the mid-teens. So that -- all of the pieces are starting to fit together. And there's a lot of optimization that will occur for us to -- how to execute on to ensure that we're continuing to meet the earnings objectives. But at the same time investing in the right things and enable us to bridge that gap on the regulatory lag. Yeah. Sure thing."

            "content": "Thanks so much, Nick. Thanks, Darcy. And Nick I love your Buckeye reference. Go Bucks. Thank you very much. Big game this weekend. Anyway, it's good to be with everybody this morning. I'm going to walk us through the third quarter and year-to-date financial results. I'll share some updates on our service territory load, and finish with some commentary on financing plans, credit metrics, and liquidity. Let's go to slide six, which shows the comparison of GAAP top rating earnings for the quarter and year-to-date periods.  GAAP earnings for the third quarter were $1.59 per share, compared to a $1.51 per share in 2020. GAAP earnings through September were $3.90 per share compared to $3.56 per share in 2020. There's a reconciliation of GAAP to operating earnings on Pages 14 and 15 of the presentation today. Let's go to Slide 7 where we can talk about our quarterly operating earnings performance by segment.  Operating earnings for the third quarter totaled $1.43 per share or $717 million compared to $1.47 per share or $728 million in 2020. Operating earnings from the vertically integrated utilities were $0.87 per share, up $0.02. Favorable drivers included, rate changes across multiple jurisdictions, weather primarily in the West, transmission revenue and lower income tax.  These items were offset somewhat by higher O&M expenses to in part to lower prior year O&M, which included actions we took to adjust to the pandemic and higher depreciation expense, as well as lower normalized margins and lower AFUDC. The Transmission and Distribution Utilities segment earned $0.31 per share flat to last year. Favorable drivers in this segment included rate changes, transmission revenue, and income taxes.  Offsetting these favorable items were O&M expenses again, a function of lower prior year O&M associated with pandemic growing efforts, depreciation, and property taxes. The AEP Transmission Holdco segment continued to grow, contributing $0.33 per share, that was an improvement of $0.05, driven by the return-on-investment growth. Generation and Marketing produced $0.04 per share, down $0.09 from last year, includes by the prior-year land sales, lower retail volumes and margins, generation and income taxes.  Finally, Corporate and other was down $0.02 per share driven by lower investment gains, and unfavorable net interest expense, which was partially offset by lower income taxes. The lower investment gains, are related to a pullback of some of the ChargePoint related gains, we've talked about on prior quarters. Let's have a look at our year-to-date results on slide number 8. Operating earnings through September totaled $3.76 per share, or $1.9 billion compared to $3.56 per share, or $1.8 billion in 2020.  Looking at the drivers by segment, operating earnings for vertically integrated utilities, were $1.87 per share down $0.03, due to higher O&M and depreciation expenses. Other smaller decreases included lower normalized sales and wholesale load, higher other taxes, and a prior period fuel adjustment. Offsetting these unfavorable variances were weight changes across various operating companies and the impact of weather due to warmer than normal temps in the winter of 2020 and the summer 2021, which created a favorable year-over-year comp for us.  Other favorable items in this segment included higher off-system sales, transmission revenue, net interest expense, and income taxes. The transmission and distribution utilities segments earned $0.85 per share, up a penny from last year. Earnings in this segment were up due to higher transmission revenue, rate changes, weather, normalized load, and income taxes. Partially offsetting these favorable items were increased depreciation, O&M, other taxes, and interest expenses.  AEP Transmission Holdco segment contributed $1.02 per share up $0.27 from last year, related to investment growth and favorable year-over-year true-up. Generation and marketing produced $0.20 per share down $0.11 from last year due to favorable one-time items in the prior year relating to an Oklaunion ARO adjustment in the sale of Conesville and reduced land sales in 2021.  Higher energy margins and low expenses in the generation business offset the unfavorable  marketplaces on the wholesale business during storm yearly in February. We also saw an unfavorable result in retail due to lower power and gas margins. Income taxes were also unfavorable. Finally, Corporate matter was up $0.06 per share driven by investment gains and lower taxes and partially offset by higher O&M. Let me take a quick minute here to talk about the investment gain, which is predominantly a function of our direct and indirect Investment ChargePoint. As you'll see on the waterfall, was produced a $0.06 benefit year-to-date in 2021, as compared to the corresponding 2020 period. You may recall that in the fourth quarter at full-year 2020, this investment produced a $0.05 contribution, and we would expect the year-over-year bids to be more pronounced at this point in 2021, as we have no benefit during the same period in 2020.  Turning to Page 9, I'll update you on our normalized low performance for the quarter. We, then, get into the specifics. Let me start by reminding everyone that everything you see on the slide is showing year-over-year growth. That means these numbers can be influenced by what was going on last year or what is happening now in 2021. Given all that occurred in the economy last year, it's obvious that these growth rates are at least partially being influenced by the comparison basis. This leads to the natural follow-up question like, how does today's low compare to pre -pandemic level? And I'll get to that question on the next slide. But before I do, let's take a look what a -- at what our normalized low growth was for the quarter. Starting in the upper left corner, normalized residential sales were down 1.6% compared to last year, bringing the year-to-date declined down to 9/10 of a percent.  That means that last year, residential sales were up 3.8% in the third quarter when the economy was just starting to reopen. One year later, they're down only 1.6%, which suggests there has been a shift up in residential sales, as more businesses have embraced a remote workforce for jobs that can be performed at home. The last item to point out on the residential charges that you'll notice that we added a new bar to the right, showing our latest projection for 2021 based on the load forecast update.  The original guidance assumed residential sales would decrease by 1.1% in 2021. The latest update showed an improvement as we now expect residential to end the year down 9/10 of a percent. Moving right, weather-normalized commercial sales increased by 5%, bringing the year-to-date growth up to 4.3%. Last year's third quarter commercial sales were down 4.6%. So again, we're seeing a net positive stories of commercial sales classes bouncing back faster than expected.  And while we're seeing a strong bounce back and the sector's most impacted by the pandemic such as schools, churches, and hotels, we're actually seeing the strongest growth in commercial sales this year from growth in data centers, especially in the Central Ohio. To give you some perspective, last year, the sector was the 9th largest commercial sector across the AP system. Today, it's the 6th largest, and will likely move further up in the rankings as more data center loads are expected to come in online over the next several years.  You will also notice that our latest load forecast update now suggests that commercial sales were end-year up 3.7% as opposed to the 0.5% decline assumed in the original guidance forecast. The economy has recovered much faster than we originally assumed, which is one of the reasons why we've updated the forecast and ensuring an improvement in that regard. In the lower left corner, you'll see that industrial sales also had a very strong quarter.  Industrial sales for the quarter increased by 7%, bringing the year-to-date up to 4.2%. Industrial sales were up at every operating Company in nearly every sector. I point out, however, that the 7% growth in the third quarter this year did not quite offset the 7.8% decline experienced last year. Which means we still have a little more room to grow before the industrial class fully recovers from the pandemic recession. The good news is we have a lot of momentum to work with.  The latest node update now projects industrial sales will end the year up 4.3%, which is 2.4% higher than assumed in the original guidance forecast. Finally, when you put it all together in the lower left corner, you'll see that normalized retail sales increased by 3% for the quarter and were up 2.3% for the first 9 months. But all indications that recovery from the pandemic and recession is happening faster than expected and our service territory is positioned to benefit from future economic growth. You'll recall that the original guidance forecast assumed normalized load growth of 2/10 of a percent in 2021. Based on our latest update, we're now expecting to end the year up 2.2%, which is a supporting factor in narrowing our earnings guidance range, and raising the midpoint for 2021. Turning to Slide 10, I want to answer the question from earlier, that asked how our current low performance compares to pre -pandemic levels. This bar chart is designed to answer that question. The blue bars are the same year-to-date bars that we shared on the prior page. As a reminder, these represent growth versus 2020, which was influenced by the restrictions implemented to manage the public health crisis.  The orange bars here show how the year-to-date sales in 2021 compared to 2019, which was the most recent pre - pandemic year for comparison. These bars tell us how close we are to a full recovery from the pandemic. Starting at the left, you'll notice that a reported residential sales are down 9/10 of a percent compared to last year, but they're actually up 1.6% compared to our pre -pandemic levels. This is a gauge for how our customers behaviors have changed since the pandemic, with more people working from home.  The next bar shows that while commercial sales are up 4.3% compared to last year. There are still 8/10 of the percent below the pre -pandemic levels. Given the recent growth we're seeing, especially in the data center nodes, we would expect commercial sales to fully recover nearly soon. Moving further, right, you can notice that while the industrial sales were up 4.2% compared to last year, they are still 3% lower than pre -pandemic levels.  Given some of the headwinds for manufacturing today with supply chain disruptions, later shortages, et cetera, it may take a little longer before the industrial quest fully recovers from the pandemic recession. But we do expect to eclipse the pre -pandemic levels in 2022. In total, our normalized load is up 2.3% compared to last year and is now within 7/10 of a percent of being fully recovered from the pandemic, so it's safe to say that we're pleased with the strength and balance of this recovery in the AEP system. Let's check on the Company's capitalization and liquidity on Page 11.  On a GAAP basis, our debt-to-capital ratio decreased 0.4% from the prior quarter to 62.2%. When adjusted for the storm during event, the ratio is slightly lower than it was at year-end 2022, sorry 2020, and now stands at 61.5%. Let's talk about our FFO to debt metric, as in the first and second quarter. Effective storm yearly continues to have a temporary and noticeable impact, on this 2021 metric. Taking a look at the upper right quadrant on this page, you'll see our FFO to debt metrics based on traditional Moody's and GAAP calculated basis. As well as an adjusted Moody's and GAAP calculated basis. On a traditional unadjusted basis, our FFO - to -debt ratio increased by 0.9% during the quarter to 10.2% on a Moody's basis. And just, again, reiterate, radio agencies continue to take the anticipated recovery into consideration as it relates to our credit ratings. So very important to note that. On an adjusted basis, the Moody's FFO-to-debt metric is 13.6%.  This figure removes or adjusts the calculation to eliminate the impact of approximately 1.2 billion of cash outflows associated with covering the unplanned urine-driven fuel and purchase power in the SPP region, directly impacting PSO and SWEPCO in particular. The metric is also adjusted to remove the effect of the associated debt we used to fund the unplanned payments. This should give you a sense of where we would be from a business - as -usual perspective with that 13.6%.  Importantly, as Nick mentioned, the recovery of the  fuel and purchase power expense in the PSO and SWEPCO jurisdictions is well underway and we're making progress. As a result, inconsistent with what we have previously communicated, we still anticipate our cash flow metrics to return to below the mid-teens target range next year. Obviously, we are trying to push towards the mid-teens range, but that will take us a little while longer, but we're definitely on our way there.  And as you know, we'll keep you posted on our progress. Before we leave the Balance Sheet topic, I do want to make note of the intended change to our 2022 financing plan, in light of our announced sale of Kentucky Power and Kentucky Transco. You may recall that we had planned to issue $1.4 billion of equity in 2022, that's inclusive of $100 million dividend reinvestment plan to fund our growth Capex program, where we will provide our typical 3-year forward annual review of our cash flows and financial metrics at the upcoming EEI Conference, where we can expect to see is that the 2022 forecast will be adjusted to eliminate the previously planned $1.4 billion of equity financing that I just mentioned with any residual proceeds being used to reduce a small portion of the 2022 debt financing that we had planned.  These actions will have no impact on our previously stated credit metric targets or messaging in that regard. On the slide deck today, on page 39, you'll see our current cash flow forecast, with which you are already familiar, We've included a note on the side to reflect the fact that the numbers have not been updated for the announced Kentucky transaction, along with the red circle around the 2022 financing -- equity financing amount that will be changed and updated when we roll out the new view in a couple of weeks in conjunction with the EEI conference.  So, while we're talking about the Kentucky transaction, I can also share that we expect that the sale will be $0.01 to $0.02 accretive in 2022, and we will reflect this in our 2022 earnings guidance that we provide to you at the EEI Conference. Okay. So back to our regularly-scheduled earnings call programming and commentary. Let's take a quick moment to visit our liquidity summary on the lower right slot -- side of Slide 11.  Our 5-year $4 billion bank revolver and 2-year $1 billion revolving credit facility, along with proceeds from the quarter-end debt issuance, support our liquidity position, which means we were strong at $5.1 billion. If you look at the lower left side of the page, you will see that our qualified pension continues to be well funded at a 104%. Additionally, our OPEB is funded at a 173.9%. Let's go slide 12 and I'll do a quick wrap up and we can get to your questions.  Our performance through the first 3 quarters of this year gives us confidence to narrow our operating guidance to the upper half of our current range, resulting in the new range of $4.65 per share to $4.75 per share with a midpoint of $4.70 per share. As we stated, we are committed to our long-term growth, rate target of 5% to 7%. Today's 2021 earnings guidance revision is yet another demonstration of our drive to deliver performance in the upper half of our guidance range. From a strategic perspective, we're making significant progress in addressing items that are top of mind for our current and perspective investors.  We're mounting contract to sell Kentucky Power and Kentucky Transco, which we expect to complete in the second quarter of 2022. This transaction enables us to avoid the 1.4 billion equity issuance, that was part of our original forecast, would share with you for 2022. Therefore, alleviates the overhang, the equity overhang. Also allows us to deliver transaction that we estimate to be 1 to 2  in 2022.  We will be more able to do this, while concurrently preserving our ability to get our FFO to debt metrics comfortably, into that mid to low teens range by 2022, which is commensurate with a Moody's BAAT stabilizing, as we continue to target that. The intention is to remain in this credit metric range. Again, with a preference to try to get closer to that midpoint, as we move along in time. All of this positions us to continue our generation transformation, which is underpinned by the renewable investment opportunity we have shared with you in complemented by our ongoing energy delivery investment.  So here you can expect to see from us at the upcoming EEI Conference in early November. In addition to the updated 3-year forward cash flow and financing plan, we'll be introducing and sharing the details behind our 2022 Earnings Guidance and our longer-term capital plan, we typically got out 5 years, all of which will incorporate the effects of the announced Kentucky sales. So, with that, surely, we do appreciate your time and attention and I'm going to turn it over to the operator so we can get to your questions. And sure. What you should anticipate is when we go to EEI, you'll see a refreshed 5-year forward Capex plan, so '22 through '26, and you'll start to begin to see a little bit more of this renewable opportunity dropped in. So, stay tuned for that, and we'll be able to talk more granularly with you here in a couple of weeks. Yes, thanks for the question, Steve. You're right. I mean, we do lose the funds from operations that relates to Kentucky and Kentucky Transco. Although, we got to keep in mind that we also eliminate about $1.3 billion of debt associated with those assets to because that goes away. And the marathon that we think through, just to take it a step further is if we avoid issuing equity, we avoid having to cover off additional dividends that were in our original plan.  So, another to a sidestep that as well. And that comes with, maybe also having some additional dollars to reduce debt. As I mentioned in my opening comments, anything above and beyond that $1.4 billion which channeled toward debt reduction that was otherwise planned for 2022. And then also, keep in mind that Kentucky Power had barely strained FFO - to -debt to begin with. So, to eliminate that piece of, I guess, drag to the overall average FFO -to-debt for their organization is also a net positive for us.  So, we are able to put these numbers together. And quite frankly, from an FFO - to -debt perspective, it is mildly beneficial and obviously a little bit of a cost on the debt-to-cap because we're not issuing additional equity. But the numbers all do hang together and coincidentally we'll be able to take literally that $1.4 billion of planned equity out of the plan, and again, you'll see that at EEI when we'll refresh the forecast. Got you. You'll see 2024 when we rollout our EEI guidance, so 3 years forward. But, as we continue to say, we are talking about mid - to -low teens. And the reason I say that is, as I mentioned today, if you look at our FFO to debt on an adjusted basis, so backing out the yearly consequence, we have something like 13.6% on a Moody's basis. As you know, our target has been to be around that Baa2 stable rating.  That's why we talk about mid - to -low teens or low - to -mid teens. Obviously, our preference and our expectation are to start to push more towards what I would characterize as mid. It'd be nice to have at least a 14 handle on that FFO to debt, and that is absolutely the plan, but we'll be able to share more with you as we get to EEI and build that forecast, but I wouldn't change how you're thinking about it. So, thinking about mid to low teens as it relates to Moody's BAAT, with a preference towards 14 plus percent. I will take this from a customer rate perspective as I could, because that's how we think about it. Because ultimately this impacts our customers. When we think about, for example, a decent sensitivity analyses around, let's say a 10% hike in natural gas prices as we all know, they've gone up substantially. The impact to customer rates varies significantly from 1 operating Company to the next, depending on the field mix.  So, for example, if I looked at Appalachian Power Company, the average residential impact price in terms of the 10% hiking gas prices would equate to about a 0.9% increase in the customer's rate. Let's compare and contrast that to say PSO or SWEPCO, whether there's much more gas concentration. So PSO, we'd be talking about 1.6% increase in customer rates. SWEPCO, 1.5%. So, this is something we're very sensitive to, because as you know, overall, we're extremely sensitive to customer rate increases and the aggregate as we continue to execute on our general Capex program. I don't know if -- Nick, you had any additional comments. Thank you. Michael, we always -- as Nick mentioned, we strive to be in the upper half of the guidance range, not necessary the upper end, although that 'd be very nice. So just a point of clarification there. And as it relates to returns, as you can see, we've kind of been hovering around the 9% ROE return level. I think that's a safe place for you to assume that we'll kind of hang out there for a while until we get a little more traction.  And the other thing if I could, circling back to your original question, when we look at the equalizer chart, often times we get questions around AEP taxes and why the lower  we relative to authorize there, and so back to your question around growth and how do you manage the business, AEP Texas, we continue to invest a significant amount of capital on an annualized basis.  And while we have very progressive rate recovery mechanisms in place that we really enjoy, I can tell you this, while the ROE may look a touch depressed relative to authorize, that Company continues to produce earnings growth and to save the 8% to 10% range. So that certifies our ability, back to your original point, getting that upper 1/2 of the range. So again, ROE, our system-wide average, assume roughly around 9% - ish and trending upward over time. And then around AEP Texas, k keeps in mind, the capital is intentional there as we continue to try to take care of the customer and grow that business. And it's paying dividends in 8% to 10% EPS growth out of it. Thanks."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session.  As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference to our host, Vice President of Investor Relations, Ms. Darcy Reese. Please go ahead.\nDarcy Reese: Thank you, Toni. Good morning, everyone. And welcome to the second quarter 2021 earnings call for American Electric Power. We appreciate you taking the time to join us today. Our earnings release, presentation slides and related financial information are available on our website at aep.com.\nNick Akins: Okay. Thanks, Darcy. And welcome again everyone to American Electric Power\u2019s second quarter 2021 earnings call. Today we reported a strong second quarter operating earnings of a $1.18 per share versus a $1.08 for the same period of 2020. Our second quarter results reflect significant progress in terms of economic recovery throughout AEP service territory, with a continued focus on OEM as we navigate through what is hopefully an emergence from the COVID-19 pandemic. Gross regional product has already exceeded its pre-pandemic levels and important across AEP service territory is now 2% of its pre-pandemic levels after adding over a 163,000 jobs in the first six months of this year. Increased vaccinations combined with the additional fiscal stimulus from the American Rescue Plan are contributing to the strong demand for goods and services throughout the economy. AEP\u2019s normalized retail sales in the second quarter of 2021 were the highest we have seen since the second quarter of 2018. Clearly, we are pleased with the improvements we have seen thus far and we will continue to monitor the recovery\u2019s progress over the second half of the year.  Accordingly, we are reaffirming our 2021 guidance range of $4.55 per share to $4.75 per share and a 5% to 7% long-term growth rate and would be again disappointed not to be in the upper half of our stated guidance range as we have previously stated. Julie will be discussing these issues in more detail in her report. Rate case activity across our jurisdictions continues to be active and substantial. In Ohio, we are awaiting an order by the commission on the settlement reach involved with the commission earlier this year. As a reminder, the settlement has broad support in the settling parties including the commission staff, the Ohio Consumers Council, industrial companies, commercial companies and other entities like the Ohio Hospital Association. We expect a decision in the third quarter of this year. Public Service Company of Oklahoma filed a rate case at the end of April. PSO is seeking $115.4 million net revenue increase and a 10% ROE. The following transitions North Central costs from the right established in the approval into base rates.\nJulie Sloat: All right. Thanks, Nick. Thanks, Darcy. It\u2019s good to be with everyone this morning. I am going to walk us through the second quarter and year-to-date financial results, share some thoughts on our service territory load and finish with a review of our credit metrics and liquidity. So let\u2019s go to slide number six which shows the comparison of GAAP to operating earnings for the quarter and year-to-date periods. GAAP earnings for the second quarter were $1.16 per share, compared to $1.05 per share in 2020. GAAP earnings through June were $2.31 per share, compared to $2.05 per share in 2020. There\u2019s a reconciliation of GAAP to operating earnings on pages 14 and 15 of the presentation today. So let\u2019s walk through our quarterly operating earnings performance by segment that\u2019s laid out on slide number seven. Operating earnings for the second quarter totaled $1.18 per share or $590 million, compared to $1.98 per share or $534 million in 2020. Operating earnings for the Vertically Integrated Utilities were $0.45 per share, down $0.10 driven by a year-over-year increase in the O&M due to lower prior year O&M, which included actions we took to adjust to the pandemic. Other pressures included lower wholesale load and higher depreciation and other taxes. These items were partially offset by the impact of rate changes across multiple jurisdictions, higher normalized retail load, transmission revenue and off system sales. The Transmission and Distribution Utilities segment earned $0.31 per share, up $0.02 from last year. Favorable drivers in this segment included higher normalized retail load, transmission revenue and rate changes, partially offsetting these favorable items were higher tax, depreciation and O&M expenses, as well as unfavorable weather and lower AFUDC. The AEP Transmission Holdco segment continued to grow contributing $0.34 per share, an improvement of $0.15, which got a boost because of the unfavorable annual true-up last year consistent with the 2021 earnings guidance assumptions we had provided to you. Our fundamental return on investment growth continued as net plant increased by $1.4 billion or 13% since June of last year. Generation and Marketing produced $0.09 per share, down $0.02 from last year, influenced by the prior year land sales and one-time items relating to an Oklaunion ARO adjustment in the sale of Conesville. We were mostly offset in the generation business by higher energy margins and lower expenses from the retirement of Oklaunion. Finally, Corporate and Other was up $0.05 per share, driven by investment gains, lower tax -- and lower taxes, which was partially offset by higher O&M and net interest expense. So bear with me a moment, I am going to talk a little bit more about that investment gain as we walk through the year-to-date view. So, if you flip to slide eight, we can look at year-to-date results. Operating earnings through June totaled $2.33 per share or $1.2 billion, compared to $2.10 per share or $1 billion in 2020. Looking at the drivers by segment, operating earnings for Vertically Integrated Utilities were $1 per share, down $0.05 due to higher O&M and depreciation expenses. Other smaller increases included lower normalized retail and wholesale load, other -- higher other taxes and a prior period fuel adjustment. The impact of weather was favorable due to the warmer than normal temps in the winter of 2020. Other favorable items in this segment included the impact of rate changes across multiple jurisdictions, higher off-system sales and transmission revenue. The Transmission and Distribution Utilities segment earned $0.54 per share, up $0.01 from last year. Earnings in this segment were up due to higher transmission revenue, rate changes, weather and normalized retail load, partially offsetting these favorable items were higher tax, depreciation, O&M and interest expenses, as well as lower AFUDC. The AEP Transmission Holdco segment contributed $0.68 per share, up $0.21 from last year, for the same reasons identified in the quarterly comparison. Generation and Marketing produced $0.16 per share, down $0.02 from last year, due to favorable one-time items in the prior year relating to an Oklaunion ARO adjustment in the sale of Conesville, higher energy margins and lower expenses in the generation business offset the unfavorable ERCOT market prices on the wholesale business during Storm Uri in February. The decrease in renewables business was driven by lower energy margins and higher expenses. Finally, Corporate and Other was up $0.08 per share, driven by investment gains and lower taxes and partially offset by higher O&M. So, let me take a quick moment to comment about the investment gain which is predominantly a function of our direct and indirect investment in charge point. As you will see on the waterfall, this produced a $0.09 benefit year-to-date in 2021 as compared to the corresponding 2020 period. You may recall that in the fourth quarter and full year 2020, this investment produced a $0.05 contribution and we would expect the year-over-year variance to be more pronounced at this point in 2021 as we had no benefit during the same period in 2020. So, turning to page nine, I will update you on our normalized load performance for the quarter. Before I talk about class level trends, I\u2019d like to start with a couple of observations at a macro level. So, first of all, since all of these charts are showing a year-over-year growth, it is important to recall that the second quarter of 2020 was at the trough of the recession when restrictions on businesses to manage the public health crisis were at their greatest. So the magnitude of growth percentages is being influenced by the comparison basis. And the second observation is that there has been a steady path to recovery since bottoming out in the second quarter of last year. The momentum we are seeing is a positive sign for the economic recovery throughout the serviced territory. So, if you start in the upper left corner, you will see that normalized residential sales were down 3.1% compared to last year bringing year-to-date decline down to 0.5%. As mentioned earlier, the comparison basis is the key here. You will notice that residential sales were up 6.2% when the COVID restrictions were at their greatest. In fact, one year later, they are only down 3.1% which suggests some of the increase in residential is having some staying power as more businesses have embraced a remote workforce for jobs that can be easily performed at home. In fact, the second quarter normalized sales in 2021 were the second highest second quarter on record exceeding every second quarter before the pandemic began. So moving to the right, weather normalized commercial sales increased by 10% bringing the year-to-date growth up to 3.9%. If you compare this with the residential class, you will notice the commercial sales growth in the second quarter is more symmetrical with last year when sales were down just over 10%. The growth in commercial sales for the quarter is spread across all operating companies and most sectors. The only sector that was down slightly compared to last year was grocery stores, which were very busy at the onset of the pandemic trying to keep shelves stocked when panic purchasing was at its highest. So moving to the lower left corner, you will see that the industrial sales also bounced back in the second quarter. Industrial sales for the quarter increased by 12.8% bringing the year-to-date growth up to 2 -- up 2.8%. Similar to commercial class -- the commercial class, you will see a symmetrical recovery compared to the second quarter of 2020 when sales were down 12.4%. Also industrial sales were up at every operating company and nearly every sector. The only industrial sector in our top 10 that reported less sales this year compared to the second quarter of 2020 is a paper manufacturing sector, which ironically was also higher last year, partially due to panic purchasing of toilet paper. This is a phenomenon that none of us is likely to forget especially if you were one of the folks who didn\u2019t get a jump on it. Finally, in the lower right corner, you can see that in total normalized retail sales increased by 6.3% for the quarter and were up 1.9% through the first half of the year. By all indications, recovery from the pandemic and recession are on a firm footing. So, let\u2019s go to slide 10. There are two more charts here that help put the second quarter normalized sales performance into perspective. The bar chart shows the last five years of weather normalized retail sales in the second quarters for the AEP System. Retail load performance in the second quarter of 2021 has not only recovered from the recession, but this is also the highest second quarter since 2018. The line chart on the bottom of this page shows the seasonally adjusted retail sales by quarter which provides an illustration of the trend of the recovery, and again, confirms that our current level of sales is the highest since the second quarter of 2018. So, before we leave the load story, let me remind you of an important factor to consider when evaluating the impact of load growth. The mix matters. So, while we are seeing strong growth now in commercial and industrial sales, those are priced at much lower realizations than the decline we are seeing in residential sales. To further illustrate this point, the impact of the pandemic was most pronounced in our biggest metropolitan area, that\u2019s Columbus Ohio. Since Columbus -- since AEP Ohio is in the T&D Utility segment where we only collect an unbundled rate, the strong recovery that we are seeing this year is coming in at much lower realizations in the system average. Finally, let me remind you that there are rate design mechanisms in place to limit the exposure when entering a downturn that can also limit the impact when you are coming out of recession. So while the industrial sales are up significantly this year versus last year, it does not mean that revenues will increase by the same percentage. So what does all this mean when we think about the remainder of 2020? Well, it means that our confidence in our earnings guidance range is fortified by what we are seeing. It suggests that the low trends we anticipated are coming to fruition as the chart on page nine illustrates. Our continued investment at Transco is fueling strong performance in this segment beyond the favorable true-up impact that we had anticipated. And while O&M is up, it\u2019s enabling us to take care of our business and customer needs given the low growth we are seeing. Obviously, we have the second half of the year to navigate, but we are pleased with the direction and are keeping a watchful eye on economic activity in our service territory, while scanning for any impact associated with rise in COVID variant. So, let\u2019s check in on the company\u2019s capitalization and liquidity position on page 11. On a GAAP basis, our debt to capital ratio increase 0.1% from the prior year quarter to 62.6% when adjusted for the Storm Uri event, the ratio remains consistent with year-end 2020 at 61.8%. Let\u2019s talk about our FFO to debt metric. As it did in the first quarter the effect of Storm Uri continues to have a temporary and noticeable impact in 2021 on this metric. Taking a look at the upper right quadrant on this page, you will see that our FFO to debt metric based on the traditional Moody\u2019s and GAAP calculated basis, as well as on an adjusted Moody\u2019s and GAAP calculated basis. On a traditional unadjusted basis, our FFO to debt ratio increased by 0.2% during the quarter to 9.3% on a Moody\u2019s basis. On an adjusted basis, the Moody\u2019s FFO to debt metric is 12.8%. To be very clear, this 12.8% figure removes or adjusts the calculation to eliminate the impact of approximately $1.2 billion of cash outflows associated with covering the unplanned Uri driven fuel and purchase power costs in the SPP region directly impacting PSO and SWEPCO in particular. This metric is also adjusted to remove the effect of the associated debt we used to fund the unplanned payments. It should give you a sense of where we would be from a business as usual perspective. As you know, we are in frequent contact with the rating agencies to keep them apprised of all aspects of our business. The rating agencies continue to take the anticipated regulatory recovery into consideration as it relates to our credit rating. And importantly, there continues to be no change in our equity financing plan and our multiyear cash flow forecast is laid out on page 39 does not assume any asset rotation proceeds. Given the regulatory recovery activity that currently in flight, we do expect our FFO to debt cash flow metric to return to the low to mid-teens target range next year. So here\u2019s a quick refresh on where all this regulatory activity stands today for PSO and SWEPCO. In Oklahoma, we are working through the regulatory process and anticipate issuing securitization bonds in the first half of 2022. In both Arkansas and Louisiana, recovery is underway, while final details get worked out in the regulatory process and we will be filing for recovery in Texas in the third quarter of 2021. So let\u2019s take a quick moment to visit our liquidity summary on slide 11. You will see here that our liquidity position remains strong at $3.3 billion, supported by our five-year $4 billion bank revolver and two-year $1 billion revolving credit facility that we entered into on March 31st of this year. If you look at the lower left side of the page, you will see there are qualified pension continues to be well funded and our OpEd is funded at 174.2%. So let\u2019s go to slide 12, we will do a quick wrap up and we can get your questions. Our performance in the first half of the year gives us confidence to reaffirm our operating earnings guidance range of $4.55 per share to $4.75 per share. Because of our ability to continue to invest in our own system organically including both our energy delivery system and the transformation of our generation fleet, we are confident in our ability to grow the company at our stated long-term growth rate of 5% to 7%. So we surely do appreciate your time and attention today. So, with that, I am going to turn the call over to the Operator for your questions.\nOperator: Thank you.  And that will come from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey. Good\u2026\nNick Akins: Hi, Julien.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Thank you for all the remarks. I\u2019d say at the pace that you guys were just talking I would have mistaken you guys sitting in New York or something like this?\nNick Akins: Yeah. No.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: So, I am going to try to catch up on everything that was just said. But maybe in summary on the logos, I hear you. I think the critical comment you made was mixed. Where are you trending against your guidance range here as you think, but obviously third quarter matters critically, obviously kept intact the total load growth here? Any comments to just resolve that against the full year numbers, I mean, I know we are still early-ish in the year?\nNick Akins: Yeah. I think, well, you just sort of answered the question. We are still early in the year because the third quarter is particularly meaningful and we typically look after third quarter to see where we actually stand. But again, as Julie mentioned, OEM goes up commensurate with all the customer expansion as well and we have pretty sizable customer expansion. Look at the industrial and commercial numbers. They are up considerably. So and I think obviously without outstripping our estimate going into the year of what overall load growth would be. But it remains to be seen. Because I think we are sort of in a very cyclical period of trying to figure out what the future holds in terms of whether this other variant of COVID is going to have an impact or what happens actually is there are just pent-up frustration then it starts to moderate. What\u2019s promising is though that we are seeing -- we are still seeing residential load, although it\u2019s negative to 2020, it\u2019s still a positive overall. So our original thesis of more residential load going forward. And if we can tie that together with improved industrial and commercial load as well, it could be very positive. But we certainly have to feel our way through that and really understand that. So we pass the third quarter before we really have a good feeling of that. Julie?\nJulie Sloat: Yeah. Just maybe add a little finer point too. If you are thinking sequentially for the remainder of the year, our load growth rates are expected to moderate in the second half of the year based on prior year comps. So when you think about it, restrictions were most severe in the second quarter and by the third quarter of last year, so by the third quarter of last year, the service territory had begun essentially a phased reopening. And so as a result, the 6.3% growth for the second quarter, probably not only the highest growth in the quarter. And actually it is the highest growth in AEP\u2019s history. But it will also be the highest load growth stat during the recovery. So if you think about the second half of the year, I would expect it year-over-year to moderate a little bit and so we are just keeping a watchful eye on how the trend continues to click along. I know I saw in The Wall Street Journal this morning CFOs commenting on where they think the economy is going to go, doesn\u2019t look like anybody is changing their estimates based on COVID trends. But we are keeping an eye on that.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. Excellent. Thank you. And then, if I can pivot the text, obviously, you all have a pretty meaningful footprint there. We have seen various legislative efforts underway. I am curious, as best you can tell thus far, I know it\u2019s early. Any kind of context you can put especially on the transmission side, the potential project here? We are hearing from some of your peers about potentially meaningful shifts?\nNick Akins: Well, certainly, obviously, it remains to be seen as far as transmission investment and really we think of T&D and what part of the business is associated with T&D. We have made some inroads in terms of in terms of backup generation, those kinds of things in terms of transmission. I really think there\u2019s probably continued opportunity for development of storage capability, of other transmission related investments on the grid to ensure that we are able to adjust that. For us, we are doing a lot in terms of line of sight into the transmission grid itself. We are continuing to expand our scale abilities, continuing to focus on our ability to have even more transmission in place, because if you are looking for additional generation to be placed in various areas, well, transmission is a big part of that solution as well. So is that, I think, Texas is sort of a microcosm of the country when you start reevaluating the system based upon the needs from not only a natural gas perspective, but also from a renewable perspective, that brings in the whole planning effort and communication in real time associated with the operations of the transmission and it -- for that matter the distribution system as well. So I think they are making the right steps and I think there\u2019s more steps to be made so and it\u2019s going to be a sort of a multiyear top of effort, and of course, we are a big part of the transmission in Texas. So we will be certainly very focused on how the T&D business can be expanded to improve the resiliency of the T&D efforts. But that means Texas is really going to have to start thinking about resources and a broader view of resources like we are having to do for the rest of the system and transmission technologies, and for that matter, distribution technologies are going to have to be recognized in its ability to provide a more resilient grid. You can\u2019t have these strict lines drawn between generation and transmission and distribution because that\u2019s not the world we are in anymore. So, we will continue that focus. Every legislative session, every regulatory session will be centered on that effort.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Excellent. Just last, Kentucky, I know you can\u2019t say much, but what\u2019s the level of interest if you can give any kind of parameters?\nNick Akins: Yeah. So, yeah, obviously, I don\u2019t want to get into too much detail there. I think, again, you answered it sort of right at the beginning. It is a confidential process. But I can say that we do have a credible interest and it is a competitive process.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Excellent. Thank you all. Take care.\nNick Akins: Okay.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nNick Akins: Good morning, Steve.\nSteve Fleishman: Hey. Good morning. Can you hear me, Nick?\nNick Akins: Good morning. Oh! Yeah. I can hear you fine.\nSteve Fleishman: Okay. Great. Thanks. I might have missed this, but just where are you on this $600 million of equity plan for this year? How much have you issued so far?\nJulie Sloat: Yeah. Thanks for the question, Steve. We have actually used the ATM to issue just under $200 million. I think there\u2019s around $195 million that was associated with the financing of the Sundance North Central wind facility and we will be continuing on with the rest of that program. As you know, about $100 million of that $600 million is also associated with the drip. So that continues to play in the background. Does that help?\nSteve Fleishman: Okay.\nJulie Sloat: Yeah.\nSteve Fleishman: And then just -- this might be a little bit hard to answer, but just in terms of thinking about the $1.4 billion for next year that\u2019s in the plan. Obviously, if you were to sell Kentucky, some of that could maybe offset some of that. So just -- could you just give us latest thoughts on how to think about the Kentucky outcome relative to that $1.4 billion for next year?\nJulie Sloat: Yeah. And then, I will -- Nick can add a finer point from a strategic perspective. But purely from a financing perspective, you are right on the money, Steve. So we got $1.4 billion embedded in our plan. And for those of you who following along at home, we are on page 39 of the cash flow if you want to take a look at 2022. About $100 million of that again is associated with the drip, about $800 million is associated with north central wind financing and then we have another $500 million just associated with general funding of growth CapEx. And so to your point, Steve, to the extent that we would find ourselves in a situation where we were able to transact and bring dollars in the door, we would absolutely be able to work off some of that, otherwise equity issuance and sidestep that. So I don\u2019t -- I can\u2019t give you a number. We don\u2019t have a transaction. But that is absolutely the thinking and how we are modeling different scenarios inside the house. And I don\u2019t know, Nick, if you have any comment, it would be great.\nNick Akins: Well, I think, you covered it well. As far as -- it\u2019s great to have a financing plan assuming Kentucky a sale at Kentucky doesn\u2019t happen. But also it\u2019s great to have options available to further optimize what that financing plan looks like. So and it is -- and I will say again, the timing particularly with Traverse being the last one, it\u2019s the largest one in first quarter 2022, that sums up pretty well with this process. So we will get this resolved and there will be finance one way or another, but at the end of the day, the timing of it and the process is continuing on plan.\nJulie Sloat: And just if I could\u2026\nSteve Fleishman: Okay.\nJulie Sloat: \u2026to follow up\u2026\nSteve Fleishman: Yeah.\nJulie Sloat: \u2026Steve. Again just to reiterate. The plan as it stands today, as you know, assumes no asset rotation. And again, I want to reinforce that, the 5% to 7% is well intact even if we don\u2019t have a transaction.\nSteve Fleishman: Okay. And are you -- do you have a bias within that range at all or just the kind of that\u2019s the range?\nNick Akins: That\u2019s -- probably we can\u2019t answer at this point, Steve.\nSteve Fleishman: Okay. So you are being very unbiased?\nNick Akins: We are.\nSteve Fleishman: Smart move. Okay. Thanks so much.\nNick Akins: Yeah. Sure. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Shahriar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead.\nNick Akins: Good morning, Shahriar.\nShahriar Pourreza: Hey. Good morning, guys. I wanted to start with a recent event and get your sense on the Mitchell order and Kentucky, sort of rejecting the rate increase you saw, and obviously, it\u2019s not a surprise well on AG strong comments prior to the decision. Nick is this sort of a signal that the state and the PSC in general they are starting to commit to maybe a little bit more of a rational thinking around an economic approach to coal like the least cost approach is just starting to bend further towards renewable. So how do we think about the viability of the plant in the state and could we see some acceleration of that 1.4-gig of solar and when you bought into plan for the state on a prior call as a direct grid? And then, how do we sort of think about West Virginia\u2019s rate request coming off the Kentucky order?\nNick Akins: Yeah. That\u2019s right. It\u2019s sort of interesting. I mean, it\u2019s multi-jurisdictional, as you know, and Mitchell is wheeling in Kentucky Power. And I think we have to get resolved Kentucky, Virginia and West Virginia. West Virginia has yet to speak on this issue, but -- and it\u2019s only the ALJ in Virginia. So we will hear more on from Virginia on that. But I think it\u2019s really important for us to really hold on our cards for now, because we got to get through a state process. It\u2019s good to have clarity. And I think Kentucky, obviously, is the first shoe to drop in this regard. But we have also made it clear that these are multi-jurisdiction unit. So we have to make sure that there\u2019s some compatibility of the jurisdictions that are involved. We will go through the process. We will get the initial views of the commissions and then if they are on different tracks, we will have to further analyze and resolve that with the commissions and there\u2019s a lot of resolutions that could occur. Some are shorter, some are longer. But we have to understand where all three commissions are before really doing anything. I think it\u2019s good to get clarity though and I think it\u2019s pretty important that whether it\u2019s the ELG or the CCR, if they approve CCR investments, but don\u2019t improve -- approve ELG investments, then that effectively brings the generation retirement dates back from 2014 to 2028. So that\u2019s something we have to consider along with those commissions. But we will know more about this in the August time frame. But I\u2019d be hesitant to say what Kentucky, it\u2019s pretty interesting that they would be looking at the ELG part of it. And I think there is becoming more of an awareness of -- that there has to be a plan. Now what that plan is, we have got a fully resolved with all those commissions. So, more to come on that.\nShahriar Pourreza: Got it. And thanks for the visibility around sort of the Kentucky process. I know, Nick, you obviously mentioned that further optimization is always a possibility. Remind us just like that sugar point is the shaping of that for instance that 16.6 gigawatts of renewables you discussed in the prior call. Obviously, Kentucky will more than likely backfill some of your North Central equity needs. So as you are thinking about further optimization, should we be watching the outcomes at the IRPs, the PSC approval, how much you plan to own versus PPA, which I guess would stipulate your incremental equity needs and the resulting size of potentially further optimization measures?\nNick Akins: Yeah. Yeah. So -- and just like, we have gone through probably a couple of years now of discussions about how North Central is going to get financed and we are finally getting to a point where ultimately we will know how it\u2019s being financed. The 16.6 gigawatts and -- is, certainly, we made a pretty credible case that we ought to own a significant part of that. I\u2019d like to own all of it. But certainly, if -- but operationally, and from a contracting standpoint, and certainly, the ability for us to respond to a system related activities, it\u2019s important for us to own and control those assets. And I think that, as we go forward, you are right, it will be the integrated resource planning filings that were made, there will start that dialogue, now we are in the process of doing RFPs to get more information obviously from the -- for the market in terms of what\u2019s out there from a developmental perspective and that process is ongoing. So, that will certainly fortify any CCN filings we have to make or anything like that after the resource planning filings. But the resource planning filings will be your first real dialogue around how quickly this transformation will occur and in each one of the jurisdictions. And so, we are feeling pretty good about it, because it\u2019s getting to a point where we have to decide from a capacity standpoint, how we support these utilities and it\u2019s pretty clear to me that the movement is to that clean energy economy to move it is to toward as long as you have some element of baseload 24x7 capacity, that renewables will be the big part of that. So, a lot of that\u2019s just becoming, I think, it\u2019s becoming much more transparent and our jurisdictions, I think, their conditions both federally and from a state perspective, they are just a better realization of what the options are and the timing of those options. And that\u2019s what will drive of course to that resource planning process.\nShahriar Pourreza: Got it. And lastly for me and I apologize if I am putting you on the spot, Nick. The news just broke out this morning. But is there any kind of refer to the First Energy deferred prosecution agreement that was announced this morning to the SEC investigation at AEP?\nNick Akins: No. Like I said before, we are on the outside looking in. We have no knowledge of any of that activity. And so if the report is true, I am glad to see that there is some element of putting all these in a rearview mirror, because naturally, and I said before, AEP has been hung up in the wake of that. And I am certainly hopeful that there\u2019s some closure brought about from that. So, but, yeah, I have -- it was a surprise to me and we knew nothing about it, and certainly, there\u2019s really nothing else that we have -- that AEP can say other than what we have put on our website and naturally there\u2019s just nothing to report from our perspective.\nShahriar Pourreza: Terrific. Thank you, Nick and Julie. Congrats on today\u2019s results.\nNick Akins: Yeah. Okay.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nNick Akins: Good morning, Stephen.\nStephen Byrd: Hey. Good morning.\nNick Akins: How are you?\nStephen Byrd: Congrats on a constructive update and on weeping in, you mentioned of both, Carly Simon and a  maybe a first.\nNick Akins: Yeah. Right.\nStephen Byrd: Okay. So a lot has been covered . Just wanted to discuss on Kentucky, if there are approaches that can help minimize tax leakage, how are you all thinking about sort of ability to bring proceeds back and sort of the impact of taxes?\nJulie Sloat: Yeah. Thanks for the question, Stephen. As you know, we are a little tax efficient right now. So, given the tax basis in Kentucky and the different hurdles that we are considering, I wouldn\u2019t see that one being a show stopper. And quite frankly, that might give us an opportunity to enhance or improve our tax efficiency without getting into a bunch of numbers. I wouldn\u2019t let that trip you up in terms of what things could stop us moving forward.\nStephen Byrd: Yeah. That\u2019s helpful. And then maybe just thinking through the upcoming RFPs, you mentioned the APCo and SWEPCO RFPs, could you just talk a little more detail in terms of color around the timetable there? And I am sorry if I missed that if you all did go through it. I don\u2019t -- didn\u2019t quite follow there, I am just thinking about sort of what that might mean for timing of incremental spending and sort of how we should think about those processes?\nNick Akins: Yeah. So, we have certainly gone through the basic requirements for the RFPs for all of these areas. But as we go through that process, there is -- at APCo, we issued an RFP there for 300 megawatts of solar and wind resources really for a completion date of 2023 or 2024. And then in May of 2021, APCo issued an RFP to obtain, I guess, it was 100 megawatts of solar and wind energy via PPA and RFP for the renewable energy certificates only, which is consistent with the Virginia and what their requirements are. And then, SWEPCO issued an RFP for own resources up to 3,000 megawatts of wind and up to 300 megawatts of solar resources with optional battery storage by the way that can achieve a completion by 2024 to 2025. And they are also seeking 200 megawatts of capacity into 2023 to 2024 range and another 250 into 2025 to 2027 range, so those bids are due in mid-August. And then at PSO, we -- in June, we notified the regulators that it intends -- we intend to issue an RFP seeking up to 2,600 megawatts of wind and up to 1,350 megawatts of solar, again with options for battery storage consideration and that\u2019s meeting capacity needs by 2025. So and then PSO plans to issue the RFP in October of this year. So those are the ones that are on the Board right now, and have really some near-term related requirements and most are capacity related requirements. So, and again, they are being done pretty much the same way as the others with North Central that we will certainly do more of it of a turnkey type of thing where we take ownership at the time it is approved in rate. So, and then, of course, we will go through the process of approvals by the various commissions along the way. So, but that\u2019s the plan right now. And then, we will continue to -- as a matter of fact, we are spending a lot of time with our Board focused on the strategies related to these types of filings and the plan long-term and it\u2019s important for everyone to understand this is going to be a continual process. And you are just seeing the first part of these really driven by capacity requirements and not just sort of an energy convenience. So, I think, they are really good to go out with right now and that\u2019s what we have at this point.\nStephen Byrd: That\u2019s really helpful. That\u2019s all I had. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nJeremy Tonet: Hi. Good morning.\nNick Akins: Good morning. How are you doing?\nJeremy Tonet: Good. Good.\nNick Akins: Okay.\nJeremy Tonet: Just wanted to pick up on Kentucky a little bit more, if that\u2019s possible and I just want to know if you might be able to comment in any degree to whether the strategic review process has received more interest from strategic or financial players? And then as well, kind of given strong prices achieved in recent industry transactions and the strong interest here in Kentucky, has this process made you thought about more asset rotation beyond Kentucky to increase balance sheet headroom overall?\nNick Akins: Yeah. So, for the first question, we started out this process saying that that we expected to get strategics and financials, and we have strategics and financials, so both are involved. And then as far as your second question is concerned, as I said earlier with the Foo Fighters dialogue, this is going to be a continual process for us. And if we are practically fully regulated so we have the opportunities to look at if we are building 16.6 gigawatts of renewables resources during the transition, then we got to think -- we have to have everything on the table in terms of sources and uses. So we are going to go through that process, and of course, Kentucky is sort of a first stop, but we will continue to evaluate our assets as sources. And if it makes sense, based upon what the other opportunities are, then that\u2019s the kind of framework that we want to move this company toward.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks for that. And then there\u2019s news coming out of FERC with regards to kind of the transmission planning process. I am just wondering if you might be able to provide some thoughts on -- your thoughts on what\u2019s been said recently and what you see is kind of best practices here?\nNick Akins: Yeah. So, obviously, we would like to see a much better transmission related planning across regions and AEP does a pretty good job itself in terms of transmission planning, because we do have a large system to consider. But at the same, RTO to RTO type planning process to try to make them more consistent so you can have this large transmission being built across regions and across states. If you are going to get that going, particularly as you are trying to get renewable resources to load centers, we are going to have to resolve these issues around multi-jurisdictional, multi-RTO type of analyses and making sure that we are consistent. The other part too is we have got to have consistency in terms of rate making and this notion of reevaluating incentives, structures and those types of things is not good for making decisions relative to transmission or -- and this is not good relative to the RTO model itself. So, I think, FERC really needs to sort of step back and take a look at it. And I think it\u2019s a real positive approach to be focusing on the planning aspects and addressing RTO to RTO boundaries, addressing areas where, what\u2019s competitive, what\u2019s not competitive, all those types of things, that\u2019s fine. But we have to have a clear planning process. And first of all, you can\u2019t have coming back later after a project, multi-millions have been spent on a project to, say, we are going to stop the project. That has to change. And the other part of it is, we have got to be able to make these investments with some sense of certainty and be able to move quickly to make that happen. So, I just -- I think, there\u2019s only so much value -- there\u2019s a lot of value of being in an RTO for customers. But there also has to be value for the companies involved from -- to make the investments that benefit customers in orders of magnitude greater than what the costs are related to, any incentives related to transmission. And if you want to send a bad message for anybody to join an RTO or anybody to stay in an RTO, it\u2019s just not good to start messing around with what the assumptions are relative to the future recovery of transmission investment. And now, when you start questioning incentives, you are really questioning anybody that\u2019s trying to put a multiyear model together to show the benefits of transmission has to take that into account that something may change. So, like trying to make an investment in a coal unit, with clean energy activities going on in Washington. So you really do have to really think this process through and think about what you are trying to achieve. Sorry, I went on that one though.\nJeremy Tonet: No. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you for that. I will stop there. Thank you.\nNick Akins: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nNick Akins: Hey, Durgesh. How are you?\nDurgesh Chopra: Hey. Good morning, Nick. Thanks for taking my question.\nNick Akins: Good morning.\nDurgesh Chopra: Hey. You addressed sort of a lot of transmission questions in the Q&A. Maybe just like the MISO transmission opportunity that the MISO has flagged perhaps just sort of unveiled towards the end of the year. I know a small sort of a set of assets for you in that location. But could you compete for some of those projects? Could that be an upside for you there?\nNick Akins: Oh! Yeah. We could. We could compete with our Transource entity, which we have been. But, yeah, we could. And actually a small impact for us as it stands. But certainly, we could certainly participate in any of that, yeah.\nDurgesh Chopra: Understood. And then just anything you are hearing at your level and your peers and through the sort of the EI organization. I mean the infrastructure bill has a pretty sizable CapEx on the transmission side or investment on the transmission side. Just anything you are hearing from that on the federal front?\nNick Akins: Yeah. So, obviously, we have the, I guess, that\u2019s $1.2 trillion, the infrastructure bill that -- it\u2019s interesting we are talking in trillions as opposed to billions now. But in terms of the hard infrastructure side of things, yeah, it appears there\u2019s some kind of convergence in Washington on that particular issue, although, more has to be done on the actual language and things like that. But as far as pursuing the advancement of, and certainly, transmission investment, but direct pay and those kinds of issues are clearly important along the way. We also have to, as far as, renewables and clean energy, PTCs, ITCs extensions of those, I think that makes sense, particularly RSI  did the delays because of COVID and that kind of thing. So I think there\u2019s opportunities for that and then as far as electric vehicles, certainly we would like to see electric vehicle infrastructure continue to be developed. So, I think all of those areas are positive. The issue is how you leverage into the private. The private companies like ours or that instead of the government funding and for transmission, for example, we think that mechanisms already exist for the development of transmission as long as you can keep all the incentives and all that kind of stuff. But -- so the federal and -- federal government funding of that now is, I think, you have to sort of think about what level of encouragement and what area. So, if they can make siding much better, if they can make, certainly, the focus on planning. Those issues enable transmission to get investments. We have no problem financing transmission investments. So I think the government probably ought to pick and choose between what they truly want to focus on that not already leveraged into the utilities, for example. They can certainly encourage development of electric vehicles with the focus on charging station infrastructure and those types of things that would be a benefit. And then, as far as the renewables transformation or the clean energy transformation, any kind of hard infrastructure around being able to move more quickly from a renewable standpoint, whether tax incentives and also uh other technologies like storage. And then also, we would like to see benefits related to either tax incentives for coal-fired generation to reduce the underappreciated plant balances, for example. If you want to have a national plan around moving to a clean energy economy, then the more quickly we can reduce underappreciated plant balances, the better we are able to make decisions and conditions, and states can make decisions about what future resource replacements would be. So I think there\u2019s several ways to really focus on this. But we are all moving toward a clean energy economy. We just need to make sure that the government doesn\u2019t try to do too much across the Board as opposed to very selected areas that enable investment to continue in the private sector. That would be my view.\nDurgesh Chopra: Appreciate that color, Nick. Really quick just -- good to see First Energy with all the DOJ investigation or at least have an agreement this morning they highlighted. Just any update on the SEC subpoena you got? Any more color that you can share with us?\nNick Akins: No. Nothing new there. We are -- we have been communicating with the SEC and we are responsive to any requests they have from a documentation standpoint. And we are going to continue to work with them and be supportive and constructive in the process and but nothing new to report there.\nDurgesh Chopra: Understood. Thank you for taking my questions.\nNick Akins: Yeah.\nOperator: Thank you. And our final question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nMichael Lapides: Nice try on that one.\nNick Akins: Michael who?\nMichael Lapides: Yeah. Hey. Actually, Michael, the guy who\u2019s excited about the changes in the Southeastern Conference they had. Hey, guys, real quick question or two. First of all, one on O&M this year, obviously, O&M at the VIU segment is up a lot. How do you think about what the second half of the year O&M trajectory looks like versus the first half? And how should we think about both for VIU and T&D kind of segments, the long-term kind of the 2022 and beyond trajectory for O&M?\nNick Akins: Yeah. I will just generally say, and Julie can certainly follow up on this, but as you have expansions in customer load, you are going to have higher O&M associated with that, but that\u2019s a good expansion. The issue for us is, what we typically do is, we are evaluating the true impacts of our Achieving Excellence Program against what our forecast needs to be in terms of bending the O&M curve. So we continue to take account of the good O&M that supports the expansion from a customer load perspective, but also continue to not only optimize that, but also continue the overall optimization of the O&M budget itself. So, yeah, you may see it, and that\u2019s why, obviously, we are watching what third quarter looks like and fourth quarter with the low it does. But we want to make absolutely sure that we are continuing to make progress consistent with that plan of consistent earnings and dividend improvements in that 5% to 7% growth trajectory. So that\u2019s what we are doing. We are not just saying, oh, yeah, load\u2019s going up, let\u2019s spend more O&M. It really is a measured approach from our perspective. Julie?\nJulie Sloat: Yeah. No. That\u2019s spot on, Nick. And thanks for the question, Michael. As I am sitting here thinking about this and as we were preparing for the earnings call, one of the things I am looking at is the mix point. You look at where load is coming in. And as mentioned in a previous answer to a question, we do expect that load on a relative basis. When you compare it to last year, for the second half, it would not be as pronounced, although we do expect it to continue to improve. So that\u2019s a good thing. And that allows us to be a little more comfortable with O&M costs where they are, because that does help the customer in the long run. So we keep that top of mind and continue to be very diligent about managing costs. But if you are trying to model for the rest of the year, let me start by saying this, we are not changing our guidance. But as you know, once we start the year and we give you that plan, so you see that waterfall that we give to you, how we get to the end of the year, obviously changes, right, because it\u2019s a dynamic business. So I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if relative to that plan, if you saw our O&M be running a little richer. But I would hope that load would be hanging in there too. And then, as you know, we are doing well on the Transmission Holdco segment already kind of clipping along where we thought we would be for the full year. So there may be some benefit there too. So do keep that in mind when you go back and compare and contrast to that guidance walk that we gave to you. I think it was on February 25th during our earnings call and then we are happy to help you with any modeling that you have offline.\nMichael Lapides: No. That sounds great. Thanks, guys. Much appreciated.\nNick Akins: Sure. Thanks.\nDarcy Reese: Thank you for joining us on today\u2019s call. As always, the IR team will be available to answer any additional questions you may have. Toni, would you please give the replay information.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this conference will be available for a replay after 11:30 a.m. Eastern today through July 29, 2021.

        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Nick Akins",
            "content": "Okay. Thanks, Darcy. And welcome again everyone to American Electric Power's second quarter 2021 earnings call. Today we reported a strong second quarter operating earnings of a $1.18 per share versus a $1.08 for the same period of 2020. Our second quarter results reflect significant progress in terms of economic recovery throughout AEP service territory, with a continued focus on OEM as we navigate through what is hopefully an emergence from the COVID-19 pandemic. Gross regional product has already exceeded its pre-pandemic levels and important across AEP service territory is now 2% of its pre-pandemic levels after adding over a 163,000 jobs in the first six months of this year. Increased vaccinations combined with the additional fiscal stimulus from the American Rescue Plan are contributing to the strong demand for goods and services throughout the economy. AEP's normalized retail sales in the second quarter of 2021 were the highest we have seen since the second quarter of 2018. Clearly, we are pleased with the improvements we have seen thus far and we will continue to monitor the recovery's progress over the second half of the year.  Accordingly, we are reaffirming our 2021 guidance range of $4.55 per share to $4.75 per share and a 5% to 7% long-term growth rate and would be again disappointed not to be in the upper half of our stated guidance range as we have previously stated. Julie will be discussing these issues in more detail in her report. Rate case activity across our jurisdictions continues to be active and substantial. In Ohio, we are awaiting an order by the commission on the settlement reach involved with the commission earlier this year. As a reminder, the settlement has broad support in the settling parties including the commission staff, the Ohio Consumers Council, industrial companies, commercial companies and other entities like the Ohio Hospital Association. We expect a decision in the third quarter of this year. Public Service Company of Oklahoma filed a rate case at the end of April. PSO is seeking $115.4 million net revenue increase and a 10% ROE. The following transitions North Central costs from the right established in the approval into base rates. Hi, Julien. Yeah. No. Yeah. I think, well, you just sort of answered the question. We are still early in the year because the third quarter is particularly meaningful and we typically look after third quarter to see where we actually stand. But again, as Julie mentioned, OEM goes up commensurate with all the customer expansion as well and we have pretty sizable customer expansion. Look at the industrial and commercial numbers. They are up considerably. So and I think obviously without outstripping our estimate going into the year of what overall load growth would be. But it remains to be seen. Because I think we are sort of in a very cyclical period of trying to figure out what the future holds in terms of whether this other variant of COVID is going to have an impact or what happens actually is there are just pent-up frustration then it starts to moderate. What's promising is though that we are seeing -- we are still seeing residential load, although it's negative to 2020, it's still a positive overall. So our original thesis of more residential load going forward. And if we can tie that together with improved industrial and commercial load as well, it could be very positive. But we certainly have to feel our way through that and really understand that. So we pass the third quarter before we really have a good feeling of that. Julie? Well, certainly, obviously, it remains to be seen as far as transmission investment and really we think of T&D and what part of the business is associated with T&D. We have made some inroads in terms of in terms of backup generation, those kinds of things in terms of transmission. I really think there's probably continued opportunity for development of storage capability, of other transmission related investments on the grid to ensure that we are able to adjust that. For us, we are doing a lot in terms of line of sight into the transmission grid itself. We are continuing to expand our scale abilities, continuing to focus on our ability to have even more transmission in place, because if you are looking for additional generation to be placed in various areas, well, transmission is a big part of that solution as well. So is that, I think, Texas is sort of a microcosm of the country when you start reevaluating the system based upon the needs from not only a natural gas perspective, but also from a renewable perspective, that brings in the whole planning effort and communication in real time associated with the operations of the transmission and it -- for that matter the distribution system as well. So I think they are making the right steps and I think there's more steps to be made so and it's going to be a sort of a multiyear top of effort, and of course, we are a big part of the transmission in Texas. So we will be certainly very focused on how the T&D business can be expanded to improve the resiliency of the T&D efforts. But that means Texas is really going to have to start thinking about resources and a broader view of resources like we are having to do for the rest of the system and transmission technologies, and for that matter, distribution technologies are going to have to be recognized in its ability to provide a more resilient grid. You can't have these strict lines drawn between generation and transmission and distribution because that's not the world we are in anymore. So, we will continue that focus. Every legislative session, every regulatory session will be centered on that effort. Yeah. So, yeah, obviously, I don't want to get into too much detail there. I think, again, you answered it sort of right at the beginning. It is a confidential process. But I can say that we do have a credible interest and it is a competitive process. Okay. Good morning, Steve. Good morning. Oh! Yeah. I can hear you fine. Well, I think, you covered it well. As far as -- it's great to have a financing plan assuming Kentucky a sale at Kentucky doesn't happen. But also it's great to have options available to further optimize what that financing plan looks like. So and it is -- and I will say again, the timing particularly with Traverse being the last one, it's the largest one in first quarter 2022, that sums up pretty well with this process. So we will get this resolved and there will be finance one way or another, but at the end of the day, the timing of it and the process is continuing on plan. That's -- probably we can't answer at this point, Steve. We are. Yeah. Sure. Thanks. Good morning, Shahriar. Yeah. That's right. It's sort of interesting. I mean, it's multi-jurisdictional, as you know, and Mitchell is wheeling in Kentucky Power. And I think we have to get resolved Kentucky, Virginia and West Virginia. West Virginia has yet to speak on this issue, but -- and it's only the ALJ in Virginia. So we will hear more on from Virginia on that. But I think it's really important for us to really hold on our cards for now, because we got to get through a state process. It's good to have clarity. And I think Kentucky, obviously, is the first shoe to drop in this regard. But we have also made it clear that these are multi-jurisdiction unit. So we have to make sure that there's some compatibility of the jurisdictions that are involved. We will go through the process. We will get the initial views of the commissions and then if they are on different tracks, we will have to further analyze and resolve that with the commissions and there's a lot of resolutions that could occur. Some are shorter, some are longer. But we have to understand where all three commissions are before really doing anything. I think it's good to get clarity though and I think it's pretty important that whether it's the ELG or the CCR, if they approve CCR investments, but don't improve -- approve ELG investments, then that effectively brings the generation retirement dates back from 2014 to 2028. So that's something we have to consider along with those commissions. But we will know more about this in the August time frame. But I'd be hesitant to say what Kentucky, it's pretty interesting that they would be looking at the ELG part of it. And I think there is becoming more of an awareness of -- that there has to be a plan. Now what that plan is, we have got a fully resolved with all those commissions. So, more to come on that. Yeah. Yeah. So -- and just like, we have gone through probably a couple of years now of discussions about how North Central is going to get financed and we are finally getting to a point where ultimately we will know how it's being financed. The 16.6 gigawatts and -- is, certainly, we made a pretty credible case that we ought to own a significant part of that. I'd like to own all of it. But certainly, if -- but operationally, and from a contracting standpoint, and certainly, the ability for us to respond to a system related activities, it's important for us to own and control those assets. And I think that, as we go forward, you are right, it will be the integrated resource planning filings that were made, there will start that dialogue, now we are in the process of doing RFPs to get more information obviously from the -- for the market in terms of what's out there from a developmental perspective and that process is ongoing. So, that will certainly fortify any CCN filings we have to make or anything like that after the resource planning filings. But the resource planning filings will be your first real dialogue around how quickly this transformation will occur and in each one of the jurisdictions. And so, we are feeling pretty good about it, because it's getting to a point where we have to decide from a capacity standpoint, how we support these utilities and it's pretty clear to me that the movement is to that clean energy economy to move it is to toward as long as you have some element of baseload 24x7 capacity, that renewables will be the big part of that. So, a lot of that's just becoming, I think, it's becoming much more transparent and our jurisdictions, I think, their conditions both federally and from a state perspective, they are just a better realization of what the options are and the timing of those options. And that's what will drive of course to that resource planning process. No. Like I said before, we are on the outside looking in. We have no knowledge of any of that activity. And so if the report is true, I am glad to see that there is some element of putting all these in a rearview mirror, because naturally, and I said before, AEP has been hung up in the wake of that. And I am certainly hopeful that there's some closure brought about from that. So, but, yeah, I have -- it was a surprise to me and we knew nothing about it, and certainly, there's really nothing else that we have -- that AEP can say other than what we have put on our website and naturally there's just nothing to report from our perspective. Yeah. Okay. Good morning, Stephen. How are you? Yeah. Right. Yeah. So, we have certainly gone through the basic requirements for the RFPs for all of these areas. But as we go through that process, there is -- at APCo, we issued an RFP there for 300 megawatts of solar and wind resources really for a completion date of 2023 or 2024. And then in May of 2021, APCo issued an RFP to obtain, I guess, it was 100 megawatts of solar and wind energy via PPA and RFP for the renewable energy certificates only, which is consistent with the Virginia and what their requirements are. And then, SWEPCO issued an RFP for own resources up to 3,000 megawatts of wind and up to 300 megawatts of solar resources with optional battery storage by the way that can achieve a completion by 2024 to 2025. And they are also seeking 200 megawatts of capacity into 2023 to 2024 range and another 250 into 2025 to 2027 range, so those bids are due in mid-August. And then at PSO, we -- in June, we notified the regulators that it intends -- we intend to issue an RFP seeking up to 2,600 megawatts of wind and up to 1,350 megawatts of solar, again with options for battery storage consideration and that's meeting capacity needs by 2025. So and then PSO plans to issue the RFP in October of this year. So those are the ones that are on the Board right now, and have really some near-term related requirements and most are capacity related requirements. So, and again, they are being done pretty much the same way as the others with North Central that we will certainly do more of it of a turnkey type of thing where we take ownership at the time it is approved in rate. So, and then, of course, we will go through the process of approvals by the various commissions along the way. So, but that's the plan right now. And then, we will continue to -- as a matter of fact, we are spending a lot of time with our Board focused on the strategies related to these types of filings and the plan long-term and it's important for everyone to understand this is going to be a continual process. And you are just seeing the first part of these really driven by capacity requirements and not just sort of an energy convenience. So, I think, they are really good to go out with right now and that's what we have at this point. Good morning. How are you doing? Okay. Yeah. So, for the first question, we started out this process saying that that we expected to get strategics and financials, and we have strategics and financials, so both are involved. And then as far as your second question is concerned, as I said earlier with the Foo Fighters dialogue, this is going to be a continual process for us. And if we are practically fully regulated so we have the opportunities to look at if we are building 16.6 gigawatts of renewables resources during the transition, then we got to think -- we have to have everything on the table in terms of sources and uses. So we are going to go through that process, and of course, Kentucky is sort of a first stop, but we will continue to evaluate our assets as sources. And if it makes sense, based upon what the other opportunities are, then that's the kind of framework that we want to move this company toward. Yeah. So, obviously, we would like to see a much better transmission related planning across regions and AEP does a pretty good job itself in terms of transmission planning, because we do have a large system to consider. But at the same, RTO to RTO type planning process to try to make them more consistent so you can have this large transmission being built across regions and across states. If you are going to get that going, particularly as you are trying to get renewable resources to load centers, we are going to have to resolve these issues around multi-jurisdictional, multi-RTO type of analyses and making sure that we are consistent. The other part too is we have got to have consistency in terms of rate making and this notion of reevaluating incentives, structures and those types of things is not good for making decisions relative to transmission or -- and this is not good relative to the RTO model itself. So, I think, FERC really needs to sort of step back and take a look at it. And I think it's a real positive approach to be focusing on the planning aspects and addressing RTO to RTO boundaries, addressing areas where, what's competitive, what's not competitive, all those types of things, that's fine. But we have to have a clear planning process. And first of all, you can't have coming back later after a project, multi-millions have been spent on a project to, say, we are going to stop the project. That has to change. And the other part of it is, we have got to be able to make these investments with some sense of certainty and be able to move quickly to make that happen. So, I just -- I think, there's only so much value -- there's a lot of value of being in an RTO for customers. But there also has to be value for the companies involved from -- to make the investments that benefit customers in orders of magnitude greater than what the costs are related to, any incentives related to transmission. And if you want to send a bad message for anybody to join an RTO or anybody to stay in an RTO, it's just not good to start messing around with what the assumptions are relative to the future recovery of transmission investment. And now, when you start questioning incentives, you are really questioning anybody that's trying to put a multiyear model together to show the benefits of transmission has to take that into account that something may change. So, like trying to make an investment in a coal unit, with clean energy activities going on in Washington. So you really do have to really think this process through and think about what you are trying to achieve. Sorry, I went on that one though. Thank you. Hey, Durgesh. How are you? Good morning. Oh! Yeah. We could. We could compete with our Transource entity, which we have been. But, yeah, we could. And actually a small impact for us as it stands. But certainly, we could certainly participate in any of that, yeah. Yeah. So, obviously, we have the, I guess, that's $1.2 trillion, the infrastructure bill that -- it's interesting we are talking in trillions as opposed to billions now. But in terms of the hard infrastructure side of things, yeah, it appears there's some kind of convergence in Washington on that particular issue, although, more has to be done on the actual language and things like that. But as far as pursuing the advancement of, and certainly, transmission investment, but direct pay and those kinds of issues are clearly important along the way. We also have to, as far as, renewables and clean energy, PTCs, ITCs extensions of those, I think that makes sense, particularly RSI  did the delays because of COVID and that kind of thing. So I think there's opportunities for that and then as far as electric vehicles, certainly we would like to see electric vehicle infrastructure continue to be developed. So, I think all of those areas are positive. The issue is how you leverage into the private. The private companies like ours or that instead of the government funding and for transmission, for example, we think that mechanisms already exist for the development of transmission as long as you can keep all the incentives and all that kind of stuff. But -- so the federal and -- federal government funding of that now is, I think, you have to sort of think about what level of encouragement and what area. So, if they can make siding much better, if they can make, certainly, the focus on planning. Those issues enable transmission to get investments. We have no problem financing transmission investments. So I think the government probably ought to pick and choose between what they truly want to focus on that not already leveraged into the utilities, for example. They can certainly encourage development of electric vehicles with the focus on charging station infrastructure and those types of things that would be a benefit. And then, as far as the renewables transformation or the clean energy transformation, any kind of hard infrastructure around being able to move more quickly from a renewable standpoint, whether tax incentives and also uh other technologies like storage. And then also, we would like to see benefits related to either tax incentives for coal-fired generation to reduce the underappreciated plant balances, for example. If you want to have a national plan around moving to a clean energy economy, then the more quickly we can reduce underappreciated plant balances, the better we are able to make decisions and conditions, and states can make decisions about what future resource replacements would be. So I think there's several ways to really focus on this. But we are all moving toward a clean energy economy. We just need to make sure that the government doesn't try to do too much across the Board as opposed to very selected areas that enable investment to continue in the private sector. That would be my view. No. Nothing new there. We are -- we have been communicating with the SEC and we are responsive to any requests they have from a documentation standpoint. And we are going to continue to work with them and be supportive and constructive in the process and but nothing new to report there. Yeah. Michael who? Yeah. I will just generally say, and Julie can certainly follow up on this, but as you have expansions in customer load, you are going to have higher O&M associated with that, but that's a good expansion. The issue for us is, what we typically do is, we are evaluating the true impacts of our Achieving Excellence Program against what our forecast needs to be in terms of bending the O&M curve. So we continue to take account of the good O&M that supports the expansion from a customer load perspective, but also continue to not only optimize that, but also continue the overall optimization of the O&M budget itself. So, yeah, you may see it, and that's why, obviously, we are watching what third quarter looks like and fourth quarter with the low it does. But we want to make absolutely sure that we are continuing to make progress consistent with that plan of consistent earnings and dividend improvements in that 5% to 7% growth trajectory. So that's what we are doing. We are not just saying, oh, yeah, load's going up, let's spend more O&M. It really is a measured approach from our perspective. Julie? Sure. Thanks."

            "content": "All right. Thanks, Nick. Thanks, Darcy. It's good to be with everyone this morning. I am going to walk us through the second quarter and year-to-date financial results, share some thoughts on our service territory load and finish with a review of our credit metrics and liquidity. So let's go to slide number six which shows the comparison of GAAP to operating earnings for the quarter and year-to-date periods. GAAP earnings for the second quarter were $1.16 per share, compared to $1.05 per share in 2020. GAAP earnings through June were $2.31 per share, compared to $2.05 per share in 2020. There's a reconciliation of GAAP to operating earnings on pages 14 and 15 of the presentation today. So let's walk through our quarterly operating earnings performance by segment that's laid out on slide number seven. Operating earnings for the second quarter totaled $1.18 per share or $590 million, compared to $1.98 per share or $534 million in 2020. Operating earnings for the Vertically Integrated Utilities were $0.45 per share, down $0.10 driven by a year-over-year increase in the O&M due to lower prior year O&M, which included actions we took to adjust to the pandemic. Other pressures included lower wholesale load and higher depreciation and other taxes. These items were partially offset by the impact of rate changes across multiple jurisdictions, higher normalized retail load, transmission revenue and off system sales. The Transmission and Distribution Utilities segment earned $0.31 per share, up $0.02 from last year. Favorable drivers in this segment included higher normalized retail load, transmission revenue and rate changes, partially offsetting these favorable items were higher tax, depreciation and O&M expenses, as well as unfavorable weather and lower AFUDC. The AEP Transmission Holdco segment continued to grow contributing $0.34 per share, an improvement of $0.15, which got a boost because of the unfavorable annual true-up last year consistent with the 2021 earnings guidance assumptions we had provided to you. Our fundamental return on investment growth continued as net plant increased by $1.4 billion or 13% since June of last year. Generation and Marketing produced $0.09 per share, down $0.02 from last year, influenced by the prior year land sales and one-time items relating to an Oklaunion ARO adjustment in the sale of Conesville. We were mostly offset in the generation business by higher energy margins and lower expenses from the retirement of Oklaunion. Finally, Corporate and Other was up $0.05 per share, driven by investment gains, lower tax -- and lower taxes, which was partially offset by higher O&M and net interest expense. So bear with me a moment, I am going to talk a little bit more about that investment gain as we walk through the year-to-date view. So, if you flip to slide eight, we can look at year-to-date results. Operating earnings through June totaled $2.33 per share or $1.2 billion, compared to $2.10 per share or $1 billion in 2020. Looking at the drivers by segment, operating earnings for Vertically Integrated Utilities were $1 per share, down $0.05 due to higher O&M and depreciation expenses. Other smaller increases included lower normalized retail and wholesale load, other -- higher other taxes and a prior period fuel adjustment. The impact of weather was favorable due to the warmer than normal temps in the winter of 2020. Other favorable items in this segment included the impact of rate changes across multiple jurisdictions, higher off-system sales and transmission revenue. The Transmission and Distribution Utilities segment earned $0.54 per share, up $0.01 from last year. Earnings in this segment were up due to higher transmission revenue, rate changes, weather and normalized retail load, partially offsetting these favorable items were higher tax, depreciation, O&M and interest expenses, as well as lower AFUDC. The AEP Transmission Holdco segment contributed $0.68 per share, up $0.21 from last year, for the same reasons identified in the quarterly comparison. Generation and Marketing produced $0.16 per share, down $0.02 from last year, due to favorable one-time items in the prior year relating to an Oklaunion ARO adjustment in the sale of Conesville, higher energy margins and lower expenses in the generation business offset the unfavorable ERCOT market prices on the wholesale business during Storm Uri in February. The decrease in renewables business was driven by lower energy margins and higher expenses. Finally, Corporate and Other was up $0.08 per share, driven by investment gains and lower taxes and partially offset by higher O&M. So, let me take a quick moment to comment about the investment gain which is predominantly a function of our direct and indirect investment in charge point. As you will see on the waterfall, this produced a $0.09 benefit year-to-date in 2021 as compared to the corresponding 2020 period. You may recall that in the fourth quarter and full year 2020, this investment produced a $0.05 contribution and we would expect the year-over-year variance to be more pronounced at this point in 2021 as we had no benefit during the same period in 2020. So, turning to page nine, I will update you on our normalized load performance for the quarter. Before I talk about class level trends, I'd like to start with a couple of observations at a macro level. So, first of all, since all of these charts are showing a year-over-year growth, it is important to recall that the second quarter of 2020 was at the trough of the recession when restrictions on businesses to manage the public health crisis were at their greatest. So the magnitude of growth percentages is being influenced by the comparison basis. And the second observation is that there has been a steady path to recovery since bottoming out in the second quarter of last year. The momentum we are seeing is a positive sign for the economic recovery throughout the serviced territory. So, if you start in the upper left corner, you will see that normalized residential sales were down 3.1% compared to last year bringing year-to-date decline down to 0.5%. As mentioned earlier, the comparison basis is the key here. You will notice that residential sales were up 6.2% when the COVID restrictions were at their greatest. In fact, one year later, they are only down 3.1% which suggests some of the increase in residential is having some staying power as more businesses have embraced a remote workforce for jobs that can be easily performed at home. In fact, the second quarter normalized sales in 2021 were the second highest second quarter on record exceeding every second quarter before the pandemic began. So moving to the right, weather normalized commercial sales increased by 10% bringing the year-to-date growth up to 3.9%. If you compare this with the residential class, you will notice the commercial sales growth in the second quarter is more symmetrical with last year when sales were down just over 10%. The growth in commercial sales for the quarter is spread across all operating companies and most sectors. The only sector that was down slightly compared to last year was grocery stores, which were very busy at the onset of the pandemic trying to keep shelves stocked when panic purchasing was at its highest. So moving to the lower left corner, you will see that the industrial sales also bounced back in the second quarter. Industrial sales for the quarter increased by 12.8% bringing the year-to-date growth up to 2 -- up 2.8%. Similar to commercial class -- the commercial class, you will see a symmetrical recovery compared to the second quarter of 2020 when sales were down 12.4%. Also industrial sales were up at every operating company and nearly every sector. The only industrial sector in our top 10 that reported less sales this year compared to the second quarter of 2020 is a paper manufacturing sector, which ironically was also higher last year, partially due to panic purchasing of toilet paper. This is a phenomenon that none of us is likely to forget especially if you were one of the folks who didn't get a jump on it. Finally, in the lower right corner, you can see that in total normalized retail sales increased by 6.3% for the quarter and were up 1.9% through the first half of the year. By all indications, recovery from the pandemic and recession are on a firm footing. So, let's go to slide 10. There are two more charts here that help put the second quarter normalized sales performance into perspective. The bar chart shows the last five years of weather normalized retail sales in the second quarters for the AEP System. Retail load performance in the second quarter of 2021 has not only recovered from the recession, but this is also the highest second quarter since 2018. The line chart on the bottom of this page shows the seasonally adjusted retail sales by quarter which provides an illustration of the trend of the recovery, and again, confirms that our current level of sales is the highest since the second quarter of 2018. So, before we leave the load story, let me remind you of an important factor to consider when evaluating the impact of load growth. The mix matters. So, while we are seeing strong growth now in commercial and industrial sales, those are priced at much lower realizations than the decline we are seeing in residential sales. To further illustrate this point, the impact of the pandemic was most pronounced in our biggest metropolitan area, that's Columbus Ohio. Since Columbus -- since AEP Ohio is in the T&D Utility segment where we only collect an unbundled rate, the strong recovery that we are seeing this year is coming in at much lower realizations in the system average. Finally, let me remind you that there are rate design mechanisms in place to limit the exposure when entering a downturn that can also limit the impact when you are coming out of recession. So while the industrial sales are up significantly this year versus last year, it does not mean that revenues will increase by the same percentage. So what does all this mean when we think about the remainder of 2020? Well, it means that our confidence in our earnings guidance range is fortified by what we are seeing. It suggests that the low trends we anticipated are coming to fruition as the chart on page nine illustrates. Our continued investment at Transco is fueling strong performance in this segment beyond the favorable true-up impact that we had anticipated. And while O&M is up, it's enabling us to take care of our business and customer needs given the low growth we are seeing. Obviously, we have the second half of the year to navigate, but we are pleased with the direction and are keeping a watchful eye on economic activity in our service territory, while scanning for any impact associated with rise in COVID variant. So, let's check in on the company's capitalization and liquidity position on page 11. On a GAAP basis, our debt to capital ratio increase 0.1% from the prior year quarter to 62.6% when adjusted for the Storm Uri event, the ratio remains consistent with year-end 2020 at 61.8%. Let's talk about our FFO to debt metric. As it did in the first quarter the effect of Storm Uri continues to have a temporary and noticeable impact in 2021 on this metric. Taking a look at the upper right quadrant on this page, you will see that our FFO to debt metric based on the traditional Moody's and GAAP calculated basis, as well as on an adjusted Moody's and GAAP calculated basis. On a traditional unadjusted basis, our FFO to debt ratio increased by 0.2% during the quarter to 9.3% on a Moody's basis. On an adjusted basis, the Moody's FFO to debt metric is 12.8%. To be very clear, this 12.8% figure removes or adjusts the calculation to eliminate the impact of approximately $1.2 billion of cash outflows associated with covering the unplanned Uri driven fuel and purchase power costs in the SPP region directly impacting PSO and SWEPCO in particular. This metric is also adjusted to remove the effect of the associated debt we used to fund the unplanned payments. It should give you a sense of where we would be from a business as usual perspective. As you know, we are in frequent contact with the rating agencies to keep them apprised of all aspects of our business. The rating agencies continue to take the anticipated regulatory recovery into consideration as it relates to our credit rating. And importantly, there continues to be no change in our equity financing plan and our multiyear cash flow forecast is laid out on page 39 does not assume any asset rotation proceeds. Given the regulatory recovery activity that currently in flight, we do expect our FFO to debt cash flow metric to return to the low to mid-teens target range next year. So here's a quick refresh on where all this regulatory activity stands today for PSO and SWEPCO. In Oklahoma, we are working through the regulatory process and anticipate issuing securitization bonds in the first half of 2022. In both Arkansas and Louisiana, recovery is underway, while final details get worked out in the regulatory process and we will be filing for recovery in Texas in the third quarter of 2021. So let's take a quick moment to visit our liquidity summary on slide 11. You will see here that our liquidity position remains strong at $3.3 billion, supported by our five-year $4 billion bank revolver and two-year $1 billion revolving credit facility that we entered into on March 31st of this year. If you look at the lower left side of the page, you will see there are qualified pension continues to be well funded and our OpEd is funded at 174.2%. So let's go to slide 12, we will do a quick wrap up and we can get your questions. Our performance in the first half of the year gives us confidence to reaffirm our operating earnings guidance range of $4.55 per share to $4.75 per share. Because of our ability to continue to invest in our own system organically including both our energy delivery system and the transformation of our generation fleet, we are confident in our ability to grow the company at our stated long-term growth rate of 5% to 7%. So we surely do appreciate your time and attention today. So, with that, I am going to turn the call over to the Operator for your questions. Yeah. Just maybe add a little finer point too. If you are thinking sequentially for the remainder of the year, our load growth rates are expected to moderate in the second half of the year based on prior year comps. So when you think about it, restrictions were most severe in the second quarter and by the third quarter of last year, so by the third quarter of last year, the service territory had begun essentially a phased reopening. And so as a result, the 6.3% growth for the second quarter, probably not only the highest growth in the quarter. And actually it is the highest growth in AEP's history. But it will also be the highest load growth stat during the recovery. So if you think about the second half of the year, I would expect it year-over-year to moderate a little bit and so we are just keeping a watchful eye on how the trend continues to click along. I know I saw in The Wall Street Journal this morning CFOs commenting on where they think the economy is going to go, doesn't look like anybody is changing their estimates based on COVID trends. But we are keeping an eye on that. Yeah. Thanks for the question, Steve. We have actually used the ATM to issue just under $200 million. I think there's around $195 million that was associated with the financing of the Sundance North Central wind facility and we will be continuing on with the rest of that program. As you know, about $100 million of that $600 million is also associated with the drip. So that continues to play in the background. Does that help? Yeah. Yeah. And then, I will -- Nick can add a finer point from a strategic perspective. But purely from a financing perspective, you are right on the money, Steve. So we got $1.4 billion embedded in our plan. And for those of you who following along at home, we are on page 39 of the cash flow if you want to take a look at 2022. About $100 million of that again is associated with the drip, about $800 million is associated with north central wind financing and then we have another $500 million just associated with general funding of growth CapEx. And so to your point, Steve, to the extent that we would find ourselves in a situation where we were able to transact and bring dollars in the door, we would absolutely be able to work off some of that, otherwise equity issuance and sidestep that. So I don't -- I can't give you a number. We don't have a transaction. But that is absolutely the thinking and how we are modeling different scenarios inside the house. And I don't know, Nick, if you have any comment, it would be great. And just if I could... ...to follow up... ...Steve. Again just to reiterate. The plan as it stands today, as you know, assumes no asset rotation. And again, I want to reinforce that, the 5% to 7% is well intact even if we don't have a transaction. Yeah. Thanks for the question, Stephen. As you know, we are a little tax efficient right now. So, given the tax basis in Kentucky and the different hurdles that we are considering, I wouldn't see that one being a show stopper. And quite frankly, that might give us an opportunity to enhance or improve our tax efficiency without getting into a bunch of numbers. I wouldn't let that trip you up in terms of what things could stop us moving forward. Yeah. No. That's spot on, Nick. And thanks for the question, Michael. As I am sitting here thinking about this and as we were preparing for the earnings call, one of the things I am looking at is the mix point. You look at where load is coming in. And as mentioned in a previous answer to a question, we do expect that load on a relative basis. When you compare it to last year, for the second half, it would not be as pronounced, although we do expect it to continue to improve. So that's a good thing. And that allows us to be a little more comfortable with O&M costs where they are, because that does help the customer in the long run. So we keep that top of mind and continue to be very diligent about managing costs. But if you are trying to model for the rest of the year, let me start by saying this, we are not changing our guidance. But as you know, once we start the year and we give you that plan, so you see that waterfall that we give to you, how we get to the end of the year, obviously changes, right, because it's a dynamic business. So I wouldn't be surprised if relative to that plan, if you saw our O&M be running a little richer. But I would hope that load would be hanging in there too. And then, as you know, we are doing well on the Transmission Holdco segment already kind of clipping along where we thought we would be for the full year. So there may be some benefit there too. So do keep that in mind when you go back and compare and contrast to that guidance walk that we gave to you. I think it was on February 25th during our earnings call and then we are happy to help you with any modeling that you have offline."

As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Ms. Darcy Reese, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nDarcy Reese: Thank you, Tony. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the First Quarter 2021 Earnings Call for American Electric Power. We appreciate you taking time today to join us today. Our earnings release, presentation slides and related financial information are available on our website at aep.com.\nNick Akins: Thanks, Darcy, and welcome again everyone to American Electric Power's first quarter 2021 earnings call and happy Earth Day. Before I get started with our results for the quarter, I just have to say, I was struck with the public relations - public reactions to the Chauvin verdict. It has been a long wait, but justice and faith in our legal system does prevail. I bring this up because it happens, I had chosen a song, which I do every quarter as you know for a different reason, but now it serves two purposes. One, the most mesmerizing singer as I'd ever heard was the late Marvin Gaye. I thought of his song when actually thinking about our quarter and the multitude of activities that AEP continues to accomplish and was thinking of what's going on the Marvin Gaye hit from 1971 written during another tumultuous time in America. This song was a plea for peace, justice and understanding perspectives to move forward in a positive way together. As I said, this song was released in 1971, 50 years ago, but it could not be more appropriate today. We need our leaders, our communities and indeed, our companies to continue to come together and stop the divisiveness, which the new cycle tends to feed off of and recognized we have a lot more in common than are differences, that would be a great start to advancing this nation in a positive way. That being said, getting to my original purpose, as I said earlier, what's going on with AEP as the lyrics say, hey, man, what's happening, whoo, everything is everything. We're going to do a get down today, why I tell you. So here we go, the first quarter of 2021 came in with operating earnings of $1.15 per share versus $1.02 for first quarter '20, which met our expectations particularly given impact in Texas, Arkansas, Louisiana and Oklahoma, which we reported on in last quarter's earnings call. AEP continues to reaffirm our 2021 guidance range of $4.55 to $4.75 per share and our 5% to 7% long-term growth rate, and we would still be disappointed not to be in the upper half of the guidance range.\nJulia Sloat: Thanks, Nick, and thanks, Darcy. It's good to be with everyone this morning. I'm going to walk us through the financial results for the quarter, share some thoughts on our service territory load and economy, and then finish with a review of our credit metrics and liquidity. So let's go to Slide 7, which shows the comparison of GAAP to operating earnings for the quarter. GAAP earnings were $1.16 per share compared to $1 per share in 2020. There is a reconciliation of GAAP to operating earnings on Page 15 of the presentation today. Let's walk through our quarterly operating earnings performance by segment, this is laid out on Slide 8. Operating earnings for the first quarter totaled $1.15 per share or $571 million compared to $1.02 per share or $504 million in 2020. Looking at the drivers by segment, operating earnings for the Vertically Integrated Utilities were $0.54 per share, up $0.04, driven by the favorable impact of weather due to warmer than normal winter temps in 2020. Other favorable items in this segment included Off-system sales, higher transmission revenue and the impact of rate changes across multiple jurisdictions, partially offsetting these favorable items were higher depreciation, lower normalized retail load, higher O&M, a prior period fuel adjustment and higher other taxes. The Transmission and Distribution Utilities segment earned $0.23 per share, down $0.01 from last year. Earnings in this segment declined primarily due to lower normalized retail load attributable in part to storm Uri. Other smaller decreases included higher depreciation, tax and O&M expenses. Favorable drivers in this segment included transmission revenue, rate changes and weather. The AEP Transmission Holdco segment continued to grow, contributing $0.35 per share, an improvement of $0.07 per share from last year. Net plant increased by $1.3 billion or 13% since March of last year. Generation and Marketing produced $0.06 per share, down $0.01 from last year. The favorable impact of the retirement of OCA Union and land sales on the generation business offset the unfavorable ERCOT market prices on the wholesale business during storm Uri in February. The decrease in the renewables business was driven by lower energy margins and higher expenses. Finally, Corporate and Other was up $0.04 per share, driven by an investment gain and lower interest expense, partially offsetting these items was the higher impact of - impact of higher taxes. Overall, we experienced a solid quarter and we're confident in reaffirming our annual operating earnings guidance. So let's take a look at our normalized load for the quarter on Page 9. Starting on the lower right corner, our first quarter normalized load came in 1.9% below the first quarter of 2020. There are two important factors to consider when evaluating the year-over-year comparison for the quarter. The first factor is that last year included an extra leap year day assuming everything else equal, you would expect about a 1% decline in sales due to one lesser day in the quarter, and the second factor is that the pandemic started during the last two weeks of the 2021st quarter. In other words, the first quarter analysis is comparing a pre-pandemic view of our service territory load to have you after COVID began. Importantly, we still expect a stronger recovery in the second half of this year as vaccinations increased positioning more communities to relax restrictions on businesses without jeopardizing public health and as a benefit of the American Rescue Plan stimulus, it was signed in late March, works its way through the economy. I'll talk a little bit more about the latest economic projections when we get to Slide 11. So let's take a look at the upper left quadrant, our normalized residential sales increased by 1.5% in the first quarter compared to last year. The growth in the residential sales was spread across most operating companies. As the pandemic recovery progresses, growth in residential sales as begun to moderate. While we expect residential sales to decline by 1.1% in 2021, we're assuming a moderate sustained load benefit from this customer class given the stickiness of work-from-home arrangements for many office workers across our service territory for the foreseeable future. So if you go over to the right, normalized commercial sales decreased by 1.6% in the first quarter. Even though commercial sales were down across every operating company excluding Ohio, we are seeing steady sequential improvement since the pandemic began. In fact, AEP Ohio was the first operating company to post positive commercial sales growth. This correlates well with the fact that the AEP Ohio territory added the most jobs in the first quarter. We also continue to see significant improvement in the same sectors that were hardest hit by the shutdowns in the second quarter of 2020. These sectors include schools, churches, restaurants and hotels. So finally, if you look in the lower left chart, you'll see that industrial sales decreased by 6.1% in the quarter compared to 2020. Industrial sales were down across every operating company and most industrial sectors. Not surprisingly, the biggest declines were located in the western territory where storm Uri in February caused a significant yet temporary - significant yet temporary disruptions to many manufacturing facilities located in ERCOT and SPP. In addition to the numerous electric generators unable to run due to frozen natural gas supply lines, there are a number of other manufacturing processes that rely on natural gas supply to produce their product. Many of those businesses were unable to produce for up to a week while the pipelines were being out and in some cases, industrial loads were stalled as long as 42 days in Texas. So the key takeaway here is that the dip in industrial sales in the first quarter was largely due to the one-time winter storm, which does not impact our fundamental outlook. So here's an interesting data point that illustrates this, our industrial sales in the eastern part of our service territory were down 2.6% as compared to the significant 12.8% drop in the western part of our service territory, which was impacted by Uri. So obviously, that's a pretty dramatic difference. That being said, we're still very bullish about the second half of the year as the US acquires a significantly greater concentration of immunity from vaccinations and as the full impact of the additional fiscal stimulus is felt throughout the service territory economy. So let's go over to Slide 10 where I can provide a little color on the industrial sales performance in the first quarter. The blue bars show the change in sales to our oil and gas customers. In aggregate, the sales to oil and gas sectors were down 9.6% in the first quarter, led by the 21% reduction in oil and gas extraction. Most of the decline in this sector is in response to the challenging market signals from last year when the drop in global demand along with the temporary price war caused oil prices to fall below many producers' breakeven point. However, we do not expect the weakness in oil and gas to persist. In fact, natural gas prices in March were up about 60% from last year and domestic oil prices last month have more than doubled since March of 2020. We fully expect the higher prices today will provide the necessary signal that producers are looking for to increase their production within the service territory. And once we see the production increase in the upstream sectors, it's only a matter of time before we see the corresponding increase in the midstream and downstream operations. The orange bars in the chart show the change in industrial sales, excluding oil and gas. While it was still down 3.3% for the quarter, we expect to see stronger improvement in the second half of the year as the global economy recovers from the pandemic. Some of the weakness in manufacturing right now is related to supply chain disruptions. As efforts continue to strengthen the resiliency of the domestic supply chain for manufacturing, the AEP service territory is certainly positioned to benefit from any movement in that direction. So let's go over to Slide number 11 where I can provide an update that I mentioned a few moments ago on the latest economic conditions within the AEP footprint. Starting in the lower left chart or on the left chart, you'll see that AEP service territory experienced a 1.6% increase in gross regional product compared to the first quarter of 2020. This was much better than the US, which had a relatively flat first quarter in terms of year-over-year GDP growth. The AEP service territory was less impacted by the virus and had fewer restrictions on businesses than other parts of the country, which has allowed the regional economy to fare better than the US throughout the pandemic. Looking forward, the AEP service territory is expected to grow by 5.2% in 2021, lagging the economic recovery in the US as you might expect. Moving to employment on the right, you can see that the job market for the AEP service territory has also outperformed the US throughout the pandemic. For the quarter, employment growth was only down 1.6%, which was 4 points or 4% better than the US during the first quarter. This is largely the result of the mix of jobs in our local economy, which has a heavier relative concentration of manufacturing and government jobs and a smaller share of leisure and hospitality jobs. Going forward, we expect job growth of 1.7% in 2021. So let's go over to Page 12 checking on the Company's capitalization and liquidity position. On a GAAP basis, our debt to capital ratio is 62.5%. When adjusted for the Storm Uri event, the ratio remains consistent with our year-end 2020 ratio at 61.8%. Let's talk about our FFO to debt metric because as you would expect and as we've been signaling, the impact of Storm Uri has and will have a temporary and noticeable impact in 2021 on this metric. Taking a look at the upper right quadrant on this page, you see our FFO to debt metric based on the traditional Moody's and GAAP calculated basis as well as on an adjusted Moody's and GAAP calculated basis. On a traditional unadjusted basis, our FFO to debt ratio decreased by 3.9% during the quarter to 9.1% on a Moody's basis. Well, this is a pretty dramatic impact. The rating agencies are very much aware of this and have taken the metric data point as well as the anticipated recovery into consideration as it relates to our credit rating. On an adjusted basis, the Moody's FFO to debt metric is 12.9%. To be very clear, this 12.9% figure removes or adjusts the calculation to eliminate the impact of approximately $1.2 billion of cash outflows associated with covering the unplanned Uri-driven fuel and purchase power in the SPP region directly impacting PSO and SWEPCO in particular. The metric is also adjusted to remove the effect of the associated debt we used to fund the unplanned payments. This should give you a sense of where we would be from a business as usual prospectus of 12.9% business as usual. As you know, we're in frequent contact with the rating agencies to keep them apprised of all aspects of our business and importantly, there is no change in our equity financing plan. On the topic of anticipated recovery, there is no debate that Storm Uri was an extreme event and consequently, the various states would like to resolve recovery docket as expeditiously as practical. Assuming recovery begins this year, our cash flow metrics will quickly return to the low to mid-teens target range next year as expected. So this should be a one year phenomenon for us. As many of you know, we have initiated regulatory cases in our respective states to evaluate the costs and determine the recovery plan. Let me provide a quick update where we are in this process. On February 24th, PSO filed with the Commission for recovery of fuel costs through a - with a regulatory asset and weighted average cost of capital carrying charge and subsequently filed a motion seeking recovery of a $615 million regulatory asset with a five-year amortization. At this point, PSO has received approval to defer the storm-related costs, with recovery of the established regulatory asset over five years at an interim rate of PSO's short-term financing cost of like 75 basis points. This is intended to be an interim order and the actual carrying charge will determined in a future review and the regulatory asset amount is subject to finalization. Importantly, Oklahoma has also taken up a securitization bill to address the extraordinary fuel and purchase power costs felt by all utilities, PSO will evaluate as the securitization is appropriate for the recovery. And if so, we would expect it to occur as early as next year. In March, the Arkansas Public Service Commission issued an order authorizing recovery of the approximate $113 million Arkansas jurisdictional share of the retail customer fuel cost over five years, with the carrying charges to be determined at a later date and the actual amount to be recovered being subject to finalization. We requested a WACC rate, which was supported by the staff in accordance with the order, SWEPCO began recovery in this jurisdiction in April, that was at a customer deposit rate of something like 80 basis points. The recovery period and associated carrying charge will be further reviewed in a hearing that's already been set for July 8th of this year, so 2021. In March, the Louisiana Public Service Commission approved a special order granting a temporary modification to the fuel adjustment clause to allow utilities to spread recovery over a longer period of time. In April, SWEPCO begin recovery of the Louisiana jurisdictional share of these fuel costs is about $150 million based on a five-year recovery period in a fuel over under recovery mechanism. SWEPCO will be working with the Louisiana Commission to finalize the actual recovery period and determine the appropriate carrying charge. And in Texas, SWEPCO intends to file for recovery under fuel surcharge, most likely in the second quarter. Our current plan is to request recovery over five years with a WACC carrying charge. Obviously, we have a lot in process on the regulatory recovery front on this matter and we'll keep you apprised as we make progress, because as we all know this is extremely important. Let's take a quick moment to visit our liquidity summary on the lower right of Slide 12. In March - on March 31st, AEP renewed its $4 billion bank revolver for five years and also entered into a two-year $1 billion revolving credit facility to fortify our liquidity position as we go forward, just placed our net liquidity position as of March 31st at a strong $3.4 billion. Switching gears, our qualified pension funding increased 1.7% during the quarter to 103.5% and our OPEB funding increased 9.6% to 170.5%. Rising interest rates that decreased plan liabilities along with positive equity returns were the primary drivers for the funded status increases in both plans during the first quarter. So let's go to Slide 13, so we can wrap this thing up and get your questions, but I just want to call out a couple of quick things before we do that. So on top of mind for many folks I know this, we want to mention to you that we completed the planned $125 million equity funding portion of the North Central Wind Sundance project. We used our at the market mechanism, so that we could time the equity need with our purchase of the Sundance project, which occurred last week. As you know, we will continue to move forward with additional opportunities in the renewable space supporting our ESG focus as we transition toward a clean energy future. Our performance in the first quarter and stability of our regulated business model gives us the confidence to reaffirm our operating earnings guidance range of $4.55 per share to $4.75 per share. Because of our ability to continue to invest in our own system organically, we are confident in our ability to grow the Company at our stated long-term growth rate of 5% to 7%. So we surely do appreciate your time and attention today. And with that, I'm going to turn the call over to the operator for your questions.\nOperator:  Our first question comes from the line of Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead.\nNick Akins: Good morning, Shar.\nShar Pourreza: Good morning, guys. Good morning, Nick. Good morning, everyone.\nJulia Sloat: Good morning.\nShar Pourreza: So the - couple of quick questions here. First on the incremental 8.6 gigs of renewable opportunities, which just added to plan. It's very sizable - maybe touch a little bit on how we should think about these new opportunities in light of the 5% to 7% growth that you gave, what sort of financing avenues were you kind of looking at the approval tariffs and what are you assuming in terms of owned versus PPA?\nNick Akins: Yeah, I think we have - the last part - last part of your question first. I think we have a pretty compelling argument now for owners of these facilities given even past the winter storm activity that we learned operationally, certainly what we learned from the - really this the provisions of the agreements that we put in place relative to the approvals really stands better in terms of our ability to manage the project, manage congestion, manage other factors that really provide benefits to our customers. So we're going to make a strong position that we should own those assets and actually when you think about the strength of the utilities, it's going to be important for the states to really focus on how do we keep our utilities strong and PPAs don't do it from a capital structure perspective. We need to make sure that ownership and their flexibility of operations is key in that regard. And regarding the other, 8600 megawatts, yeah, it is a sizable number, but obviously when you look at the evaluation of the retirements, when you look at the needs of the operating companies and also North Central certainly showed, you can deploy capital and reduce the overall bills to consumers. So when you think about the retirements of coal-fired generation, the imposition of additional transmission, having the benefits of the fuel cost aspects of it are tremendously important. So when you look at the analysis having some level of carbon pricing in there certainly increases the focus on the ability for renewables to come into play and that's certainly what we've been focusing on. So as you look at the finance ability of it, the finance ability pretty much work like we - like it did for North Central, although it is large number. So we'll have to be very aware of what our balance sheet strength looks like during the process, the timing of when the different tranches of these renewables come into play, the cash position that supported with these projects coming online and being able to improve as Julia mentioned. This FFO to debt thing where it is today is really a 2021 issue. In 2022, FFO to debt comes back up and certainly with the ability to put these projects in place, it will help in terms of our ability to continue to fund these projects. So it will probably - we've certainly would like for it all to be incremental, but in reality when you go through this process, it will probably be around capital allocation and prioritization associated with that within the existing plan, but also incremental. So it'd be a combination of both. Yet to be seen, obviously if load continues to grow, if the position relative to the regulatory framework getting concurrent recovery, making sure that we get off the tax ADIT issues, that's all going to be helpful in terms of our ability to finance. So it's still a work in progress.\nShar Pourreza: Got it. And then maybe just transitioning to corporate strategy and asset optimization, obviously, the strategic review for Kentucky is started, so Brian has been obviously very busy year, can we maybe just elaborate on the phase we are in with that process has - have bidders emerge or data rooms opened and assuming this would backfill most of your Wind Catcher equity need. So assuming we are looking at a Duke style Indiana GIC transaction for the entire OPCo. So we should obviously consider leakage share any NOLs as well that could be applicable in this case?\nNick Akins: Yes, Shar, you are always ahead in terms of questions. Yeah, and I really can't answer any of those at this point because we are in a process and certainly as soon as we have information on it, I think the real issue here is, we have made a deliberate decision to really start our portfolio management approach and evaluating jurisdictions, because we are fully regulated. We can look at these areas and determine what the best fit is in terms of future capital needs and what our focus is in terms of moving to a clean energy economy. So - and for us to come out and say that we are in a strategic process relative to Kentucky is an important statement in that regard. That's probably as far as we can go right now.\nShar Pourreza: Let me ask you something a little bit more of a theoretical question, would you consider asset rotations above your current equity needs, let's say, from North Central to fund the incremental CapEx or renewables or T&D, I mean, you're within your credit metric guidance but does it make sense for you to further improve your balance sheet and simplify your store even further. I mean, do you kind of like looking at the stock valuation and does it may be more sense to - do you think there's incremental value from a multiple standpoint to even have a stronger balance sheet and operating even less states here and I'm thinking maybe Texas?\nNick Akins: Well, certainly, like I said, this is at the beginning of this process, but multiple expansion is clearly on our minds and making sure that you can - you're investing in the right things at the right places at the right time is going to be incredibly important. And you saw that with North Central of timing the recovery with the actual investments with the turnkey approach that we took and it's all about the timing of it, it's all about the decisions made to ensure that we are doing proper capital allocation and rotation to manage this process forward. So - and like I said earlier, that's going to be a continuing part of our business.\nShar Pourreza: Terrific. Thank you, guys. I'll jump in the queue. I appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. Next, we go to the line of Julien Dumoulin Smith with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nNick Akins: Good morning, Julien.\nJulien Dumoulin Smith: Hey, good morning, team. Congratulations on all these updates.\nNick Akins: Yeah.\nJulien Dumoulin Smith: A lot to digest here today, I did. If I can, let's start with a higher level question here, right. So you're proposing a lot specifically in PSO, how do you think about the events that have transpired in Texas and Uri impacting that and specifically around some intermittent resources like solar in Oklahoma, right. We just haven't seen a lot of that historically and so this is a little bit of new territory for that geography more than the economics all around. Can you talk to that and have you kind of vetted some of the proposals here and the approval process?\nNick Akins: Yeah, so obviously, we're right out of the gate in terms of the announcement of what's included in each jurisdiction. So we'll have discussions with the commissions and that's part of the integrated resource planning processes and keep in mind too, when we do this evaluation during the RFP, I mean, during the process, as always solving for whatever the lease cost is in terms of what those resources are. So it shows up as win. And then solar, typically it's showing up as more wind early on and solar starts to pick up, but that's pretty fungible as you go forward. I mean, these plans will change as we go forward based upon where technologies go, certainly where the opportunities exist. Oklahoma may want more wind and less solar, but that won't matter, it'd be a part of the total renewables piece that's included there. The other part of it too is, we will be very mindful of how much renewables are placed into service in relation to 24/7 supply and there is some natural gas that's built into this plan as well that enables more renewables to be put in place, but the real focus going forward during this transitional period will be for units that provide 24/7 to be more of a reliability component, certainly more of a - sort of an insurance backstop for weather events or other events that may occur that impact the grid security and will have to be very, very mindful of how those studies actually go. And I'll tell you, in our climate report, we saw for 2050 with a $15 carbon price and then more aggressive $30 carbon price, the 2035 case didn't solve because of the timing of getting resources in place and system-related issues. So you have to really think about how that's done and we've looked at these plans and we certainly believe that was the level of 24/7 supply we still have out there and the additional opportunity associated with just the diversity of some of these projects. It's going to be of particular value to our customers going forward. And I guess, I'll just remind you that North Central, had it been operational during this time of the Texas and Oklahoma outages with the Uri would have saved customers $227 million. So you think about the savings associated with that and the other thing too, the previous question, someone was - Shar was asking, when the utilities do it, they focus on the long term and North Central already had the weather package is already in place where you don't find that in a large part of the market. So we think the long-term when we go about after these investments and that's why ownership is clearly important.\nJulien Dumoulin Smith: Excellent. And just to clarify this a little bit further, I know that the equity numbers aren't moving around too much, we're at all, frankly, relative to CapEx, but how much capital could be shifted given the latest updates here in the three-year versus the five-year outlook here? Just want to understand, out of the total 10-year view that you guys are providing today, how much could be in that three-year and five-year window as you think about just the specific timing of each of these dockets that will come up for renewable resources?\nNick Akins: Well, yeah, as I mentioned, 10,000 of the megawatts of the 16,000 - over 16,000 is in the '21 to '25 timeframe, so it's going to be near-term. So when you think about these projects, they take a couple of years to put in place. You'll be looking more at that '23 to '25 for most of it, but some of it was - is already in play. There is already RFPs going out for suppliers of some of these renewables as we speak. Julia, anything do you want to add to that?\nJulia Sloat: No, you've got that perfect, thank you.\nNick Akins: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nStephen Byrd: Hi, thanks guys for taking my question.\nNick Akins: Good morning, Stephen.\nStephen Byrd: Good morning. Congrats on a great update and a big movement in renewables, so happy to see that. I wanted - if you could just talk a little bit more about as you grow out renewables, whether there might be some additional transmission distribution requirements or stores there just other things that would sort of be additive as well, it's obviously just huge amount of megawatts, just curious about the other impacts?\nNick Akins: Yeah, there will be and many of these projects, obviously, we'll have to look at the placement of these projects as in the level of congestion, but also the level of transmission investment that's required. But keep in mind too with the Biden administrations doing relative to the movement to clean energy, which obviously is a big part of his plan, large scale transmission will also be incredibly important. So, I see with what's going on today and in excess of all these things coming together, our transmission which you've always said is, as far as I can see for a decade, well, it's probably even higher. We don't know what that number is at this point and I think we've got to get through the process and fully understand that, but when you do the net benefits associated with fuel and the capital cost of the renewables projects and transmission, it's still a benefit to consumers. So, we'll go through that process, but you're right to be bullish about transmission in relation to these investments, but also everyone else's investments because we are the largest transmission provider in the country and most of this has to come through us.\nStephen Byrd: That's really helpful. And then I wanted to drill into Texas for just a moment. There are some bills as you know that are floating around that would permit securitization of costs and those look to be, I guess to me, quite helpful from a financing point of view, just curious how you're thinking about that impact, how might that impact your thoughts on financing? I appreciate the point you raised earlier that essentially the credit metrics are sort of artificially low at the moment because of the storm, but with some of this - some of these bills be especially helpful to you?\nNick Akins: Well, certainly the ERCOT portion of Texas, we are essentially a large company there at T&D. So, and we have, based on our cost provisions in place for recovery of that, we - the only real exposure we've got from a standpoint is any, I guess some of the reps, they could potentially go bankrupt and - but that's where it's going to be important to understand where that goes and also as far as securitization is concerned, we view securitization in the past in Texas and you're seeing it develop for what's classified of storm caused, but it really is Uri-related investments we'd be fine with that. Julia, anything...\nJulia Sloat: No, that would be great. Great question, Stephen. So, we're keeping an eye on what's going on in Oklahoma. There is an opportunity potentially to engage in some securitization activity there, would love to get cash in the door. So if that's something that's workable, we will absolutely take the cash and my understanding is, the way that is being at least they initially discussed it and potentially structured would be such - in such a way that that does not sit on our balance sheet, which makes it even better. So, yes, we'll take that cash and with no doubt on the balance sheet, we like that very much. So, we are definitely poised and ready and waiting.\nStephen Byrd: That's great. Maybe one last quick one, just as we think about this growth in renewables, any changes in terms of your thoughts on coal retirement dates?\nNick Akins: Well, obviously the move we made on the second Rockport Unit solidified at least at 2028 and it could occur earlier depend on what the conditions are and what the evaluations are with the commission and the replacements of capacity. And so, we are - and actually, we're looking for provisions like that even in legislation that's occurring, because you're seeing all kinds of incentives developed for extension of PTCs, ITCs, direct pay we like, so direct pay not only for renewables projects, but also for transmission. If you have an ITC, but I think also, we'd like to see incentives for the undepreciated plant balances of coal units to further accelerate the ability to retire and obviate the impact to our customers. But the current plan does assume any of these advancements so - and this happens all the time where we have plans that are out there that are public, but lot of things get worked on and we'll continue to work on these objectives, because our objective is to move as quickly as possible to derisk these investments, particularly with new environmental rules with CCR and other things. We're making decisions about these plants and you've seen the last two quarters, we've announced earlier retirements of coal and lignite plant operation. So I would fully expect to see that process to continue.\nStephen Byrd: Very good. Thank you very much.\nNick Akins: Yeah.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nSteve Fleishman: Yeah, thanks. Good morning, Nick and team.\nNick Akins: Good morning, Steve. How are you doing?\nSteve Fleishman: I'm doing well. I have a couple of questions on the Kentucky Power announcement.\nNick Akins: Yeah.\nSteve Fleishman: So just I think, Nick, you said that you're doing a strategic review with a target for year-end. So, is that the target to basically have a sales done and proceeds by year-end or have a kind of like a sale or other plan announced by year-end?\nNick Akins: Steve, so, I didn't say year-end. I said we would get the evaluation done in 2021, that could be earlier in the year, it could be later in the year. Obviously, we need to get farther down the road in terms of this process. I can tell you that the process is established, it's ongoing and we're going to move as quickly as possible. So - and we've always talked about the timing of the resolution of anything related to the weather was Kentucky or anything else in relation to the needs around North Central. So, and we still believe that timing fits.\nSteve Fleishman: Okay, that's helpful.\nNick Akins: So, I wasn't saying that would be the end of the year before we know anything, I just said during '21.\nSteve Fleishman: Okay. And just, is there kind of - this may be, it seems silly, but just, is there a reason that this wasn't like part of your slide deck or release or just - it was just stated on the call, just - it's something just happened, the Board just decide something?\nNick Akins: No, I think it was out of respect to our employees, because obviously, you can't say something like this from an SEC perspective without some thought around that, but also there is the human aspects of it too and employee aspects. Matter of fact, our employees just found out about it. When I've said it, I have a webcast after this with all employees to talk about this to just alleviate their concerns through the process, but this is the way that occurs, there is multiple things you have to think about when you're making these kinds of announcements.\nSteve Fleishman: Understood. And then just in terms of - that's helpful. So in terms of the - in terms of thinking about your financing, this would still be potentially directed at replacing the equity needs that you have currently for North Central as a potential replacement for some of that it will be?\nNick Akins: Yeah, I'll let Julia talk about that.\nJulia Sloat: Steve, yeah, thank you for the question. Absolutely, to the extent that we get dollars in the door, that will be a wonderful place to put that to work in terms of being able to sidestep some of the equity need and we'll see if we can make that happen, absolutely.\nNick Akins: We have the that we've access, but obviously it would change the nature of that.\nSteve Fleishman: One challenge with Kentucky Power has a lot of coal plants and exposure I guess, so to speak, just, do you feel like there is still despite that decent interest to be able to monetize at a reasonable price?\nNick Akins: Yeah, and obviously different parties look at in different ways and that's what we're going to find out and through the strategic process is what evaluation Kentucky's ownership of Mitchell in terms of valuation and its impact on overall price would be. It still has value, it's still has years to operate and certainly, if you look at the plan that we presented, you still have a potential renewables opportunity there, particularly with the potential retirement of Mitchell at some point. So, anyone who is looking at this, I would say, it's not - in terms of just the valuation of Mitchell, it's a evaluation of what you do with it during the transition. So there's a lot of things to look at from that perspective.\nSteve Fleishman: And my last question just on this topic and my last question is just, the overall portfolio optimization kind of that you've been doing, is this a conclusion of that or is this something where we could get more?\nNick Akins: No, it's going to be an ongoing part of our process. So it's just the beginning.\nSteve Fleishman: Great. That's helpful. Thank you very much.\nNick Akins: Yeah, okay.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of the Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nNick Akins: Good morning, Durgesh.\nDurgesh Chopra: Hey, good morning, Nick. Thank you for taking my question. Just I have - I think you've covered the rest, just on storm costs, Julia, you're currently deferring those, right, the $1.2 billion on the balance sheet, can you just reminded us...\nJulia Sloat: Yeah...\nDurgesh Chopra: Thank you. Can you just remind us what is factored into your 2021 guidance, I'm just thinking about how the sort of the regulatory decisions here in the next few months impact your 2021 numbers?\nJulia Sloat: Yeah, absolutely. You have it exactly right. We're deferring those storm costs, particularly as it relates to the fuel and purchase power costs, because that's the biggest chunk of the dollars that we had exposure to as it relates to storm in Uri in particular. And as it relates to what's embedded in our guidance, I would tell you, we actually updated our cash flow forecast. That's included in the slide deck that you have today to incorporate the impact of this particular circumstance as well as the fact that we did have some ice storms and more I'd characterize more kind of normal storm-related activities that occurred in the eastern portion of our jurisdictions here during the first quarter. So all of that is factored into those new cash flow forecast details, which you'll see impacting the cash flow from operations line in the slide included in the deck today. As you know, we did take on some additional debt to be able to accommodate the fuel and purchase power spike that was not anticipated and so that is now being absorbed into our 2021 operations and therefore into our earnings. Interestingly, if you look at Page number 8 of the slide deck that we have out there today, on the Corporate and Other segment, you'll actually see that interest expense was a benefit to us this time despite the fact that we have taken on a little additional debt in that capacity, because we took a $500 million term loan on at the parent company interest rates - in terms of interest cost I should say, was much lower in this particular quarter versus last year. We do have - still have lower debt outstanding from a short-term perspective versus last year. So all of those factors, interestingly, helped to have this impact to be one of benefit to us in this particular period. So, steady as she goes, no change in forecast, still feeling really good about where we are. Hopefully that helps you a little bit.\nDurgesh Chopra: It does. It does a nutshell. It's captured in your EPS guidance, interest costs and the cash flow metrics already reflect the sort of the some of the treatment you might get in terms of recovery for these costs.\nJulia Sloat: You've got it. We did that by design because we wanted to make sure we had a fair amount of integrity in that forecast with - particularly when you look at the cash flow metrics and give a shout out to our fixed income friends because I know that's extremely important.\nDurgesh Chopra: Understood, thanks. Just one last one for me. Nick, you mentioned the disappointing first quarter, it's just what to look forward there in terms of next steps, is there going to be a rulemaking procedure and just next steps there, what should we be looking for there?\nNick Akins: Yeah, there it is open for right now. So, and obviously our comments will be very direct and very focused, and I'm sure there'll be others in the industry with that as well, but it just seems like a direct polar opposite to where the administration is trying to go with movement to a clean energy economy and really it is directly opposite to years of precedents of encouraging the development of transmission. So I'm certainly hopeful as we get through the dialog of what this all means and actually with RTO participation, when we originally joined the RTO years ago, we were making a lot of money off of through an outrates of transmission. We traded that in for generation benefits, because we were selling a lot of generation. We're not selling generation, so to any real extent and certainly when you look at the value proposition of an RTO, it is centered on the ability to optimize across a larger jurisdiction. But from an AEP perspective, you got the cost of the RTO and certainly, our customers need to be able to benefit from that. So if you disrupt that net cost benefit opportunity, you will have people making different decisions about RTO participation. So I think it's just sort of a policy move in the wrong direction, but certainly and hopeful that the commission comes together on that.\nDurgesh Chopra: Understood. Is there a timeline as to when the common period ends and when they might make a final determination yet?\nNick Akins: I don't know that there is right now, they have to post the noper in the Federal Register first. So we're thinking probably a summer timeframe for the noper.\nDurgesh Chopra: Understood. Thank you. Appreciate the color.\nNick Akins: Yeah.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Weisel with Scotiabank. Please go ahead.\nNick Akins: Good morning, Andrew.\nAndrew Weisel: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. I appreciate late in the call here. First, just to follow up on the transmission, are you able to provide an EPS sensitivity or potential impact if that RTO incentive adder would it be eliminated?\nNick Akins: Yeah, we had in our queue, actually, the number for our evaluation that we lost the entire 50 basis points, it would amount to $55 million to $70 million pre-tax. So - and that's the evaluation now and who knows what they're going to do because you went in the meeting thinking they may actually go up on the RTO incentive, but they remains to be seen what they decide to do, but that's the impact.\nAndrew Weisel: Well, that was the next thing I was going to ask, do you see any potential of an increase or do you think that's, it's a highly improbable at this point?\nNick Akins: I think certainly with what transpired, we're just trying to make sure it stays the same, but if it increases, there's a lot of reasons for it to increase because RTO participation and the adders associated with transmission, like I said, the expenses of an RTO continue to go up and up. So I think there definitely needs to be an incentive there.\nAndrew Weisel: Okay, great. Then just one last follow-up question on the renewables. Do you - you talked a bit about the cost savings from coal plant retirements and I know it's early and the cost would be continuously changing hopefully downward. But from what you see today, do you expect this update to the generation stack to lower customer bills in most cases, all else equal and you mentioned something about potential carbon policy, does your analysis assumes some sort of federal clean energy standard and how would it look from an affordability perspective without that?\nNick Akins: We've always had the carbon value in our analysis from a resource planning perspective and I think it's $15 a ton is what we've used. In our reports, our Climate Report, we used two cases, a $15 case and a $30 case that was more aggressive and certainly that brought more - that case more renewables in more quickly, but that's not reflected in the plan that we've shown here. So, yes, it's certainly something that we're - we will continue to look at and evaluate with the commission.\nJulia Sloat: If I could...\nNick Akins: Yeah go ahead.\nJulia Sloat: Just to throw additional finer point on that as well, if carbon pricing is excluded from the equation, the renewable opportunity could get a haircut buy about 2 gigawatts. So it's not that significant, but want to throw that out there.\nNick Akins: Yeah, we're looking at this thing as a $15 billion to $20 billion investment opportunity. So, it would be not much of an impact if you took out the carbon pricing, but you can't plan for anything without putting in a carbon pricing these days.\nAndrew Weisel: Okay, great. And the affordability question, assuming the carbon is in the bulk part of what you're talking...\nNick Akins: Yeah, and we've demonstrated that with North Central. I mean, you can put these projects in place and keep in mind, we're thinking about the resiliency and reliability of the grid too. So there's limitations and we have to go through that process, but the ones we have in this plan, we can do and certainly, when you look at the benefits of North Central, for example, it was $3 billion of benefit to the customers and so when you have those kinds of economics in play, if you're able to run your 24/7 generation has more of a reliability and as an insurance policy essentially and layer in as much renewables you can, put in transmission to make sure of the system continues to operate the way it should and then it could be pretty powerful combination to benefit customers in the future.\nAndrew Weisel: That's great. Thank you very much for the details.\nNick Akins: Yeah.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nNick Akins: Good morning, Jeremy.\nJeremy Tonet: Good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in here at the end. Just wanted to touch based on Rockport, if I could, in kind of the decision tree that led to this and just wanted to see what other kinds of options you were evaluating, just a bit more color would be helpful there, thanks.\nNick Akins: Yeah, so obviously we were looking at future requirements instead of environmental requirements on the units and if we kept them operating longer than 2028, that would be a challenge from an economic perspective. We didn't want to start making those kinds of investments not knowing how long the units would actually be operational, so that was a consideration. The other, as I mentioned, was litigation to clear all that out to make sure we took ownership and we took control. And then, of course the value of the short-term bridge that exists that gives us the flexibility to make decisions with the Indiana Commission to focus on what is the right path for that transition. So it gives us a lot of optionality, a lot of flexibility and the control and by the way, I mean there's two units there. So one we own, one we leased and it just made more sense for us to own both of them and make the decision of the plant as a whole and be able to adjust accordingly. So, it worked out well overall from that perspective and like I say, it gives us a lot of optionality and flexibility and actually at a pretty - at a price that I think it was $115 million. So it's an opportunity for us to really pay for that degree of optionality that has considerable value.\nJeremy Tonet: Great, that's helpful. I'll stop there. Thanks.\nNick Akins: Yeah, sort of thing.\nDarcy Reese: This is Darcy. We have time for one more question.\nOperator: Great, thank you. Our last question comes from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nNick Akins: Michael, you snuck in there.\nMichael Lapides: I snuck in at the end that better late than never. Thank you for taking my question, team. Hey, Nick, you mentioned Kentucky today, you also outline the renewable growth platform and plan for the regulated businesses. And obviously, lots of renewable companies, pure plays trading at pretty good multiples even after the recent share price weakness, just curious how do you think about the renewable portfolio at the G&M segment and whether that piece of the business is truly core to AEP or whether the real growth is obviously in the regulated subsidiaries and maybe the non-reg contracted renewable business could potentially be a source of funds for the parent to fund regulated growth?\nNick Akins: Yeah, so that's been a continual part of our business, just gets allocated capital, the AEP Energy gets allocated capital and he is perfectly willing to throw it back over the fence, because we make evaluations based upon his threshold which is commensurate with the regulated part and also just his business is important because it keeps us in a part of, like for example, we're doing a lot of projects here in Ohio directly with customers and it enables us to with customers and corporations actually and enables us to be in that business, but at the same time, we're able to manage the capital such that you can throw it back over the fence if we see a better opportunity on the regulated side. So we have that working very well where we can make those trade-offs on a continual basis. So yes, it could be a source of capital to do some of these things, and again that lends itself to the portfolio management approach to ensure that we're putting the money in the right place at the right time. So - and like I said, he is doing an incredible job with that and that organization and the fact is they are still doing the renewable part of it, but they're also doing specific relationships with customers with microgrids and those types of applications. So, the value proposition of that business is so important to us seeing the leading edge of what we need to be doing and making cases in our regulated business to ensure that we can continue to grow from those perspectives as well. So, all in all, it's working fine. But, yeah, the answer is yes, we can utilize that as a source.\nMichael Lapides: Got it. Thank you, Nick. Much appreciate it, guys.\nNick Akins: Okay.\nDarcy Reese: Hey, Tani, I wanted to say thank you for joining us on today's call. As always, the IR team will be available to answer any questions you may have. If you could please give the replay information.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Nick Akins",
            "content": "Thanks, Darcy, and welcome again everyone to American Electric Power's first quarter 2021 earnings call and happy Earth Day. Before I get started with our results for the quarter, I just have to say, I was struck with the public relations - public reactions to the Chauvin verdict. It has been a long wait, but justice and faith in our legal system does prevail. I bring this up because it happens, I had chosen a song, which I do every quarter as you know for a different reason, but now it serves two purposes. One, the most mesmerizing singer as I'd ever heard was the late Marvin Gaye. I thought of his song when actually thinking about our quarter and the multitude of activities that AEP continues to accomplish and was thinking of what's going on the Marvin Gaye hit from 1971 written during another tumultuous time in America. This song was a plea for peace, justice and understanding perspectives to move forward in a positive way together. As I said, this song was released in 1971, 50 years ago, but it could not be more appropriate today. We need our leaders, our communities and indeed, our companies to continue to come together and stop the divisiveness, which the new cycle tends to feed off of and recognized we have a lot more in common than are differences, that would be a great start to advancing this nation in a positive way. That being said, getting to my original purpose, as I said earlier, what's going on with AEP as the lyrics say, hey, man, what's happening, whoo, everything is everything. We're going to do a get down today, why I tell you. So here we go, the first quarter of 2021 came in with operating earnings of $1.15 per share versus $1.02 for first quarter '20, which met our expectations particularly given impact in Texas, Arkansas, Louisiana and Oklahoma, which we reported on in last quarter's earnings call. AEP continues to reaffirm our 2021 guidance range of $4.55 to $4.75 per share and our 5% to 7% long-term growth rate, and we would still be disappointed not to be in the upper half of the guidance range. Good morning, Shar. Yeah, I think we have - the last part - last part of your question first. I think we have a pretty compelling argument now for owners of these facilities given even past the winter storm activity that we learned operationally, certainly what we learned from the - really this the provisions of the agreements that we put in place relative to the approvals really stands better in terms of our ability to manage the project, manage congestion, manage other factors that really provide benefits to our customers. So we're going to make a strong position that we should own those assets and actually when you think about the strength of the utilities, it's going to be important for the states to really focus on how do we keep our utilities strong and PPAs don't do it from a capital structure perspective. We need to make sure that ownership and their flexibility of operations is key in that regard. And regarding the other, 8600 megawatts, yeah, it is a sizable number, but obviously when you look at the evaluation of the retirements, when you look at the needs of the operating companies and also North Central certainly showed, you can deploy capital and reduce the overall bills to consumers. So when you think about the retirements of coal-fired generation, the imposition of additional transmission, having the benefits of the fuel cost aspects of it are tremendously important. So when you look at the analysis having some level of carbon pricing in there certainly increases the focus on the ability for renewables to come into play and that's certainly what we've been focusing on. So as you look at the finance ability of it, the finance ability pretty much work like we - like it did for North Central, although it is large number. So we'll have to be very aware of what our balance sheet strength looks like during the process, the timing of when the different tranches of these renewables come into play, the cash position that supported with these projects coming online and being able to improve as Julia mentioned. This FFO to debt thing where it is today is really a 2021 issue. In 2022, FFO to debt comes back up and certainly with the ability to put these projects in place, it will help in terms of our ability to continue to fund these projects. So it will probably - we've certainly would like for it all to be incremental, but in reality when you go through this process, it will probably be around capital allocation and prioritization associated with that within the existing plan, but also incremental. So it'd be a combination of both. Yet to be seen, obviously if load continues to grow, if the position relative to the regulatory framework getting concurrent recovery, making sure that we get off the tax ADIT issues, that's all going to be helpful in terms of our ability to finance. So it's still a work in progress. Yes, Shar, you are always ahead in terms of questions. Yeah, and I really can't answer any of those at this point because we are in a process and certainly as soon as we have information on it, I think the real issue here is, we have made a deliberate decision to really start our portfolio management approach and evaluating jurisdictions, because we are fully regulated. We can look at these areas and determine what the best fit is in terms of future capital needs and what our focus is in terms of moving to a clean energy economy. So - and for us to come out and say that we are in a strategic process relative to Kentucky is an important statement in that regard. That's probably as far as we can go right now. Well, certainly, like I said, this is at the beginning of this process, but multiple expansion is clearly on our minds and making sure that you can - you're investing in the right things at the right places at the right time is going to be incredibly important. And you saw that with North Central of timing the recovery with the actual investments with the turnkey approach that we took and it's all about the timing of it, it's all about the decisions made to ensure that we are doing proper capital allocation and rotation to manage this process forward. So - and like I said earlier, that's going to be a continuing part of our business. Good morning, Julien. Yeah. Yeah, so obviously, we're right out of the gate in terms of the announcement of what's included in each jurisdiction. So we'll have discussions with the commissions and that's part of the integrated resource planning processes and keep in mind too, when we do this evaluation during the RFP, I mean, during the process, as always solving for whatever the lease cost is in terms of what those resources are. So it shows up as win. And then solar, typically it's showing up as more wind early on and solar starts to pick up, but that's pretty fungible as you go forward. I mean, these plans will change as we go forward based upon where technologies go, certainly where the opportunities exist. Oklahoma may want more wind and less solar, but that won't matter, it'd be a part of the total renewables piece that's included there. The other part of it too is, we will be very mindful of how much renewables are placed into service in relation to 24/7 supply and there is some natural gas that's built into this plan as well that enables more renewables to be put in place, but the real focus going forward during this transitional period will be for units that provide 24/7 to be more of a reliability component, certainly more of a - sort of an insurance backstop for weather events or other events that may occur that impact the grid security and will have to be very, very mindful of how those studies actually go. And I'll tell you, in our climate report, we saw for 2050 with a $15 carbon price and then more aggressive $30 carbon price, the 2035 case didn't solve because of the timing of getting resources in place and system-related issues. So you have to really think about how that's done and we've looked at these plans and we certainly believe that was the level of 24/7 supply we still have out there and the additional opportunity associated with just the diversity of some of these projects. It's going to be of particular value to our customers going forward. And I guess, I'll just remind you that North Central, had it been operational during this time of the Texas and Oklahoma outages with the Uri would have saved customers $227 million. So you think about the savings associated with that and the other thing too, the previous question, someone was - Shar was asking, when the utilities do it, they focus on the long term and North Central already had the weather package is already in place where you don't find that in a large part of the market. So we think the long-term when we go about after these investments and that's why ownership is clearly important. Well, yeah, as I mentioned, 10,000 of the megawatts of the 16,000 - over 16,000 is in the '21 to '25 timeframe, so it's going to be near-term. So when you think about these projects, they take a couple of years to put in place. You'll be looking more at that '23 to '25 for most of it, but some of it was - is already in play. There is already RFPs going out for suppliers of some of these renewables as we speak. Julia, anything do you want to add to that? Thank you. Good morning, Stephen. Yeah, there will be and many of these projects, obviously, we'll have to look at the placement of these projects as in the level of congestion, but also the level of transmission investment that's required. But keep in mind too with the Biden administrations doing relative to the movement to clean energy, which obviously is a big part of his plan, large scale transmission will also be incredibly important. So, I see with what's going on today and in excess of all these things coming together, our transmission which you've always said is, as far as I can see for a decade, well, it's probably even higher. We don't know what that number is at this point and I think we've got to get through the process and fully understand that, but when you do the net benefits associated with fuel and the capital cost of the renewables projects and transmission, it's still a benefit to consumers. So, we'll go through that process, but you're right to be bullish about transmission in relation to these investments, but also everyone else's investments because we are the largest transmission provider in the country and most of this has to come through us. Well, certainly the ERCOT portion of Texas, we are essentially a large company there at T&D. So, and we have, based on our cost provisions in place for recovery of that, we - the only real exposure we've got from a standpoint is any, I guess some of the reps, they could potentially go bankrupt and - but that's where it's going to be important to understand where that goes and also as far as securitization is concerned, we view securitization in the past in Texas and you're seeing it develop for what's classified of storm caused, but it really is Uri-related investments we'd be fine with that. Julia, anything... Well, obviously the move we made on the second Rockport Unit solidified at least at 2028 and it could occur earlier depend on what the conditions are and what the evaluations are with the commission and the replacements of capacity. And so, we are - and actually, we're looking for provisions like that even in legislation that's occurring, because you're seeing all kinds of incentives developed for extension of PTCs, ITCs, direct pay we like, so direct pay not only for renewables projects, but also for transmission. If you have an ITC, but I think also, we'd like to see incentives for the undepreciated plant balances of coal units to further accelerate the ability to retire and obviate the impact to our customers. But the current plan does assume any of these advancements so - and this happens all the time where we have plans that are out there that are public, but lot of things get worked on and we'll continue to work on these objectives, because our objective is to move as quickly as possible to derisk these investments, particularly with new environmental rules with CCR and other things. We're making decisions about these plants and you've seen the last two quarters, we've announced earlier retirements of coal and lignite plant operation. So I would fully expect to see that process to continue. Yeah. Good morning, Steve. How are you doing? Yeah. Steve, so, I didn't say year-end. I said we would get the evaluation done in 2021, that could be earlier in the year, it could be later in the year. Obviously, we need to get farther down the road in terms of this process. I can tell you that the process is established, it's ongoing and we're going to move as quickly as possible. So - and we've always talked about the timing of the resolution of anything related to the weather was Kentucky or anything else in relation to the needs around North Central. So, and we still believe that timing fits. So, I wasn't saying that would be the end of the year before we know anything, I just said during '21. No, I think it was out of respect to our employees, because obviously, you can't say something like this from an SEC perspective without some thought around that, but also there is the human aspects of it too and employee aspects. Matter of fact, our employees just found out about it. When I've said it, I have a webcast after this with all employees to talk about this to just alleviate their concerns through the process, but this is the way that occurs, there is multiple things you have to think about when you're making these kinds of announcements. Yeah, I'll let Julia talk about that. We have the that we've access, but obviously it would change the nature of that. Yeah, and obviously different parties look at in different ways and that's what we're going to find out and through the strategic process is what evaluation Kentucky's ownership of Mitchell in terms of valuation and its impact on overall price would be. It still has value, it's still has years to operate and certainly, if you look at the plan that we presented, you still have a potential renewables opportunity there, particularly with the potential retirement of Mitchell at some point. So, anyone who is looking at this, I would say, it's not - in terms of just the valuation of Mitchell, it's a evaluation of what you do with it during the transition. So there's a lot of things to look at from that perspective. No, it's going to be an ongoing part of our process. So it's just the beginning. Yeah, okay. Good morning, Durgesh. Yeah, there it is open for right now. So, and obviously our comments will be very direct and very focused, and I'm sure there'll be others in the industry with that as well, but it just seems like a direct polar opposite to where the administration is trying to go with movement to a clean energy economy and really it is directly opposite to years of precedents of encouraging the development of transmission. So I'm certainly hopeful as we get through the dialog of what this all means and actually with RTO participation, when we originally joined the RTO years ago, we were making a lot of money off of through an outrates of transmission. We traded that in for generation benefits, because we were selling a lot of generation. We're not selling generation, so to any real extent and certainly when you look at the value proposition of an RTO, it is centered on the ability to optimize across a larger jurisdiction. But from an AEP perspective, you got the cost of the RTO and certainly, our customers need to be able to benefit from that. So if you disrupt that net cost benefit opportunity, you will have people making different decisions about RTO participation. So I think it's just sort of a policy move in the wrong direction, but certainly and hopeful that the commission comes together on that. I don't know that there is right now, they have to post the noper in the Federal Register first. So we're thinking probably a summer timeframe for the noper. Yeah. Good morning, Andrew. Yeah, we had in our queue, actually, the number for our evaluation that we lost the entire 50 basis points, it would amount to $55 million to $70 million pre-tax. So - and that's the evaluation now and who knows what they're going to do because you went in the meeting thinking they may actually go up on the RTO incentive, but they remains to be seen what they decide to do, but that's the impact. I think certainly with what transpired, we're just trying to make sure it stays the same, but if it increases, there's a lot of reasons for it to increase because RTO participation and the adders associated with transmission, like I said, the expenses of an RTO continue to go up and up. So I think there definitely needs to be an incentive there. We've always had the carbon value in our analysis from a resource planning perspective and I think it's $15 a ton is what we've used. In our reports, our Climate Report, we used two cases, a $15 case and a $30 case that was more aggressive and certainly that brought more - that case more renewables in more quickly, but that's not reflected in the plan that we've shown here. So, yes, it's certainly something that we're - we will continue to look at and evaluate with the commission. Yeah go ahead. Yeah, we're looking at this thing as a $15 billion to $20 billion investment opportunity. So, it would be not much of an impact if you took out the carbon pricing, but you can't plan for anything without putting in a carbon pricing these days. Yeah, and we've demonstrated that with North Central. I mean, you can put these projects in place and keep in mind, we're thinking about the resiliency and reliability of the grid too. So there's limitations and we have to go through that process, but the ones we have in this plan, we can do and certainly, when you look at the benefits of North Central, for example, it was $3 billion of benefit to the customers and so when you have those kinds of economics in play, if you're able to run your 24/7 generation has more of a reliability and as an insurance policy essentially and layer in as much renewables you can, put in transmission to make sure of the system continues to operate the way it should and then it could be pretty powerful combination to benefit customers in the future. Yeah. Good morning, Jeremy. Yeah, so obviously we were looking at future requirements instead of environmental requirements on the units and if we kept them operating longer than 2028, that would be a challenge from an economic perspective. We didn't want to start making those kinds of investments not knowing how long the units would actually be operational, so that was a consideration. The other, as I mentioned, was litigation to clear all that out to make sure we took ownership and we took control. And then, of course the value of the short-term bridge that exists that gives us the flexibility to make decisions with the Indiana Commission to focus on what is the right path for that transition. So it gives us a lot of optionality, a lot of flexibility and the control and by the way, I mean there's two units there. So one we own, one we leased and it just made more sense for us to own both of them and make the decision of the plant as a whole and be able to adjust accordingly. So, it worked out well overall from that perspective and like I say, it gives us a lot of optionality and flexibility and actually at a pretty - at a price that I think it was $115 million. So it's an opportunity for us to really pay for that degree of optionality that has considerable value. Yeah, sort of thing. Michael, you snuck in there. Yeah, so that's been a continual part of our business, just gets allocated capital, the AEP Energy gets allocated capital and he is perfectly willing to throw it back over the fence, because we make evaluations based upon his threshold which is commensurate with the regulated part and also just his business is important because it keeps us in a part of, like for example, we're doing a lot of projects here in Ohio directly with customers and it enables us to with customers and corporations actually and enables us to be in that business, but at the same time, we're able to manage the capital such that you can throw it back over the fence if we see a better opportunity on the regulated side. So we have that working very well where we can make those trade-offs on a continual basis. So yes, it could be a source of capital to do some of these things, and again that lends itself to the portfolio management approach to ensure that we're putting the money in the right place at the right time. So - and like I said, he is doing an incredible job with that and that organization and the fact is they are still doing the renewable part of it, but they're also doing specific relationships with customers with microgrids and those types of applications. So, the value proposition of that business is so important to us seeing the leading edge of what we need to be doing and making cases in our regulated business to ensure that we can continue to grow from those perspectives as well. So, all in all, it's working fine. But, yeah, the answer is yes, we can utilize that as a source. Okay."

            "content": "Thanks, Nick, and thanks, Darcy. It's good to be with everyone this morning. I'm going to walk us through the financial results for the quarter, share some thoughts on our service territory load and economy, and then finish with a review of our credit metrics and liquidity. So let's go to Slide 7, which shows the comparison of GAAP to operating earnings for the quarter. GAAP earnings were $1.16 per share compared to $1 per share in 2020. There is a reconciliation of GAAP to operating earnings on Page 15 of the presentation today. Let's walk through our quarterly operating earnings performance by segment, this is laid out on Slide 8. Operating earnings for the first quarter totaled $1.15 per share or $571 million compared to $1.02 per share or $504 million in 2020. Looking at the drivers by segment, operating earnings for the Vertically Integrated Utilities were $0.54 per share, up $0.04, driven by the favorable impact of weather due to warmer than normal winter temps in 2020. Other favorable items in this segment included Off-system sales, higher transmission revenue and the impact of rate changes across multiple jurisdictions, partially offsetting these favorable items were higher depreciation, lower normalized retail load, higher O&M, a prior period fuel adjustment and higher other taxes. The Transmission and Distribution Utilities segment earned $0.23 per share, down $0.01 from last year. Earnings in this segment declined primarily due to lower normalized retail load attributable in part to storm Uri. Other smaller decreases included higher depreciation, tax and O&M expenses. Favorable drivers in this segment included transmission revenue, rate changes and weather. The AEP Transmission Holdco segment continued to grow, contributing $0.35 per share, an improvement of $0.07 per share from last year. Net plant increased by $1.3 billion or 13% since March of last year. Generation and Marketing produced $0.06 per share, down $0.01 from last year. The favorable impact of the retirement of OCA Union and land sales on the generation business offset the unfavorable ERCOT market prices on the wholesale business during storm Uri in February. The decrease in the renewables business was driven by lower energy margins and higher expenses. Finally, Corporate and Other was up $0.04 per share, driven by an investment gain and lower interest expense, partially offsetting these items was the higher impact of - impact of higher taxes. Overall, we experienced a solid quarter and we're confident in reaffirming our annual operating earnings guidance. So let's take a look at our normalized load for the quarter on Page 9. Starting on the lower right corner, our first quarter normalized load came in 1.9% below the first quarter of 2020. There are two important factors to consider when evaluating the year-over-year comparison for the quarter. The first factor is that last year included an extra leap year day assuming everything else equal, you would expect about a 1% decline in sales due to one lesser day in the quarter, and the second factor is that the pandemic started during the last two weeks of the 2021st quarter. In other words, the first quarter analysis is comparing a pre-pandemic view of our service territory load to have you after COVID began. Importantly, we still expect a stronger recovery in the second half of this year as vaccinations increased positioning more communities to relax restrictions on businesses without jeopardizing public health and as a benefit of the American Rescue Plan stimulus, it was signed in late March, works its way through the economy. I'll talk a little bit more about the latest economic projections when we get to Slide 11. So let's take a look at the upper left quadrant, our normalized residential sales increased by 1.5% in the first quarter compared to last year. The growth in the residential sales was spread across most operating companies. As the pandemic recovery progresses, growth in residential sales as begun to moderate. While we expect residential sales to decline by 1.1% in 2021, we're assuming a moderate sustained load benefit from this customer class given the stickiness of work-from-home arrangements for many office workers across our service territory for the foreseeable future. So if you go over to the right, normalized commercial sales decreased by 1.6% in the first quarter. Even though commercial sales were down across every operating company excluding Ohio, we are seeing steady sequential improvement since the pandemic began. In fact, AEP Ohio was the first operating company to post positive commercial sales growth. This correlates well with the fact that the AEP Ohio territory added the most jobs in the first quarter. We also continue to see significant improvement in the same sectors that were hardest hit by the shutdowns in the second quarter of 2020. These sectors include schools, churches, restaurants and hotels. So finally, if you look in the lower left chart, you'll see that industrial sales decreased by 6.1% in the quarter compared to 2020. Industrial sales were down across every operating company and most industrial sectors. Not surprisingly, the biggest declines were located in the western territory where storm Uri in February caused a significant yet temporary - significant yet temporary disruptions to many manufacturing facilities located in ERCOT and SPP. In addition to the numerous electric generators unable to run due to frozen natural gas supply lines, there are a number of other manufacturing processes that rely on natural gas supply to produce their product. Many of those businesses were unable to produce for up to a week while the pipelines were being out and in some cases, industrial loads were stalled as long as 42 days in Texas. So the key takeaway here is that the dip in industrial sales in the first quarter was largely due to the one-time winter storm, which does not impact our fundamental outlook. So here's an interesting data point that illustrates this, our industrial sales in the eastern part of our service territory were down 2.6% as compared to the significant 12.8% drop in the western part of our service territory, which was impacted by Uri. So obviously, that's a pretty dramatic difference. That being said, we're still very bullish about the second half of the year as the US acquires a significantly greater concentration of immunity from vaccinations and as the full impact of the additional fiscal stimulus is felt throughout the service territory economy. So let's go over to Slide 10 where I can provide a little color on the industrial sales performance in the first quarter. The blue bars show the change in sales to our oil and gas customers. In aggregate, the sales to oil and gas sectors were down 9.6% in the first quarter, led by the 21% reduction in oil and gas extraction. Most of the decline in this sector is in response to the challenging market signals from last year when the drop in global demand along with the temporary price war caused oil prices to fall below many producers' breakeven point. However, we do not expect the weakness in oil and gas to persist. In fact, natural gas prices in March were up about 60% from last year and domestic oil prices last month have more than doubled since March of 2020. We fully expect the higher prices today will provide the necessary signal that producers are looking for to increase their production within the service territory. And once we see the production increase in the upstream sectors, it's only a matter of time before we see the corresponding increase in the midstream and downstream operations. The orange bars in the chart show the change in industrial sales, excluding oil and gas. While it was still down 3.3% for the quarter, we expect to see stronger improvement in the second half of the year as the global economy recovers from the pandemic. Some of the weakness in manufacturing right now is related to supply chain disruptions. As efforts continue to strengthen the resiliency of the domestic supply chain for manufacturing, the AEP service territory is certainly positioned to benefit from any movement in that direction. So let's go over to Slide number 11 where I can provide an update that I mentioned a few moments ago on the latest economic conditions within the AEP footprint. Starting in the lower left chart or on the left chart, you'll see that AEP service territory experienced a 1.6% increase in gross regional product compared to the first quarter of 2020. This was much better than the US, which had a relatively flat first quarter in terms of year-over-year GDP growth. The AEP service territory was less impacted by the virus and had fewer restrictions on businesses than other parts of the country, which has allowed the regional economy to fare better than the US throughout the pandemic. Looking forward, the AEP service territory is expected to grow by 5.2% in 2021, lagging the economic recovery in the US as you might expect. Moving to employment on the right, you can see that the job market for the AEP service territory has also outperformed the US throughout the pandemic. For the quarter, employment growth was only down 1.6%, which was 4 points or 4% better than the US during the first quarter. This is largely the result of the mix of jobs in our local economy, which has a heavier relative concentration of manufacturing and government jobs and a smaller share of leisure and hospitality jobs. Going forward, we expect job growth of 1.7% in 2021. So let's go over to Page 12 checking on the Company's capitalization and liquidity position. On a GAAP basis, our debt to capital ratio is 62.5%. When adjusted for the Storm Uri event, the ratio remains consistent with our year-end 2020 ratio at 61.8%. Let's talk about our FFO to debt metric because as you would expect and as we've been signaling, the impact of Storm Uri has and will have a temporary and noticeable impact in 2021 on this metric. Taking a look at the upper right quadrant on this page, you see our FFO to debt metric based on the traditional Moody's and GAAP calculated basis as well as on an adjusted Moody's and GAAP calculated basis. On a traditional unadjusted basis, our FFO to debt ratio decreased by 3.9% during the quarter to 9.1% on a Moody's basis. Well, this is a pretty dramatic impact. The rating agencies are very much aware of this and have taken the metric data point as well as the anticipated recovery into consideration as it relates to our credit rating. On an adjusted basis, the Moody's FFO to debt metric is 12.9%. To be very clear, this 12.9% figure removes or adjusts the calculation to eliminate the impact of approximately $1.2 billion of cash outflows associated with covering the unplanned Uri-driven fuel and purchase power in the SPP region directly impacting PSO and SWEPCO in particular. The metric is also adjusted to remove the effect of the associated debt we used to fund the unplanned payments. This should give you a sense of where we would be from a business as usual prospectus of 12.9% business as usual. As you know, we're in frequent contact with the rating agencies to keep them apprised of all aspects of our business and importantly, there is no change in our equity financing plan. On the topic of anticipated recovery, there is no debate that Storm Uri was an extreme event and consequently, the various states would like to resolve recovery docket as expeditiously as practical. Assuming recovery begins this year, our cash flow metrics will quickly return to the low to mid-teens target range next year as expected. So this should be a one year phenomenon for us. As many of you know, we have initiated regulatory cases in our respective states to evaluate the costs and determine the recovery plan. Let me provide a quick update where we are in this process. On February 24th, PSO filed with the Commission for recovery of fuel costs through a - with a regulatory asset and weighted average cost of capital carrying charge and subsequently filed a motion seeking recovery of a $615 million regulatory asset with a five-year amortization. At this point, PSO has received approval to defer the storm-related costs, with recovery of the established regulatory asset over five years at an interim rate of PSO's short-term financing cost of like 75 basis points. This is intended to be an interim order and the actual carrying charge will determined in a future review and the regulatory asset amount is subject to finalization. Importantly, Oklahoma has also taken up a securitization bill to address the extraordinary fuel and purchase power costs felt by all utilities, PSO will evaluate as the securitization is appropriate for the recovery. And if so, we would expect it to occur as early as next year. In March, the Arkansas Public Service Commission issued an order authorizing recovery of the approximate $113 million Arkansas jurisdictional share of the retail customer fuel cost over five years, with the carrying charges to be determined at a later date and the actual amount to be recovered being subject to finalization. We requested a WACC rate, which was supported by the staff in accordance with the order, SWEPCO began recovery in this jurisdiction in April, that was at a customer deposit rate of something like 80 basis points. The recovery period and associated carrying charge will be further reviewed in a hearing that's already been set for July 8th of this year, so 2021. In March, the Louisiana Public Service Commission approved a special order granting a temporary modification to the fuel adjustment clause to allow utilities to spread recovery over a longer period of time. In April, SWEPCO begin recovery of the Louisiana jurisdictional share of these fuel costs is about $150 million based on a five-year recovery period in a fuel over under recovery mechanism. SWEPCO will be working with the Louisiana Commission to finalize the actual recovery period and determine the appropriate carrying charge. And in Texas, SWEPCO intends to file for recovery under fuel surcharge, most likely in the second quarter. Our current plan is to request recovery over five years with a WACC carrying charge. Obviously, we have a lot in process on the regulatory recovery front on this matter and we'll keep you apprised as we make progress, because as we all know this is extremely important. Let's take a quick moment to visit our liquidity summary on the lower right of Slide 12. In March - on March 31st, AEP renewed its $4 billion bank revolver for five years and also entered into a two-year $1 billion revolving credit facility to fortify our liquidity position as we go forward, just placed our net liquidity position as of March 31st at a strong $3.4 billion. Switching gears, our qualified pension funding increased 1.7% during the quarter to 103.5% and our OPEB funding increased 9.6% to 170.5%. Rising interest rates that decreased plan liabilities along with positive equity returns were the primary drivers for the funded status increases in both plans during the first quarter. So let's go to Slide 13, so we can wrap this thing up and get your questions, but I just want to call out a couple of quick things before we do that. So on top of mind for many folks I know this, we want to mention to you that we completed the planned $125 million equity funding portion of the North Central Wind Sundance project. We used our at the market mechanism, so that we could time the equity need with our purchase of the Sundance project, which occurred last week. As you know, we will continue to move forward with additional opportunities in the renewable space supporting our ESG focus as we transition toward a clean energy future. Our performance in the first quarter and stability of our regulated business model gives us the confidence to reaffirm our operating earnings guidance range of $4.55 per share to $4.75 per share. Because of our ability to continue to invest in our own system organically, we are confident in our ability to grow the Company at our stated long-term growth rate of 5% to 7%. So we surely do appreciate your time and attention today. And with that, I'm going to turn the call over to the operator for your questions. Good morning. No, you've got that perfect, thank you. No, that would be great. Great question, Stephen. So, we're keeping an eye on what's going on in Oklahoma. There is an opportunity potentially to engage in some securitization activity there, would love to get cash in the door. So if that's something that's workable, we will absolutely take the cash and my understanding is, the way that is being at least they initially discussed it and potentially structured would be such - in such a way that that does not sit on our balance sheet, which makes it even better. So, yes, we'll take that cash and with no doubt on the balance sheet, we like that very much. So, we are definitely poised and ready and waiting. Steve, yeah, thank you for the question. Absolutely, to the extent that we get dollars in the door, that will be a wonderful place to put that to work in terms of being able to sidestep some of the equity need and we'll see if we can make that happen, absolutely. Yeah... Yeah, absolutely. You have it exactly right. We're deferring those storm costs, particularly as it relates to the fuel and purchase power costs, because that's the biggest chunk of the dollars that we had exposure to as it relates to storm in Uri in particular. And as it relates to what's embedded in our guidance, I would tell you, we actually updated our cash flow forecast. That's included in the slide deck that you have today to incorporate the impact of this particular circumstance as well as the fact that we did have some ice storms and more I'd characterize more kind of normal storm-related activities that occurred in the eastern portion of our jurisdictions here during the first quarter. So all of that is factored into those new cash flow forecast details, which you'll see impacting the cash flow from operations line in the slide included in the deck today. As you know, we did take on some additional debt to be able to accommodate the fuel and purchase power spike that was not anticipated and so that is now being absorbed into our 2021 operations and therefore into our earnings. Interestingly, if you look at Page number 8 of the slide deck that we have out there today, on the Corporate and Other segment, you'll actually see that interest expense was a benefit to us this time despite the fact that we have taken on a little additional debt in that capacity, because we took a $500 million term loan on at the parent company interest rates - in terms of interest cost I should say, was much lower in this particular quarter versus last year. We do have - still have lower debt outstanding from a short-term perspective versus last year. So all of those factors, interestingly, helped to have this impact to be one of benefit to us in this particular period. So, steady as she goes, no change in forecast, still feeling really good about where we are. Hopefully that helps you a little bit. You've got it. We did that by design because we wanted to make sure we had a fair amount of integrity in that forecast with - particularly when you look at the cash flow metrics and give a shout out to our fixed income friends because I know that's extremely important. If I could... Just to throw additional finer point on that as well, if carbon pricing is excluded from the equation, the renewable opportunity could get a haircut buy about 2 gigawatts. So it's not that significant, but want to throw that out there."

Please go ahead.\nDarcy Reese: Thank you, Brad. Good morning everyone and welcome to the Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Call for American Electric Power. We appreciate you taking time today to join us. Our earnings release presentation slides and related financial information are available on our website at aep.com Today we will be making forward looking statements during the call. There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements. Please refer to our SEC filings for discuss of these factors. Joining me this morning for opening remarks are Julie Sloat, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Anne Kelly, our Chief Financial Officer. We will take your questions following their remarks. I will now turn the call over to Julie.\nJulia Sloat: Thanks, Darcy. Welcome, everyone, to American Electric Power's Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. I'm happy to be here with all of you this morning, and I'm pleased to be joined by our recently appointed CFO, Ann Kelly, who joined our team in late November. So here we go.  We're making great progress and have a lot to share with you today, starting with the financial performance of our fourth quarter and year. I'll provide update on our Kentucky operations sale, unregulated renewable sale and retail business strategic review. I'll also provide insight into the regulatory and legislative front, as we work to implement important new initiatives to ensure our customers and communities needs, which are met in turn, and drives our high-quality investment proposition.  Finally, I'll include an update -- or I'll conclude with an update on our generation fleet transformation as we continue to invest in regulated renewables and our energy delivery infrastructure, a summary of 2022 highlights and our focus for 2023 can be found on Slides 6 and 7 of today's presentation. As you know, we have a long history of consistently delivering and exceeding our earnings guidance and 2022 is no exception.  I'm very proud of the dedication and accomplishments of the entire AEP team over the past year. While we finished the year strong, I can promise you, we're just getting started. Our robust financial plan continues to yield results. We delivered strong fourth quarter 2022 operating earnings of $1.05 per share bringing our full year 2022 operating earnings to $5.09 per share. We're also -- we also increased our quarterly dividend from $0.78 to $0.83 per share, which we announced back in October. AEP's teamwork-driven performance in 2022 has established a strong foundation from which we can reaffirm our 2023 full year operating earnings guidance range of $5.19 to $5.39, all while mitigating inflationary cost pressures, supply chain pressures and higher interest rates as well as constructively navigating regulatory and legislative frameworks. Formula rates in several of our state jurisdictions and in our high-growth transmission business help us to manage increased interest expense and higher costs.  Importantly, as we keep customer affordability top of mind, we are actively working with our states on the economic development front to drive expansion in our service territory, and we are incorporating efficiencies and expense containment into our rate recovery filings to continue to help offset the impact of increased cost pressures. As a matter of fact, the economic development efforts over the past several years are proving to be appreciably beneficial, and we'll talk about normalized load in a few minutes. But to illustrate my point, I can tell you that normalized industrial sales were up 4.5%, largely as a result of those efforts, not to mention the added benefit of attracting jobs, residents and other cascading upside to our communities, all of which helps to manage customer rates given the bigger denominator.  We value our stakeholder relationships, and we made steady progress on the regulatory front over the past year, including achieving constructive base rate outcomes in Arkansas and SWEPCO Texas and a favorable Supreme Court appeal related to Virginia's last rate case and the securitization of Winter Storm Uri costs in Oklahoma. Our resulting earned regulated ROE as of December 31 was 9.1%, which suggests we still have work to do on this front, and I'll talk about our regulatory activity that we have underway to address this. So hang with me for a few minutes, and I'll get there. AEP is leading the transition to a clean energy economy as we engage in one of the largest generation fleet transformations in our industry, in 2022, our 1.5 gigawatt North Central wind portfolio became fully operational with the completion of the Traverse wind farm project, which marked the beginning of our clean energy fleet transition. We'll continue to execute on our fleet transformation strategy with the opportunity to add approximately 17 gigawatts of new generation resources between 2023 and 2032, while mitigating fuel cost volatility and creating a more diverse resource portfolio to benefit our customers. This will significantly contribute to AEP's reduced carbon emissions profile and put us on a path to achieve our upgraded net zero goal by 2045.  Importantly, the recent passage of the Inflation Reduction Act provides support for our clean energy goals, and this will extend our investment runway as we continue to address the needs of our generation fleet. Since assuming the role of President and now CEO, I prioritize simplifying and derisking our business profile, which has become a core standard by which we evaluate our business activity. By actively managing our portfolio and demonstrating a clear commitment to the successful execution of initiatives and transactions, we continue to deliver significant benefits to our stakeholders.  As you are very much aware, we are working diligently to complete the sale of our Kentucky operations to Liberty. You can find the related regulatory time line on Slide 8 in the presentation today. As an update, AEP and Liberty followed the blueprint provided by the FERC order and filed a new FERC 203 application on February 14 of this year, requesting a shortened comment period and expedited approval to meet the contractual April 26, 2023 transaction close date. Immediately after the filing was made, FERC issued a notice incorporating a shortened 45-day comment deadline related to the application. The shortened comment period is a good sign signaling the commission is open to considering our application on an accelerated basis. AEP and Algonquin are in regular communication discussing various aspects of the transaction, the path forward and our partnership. We're mindful of the April 26 date in the stock purchase agreement and are cognizant of the tight time frame given the March 31 comment period deadline.  The objective of both AEP and Algonquin remains clear, and that's to close the transaction. And both parties are firmly committed to moving forward and bringing forth the benefits of this transaction to customers. Related to our unregulated contract renewables portfolio, after strong buyer interest, we're pleased with our announcement made yesterday for the sale of our 1,365 megawatt portfolio to IRG Acquisition Holdings, which is a partnership owned by Invenergy, CDPQ and funds managed by Blackstone infrastructure. A summary of the sale can be seen on Slide 9 of the presentation today.  We're currently targeting a second quarter 2023 close. The utilization of the proceeds from the sale is now reflected in our updated multiyear financing plan on Slide 39, and the transaction proceeds will be directed to support our regulated businesses as we enhance the energy delivery infrastructure and transform our generation fleet. Our near-term focus remains closing on our 2 pending sale transactions Kentucky and our unregulated renewables. Once both of these transactions are complete, we plan to revisit the equity needs in our current multiyear financing plan. As we've been clear in the past we will use the asset sales to responsibly eliminate equity while maintaining a strong balance sheet, no change in messaging on this.  And that's important that I reiterate that. No change in the messaging. Finally, in October 2022, we announced the strategic review of our retail business. We're looking at this business to determine how or if it fits with the current AP portfolio and we'll keep you updated on our progress. We're expecting to complete the strategic review in the first half of 2023.  Let me touch on our regulatory and legislative initiatives that we have underway. We remain focused on reducing our authorized versus actual ROE gap. As I mentioned earlier, our 2022 earned regulated was ?ROE 9.1% and -- our 2023 earnings guidance range assumes a 9.4% earned ROE, and we are already making progress in that direction. In January, we reached the settlement and gain commission approval for our Louisiana base case, which allows us to reestablish a formula rate plan -- as we advance through the year, the team will be active in completing our current base case in Oklahoma and rider recovery of the 88 megawatts of the Turk plant, which is not currently in Arkansas rates. We also filed an electric security plan in Ohio, which will take us into 2024.  Let me shift gears and provide you with an update on our deferred fuel recovery efforts that are currently underway. As we've previously shared with you over the past several months, we have made adjustments to our traditional cost recovery methods in a number of our states to allow for recovery while spreading the cost out for our customers to make them more affordable.  In West Virginia, we continue to pursue approval of the pass-through of fuel costs under the fuel clause. We also intend to propose an alternative path to recovery of these costs under proposed legislation, if Approved, that would allow us to securitize these costs and minimize customer impact. The West Virginia Commission recently instructed its staff to finish its prudence review of the 2021 and 2022 fuel costs. The state legislature continues to move the securitization legislation forward with the Commission Chair recently testifying in support before the lawmakers.  I'll conclude my remarks with an update on our regulated renewables strategy and execution. Our capacity needs continue to drive us forward on the regulated renewables front, and we continue to work with our regulators, policymakers and other key stakeholders to ensure a durable and sustainable transmission -- transition to a clean energy economy in our vertically integrated state.  The recently enacted Inflation Reduction Act will help us advance our goals in this area and will provide additional value to our customers as we seek to acquire resources consistent with our plan. We've made considerable progress on SWEPCO's 999-megawatt renewables application, which represents a $2.2 billion investment for AEP. Parties filed a unanimous settlement in Arkansas on January 27 and for a portfolio of owned wind and solar resources. A hearing was held in Texas in January, and we continue to have constructive settlement dialogue with parties in Louisiana, and the hearing date has been formally extended to March 21 to accommodate this. We look forward to receiving the commission's orders, which are expected in the second quarter of 2023 on Louisiana and the third quarter of 2023 for Texas.  In November of 2022, PSO made a regulatory filing in Oklahoma to own 995.5 megawatts of solar and wind projects representing a $2.5 billion investment. A procedural schedule was issued last month which includes a hearing date in April and an expected commission order in the third quarter of this year. Separately, we're also seeking to acquire the 154-megawatt [indiscernible] wind facility in Oklahoma from EDF. FERC approved this acquisition on February 16, and we're pursuing rate recovery of this investment through the ongoing PSO base rate case.  The project is already in service and will provide immediate capacity for PSO's customers. Our regulated renewables goals are aligned and supported by our integrated resources plans. In accordance with those plans, we issued request for proposal in 2022 for wind, solar and other resources at APCo, INM and once again at SWEPCO. We anticipate making the related regulatory funds to acquire additional resources under these RFPs throughout 2023.  We continue to see rapid changes in our industry and increasing need and demand from customers and communities across the United States. At the end of 2022, as I prepared to assume my new position at AEP, the team and I dedicated a considerable amount of time and energy to determining how AEP would continue to deliver safe, clean, affordable and reliable energy and how we could deliver this energy faster and more efficiently to our customers while generating enhanced value to our stakeholders. Our long-term earnings growth rate of 6% to 7% is underpinned by a robust $40 billion capital investment plan for 2023 through 2027, which includes $15 billion in transmission and $9 billion in regulated renewables investments.  As evidenced by our fourth quarter and full year 2022 performance AEP has had a long-standing track record of consistently delivering on our strategic objectives, our transformation strategy is working and the investments we're making continue to support our positive earnings growth and results. Now please join me in welcoming Ann to her first AEP earnings call. I'll leave you in her very capable hands as she provides insight and perspective into our performance drivers for 2022 and the details supporting our financial targets. Ann?\nAnn Kelly: Thank you, Julia and Darcy. It's great to be with you all this morning and thanks for dialing in. I'll walk us through our fourth quarter and full year results, share some updates on our service territory load and our outlook for 2023 and finish with commentary on credit metrics and liquidity as well as some thoughts on our guidance, financial targets and portfolio management.  So let's go to Slide 10, which shows the comparison of GAAP to operating earnings for the quarter and year-to-date periods. As Julie mentioned, we had a strong operating results in both the fourth quarter and for the full year. GAAP earnings for the fourth quarter were $0.75 per share compared to $1.07 per share in 2021. GAAP earnings for the year were $4.51 per share compared to $4.97 per share in 2021. For the quarter, I'll mention that we have reflected additional charges related to the expected sale of Kentucky Power and Kentucky Transco as nonoperating costs. This is largely a result of the delay in the closing from the need to file a new 203 application with the FERC. There are detailed reconciliations of GAAP to operating earnings on Pages 18 and 19 of the presentation today. Today, I'm going to focus more on our full year results, but I did want to provide a few highlights on the fourth quarter as we show on Slide 11. Operating earnings for the fourth quarter totaled $1.05 per share compared to $0.98 per share in 2021.  This is a $0.07 or 7% increase year-over-year. While we had a lot of puts and takes, our vertically integrated and T&D utility segments continued to perform well, resulting from rate changes, transmission revenue and some favorable weather. We did see a $0.03 decline in our normalized retail margin, but that was due to a change in sales mix as low as favorable for the quarter.  I'll discuss load in more detail in a couple of minutes. We were also able to support an increase in our O&M expenses as a result of the strong earnings that we were seeing. Transmission Holdco was favorable by $0.03, even after factoring in the loss the Ohio RTO adder as we continue to see the benefits of our investments. Generation and Marketing produced $0.16 per share, up $0.10 from last year, driven by increased retail energy margins and favorable generation performance, primarily driven by fewer average days year-over-year.  And finally, Corporate and Other was down $0.05 per share driven by increased interest expense and investment losses, partially offset by favorable income taxes. Now let's have a look at our year-to-date results on Slide 12. Operating earnings for 2022 totaled $1.09 per share compared to $4.74 per share in 2021. This was an increase of $0.35 per share or 7%. Looking at the drivers by segment. Operating earnings for vertically integrated utilities were $2.56 per share, up $0.30. Due to rate changes across various operating companies, favorable weather, increased transmission revenue and also increase normalized load. Offsetting these favorable variances were higher O&M, increased depreciation expense and increased interest expense.  Once again, the change in accounting around the Rockport Unit 2 lease results in $0.23 of favorable O&M offset by $0.23 of unfavorable depreciation. In the Transmission & Distribution Utilities segment, earned $1.16 per share, up $0.06 from last year. Favorable drivers in this segment included rate changes in Texas and Ohio, favorable weather and increased normalized retail load and transmission revenue. Offsetting these favorable items were unfavorable O&M and depreciation. With the favorable weather and other items that we experienced in 2022, we were able to responsibly deploy additional O&M in both utility segments to spend on items like increased vegetation management to improve system reliability.  The AEP Transmission Holdco segment contributed $1.32 per share, down $0.03 from last year. Favorable investment growth of $0.12 was more than offset by an unaffared true-up of $0.04, the loss of the RTO adder in Ohio and increased income taxes. Remember, our 2022 guidance had this segment down by $0.08 year-over-year as a result of the investment growth being more than offset by the annual true-up to some unfavorable comparisons for taxes and interest. Generation and Marketing produced $0.50 per share, up $0.24 from last year. The positive variance here is primarily due to the sale of renewable development sites, improved generation performance in land sales in the generation business, improved retail margins and increased wholesale margins stemming from favorable market conditions.  And finally, Corporate and Other was down $0.22 per share, driven by investment losses unfavorable interest in increased O&M, partly offset by lower income taxes. The investment losses continue to be impacted by the year-over-year comparisons for our ChargePoint investment that we exited in the third quarter. As we mentioned earlier, we are reaffirming our guidance range for 2023. For convenience, we've included an updated waterfall on our actual 2022 results to the midpoint of our guidance for 2023 on Slide 36. While the variances changed due to the 2022 actual results, there is no change to our 2023 segment or overall guidance. We are confident that our regulatory actions to provide timely returns on our distribution and renewable investments, continued investment in transmission assets, the impact of economic development efforts and prudent O&M management will offset headwinds such as rising interest rates and inflationary pressures.  Now turning to Slide 13, I'll provide an update on our normalized load performance. Overall, 2022 was a remarkable year for normalized load growth across the AEP service territory. Despite the Federal Reserve's intentional actions to slow down the economy, AEP experienced its strongest weather-normalized load growth in over 15 years with 2.8% annual growth. The most impressive part is that this is experience on top of a recovery year. As a reminder, 2021 was the strongest year for AEP's normalized growth in over a decade until 2022. The growth in 2022 was spread across nearly every operating company in every major retail class. Starting in the lower right corner of the slide, normalized retail sales increased by 1.9% in the fourth quarter and ended the year up 2.8% compared to last year. For the quarter, the growth in commercial and industrial sales will more than offset the modest decline in residential sales.  Looking forward, you will see that we are expecting growth of 7% to 10% in 2023. The story is changing somewhat to further remove away from the pandemic. In 2022, the boost from fiscal policy overwhelmed the Federal Reserve's efforts to constrain the economy through monetary policy. In 2023, we expect the fiscal boost to date given the congressional changes after the election, while the Fed's efforts to tame inflation remain in place. We expect this to result in a slight moderation of economic growth for the balance of this year.  Moving to the upper left corner, Normalized residential sales decreased by 0.8% in the fourth quarter but finished the year slightly above 2021. For the quarter, residential customer counts increased by 0.4%, but this was offset by a 1.2% decline in weather normalized usage.  This is not surprising when you consider the impact that higher inflation, energy costs and interest rates on customers' disposable income to end the year. You will notice that we now expect residential sales to decrease by 0.5% in 2023 for the same reason. Moving right, weather-normalized commercial increased by 5.4% for the quarter and ended the year up 4.2% compared to 2021. The growth in commercial sales was spread across nearly every operating company. fastest-growing commercial sectors, professional scientific and tech services that includes data centers, which -- where load was up nearly 30% compared to last year for both the quarter and the year-to-date comparisons.  The outlook for 2023 is showing a modest 0.6% growth. While we do see momentum in this class driven by economic development, the sustained impact of the labor shortage inflation high interest rates and energy costs will act as a headwind in 2023. Finally, focusing on the lower left corner, you see the industrial sales growth moderated in the fourth quarter, up 1.5% and while the year ended 4.5% above 2021. Industrial sales increased at most operating companies in many of our largest sectors.  We continue to experience robust growth in the oil and gas sectors, which were up 6% compared to the fourth quarter of 2021. Outside of oil and gas, which tends to run countercyclical to the rest of the economy, we did notice softer industrial sales growth consistent with many of the economic indicators. As you know, the ISM manufacturing index fell below 50 in the fourth quarter, which is a sign of an industrial contraction. The combination of sustained inflation, supply chain disruptions, increasing borrowing costs, strong dollar and elevated energy costs have formed significant challenges for domestic manufacturing. Fortunately, AEP's past economic development activities are providing an offset and are keeping AEP's industrial sales growth in positive territory. You see that the outlook is showing industrial sales growth of 2.1% in 2023, which is largely attributable to the consistent economic development activities from the past. I'll provide additional detail on the impact of these efforts in the next slide.  To summarize, the AP service territory experienced a remarkable year for load growth in 2022 despite the inflationary pressures on wages and energy and a federal reserve that was intentionally trying to slow down the economy. We are finally seeing evidence that these measures are starting to have an impact, which will result in slower growth in 2023. Fortunately, AEP's disciplined commitment to economic development should keep our load growth in the black moving forward.  For example, absent economic development, our loan growth would have been essentially flat in the fourth quarter and up 1.1% for the year.  Turning to Slide 14, I want to highlight how our commitment to economic development is helping to sustain load growth even in the face of challenging economic conditions. The chart on this slide illustrates why the strategy is so important to us. The blue bars on this chart show the growth of gross regional product for the AEP service territory over the past year. You can see that it has been slowing over the period. And in fact, for the fourth quarter, growth in AEP's GRP was slightly negative compared to the fourth quarter of 2021. However, the green bars here show our industrial sales growth over the same period. You'll notice they have been resilient throughout 2022 without any help from GRP. A lot of the growth in industrial load that we are seeing today is a consequence of economic development projects from previous years. And our focus on economic development is not just about the additional load that we report to you on a quarterly basis. We are also focused on attracting employers to the service territory. We know that adding new loading customers are a key strategy to providing value to all customers. This allows us to continue to prioritize investments that will improve the customer experience while mitigating the rate impacts on our customer base.  By making this a key component of our strategy, AEP is helping to mitigate the impact of the economic downturn on our customers, communities and shareholders. And AEP's economic development team has a proven track record of helping to bring these new customers to our service territory with an emphasis on jobs and load. In fact, the AEP service territories added over 141,000 jobs in 2022.  Let's move on to Slide 15 to discuss the company's capitalization and liquidity position. Taking a look at the upper left quadrant on this page, you see our FFO-to-debt metric stands at 13.2%, which is a decrease of 1.3% from the prior quarter. The primary reason for this decrease is the impact on both FFO and short-term debt from a decrease in our mark-to-market collateral positions associated with the decline in natural gas and power prices. as well as a continued increase in our deferred fuel balances.  We remain committed to our targeted FFO-to-debt range of 14% to 15%, and we plan to trend back into that range near the end of 2023 as we continue to work through the regulatory recovery process of our deferred fuel balances, which can drive some volatility in the metrics. You can see our liquidity summary on the lower left quadrant side. Our 5-year $4 billion bank revolver and 2-year $1 billion revolving credit facility support our liquidity position, which remains strong at $2.6 billion. The $1.1 billion change from last quarter is mainly due to an increase in commercial paper outstanding for the reasons I mentioned earlier.  On a GAAP basis, our debt-to-capital ratio increased from the prior quarter by 1.5% to 62.9%. On the qualified pension front, our funding status remained strong, ending the quarter at 102.4%. While assets performed as expected during the quarter, the primary driver for the funded status decreased was due to an increase in the liability caused by changes in actuarial assumptions influenced by the rising interest rate environment in 2022.  Now turning to Slide 16. I'll give a quick recap of today's message. First, we are focused on execution. The Kentucky transaction is back in front of the FERC and Liberty and AEP are committed to moving forward with this transaction. We just announced the agreement to sell our unregulated contract renewables portfolio and are working through the strategic review of the retail business. Each of these actions will help us to simplify and derisk our business. Even as we worked on these initiatives, we didn't take our eye off the ball of managing the business. We finished 2022 with solid earnings and made significant investments to support our customers even with the backdrop of supply chain challenges and inflationary pressures.  We continue to be committed to our long-term growth rate of 6% to 7% and continued dividend growth and a strong balance sheet while derisking the company, focusing on the customer and actively managing the portfolio. We really appreciate your time and attention today. I'm going to ask Brad to open up the call so that we can answer any questions that you may have.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. And we'll first go to Shahriar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners.\nShahriar Pourreza: So a couple of quick ones here. Looking at just the West Virginia fuel cost recovery, hearings were obviously held in 4Q, and there was a discussion about moving to quarterly time periods as well as securitization. I guess, can you give us maybe an update on how you're looking at the situation where we might be headed from here? There's a lot of moving pieces I guess. So how is the dialogue going? And sort of any sense of bill impact ranges, especially with the recent gas price collapse?\nJulia Sloat: Yes. I still appreciate the question because shares, I'm sure you can imagine, it is absolutely top of mind for us. And as Ann mentioned in her comments, top of mind from a CFO perspective, most definitely. As you know, we did get an order.  The staff is going through its paces as we had to work through the prudency review. And in the background, what's playing is a legislation that could potentially accommodate securitization of the dollars we have outstanding, our fuel balance in West Virginia $520 million -- so it's not insignificant and it's extremely important to be able to digest this in a way that can accommodate customer rates. So we're hoping that we'll be able to be in a position we'll be able to utilize the securitization legislation, if approved, to be able to smooth this out and take care of customer needs in terms of the bill in path. And I don't know, Ann, do you have any other thoughts on that, how we might do that?\nAnn Kelly: Yes. No, it's absolutely right. I mean utilizing the securitization allows us to spread it out over time and minimize and actually keep our customer rates relatively flat, which is really the intention. Now this will take some time. It will be effective in June, and we need to commission the order. So we would expect the securitization to take place in the first half of 2024.\nShahriar Pourreza: Got it. Okay. Perfect. And then just lastly, on the financing needs. Obviously, we've noticed that you now include both the $1.2 billion expected cash proceeds from Kentucky as well as I think for the first time, the expected $1.2 billion from the contracted renewable sale. I guess looking at the sources and uses, why wait to update your funding needs on the equity side, especially if you're including the proceeds already. Is there anything we should be thinking about here?\nJulia Sloat: No hidden message there at all, Shahriar. We want to make sure that we get both of these transactions in the bag, get them taken care of and then we'll recalibrate. And as you know, our objective is twofold. We want to make sure we have a strong balance sheet because we don't want anybody worried about any dilutive otherwise actions that we would have to take. So that's first and foremost. So top of mind for us is making sure that balance sheet is in check.  And as you know, we put out a target goal for FFO to debt of 14% to 15%. That being said, to the extent that we will then be able to eliminate future equity needs, we don't have a significant amount of equity financing when you look out over the horizon. But if we're able to kind of pull that back a little bit and still hit the objective on the strong balance sheet, we'll absolutely do that. So no hidden message. Obviously, both of these are moving along, contractor renewables new for us. We know that, that will close in the second quarter. We believe that's the plan to close in the second quarter. And as you know, Kentucky is pending with its 203 application. So stay tuned. We just want to make sure that we got this completely right for you all and that you're not concerned.\nOperator: And next, we'll go to Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. .\nJeremy Tonet: I just want to pivot towards the retail business a little bit. And if you could just peel back, I guess, a little bit how that process stands at this point. Just wondering, any thoughts that are be considered here of why that would remain in the portfolio, what might prevent you from selling it? I'm just wondering if you might be able to provide a little bit more color of what's in that business, EBITDA earnings or anything else to wrap our heads around there?\nJulia Sloat: Yes, absolutely. And I love the question because that's exactly what we're doing in our house right now is going through the paces to determine exactly does it fit -- if there's anything that does fit, what does that look like? Stay tuned. That will be a first half story for AEP. So expect us to be coming to you probably in the second quarter with a little more granular detail because we're literally going through that analysis now and working with the troops to make sure we have that finally, too, so we can get back out to you.  As far as quantifying how big is this business and what does it mean currently to AEP, the net asset position or, I guess, equity position, if you strip out the liabilities, we're talking about $193 million -- the vast majority of that is working capital to the tune of about $150 million of the $193 million, and the rest is largely IT software, and then we have a little smidge of goodwill in there of about $1 million to give you some parameters.  And then another thing that I would think about is what does that mean from an EPS perspective, in 2022, this retail business contributed $0.05 of EPS. And in 2023, we have $0.04 embedded in our guidance to give you that goalpost to. Hopefully, that helps.\nJeremy Tonet: That's very helpful. And just going back to the renewables sale here. Was there an EBITDA number that you might be able to share with us or have shared on that?\nJulia Sloat: We haven't disclosed an EBITDA number. I can tell you that in our guidance for 2023, we're looking at $0.01 that renewable business contributed, I think it was $0.08. Does that sound right, Ann? $0.08, yes?\nAnn Kelly: $0.08, yes.\nJulia Sloat: $0.08 in 2022 to give you those parameters.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. That's helpful. And just one last one, if I could. Touching on what Shahriar was talking about with the fuel business what have you. And I guess if moving pieces here, getting back to what the agencies are looking at, how should we think about the cadence of fuel balance normalizing any other items as we get to the 14% to 15% FFO debt target range by year-end '23, I think?\nJulia Sloat: That's right. We expect to get our -- up to the -- get the ball between the uprates in the last part of the year. We do expect to have a little bit of pressure on the front end as we continue to work through some of the fuel balances. As I mentioned, when you look at West Virginia stand-alone, it's about $520 million. Does that sound right, Ann?\nAnn Kelly: Yes, $520 million. And as I mentioned, the securitization of that will take some time. So likely won't be done by the end of this year. But -- in terms of our other fuel balances in other jurisdictions, we have positive mechanisms to recover that. And also natural gas rates and power prices are declining, so that will help somewhat as well.\nOperator: And next, we'll go to Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research.\nSteven Fleishman: Yes. So just kind of similar -- similar question on the deferred fuel. If you just looked at the year-end number on FFO to debt, how much do you think deferred fuel represents in terms of impact that's lowering that number? Looking at FFO to debt?\nJulia Sloat: So we're at 13.2% as of year-end. And so if we get above that 14%-ish range by year-end 2023, I don't know that looks about -- I don't say entirely 100 basis points, but it's pretty significant.\nAnn Kelly: Yes. I think it actually might be a little bit less than 100 basis when you think about it because we have $1.7 billion of deferred fuel at the end of the year.\nSteven Fleishman: Okay. That's very helpful. And then just on the ROE improvement to the 9.4 in this year's guidance. Is it -- is there any states that are really driving a lot of that? Are there any states that they're still kind of the most room to go after '23?\nJulia Sloat: Yes. So here's where I'll draw your attention to. And I know we have the little equalizer chart here in the slide deck somewhere. I think it's on Page 41. And so you can get a sense of kind of where we are hanging out on each of the respective operating company entities. But what we do have in play right now is that at PSO, so Oklahoma, we have a base case underway. So that should help us to begin to heal the ROE, the earned ROE at PSO. So stay tuned for that. So base case in play there. And then as I mentioned in my opening remarks, we recently were able to finalize our Louisiana base case and then reactivate this formula rate plan. So that will get underway to, again, to help move SWEPCO's ROE back up closer to its authorized levels. Kentucky, obviously, you know what we're doing with Kentucky. And APCo, I think APCo, that's why the legislation in Virginia becomes so important to us. because we're in an under-earning position right now. We got the outcome of the Virginia triennial case, which should be beneficial to us in 2023, but I would still expect APCo's ROE to be under pressure until we get, hopefully, some resolution around Virginia legislation that to the extent that we're able to modify the regulatory recovery methods that are being employed in that particular state, we'll begin to see some healing on that particular ROE, too. So our triennial versus say a biennial, AEP is going to lead more toward a biennial or an annual type look versus necessarily that triennial because unfortunately kind of tracks us in an under-earning position, so stay tuned. We'll see how the Virginia legislation process moved along. Our team is absolutely at the table with all the other stakeholders. So that sounds constructive. So we're hopeful and we'll see this developing situation through and then we would expect something to be in the improvement territory for APCo.\nSteven Fleishman: Just for clarity on that last point in Virginia, why does -- what are things that would help you in the Virginia law, it go into the biannual so you don't have to go so far between cases or something else?\nJulia Sloat: Anything shorter, Steve, is going to be better for us -- so that will move us in a more productive situation or direction for APCo in particular. I mean an annual rate trout would be fine, too. But again, you can see the direction. So that will be important for us as we work through the different solutions that are being contemplated now because I know we have, I think, 3 bills that are being evaluated or at least shopped in Virginia. But as I mentioned, AEP is absolutely at the table, and we'll see how this ultimately shakes out. Obviously, the benefit needs to go to the customers, but then also our investors as we work to improve the ROE.\nOperator: Next, we can go to Nick Campanella with Credit Suisse.\nNicholas Campanella: I guess just very clear from the filings that have been made so far on the Kentucky transaction that the parties are committed here and you're working towards closing and what is somewhat of a tight deadline. Can you just kind of give us a sense how that changes, if your funding strategy changes at all if this deal weren't to go through and how that would overall kind of change your strategy if it went there.\nJulia Sloat: Yes. Nick, I still appreciate the question, and I'll let Ann jump in here in a second on what our thoughts are on funding. But I have before I do that, I have to say, we're committed to the transaction. I know you point that out. And I know we do have a tight time line. That's precisely why I threw that out there in my opening comments. The objective is to, I'll say, push for the tape because I know we've got that April 26 date. But importantly, I need you guys to have this takeaway both the AEP and the Algonquin team members continue to have a regular dialogue and work closely together.  So we're all in and we'll continue to push to try to do this as expeditiously as possible. But I think we're also in a good position from a financing perspective. Ann, you want to talk a little bit...\nAnn Kelly: Yes, absolutely. So I mean should Kentucky not close, we would expect to keep our equity needs the same. So no new equity if that happens. We'll just be managing our FFO to debt as tightly as possible and don't expect any changes.\nNicholas Campanella: Okay. That's helpful. I appreciate that. And then I guess just I know we talked a lot about deferred fuel, but we noticed that the CFO is slightly depressed in '23 versus kind of what you outlined at the Analyst Day. And I think you're making up for that in the back part of the plan. But is that purely just deferred fuel impacts? Or is there something else fundamental there? That would helpful.\nAnn Kelly: Yes, there's really 2 main drivers. Deferred fuel is the biggest piece, but the other piece is we've had some return of collateral from a mark-to-market due to the reduction in natural gas and power prices that has impacted that as well.\nOperator: Next, we can go to Bill Appicelli with UBS.\nUnidentified Analyst: Just going back to the Kentucky sale. I know you said that FERC provided for a 45-day comment period so that was look like it was going to be supportive of maybe an expedited ruling. But will we get further indications from FERC, if they will rule an expedited manner? Or do we just have to wait and see?\nJulia Sloat: Yes. So the next gating item for us is March 31. That ends the commentary period, and we'll just proceed from there. We know the other backdrop for us or backstop for us, as I mentioned in my comments, is the April 26 date. So that's top of mind for us as well. But here's where I continue to go in my mind. None of the benefits yet to the customer until we close the transaction. They don't start in advance. So that's incredibly important. And I think we've got everyone's attention.  And Bill, the other thing that we were particularly sensitive to, and I know Darcy has probably shared this with you, if you've called in, in the interim here, but we really made an effort to take the FERC blueprint to make sure that we were accommodating or addressing the concerns that FERC voiced as it relates to taking care of customers and making sure there's no harm.  And as a matter of fact, if you at the application. I think we go in pre through the new 203 application in pretty granular form. I think it's Pages 4, 5 and 6. Clearly, I've read this a few times. Take a look at that if you want to get a better sense of what the parties have come up with to be able to take care of the customers in the state of Kentucky and specifically Kentucky Power's footprint. So I think everybody is going to be working on an expedited basis and schedule.  And clearly, we very much appreciated the shortened comment period because I do think it's indicative. So we'll continue to work through it and rest assured that both the AEP and Algonquin team members will continue to be in regular contact with one another because at this point, we're partners in all of this.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. No, that's very helpful. And then I guess, what happens if we get to the April 26 date, and we don't have a decision from FERC. Can that be extended or...\nJulia Sloat: Excellent question, excellent question. And here's how we can answer that for you. I mentioned that the teams are in constant contact and regular contact. I would expect that if we get closer to that date, that the teams will be talking specifically about this. So stay tuned.\nOperator: And next, we'll go to Durgesh Chopra with Evercore. .\nDurgesh Chopra: Just first, a quick clarification. The -- I think you mentioned $0.08 for the renewables business EPS. That's just half year, right? So that's what's embedded in the guidance and the full year earnings are double that to $0.16, right?\nAnn Kelly: No, $0.08 is last year. So the 2022 EPS from renewables, as we mentioned, for 2023, we expect that to be $0.01.\nDurgesh Chopra: Got it. So that's the full year contribution for 2022?\nJulia Sloat: That's correct. Yes, $0.08 for 2022, $0.01 for 2023. And so the way I would characterize it, and I think this is how we had the press release neutral to maybe slightly dilutive to the tune of $0.01. So from my chair, I'm not worried about it.\nDurgesh Chopra: Got it. Okay. And then just, again, I want to go back to the sort of the financing slide. Can you just updated thoughts on use of proceeds here. Clearly, the renewable sale is on track and get $1.2 billion in cash. So how should we think about use of proceeds? Should that at least eliminate equity for 2024?\nJulia Sloat: Yes. So do you want to take that?\nAnn Kelly: No. Right now, we are not going to reduce any equity in the outer years. But as Julie mentioned, once we close the Kentucky transaction, the renewables transaction, we're going to we reevaluate and see whether or not we can responsibly take out equity in the future while keeping in mind and having a strong balance sheet.\nOperator: And next, we can go to Paul Fremont with Ladenburg.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great. So I guess the first question, right now, the sales proceeds from the 2 transactions actually are in excess of the equity that you had identified last year. So we should assume though that the sales proceeds don't eliminate your equity need, they just reduce it. Is that a fair characterization?\nJulia Sloat: I think that's a fair characterization. And just as a reminder because Ann wasn't here when we made these announcements last year. But Paul, you may remember, we took out of the 2022 plan -- the 2022 plan, $1.4 billion of equity because we assume that the Kentucky transaction would have closed. We never put that equity back in. And so right now, we're just kind of waiting to have that particular transaction close. And then we introduced the contracted renewables transaction on top of that. So what you see today is versus what we originally had planned, we had already stripped out $1.4 billion of equity. So that's already assumed in this plan versus what we originally had when we announced Kentucky. And so as Ann mentioned, what you should anticipate is we've already assumed all the process both of these transactions are assumed in the multiyear forecast you have on Page 39.  And that once we close on both of them, we like cash. We like cash coming in the door. So once we close on those, we'll be able to recalibrate to make sure we're doing -- hitting 2 objectives: number one, make sure that we're getting to that 15% -- 14% to 15% FFO-to-debt and then being able to tweak, meaning otherwise translation reduce any of those equity needs in those future periods. So don't anticipate us just piping all of that out because we've already assumed the Kentucky utilization was in there, but we may have some wiggle room here to take some additional dollars out in terms of equity once we close on the transaction.  And so no hidden message there. We're just wait until we have the dollars, and we'll be right back to you to be able to take some of those equity needs out assuming we can get the metrics that we need to hit from an FFO-to-debt perspective, and I think we can do it.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great. And then moving to Virginia. You guys -- or there's a bill, I think that's under duration SB 1075, would you expect that to survive, come out of conference and ultimately be adopted? Or I guess, what's your thought process on what will happen in Virginia?\nJulia Sloat: Yes. So here's what I have. I have that SB 1075 was amended in the house and then we -- it was transitioned to a biennial. And then we're continuing to work with our legislators and the governors to reach some consensus on the language. And if this does pass, what you should anticipate is that AEP or APCo would file its last triennial in 2023, and that would cover the period through 2022. So we'll see if we can get this across the goal line.  I know we've got some other competing bills or legislation that is being proposed as well, also looks like a biennial situation.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great. And can you break out for 2022, just the contribution from generation?\nJulia Sloat: From all of our generating assets or the generation market...\nUnidentified Analyst: In the G&M section, so the merchant -- in other words, the merchant generation contribution in 2022.\nJulia Sloat: Yes. I can give you the renewable part, that was $0.08. I have that off the top of my head. I can give you the -- so I'm going to work it a little bit backwards. I give you the retail piece of the business, and that's not the generation component. So that was $0.05. So then you've got, what, $0.13 there of the total earned. We can circle back with you, Paul, and get you that number, though. That would be no problem.\nUnidentified Analyst: That would be great. And maybe the last question for me. the income tax changes and other and corporate and other, can you maybe give a little flavor as to what drove those?\nJulia Sloat: Hang on one second here. We're kind of running through my notes because I don't have that in front of me.\nAnn Kelly: Yes. So the income tax, there's a little bit of geography here with respect to the parent company loss that's driving that impact. And then -- the other is just a lot of very small items that are loan together.\nOperator: And with no further questions in queue, I'll hand the call back over to Darcy Reese.\nDarcy Reese: Thank you for joining us on today's call. As always, the IR team will be available to answer any additional questions you may have. Brad, would you please give the replay information.\nOperator: Certainly. Thank you.

            "name": "Julia Sloat",
            "content": "Thanks, Darcy. Welcome, everyone, to American Electric Power's Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. I'm happy to be here with all of you this morning, and I'm pleased to be joined by our recently appointed CFO, Ann Kelly, who joined our team in late November. So here we go.  We're making great progress and have a lot to share with you today, starting with the financial performance of our fourth quarter and year. I'll provide update on our Kentucky operations sale, unregulated renewable sale and retail business strategic review. I'll also provide insight into the regulatory and legislative front, as we work to implement important new initiatives to ensure our customers and communities needs, which are met in turn, and drives our high-quality investment proposition.  Finally, I'll include an update -- or I'll conclude with an update on our generation fleet transformation as we continue to invest in regulated renewables and our energy delivery infrastructure, a summary of 2022 highlights and our focus for 2023 can be found on Slides 6 and 7 of today's presentation. As you know, we have a long history of consistently delivering and exceeding our earnings guidance and 2022 is no exception.  I'm very proud of the dedication and accomplishments of the entire AEP team over the past year. While we finished the year strong, I can promise you, we're just getting started. Our robust financial plan continues to yield results. We delivered strong fourth quarter 2022 operating earnings of $1.05 per share bringing our full year 2022 operating earnings to $5.09 per share. We're also -- we also increased our quarterly dividend from $0.78 to $0.83 per share, which we announced back in October. AEP's teamwork-driven performance in 2022 has established a strong foundation from which we can reaffirm our 2023 full year operating earnings guidance range of $5.19 to $5.39, all while mitigating inflationary cost pressures, supply chain pressures and higher interest rates as well as constructively navigating regulatory and legislative frameworks. Formula rates in several of our state jurisdictions and in our high-growth transmission business help us to manage increased interest expense and higher costs.  Importantly, as we keep customer affordability top of mind, we are actively working with our states on the economic development front to drive expansion in our service territory, and we are incorporating efficiencies and expense containment into our rate recovery filings to continue to help offset the impact of increased cost pressures. As a matter of fact, the economic development efforts over the past several years are proving to be appreciably beneficial, and we'll talk about normalized load in a few minutes. But to illustrate my point, I can tell you that normalized industrial sales were up 4.5%, largely as a result of those efforts, not to mention the added benefit of attracting jobs, residents and other cascading upside to our communities, all of which helps to manage customer rates given the bigger denominator.  We value our stakeholder relationships, and we made steady progress on the regulatory front over the past year, including achieving constructive base rate outcomes in Arkansas and SWEPCO Texas and a favorable Supreme Court appeal related to Virginia's last rate case and the securitization of Winter Storm Uri costs in Oklahoma. Our resulting earned regulated ROE as of December 31 was 9.1%, which suggests we still have work to do on this front, and I'll talk about our regulatory activity that we have underway to address this. So hang with me for a few minutes, and I'll get there. AEP is leading the transition to a clean energy economy as we engage in one of the largest generation fleet transformations in our industry, in 2022, our 1.5 gigawatt North Central wind portfolio became fully operational with the completion of the Traverse wind farm project, which marked the beginning of our clean energy fleet transition. We'll continue to execute on our fleet transformation strategy with the opportunity to add approximately 17 gigawatts of new generation resources between 2023 and 2032, while mitigating fuel cost volatility and creating a more diverse resource portfolio to benefit our customers. This will significantly contribute to AEP's reduced carbon emissions profile and put us on a path to achieve our upgraded net zero goal by 2045.  Importantly, the recent passage of the Inflation Reduction Act provides support for our clean energy goals, and this will extend our investment runway as we continue to address the needs of our generation fleet. Since assuming the role of President and now CEO, I prioritize simplifying and derisking our business profile, which has become a core standard by which we evaluate our business activity. By actively managing our portfolio and demonstrating a clear commitment to the successful execution of initiatives and transactions, we continue to deliver significant benefits to our stakeholders.  As you are very much aware, we are working diligently to complete the sale of our Kentucky operations to Liberty. You can find the related regulatory time line on Slide 8 in the presentation today. As an update, AEP and Liberty followed the blueprint provided by the FERC order and filed a new FERC 203 application on February 14 of this year, requesting a shortened comment period and expedited approval to meet the contractual April 26, 2023 transaction close date. Immediately after the filing was made, FERC issued a notice incorporating a shortened 45-day comment deadline related to the application. The shortened comment period is a good sign signaling the commission is open to considering our application on an accelerated basis. AEP and Algonquin are in regular communication discussing various aspects of the transaction, the path forward and our partnership. We're mindful of the April 26 date in the stock purchase agreement and are cognizant of the tight time frame given the March 31 comment period deadline.  The objective of both AEP and Algonquin remains clear, and that's to close the transaction. And both parties are firmly committed to moving forward and bringing forth the benefits of this transaction to customers. Related to our unregulated contract renewables portfolio, after strong buyer interest, we're pleased with our announcement made yesterday for the sale of our 1,365 megawatt portfolio to IRG Acquisition Holdings, which is a partnership owned by Invenergy, CDPQ and funds managed by Blackstone infrastructure. A summary of the sale can be seen on Slide 9 of the presentation today.  We're currently targeting a second quarter 2023 close. The utilization of the proceeds from the sale is now reflected in our updated multiyear financing plan on Slide 39, and the transaction proceeds will be directed to support our regulated businesses as we enhance the energy delivery infrastructure and transform our generation fleet. Our near-term focus remains closing on our 2 pending sale transactions Kentucky and our unregulated renewables. Once both of these transactions are complete, we plan to revisit the equity needs in our current multiyear financing plan. As we've been clear in the past we will use the asset sales to responsibly eliminate equity while maintaining a strong balance sheet, no change in messaging on this.  And that's important that I reiterate that. No change in the messaging. Finally, in October 2022, we announced the strategic review of our retail business. We're looking at this business to determine how or if it fits with the current AP portfolio and we'll keep you updated on our progress. We're expecting to complete the strategic review in the first half of 2023.  Let me touch on our regulatory and legislative initiatives that we have underway. We remain focused on reducing our authorized versus actual ROE gap. As I mentioned earlier, our 2022 earned regulated was ?ROE 9.1% and -- our 2023 earnings guidance range assumes a 9.4% earned ROE, and we are already making progress in that direction. In January, we reached the settlement and gain commission approval for our Louisiana base case, which allows us to reestablish a formula rate plan -- as we advance through the year, the team will be active in completing our current base case in Oklahoma and rider recovery of the 88 megawatts of the Turk plant, which is not currently in Arkansas rates. We also filed an electric security plan in Ohio, which will take us into 2024.  Let me shift gears and provide you with an update on our deferred fuel recovery efforts that are currently underway. As we've previously shared with you over the past several months, we have made adjustments to our traditional cost recovery methods in a number of our states to allow for recovery while spreading the cost out for our customers to make them more affordable.  In West Virginia, we continue to pursue approval of the pass-through of fuel costs under the fuel clause. We also intend to propose an alternative path to recovery of these costs under proposed legislation, if Approved, that would allow us to securitize these costs and minimize customer impact. The West Virginia Commission recently instructed its staff to finish its prudence review of the 2021 and 2022 fuel costs. The state legislature continues to move the securitization legislation forward with the Commission Chair recently testifying in support before the lawmakers.  I'll conclude my remarks with an update on our regulated renewables strategy and execution. Our capacity needs continue to drive us forward on the regulated renewables front, and we continue to work with our regulators, policymakers and other key stakeholders to ensure a durable and sustainable transmission -- transition to a clean energy economy in our vertically integrated state.  The recently enacted Inflation Reduction Act will help us advance our goals in this area and will provide additional value to our customers as we seek to acquire resources consistent with our plan. We've made considerable progress on SWEPCO's 999-megawatt renewables application, which represents a $2.2 billion investment for AEP. Parties filed a unanimous settlement in Arkansas on January 27 and for a portfolio of owned wind and solar resources. A hearing was held in Texas in January, and we continue to have constructive settlement dialogue with parties in Louisiana, and the hearing date has been formally extended to March 21 to accommodate this. We look forward to receiving the commission's orders, which are expected in the second quarter of 2023 on Louisiana and the third quarter of 2023 for Texas.  In November of 2022, PSO made a regulatory filing in Oklahoma to own 995.5 megawatts of solar and wind projects representing a $2.5 billion investment. A procedural schedule was issued last month which includes a hearing date in April and an expected commission order in the third quarter of this year. Separately, we're also seeking to acquire the 154-megawatt [indiscernible] wind facility in Oklahoma from EDF. FERC approved this acquisition on February 16, and we're pursuing rate recovery of this investment through the ongoing PSO base rate case.  The project is already in service and will provide immediate capacity for PSO's customers. Our regulated renewables goals are aligned and supported by our integrated resources plans. In accordance with those plans, we issued request for proposal in 2022 for wind, solar and other resources at APCo, INM and once again at SWEPCO. We anticipate making the related regulatory funds to acquire additional resources under these RFPs throughout 2023.  We continue to see rapid changes in our industry and increasing need and demand from customers and communities across the United States. At the end of 2022, as I prepared to assume my new position at AEP, the team and I dedicated a considerable amount of time and energy to determining how AEP would continue to deliver safe, clean, affordable and reliable energy and how we could deliver this energy faster and more efficiently to our customers while generating enhanced value to our stakeholders. Our long-term earnings growth rate of 6% to 7% is underpinned by a robust $40 billion capital investment plan for 2023 through 2027, which includes $15 billion in transmission and $9 billion in regulated renewables investments.  As evidenced by our fourth quarter and full year 2022 performance AEP has had a long-standing track record of consistently delivering on our strategic objectives, our transformation strategy is working and the investments we're making continue to support our positive earnings growth and results. Now please join me in welcoming Ann to her first AEP earnings call. I'll leave you in her very capable hands as she provides insight and perspective into our performance drivers for 2022 and the details supporting our financial targets. Ann? Yes. I still appreciate the question because shares, I'm sure you can imagine, it is absolutely top of mind for us. And as Ann mentioned in her comments, top of mind from a CFO perspective, most definitely. As you know, we did get an order.  The staff is going through its paces as we had to work through the prudency review. And in the background, what's playing is a legislation that could potentially accommodate securitization of the dollars we have outstanding, our fuel balance in West Virginia $520 million -- so it's not insignificant and it's extremely important to be able to digest this in a way that can accommodate customer rates. So we're hoping that we'll be able to be in a position we'll be able to utilize the securitization legislation, if approved, to be able to smooth this out and take care of customer needs in terms of the bill in path. And I don't know, Ann, do you have any other thoughts on that, how we might do that? No hidden message there at all, Shahriar. We want to make sure that we get both of these transactions in the bag, get them taken care of and then we'll recalibrate. And as you know, our objective is twofold. We want to make sure we have a strong balance sheet because we don't want anybody worried about any dilutive otherwise actions that we would have to take. So that's first and foremost. So top of mind for us is making sure that balance sheet is in check.  And as you know, we put out a target goal for FFO to debt of 14% to 15%. That being said, to the extent that we will then be able to eliminate future equity needs, we don't have a significant amount of equity financing when you look out over the horizon. But if we're able to kind of pull that back a little bit and still hit the objective on the strong balance sheet, we'll absolutely do that. So no hidden message. Obviously, both of these are moving along, contractor renewables new for us. We know that, that will close in the second quarter. We believe that's the plan to close in the second quarter. And as you know, Kentucky is pending with its 203 application. So stay tuned. We just want to make sure that we got this completely right for you all and that you're not concerned. Yes, absolutely. And I love the question because that's exactly what we're doing in our house right now is going through the paces to determine exactly does it fit -- if there's anything that does fit, what does that look like? Stay tuned. That will be a first half story for AEP. So expect us to be coming to you probably in the second quarter with a little more granular detail because we're literally going through that analysis now and working with the troops to make sure we have that finally, too, so we can get back out to you.  As far as quantifying how big is this business and what does it mean currently to AEP, the net asset position or, I guess, equity position, if you strip out the liabilities, we're talking about $193 million -- the vast majority of that is working capital to the tune of about $150 million of the $193 million, and the rest is largely IT software, and then we have a little smidge of goodwill in there of about $1 million to give you some parameters.  And then another thing that I would think about is what does that mean from an EPS perspective, in 2022, this retail business contributed $0.05 of EPS. And in 2023, we have $0.04 embedded in our guidance to give you that goalpost to. Hopefully, that helps. We haven't disclosed an EBITDA number. I can tell you that in our guidance for 2023, we're looking at $0.01 that renewable business contributed, I think it was $0.08. Does that sound right, Ann? $0.08, yes? $0.08 in 2022 to give you those parameters. That's right. We expect to get our -- up to the -- get the ball between the uprates in the last part of the year. We do expect to have a little bit of pressure on the front end as we continue to work through some of the fuel balances. As I mentioned, when you look at West Virginia stand-alone, it's about $520 million. Does that sound right, Ann? So we're at 13.2% as of year-end. And so if we get above that 14%-ish range by year-end 2023, I don't know that looks about -- I don't say entirely 100 basis points, but it's pretty significant. Yes. So here's where I'll draw your attention to. And I know we have the little equalizer chart here in the slide deck somewhere. I think it's on Page 41. And so you can get a sense of kind of where we are hanging out on each of the respective operating company entities. But what we do have in play right now is that at PSO, so Oklahoma, we have a base case underway. So that should help us to begin to heal the ROE, the earned ROE at PSO. So stay tuned for that. So base case in play there. And then as I mentioned in my opening remarks, we recently were able to finalize our Louisiana base case and then reactivate this formula rate plan. So that will get underway to, again, to help move SWEPCO's ROE back up closer to its authorized levels. Kentucky, obviously, you know what we're doing with Kentucky. And APCo, I think APCo, that's why the legislation in Virginia becomes so important to us. because we're in an under-earning position right now. We got the outcome of the Virginia triennial case, which should be beneficial to us in 2023, but I would still expect APCo's ROE to be under pressure until we get, hopefully, some resolution around Virginia legislation that to the extent that we're able to modify the regulatory recovery methods that are being employed in that particular state, we'll begin to see some healing on that particular ROE, too. So our triennial versus say a biennial, AEP is going to lead more toward a biennial or an annual type look versus necessarily that triennial because unfortunately kind of tracks us in an under-earning position, so stay tuned. We'll see how the Virginia legislation process moved along. Our team is absolutely at the table with all the other stakeholders. So that sounds constructive. So we're hopeful and we'll see this developing situation through and then we would expect something to be in the improvement territory for APCo. Anything shorter, Steve, is going to be better for us -- so that will move us in a more productive situation or direction for APCo in particular. I mean an annual rate trout would be fine, too. But again, you can see the direction. So that will be important for us as we work through the different solutions that are being contemplated now because I know we have, I think, 3 bills that are being evaluated or at least shopped in Virginia. But as I mentioned, AEP is absolutely at the table, and we'll see how this ultimately shakes out. Obviously, the benefit needs to go to the customers, but then also our investors as we work to improve the ROE. Yes. Nick, I still appreciate the question, and I'll let Ann jump in here in a second on what our thoughts are on funding. But I have before I do that, I have to say, we're committed to the transaction. I know you point that out. And I know we do have a tight time line. That's precisely why I threw that out there in my opening comments. The objective is to, I'll say, push for the tape because I know we've got that April 26 date. But importantly, I need you guys to have this takeaway both the AEP and the Algonquin team members continue to have a regular dialogue and work closely together.  So we're all in and we'll continue to push to try to do this as expeditiously as possible. But I think we're also in a good position from a financing perspective. Ann, you want to talk a little bit... Yes. So the next gating item for us is March 31. That ends the commentary period, and we'll just proceed from there. We know the other backdrop for us or backstop for us, as I mentioned in my comments, is the April 26 date. So that's top of mind for us as well. But here's where I continue to go in my mind. None of the benefits yet to the customer until we close the transaction. They don't start in advance. So that's incredibly important. And I think we've got everyone's attention.  And Bill, the other thing that we were particularly sensitive to, and I know Darcy has probably shared this with you, if you've called in, in the interim here, but we really made an effort to take the FERC blueprint to make sure that we were accommodating or addressing the concerns that FERC voiced as it relates to taking care of customers and making sure there's no harm.  And as a matter of fact, if you at the application. I think we go in pre through the new 203 application in pretty granular form. I think it's Pages 4, 5 and 6. Clearly, I've read this a few times. Take a look at that if you want to get a better sense of what the parties have come up with to be able to take care of the customers in the state of Kentucky and specifically Kentucky Power's footprint. So I think everybody is going to be working on an expedited basis and schedule.  And clearly, we very much appreciated the shortened comment period because I do think it's indicative. So we'll continue to work through it and rest assured that both the AEP and Algonquin team members will continue to be in regular contact with one another because at this point, we're partners in all of this. Excellent question, excellent question. And here's how we can answer that for you. I mentioned that the teams are in constant contact and regular contact. I would expect that if we get closer to that date, that the teams will be talking specifically about this. So stay tuned. That's correct. Yes, $0.08 for 2022, $0.01 for 2023. And so the way I would characterize it, and I think this is how we had the press release neutral to maybe slightly dilutive to the tune of $0.01. So from my chair, I'm not worried about it. Yes. So do you want to take that? I think that's a fair characterization. And just as a reminder because Ann wasn't here when we made these announcements last year. But Paul, you may remember, we took out of the 2022 plan -- the 2022 plan, $1.4 billion of equity because we assume that the Kentucky transaction would have closed. We never put that equity back in. And so right now, we're just kind of waiting to have that particular transaction close. And then we introduced the contracted renewables transaction on top of that. So what you see today is versus what we originally had planned, we had already stripped out $1.4 billion of equity. So that's already assumed in this plan versus what we originally had when we announced Kentucky. And so as Ann mentioned, what you should anticipate is we've already assumed all the process both of these transactions are assumed in the multiyear forecast you have on Page 39.  And that once we close on both of them, we like cash. We like cash coming in the door. So once we close on those, we'll be able to recalibrate to make sure we're doing -- hitting 2 objectives: number one, make sure that we're getting to that 15% -- 14% to 15% FFO-to-debt and then being able to tweak, meaning otherwise translation reduce any of those equity needs in those future periods. So don't anticipate us just piping all of that out because we've already assumed the Kentucky utilization was in there, but we may have some wiggle room here to take some additional dollars out in terms of equity once we close on the transaction.  And so no hidden message there. We're just wait until we have the dollars, and we'll be right back to you to be able to take some of those equity needs out assuming we can get the metrics that we need to hit from an FFO-to-debt perspective, and I think we can do it. Yes. So here's what I have. I have that SB 1075 was amended in the house and then we -- it was transitioned to a biennial. And then we're continuing to work with our legislators and the governors to reach some consensus on the language. And if this does pass, what you should anticipate is that AEP or APCo would file its last triennial in 2023, and that would cover the period through 2022. So we'll see if we can get this across the goal line.  I know we've got some other competing bills or legislation that is being proposed as well, also looks like a biennial situation. From all of our generating assets or the generation market... Yes. I can give you the renewable part, that was $0.08. I have that off the top of my head. I can give you the -- so I'm going to work it a little bit backwards. I give you the retail piece of the business, and that's not the generation component. So that was $0.05. So then you've got, what, $0.13 there of the total earned. We can circle back with you, Paul, and get you that number, though. That would be no problem. Hang on one second here. We're kind of running through my notes because I don't have that in front of me."

            "name": "Ann Kelly",
            "content": "Thank you, Julia and Darcy. It's great to be with you all this morning and thanks for dialing in. I'll walk us through our fourth quarter and full year results, share some updates on our service territory load and our outlook for 2023 and finish with commentary on credit metrics and liquidity as well as some thoughts on our guidance, financial targets and portfolio management.  So let's go to Slide 10, which shows the comparison of GAAP to operating earnings for the quarter and year-to-date periods. As Julie mentioned, we had a strong operating results in both the fourth quarter and for the full year. GAAP earnings for the fourth quarter were $0.75 per share compared to $1.07 per share in 2021. GAAP earnings for the year were $4.51 per share compared to $4.97 per share in 2021. For the quarter, I'll mention that we have reflected additional charges related to the expected sale of Kentucky Power and Kentucky Transco as nonoperating costs. This is largely a result of the delay in the closing from the need to file a new 203 application with the FERC. There are detailed reconciliations of GAAP to operating earnings on Pages 18 and 19 of the presentation today. Today, I'm going to focus more on our full year results, but I did want to provide a few highlights on the fourth quarter as we show on Slide 11. Operating earnings for the fourth quarter totaled $1.05 per share compared to $0.98 per share in 2021.  This is a $0.07 or 7% increase year-over-year. While we had a lot of puts and takes, our vertically integrated and T&D utility segments continued to perform well, resulting from rate changes, transmission revenue and some favorable weather. We did see a $0.03 decline in our normalized retail margin, but that was due to a change in sales mix as low as favorable for the quarter.  I'll discuss load in more detail in a couple of minutes. We were also able to support an increase in our O&M expenses as a result of the strong earnings that we were seeing. Transmission Holdco was favorable by $0.03, even after factoring in the loss the Ohio RTO adder as we continue to see the benefits of our investments. Generation and Marketing produced $0.16 per share, up $0.10 from last year, driven by increased retail energy margins and favorable generation performance, primarily driven by fewer average days year-over-year.  And finally, Corporate and Other was down $0.05 per share driven by increased interest expense and investment losses, partially offset by favorable income taxes. Now let's have a look at our year-to-date results on Slide 12. Operating earnings for 2022 totaled $1.09 per share compared to $4.74 per share in 2021. This was an increase of $0.35 per share or 7%. Looking at the drivers by segment. Operating earnings for vertically integrated utilities were $2.56 per share, up $0.30. Due to rate changes across various operating companies, favorable weather, increased transmission revenue and also increase normalized load. Offsetting these favorable variances were higher O&M, increased depreciation expense and increased interest expense.  Once again, the change in accounting around the Rockport Unit 2 lease results in $0.23 of favorable O&M offset by $0.23 of unfavorable depreciation. In the Transmission & Distribution Utilities segment, earned $1.16 per share, up $0.06 from last year. Favorable drivers in this segment included rate changes in Texas and Ohio, favorable weather and increased normalized retail load and transmission revenue. Offsetting these favorable items were unfavorable O&M and depreciation. With the favorable weather and other items that we experienced in 2022, we were able to responsibly deploy additional O&M in both utility segments to spend on items like increased vegetation management to improve system reliability.  The AEP Transmission Holdco segment contributed $1.32 per share, down $0.03 from last year. Favorable investment growth of $0.12 was more than offset by an unaffared true-up of $0.04, the loss of the RTO adder in Ohio and increased income taxes. Remember, our 2022 guidance had this segment down by $0.08 year-over-year as a result of the investment growth being more than offset by the annual true-up to some unfavorable comparisons for taxes and interest. Generation and Marketing produced $0.50 per share, up $0.24 from last year. The positive variance here is primarily due to the sale of renewable development sites, improved generation performance in land sales in the generation business, improved retail margins and increased wholesale margins stemming from favorable market conditions.  And finally, Corporate and Other was down $0.22 per share, driven by investment losses unfavorable interest in increased O&M, partly offset by lower income taxes. The investment losses continue to be impacted by the year-over-year comparisons for our ChargePoint investment that we exited in the third quarter. As we mentioned earlier, we are reaffirming our guidance range for 2023. For convenience, we've included an updated waterfall on our actual 2022 results to the midpoint of our guidance for 2023 on Slide 36. While the variances changed due to the 2022 actual results, there is no change to our 2023 segment or overall guidance. We are confident that our regulatory actions to provide timely returns on our distribution and renewable investments, continued investment in transmission assets, the impact of economic development efforts and prudent O&M management will offset headwinds such as rising interest rates and inflationary pressures.  Now turning to Slide 13, I'll provide an update on our normalized load performance. Overall, 2022 was a remarkable year for normalized load growth across the AEP service territory. Despite the Federal Reserve's intentional actions to slow down the economy, AEP experienced its strongest weather-normalized load growth in over 15 years with 2.8% annual growth. The most impressive part is that this is experience on top of a recovery year. As a reminder, 2021 was the strongest year for AEP's normalized growth in over a decade until 2022. The growth in 2022 was spread across nearly every operating company in every major retail class. Starting in the lower right corner of the slide, normalized retail sales increased by 1.9% in the fourth quarter and ended the year up 2.8% compared to last year. For the quarter, the growth in commercial and industrial sales will more than offset the modest decline in residential sales.  Looking forward, you will see that we are expecting growth of 7% to 10% in 2023. The story is changing somewhat to further remove away from the pandemic. In 2022, the boost from fiscal policy overwhelmed the Federal Reserve's efforts to constrain the economy through monetary policy. In 2023, we expect the fiscal boost to date given the congressional changes after the election, while the Fed's efforts to tame inflation remain in place. We expect this to result in a slight moderation of economic growth for the balance of this year.  Moving to the upper left corner, Normalized residential sales decreased by 0.8% in the fourth quarter but finished the year slightly above 2021. For the quarter, residential customer counts increased by 0.4%, but this was offset by a 1.2% decline in weather normalized usage.  This is not surprising when you consider the impact that higher inflation, energy costs and interest rates on customers' disposable income to end the year. You will notice that we now expect residential sales to decrease by 0.5% in 2023 for the same reason. Moving right, weather-normalized commercial increased by 5.4% for the quarter and ended the year up 4.2% compared to 2021. The growth in commercial sales was spread across nearly every operating company. fastest-growing commercial sectors, professional scientific and tech services that includes data centers, which -- where load was up nearly 30% compared to last year for both the quarter and the year-to-date comparisons.  The outlook for 2023 is showing a modest 0.6% growth. While we do see momentum in this class driven by economic development, the sustained impact of the labor shortage inflation high interest rates and energy costs will act as a headwind in 2023. Finally, focusing on the lower left corner, you see the industrial sales growth moderated in the fourth quarter, up 1.5% and while the year ended 4.5% above 2021. Industrial sales increased at most operating companies in many of our largest sectors.  We continue to experience robust growth in the oil and gas sectors, which were up 6% compared to the fourth quarter of 2021. Outside of oil and gas, which tends to run countercyclical to the rest of the economy, we did notice softer industrial sales growth consistent with many of the economic indicators. As you know, the ISM manufacturing index fell below 50 in the fourth quarter, which is a sign of an industrial contraction. The combination of sustained inflation, supply chain disruptions, increasing borrowing costs, strong dollar and elevated energy costs have formed significant challenges for domestic manufacturing. Fortunately, AEP's past economic development activities are providing an offset and are keeping AEP's industrial sales growth in positive territory. You see that the outlook is showing industrial sales growth of 2.1% in 2023, which is largely attributable to the consistent economic development activities from the past. I'll provide additional detail on the impact of these efforts in the next slide.  To summarize, the AP service territory experienced a remarkable year for load growth in 2022 despite the inflationary pressures on wages and energy and a federal reserve that was intentionally trying to slow down the economy. We are finally seeing evidence that these measures are starting to have an impact, which will result in slower growth in 2023. Fortunately, AEP's disciplined commitment to economic development should keep our load growth in the black moving forward.  For example, absent economic development, our loan growth would have been essentially flat in the fourth quarter and up 1.1% for the year.  Turning to Slide 14, I want to highlight how our commitment to economic development is helping to sustain load growth even in the face of challenging economic conditions. The chart on this slide illustrates why the strategy is so important to us. The blue bars on this chart show the growth of gross regional product for the AEP service territory over the past year. You can see that it has been slowing over the period. And in fact, for the fourth quarter, growth in AEP's GRP was slightly negative compared to the fourth quarter of 2021. However, the green bars here show our industrial sales growth over the same period. You'll notice they have been resilient throughout 2022 without any help from GRP. A lot of the growth in industrial load that we are seeing today is a consequence of economic development projects from previous years. And our focus on economic development is not just about the additional load that we report to you on a quarterly basis. We are also focused on attracting employers to the service territory. We know that adding new loading customers are a key strategy to providing value to all customers. This allows us to continue to prioritize investments that will improve the customer experience while mitigating the rate impacts on our customer base.  By making this a key component of our strategy, AEP is helping to mitigate the impact of the economic downturn on our customers, communities and shareholders. And AEP's economic development team has a proven track record of helping to bring these new customers to our service territory with an emphasis on jobs and load. In fact, the AEP service territories added over 141,000 jobs in 2022.  Let's move on to Slide 15 to discuss the company's capitalization and liquidity position. Taking a look at the upper left quadrant on this page, you see our FFO-to-debt metric stands at 13.2%, which is a decrease of 1.3% from the prior quarter. The primary reason for this decrease is the impact on both FFO and short-term debt from a decrease in our mark-to-market collateral positions associated with the decline in natural gas and power prices. as well as a continued increase in our deferred fuel balances.  We remain committed to our targeted FFO-to-debt range of 14% to 15%, and we plan to trend back into that range near the end of 2023 as we continue to work through the regulatory recovery process of our deferred fuel balances, which can drive some volatility in the metrics. You can see our liquidity summary on the lower left quadrant side. Our 5-year $4 billion bank revolver and 2-year $1 billion revolving credit facility support our liquidity position, which remains strong at $2.6 billion. The $1.1 billion change from last quarter is mainly due to an increase in commercial paper outstanding for the reasons I mentioned earlier.  On a GAAP basis, our debt-to-capital ratio increased from the prior quarter by 1.5% to 62.9%. On the qualified pension front, our funding status remained strong, ending the quarter at 102.4%. While assets performed as expected during the quarter, the primary driver for the funded status decreased was due to an increase in the liability caused by changes in actuarial assumptions influenced by the rising interest rate environment in 2022.  Now turning to Slide 16. I'll give a quick recap of today's message. First, we are focused on execution. The Kentucky transaction is back in front of the FERC and Liberty and AEP are committed to moving forward with this transaction. We just announced the agreement to sell our unregulated contract renewables portfolio and are working through the strategic review of the retail business. Each of these actions will help us to simplify and derisk our business. Even as we worked on these initiatives, we didn't take our eye off the ball of managing the business. We finished 2022 with solid earnings and made significant investments to support our customers even with the backdrop of supply chain challenges and inflationary pressures.  We continue to be committed to our long-term growth rate of 6% to 7% and continued dividend growth and a strong balance sheet while derisking the company, focusing on the customer and actively managing the portfolio. We really appreciate your time and attention today. I'm going to ask Brad to open up the call so that we can answer any questions that you may have. Yes. No, it's absolutely right. I mean utilizing the securitization allows us to spread it out over time and minimize and actually keep our customer rates relatively flat, which is really the intention. Now this will take some time. It will be effective in June, and we need to commission the order. So we would expect the securitization to take place in the first half of 2024. $0.08, yes. Yes, $520 million. And as I mentioned, the securitization of that will take some time. So likely won't be done by the end of this year. But -- in terms of our other fuel balances in other jurisdictions, we have positive mechanisms to recover that. And also natural gas rates and power prices are declining, so that will help somewhat as well. Yes. I think it actually might be a little bit less than 100 basis when you think about it because we have $1.7 billion of deferred fuel at the end of the year. Yes, absolutely. So I mean should Kentucky not close, we would expect to keep our equity needs the same. So no new equity if that happens. We'll just be managing our FFO to debt as tightly as possible and don't expect any changes. Yes, there's really 2 main drivers. Deferred fuel is the biggest piece, but the other piece is we've had some return of collateral from a mark-to-market due to the reduction in natural gas and power prices that has impacted that as well. No, $0.08 is last year. So the 2022 EPS from renewables, as we mentioned, for 2023, we expect that to be $0.01. No. Right now, we are not going to reduce any equity in the outer years. But as Julie mentioned, once we close the Kentucky transaction, the renewables transaction, we're going to we reevaluate and see whether or not we can responsibly take out equity in the future while keeping in mind and having a strong balance sheet. Yes. So the income tax, there's a little bit of geography here with respect to the parent company loss that's driving that impact. And then -- the other is just a lot of very small items that are loan together."

At this time all participants are in listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question and answer session. [Operator Instructions]. And as a reminder, your conference is being recorded.  I would now like to turn the conference over to you host Vice President of Investor Relations Darcy Reese. Please go ahead.\nDarcy Reese : Thank you, Louis. Good morning, everyone and welcome to the third quarter 2022 earnings call for American Electric Power. We appreciate you taking the time to join us today. Our earnings release presentation slides and related financial information are available on our website at aep.com. Today we will be making forward-looking statements during the call. There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements. Please refer to our SEC filings for a discussion of these factors.   Joining me this morning for opening remarks are Nick Akins, our Chair, and Chief Executive Officer; and Julie Sloat, our President Chief Financial Officer. We will take your questions following their remarks.   I will now turn the call over to Nick.\nNick Akins: Okay, thanks, Darcy. Welcome everyone to American Electric Powers third quarter 2022 earnings call. We continue to make significant progress on our commitments, we have leveraged our scale, our financial strength, portfolio management and transition to a pure play regulated utility.  Over the past 10 years, we've had a great record of consistently exceeding our earnings projections and raising guidance, with this quarter being no exception. Today I'll provide a brief recap of the key financial highlights for the quarter, followed by updates on our Kentucky sale process, our unregulated contracted renewables portfolio sale, and the previously announced strategic review of our retail business, all of which are part of our strategy to simplify and derisk our business profile.  I will then spend time discussing our carbon emission reduction goals, in addition to our continued emphasis on regulated renewables execution, and generation fleet transformation. I'll conclude by providing insights into our other ongoing regulatory activities.  All of this summarized information can be found on slide six and seven of today's presentation with supporting details in the appendix. So, after the financials, we continue to build on our momentum delivering strong third quarter 2022, operating earnings $1.62 per share or $831 million.  Today, we are reaffirming our 2022 narrowed full year operating guidance range, as well as our newly introduced 2023 operating earnings guidance range, both of which we had announced at our recent Analyst Day.  As a reminder, we are going -- are guiding to a 2022 range of $4.97 to $5.07, with an increased midpoint of $5.02 per share, and our 2023 guidance range is $5.19 to $5.31, with a $5.29 per share midpoint. Our long term earnings growth rate guidance of 6% to 7% is underpinned by a robust $40 billion capital investment plan for 2023 to 2027, which includes $26 billion in wires and $9 billion in regulated renewables investments.  Moreover, our dividend growth is in line with our long-term growth rate and within our targeted payout ratio of 60% to 70%. We continue to derisk our platform and execute our strategy to ensure that we are best positioned for value creation in the face of global economic uncertainty and inflationary pressures. As part of this effort, we are continuing to work with states to drive reliability and resiliency in our service territory amidst customer bill considerations and other macroeconomic factors. In order to lessen the impact on our capital investment plan, we have also diversified our mix of suppliers, which has minimized customer and business supply chain disruptions to date. Later in today's call, Julie will walk through our third quarter performance drivers and share thoughts on the positive load outlook in our service territory as well as on our targeted 14% to 15% FFO to debt range. So now talking about some of the strategic reviews. True to our steadfast commitment to execution, we're in the final stretch to complete the sale of our Kentucky operations celebrity. As we previously mentioned, FERC told their approval date to December 16, and we have, therefore, signed with Liberty to plan for a January 2023 closing date. This date is keyed off of FERC's process and should give confidence to all stakeholders, including employees, customers, communities and shareholders. It also enables our transition teams to adequately and efficiently plan for the closing. While our sale time line has shifted over the past year, we are not revising our earnings guidance or any of our equity needs. We are pleased to reach this point and are confident in our ability to close the transaction shortly after the start of the new year. Related to our unregulated contracted renewals portfolio, we launched the sale process for this 1,365 megawatt portfolio in late August 2022 with strong buyer interest from both financial and strategic investors. We recently accepted bids for Phase 1 of the auction process and are proceeding into Phase II due diligence with selected bidders. We are on pace for closing for a closing date in the second quarter of 2023. Selling the portfolio will allow AEP to shift focus and rotate capital towards regulated businesses as we continue to transform our generation fleet and enhance transmission infrastructure.  As we announced earlier this month on our Analyst Day, we are pursuing a strategic review of our retail business as we adjust to how our interest in the competitive markets has changed over time. We'll keep you updated on our progress and expect to complete our review in the first half of 2023. We're always considering opportunities to enhance shareholder value, and we'll continue to evaluate potential value-additive opportunities for our regulated businesses against the backdrop of our goal to further simplify and derisk the business. Now regarding emission reduction goals, as we mentioned in the Analyst Day, AEP remains firmly grounded in our principles of resiliency, reliability and affordability, while recognizing the value of our diverse resource portfolio given today's world of energy-related volatility. We are undertaking one of the largest clean energy transformations in the country through our regulated renewable strategy, and we announced our enhanced and accelerated carbon emission reduction goals at our Analyst Day in early October, as I mentioned earlier. First, we have rebased our near-term emission reduction target of 80% by 2030 now pegged to a 2005 baseline instead of 2000. Second, we upgraded our near-term reduction target. And as such, all Scope one emissions are now included in our carbon emission reduction goals.  Lastly, we accelerated our net zero goal by five years from 2050 to 2045. We are confident in our path forward and our ability to hit key milestones in a steady and timely manner. Importantly, these goals are aligned and supported by our latest integrated resource lands that are in the various states. We will continue our planned retirement and disposition of select fossil fuel units while adding renewables to our generation portfolio. Our 1.5-gigawatt North Central wind portfolio, which became fully operational in March of this year, represents only the beginning of our clean energy fleet transition. In addition, we have 17-gigawatts of potential generation additions across different resource types within our vertically-integrated utilities over the next 10 years. Combined, this represents 18.5-gigawatts of new generation, which will significantly contribute to AEP's reduced carbon emissions profile and put us on a path to achieve net zero -- our net zero goal by 2045.  As an update, on October 19, related to SWEPCO's 999-megawatt renewables totaling $2.2 billion of investment, the Arkansas staff filed support of these resources subject to conditions. Commission orders are expected in 2023. As we look to the long term, we are committed to building a reliable and resilient grid to efficiently deliver clean energy to our customers, and we will continue to monitor new technologies that can help us close the gap to net zero, while maintaining the highly reliable and affordable delivery of energy that our customers expect. Moreover, newly passed provisions and the Inflation Reduction Act, which is foundational to our clean energy investment strategy should help bolster advancement of new carbon-free energy sources. The bill includes tax credits for technologies like clean hydrogen projection -- production and energy storage, in addition to the technology neutral tax credits for our carbon-free resources and we will continue to evaluate these resources through our integrated resource plans. With regard to our ongoing regulatory activities, our regulated ROE as of September 30, 2022, is 9.3% and continues to improve as we work through regulatory cases and continue to make strides in reducing our authorized versus actual ROE gap. In fact, as an update on SWEPCO on September 29, we filed notice to move the 88 megawatts of Turk Plant into rates in Arkansas. The full filing will occur within the November, December time frame, and we will seek a rider to place the 88-megawatt capacity in rates. With respect to our outstanding SWEPCO Louisiana rate case, we are expecting an order in the fourth quarter of 2022. We've also made notable progress on APCo's 2020 Virginia case. As many of you likely recall, we successfully appeal the triennial rate order the day following the issuance of the order in November 2020, giving confidence in our position that the order was inconsistent with Virginia statute. We are pleased that the court recently ruled in AEP's favor preserving our right to seek a retroactive adjustment in addition to the ongoing rate adjustment. Interim rates were implemented in Virginia on October First of this year. We've also actively managed the implications of increased fuel costs as we focus on maintaining a balance between cost recovery and customer impacts.  As part of this effort, our operating companies continue to work with commissions, regulators and other stakeholders to educate customers about surges and put mechanisms in place to alleviate these pressures. For example, we have 6-month and 2-month clauses in I&M and SWEPCO Louisiana respectively, to help ease the effect of longer-term fuel classes. We also -- we were also able to lengthen the months of fuel recovery in Virginia and Oklahoma and are working with our customers and commissions to make sure we recover that over a longer period of time. As you all know, this will be my last earnings call as I will be transitioning from CEO to Executive Chair on January 1, and Julie will become CEO of AEP. We're very excited to have an executive of Julie's caliber to lead our company. I'm confident in her deep knowledge of AEP as well as the emphasis she places on consistency, quality of earnings and dividends and shareholder and customer value creation that will be instrumental to AEP's continued success. I'm also confident that she has the heart to be a strong leader. I'm reminded of the lyrics of Rush\u2019s Closer to the Heart that I have always related to as a CEO, and it goes something like this. And the men and women who hold high places must be the ones who start to mold a new reality closer to the heart. The role of a CEO in the company, our communities and our country has changed during my tenure, Julie is the embodiment of the new CEO and will lead this company to even greater success. After 44 earnings call, my tenure will soon come to an end as CEO of this great company. So, I'll end this call with lyrics from a great Led Zeppelin song. And so today, my world at smiles. And song title is Merely Thank You. Julie?\nJulie Sloat: Oh, my goodness, Nick. Thank you. Thank you. Well, yes, all heart and all in. Absolutely, absolutely. So, thanks, everyone, for joining us today. I know you have a real busy morning with multiple companies reporting. So, we'll try to be as efficient as possible. But I'm going to walk us through the third quarter year-to-date results, share some updates on our service territory load and economy and finish with commentary on credit metrics and liquidity, as well as some thoughts on our guidance, financial targets and recap our commitments to stakeholders. So, I'm going to start on Slide eight which shows the comparison of GAAP to operating earnings. GAAP earnings for the third quarter were $1.33 per share compared to $1.59 per share in 2021. GAAP earnings through September were $3.76 per share compared to $3.90 per share in 2021. For the quarter, I'd like to mention two reconciling items. First, there's a write-off of a Virginia regulatory asset associated with previously closed coal plants. This is a result of the Virginia Supreme Court opinion that affirmed the company's original write-down of those plants in 2019 and allowed APCo to increase its Virginia rates on a going-forward basis. The other reconciling item that I'd like to mention related to the sale of Kentucky Power. You'll recall that we announced on September 30, that we'd entered into an amendment to the stock purchase agreement with Liberty that among other items resulted in a reduced purchase price. We've reflected the additional loss on the expected sale of Kentucky Power and Kentucky Transco as a non-operating cost. There's a detailed reconciliation of GAAP to operating earnings on Pages 16 and 17 of the presentation today. Let's walk through our quarterly operating earnings performance by segment on Slide nine. Operating earnings for the third quarter totaled $1.62 per share compared to $1.43 per share in 2021.  Operating earnings for the vertically-integrated utilities were $0.97 per share, up $0.10. Favorable drivers included rate changes across multiple jurisdictions, the impact of the Virginia Supreme Court ruling related to our APCo triennial review, which you'll see on the waterfall today is a $0.06 catch-up of the 2017 through 2019 under earnings, positive weather on our Western jurisdictions and increased transmission revenue. These items were somewhat offset by an increase in depreciation lower normalized load and increased income taxes. Just as a reminder on O&M and depreciation, as I mentioned on last quarter's call that included in our 2022 guidance details, we have a change in accounting related to the Rockport Unit 2 lease at I&M. We're seeing approximately $0.05 of favorable O&M offset by $0.05 of unfavorable depreciation in each quarter of 2022, but no consequential earnings impact. I'll talk a little bit more on load performance, but I'll get to that here in a minute. So, bear with me. The Transmission and Distribution Utilities segment earned $0.32 per share, up $0.01 compared to last year. Favorable drivers in this segment include rate changes and positive weather in Texas and Ohio and increased transmission revenue.  Offsetting these favorable items were unfavorable O&M depreciation and income taxes. The AEP transmission Holdco segment contributed $0.33 per share flat compared to last year, favorable investment growth of $0.2 was somewhat offset by unfavorable income taxes. Generation and marketing produced $0.14 per share up $0.10 from last year. The positive variance is primarily due to higher retail margins, increased renewable wind production, higher market prices impacting generation margins and favorable income taxes. Finally, Corporate and Other was down $0.02 per share driven by unfavorable interest expense, mainly as a result of the increase in short-term debt rates and increased O&M partially offset by reduced investment losses. The reduced investment losses are largely related to charge point losses that we had in the third quarter of 2021, that have reversed this year. I'll note that we exited our position in charge point during the third quarter so a side from the year-over-year comparison, we will not have any new volatility in this particular aspect of corporate and the -- corporate and other segment relating to our direct ownership of charge point shares since the position has been liquidated. So, let's go to Slide 10, and I'll talk about our year-to-date operating earnings performance. Year-to-date operating earnings total to $4.04 per share compared to $3.76 per share in 2021. Operating earnings for vertically integrated utilities were $2.15 per share, up $0.28. Similar to the quarter, favorable drivers included rate changes across multiple jurisdictions, the resolution of the APCo triennial, positive weather in our western jurisdictions, increased transmission revenue and favorable normalized retail load. These items were somewhat offset by increased depreciation and lower off-system sales. Once again, the change in accounting around the Rockport Unit two lease results in $0.17 of favorable O&M offset by $0.17 of unfavorable depreciation.  The Transmission and Distribution Utilities segment earned $0.95 per share, up $0.10 compared to last year. Favorable drivers in this segment included rate changes in Texas and Ohio, favorable weather and increased normalized retail load and transmission revenue. Offsetting these favorable items were unfavorable O&M, property taxes and depreciation. The AEP Transmission Holdco segment contributed $0.95 per share, down $0.07 per share compared to last year. Favorable investment growth of $0. 06 was more than offset by an unfavorable true-up of $0.07 and increased income taxes. As I mentioned last quarter, this is entirely consistent with our guidance. Our 2022 guidance had this segment down by $0.08 year-over-year as a result of the investment growth being more than offset by the annual true-up that occurred last quarter and some unfavorable comparisons on the tax and financing side. Generation and Marketing produced $0.34 per share, up $0.14 from last year. The positive variance is primarily due to the sale of renewable development sites improved retail margins, increased wholesale margins and land sales in the depreciate generation segment. Finally, Corporate and other was down $0.17 per share, driven by lower investment gains, unfavorable interest and increased O&M. The lower investment gains are largely related to charge point gains that we had in 2021 that reversed this year. Turning to Slide 11. Let me provide an update on our normalized load performance for the quarter. Overall, AEP service territory has maintained significant momentum through the first three quarters of the year despite increasing headwinds impacting the macro economy. Starting in the lower right corner, normalized retail sales increased by 2.6% in the third quarter compared to last year. Once again, every operating company experienced positive year-over-year growth for the quarter. Furthermore, the growth in the commercial and industrial sales this quarter more than offset the modest decline in residential sales. For the year-to-date comparison, AEP's normalized retail sales increased by 3.1%, with growth spread across all major retail classes and operating companies. In fact, we're on pace to experience the strongest year for load growth since the mid-1990s. And that's on top of the recovery year we had last year when the load increased by 2.1%. Moving to the upper left corner, normalized residential sales decreased by 0.8% in the third quarter but remained up 0.3% through September compared to last year. For the quarter, residential accounts increased by 0.4%, but this was offset by a 1.2% decline in weather-normalized usage. This is not surprising when you consider that last year, many of our customers were receiving extra income from the fiscal stimulus that is not happening in 2022. While the results were mixed by operating company, the strongest residential growth for the quarter was at SWEPCO. Moving right, weather normalized commercial sales increased by 3.4% for the quarter and were up 3.8% for the year-to-date comparison. The growth in commercial sales was spread across nearly every operating company and eight of our top 10 commercial sectors. The fastest-growing commercial sector is data centers, where loads up 33% compared to last year for the quarter and for the year-to-date comparisons. Finally, focusing on the lower left corner, you'll see that the industrial sales posted another strong quarter, up 6% for the quarter and up 5.5% for the year-to-date comparison to last year. Industrial sales were up at nearly every operating company in most of our largest sectors. We continue to experience double-digit growth in a number of key industries this quarter, including chemicals, manufacturing and oil and gas extraction. We also saw robust growth in primary metals manufacturing, pipeline transportation, paper manufacturing and coal mining. To summarize, the AEP service territory has maintained significant momentum through the first nine months of the year despite the challenging headwinds of inflation, higher interest rates, supply chain disruptions and the labor shortage.  We know the Federal Reserve's approach to address inflation is designed to slow down the economy, which will eventually work its way through our footprint. However, I'd like to remind you that there are things that we've done and will continue to do to help mitigate the impact of slowing economic conditions in our service territory specifically, we're talking about our economic development efforts.  So, turning to Slide 12, I want to highlight how our commitment to economic development is helping to sustain load growth even in the face of challenging economic conditions. The chart on this slide illustrates why this strategy is so important to us. The blue bars on this chart show the growth in gross regional product or GRP, for the AEP service territory over the past year. So, you can see that it has been slowing over the period. In fact, for the third quarter, growth in AEP's GRP was essentially flat. However, the green bars here show that our industrial sales growth over the same period, you'll notice that they've maintained their strength, even improving 6% without the help from GRP. How does this happen? That's because of our consistent and disciplined approach to economic development over the years. A lot of the growth in industrial load that we're seeing today is a consequence of economic development projects from previous years that are coming online this year.  Examples include a large steel plant and an LNG processing facility that are now online in the AEP Texas service territory, a new chemicals plant that is now operating in Tennessee or a paper plant that is now producing in Oklahoma. And these are just a few of the many examples that we could mention. But the key takeaway here is that AEP's commitment to economic development is what is allowing us to be on track to post our strongest year for load growth in decades despite an economy that is beginning to slow down. Another key point to remember is that you cannot turn it on or off like a light switch. Economic development projects take time to materialize, and the results that we see here today are largely the result of activities that occurred years ago. By making this a key component of our strategy, AEP is helping to mitigate the impact of economic downturns on our customers, our communities and our investors. And AEP's economic development team has a proven track record of helping bring these new customers to our service territory with an emphasis on jobs and load. In fact, the AEP service territory has added over 106,000 jobs this year. So, let's move down to Slide 13, to discuss the company's capitalization and liquidity position. We're doing well in this regard. On a GAAP basis, our debt-to-capital ratio held constant from the prior quarter at 61.4%. Taking a look at the left upper quadrant on this page, you'll see our FFO to debt metric stands at 14.5% on both the Moody's and a GAAP basis, which is an increase of 1.1% and 1.2%, respectively, the prior quarter. The primary reason for the increase is attributed to the completion of the PSO securitization efforts, which increased cash from operations. As we stated on our last earnings call, we anticipated trending toward our FFO debt targeted range of 14% to 15% as the year progressed, and we currently sit comfortably within that range. You can see our liquidity summer in the lower left quadrant on the slide, our 5-year $4 billion bank revolver and our 2-year $1 billion revolving credit facility to support our liquidity position, which remains strong at $3.6 billion. On the qualified pension front, while our funding status decreased 0.3% during the quarter, it remains comfortably strong at 105.3%. Negative returns on the risk seeking and fixed income assets during the quarter were primary drivers of the funded status decrease. However, rising interest rates cause plan liability to decrease, which provided a favorable offset to the negative asset returns. So, we're in a good place in terms of funding. Let's go to Slide 14, So I can do a quick recap of today's message. The third quarter continues to provide a solid foundation for the rest of 2022 and allowed us -- at our recent Analyst Day, in narrow and raise our operating earnings guidance range to $4.97 to $5.07 with a midpoint of $5.02. As you know, AEP offers steady and predictable growth driven by our low-risk regulated business, robust electric infrastructure investment pipeline and our proven track record of managing cost pressures over time while growing our rate base. This, along with the updated 2022 load forecast we provided at our October 4 Analyst Day and the Virginia Supreme Court ruling related to APCo's 2017 to 2019 triennial review, position us to navigate headwinds, remaining this year that you would expect, such as continued inflation, interest rates, weather risks, et cetera, which is why we maintained a $0.10 range when we recently lifted and tightened our 2022 guidance range. We continue to be committed to our long-term growth rate of 6% to 7%, continued dividend growth and a strong balance sheet while we are delisting the company, focusing on the customer and actively managing the portfolio. So, we really do appreciate your time and attention today and I know you guys are super busy with the all the earnings calls. So, with that, I'm going to kick it over to the operator, so we can hear what's on your mind and take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Jeremy Tonet from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. \nJeremy Tonet: Good morning. I just wanted to pick up on one of the key themes at the Analyst Day talking about the transmission within AEP and the significant growth potential there as you see it and what appears to be a valuation disconnect with AEP stock relative to public comps and transactions. I'm just wondering if that conversation invited any reverse inquiries on your assets? I know you said these are core to you, but just kind of curious how that's developed and any other thoughts on that side you might share?\nNick Akins: Yes, I'll just follow up with the -- did I mention transmission. So I'll turn it over to Julie, who respond to that.\nJulie Sloat: Thank you, Nick. Thanks, Jeremy. Thanks for the question. Let me tell you, we've certainly got a lot of attention from our investor base. And so I'll answer it that way. So we appreciate that because that means we're doing our jobs. I think we still need to do a lot of work here to make sure that we make it easy for you all to understand what the earnings stream is in the earnings potential of that particular business. And so as we were getting ready for this call today, I'm looking at the waterfalls on Pages 9 and 10 of the presentation today. And so let me go to Page 10 just for real quickly. So the AEP Transmission Holdco, which is our pure play transmission component contributed $0.95 of the $4.04 year-to-date. And as you know, we've got more transmission and play across this waterfall too, that shows up in the vertically integrated utilities in the T&D segment. So as a swag and we'll do better with this as we go into 2023 to give you a more granular view of the transmission component in the aggregate from AEP, but assume that roughly 50% of the earnings on the vertically integrated utilities and T&D utilities is essentially the part of the 95% -- or I'm sorry, adding $0.95 to another -- let me say it in another way, I'm totally tripping over myself here. $0.95 from the AEP Transmission Holdco, essentially double that. So that's about half. So half of our earnings are coming from that particular segment. The other half is coming from vertically integrated utilities and in T&D utilities. So not insignificant when you compare that just under $2 to the 404. So we'll do better, and I'll do better explain in the stuff as we go forward in 2023, but I wanted to have that number kind of in the back of my pocket here in case you asked the question, so I'm glad you did.\nNick Akins: But the overarching theme around transmission is that with -- certainly with the movement to clean energy economy, and the focus we have on renewables being put in place, you can't put these renewables in place without additional transmission, transmission, is becoming more constrained. So it turns out to be very positive from an AEP perspective from an opportunities to really focus on not only the development of transmission, which were the largest in the country but also in terms of the renewables build-out and in fact, distribution with distributed energy resources that will drive different resource needs as well. So all in good shape from that perspective. So we feel very, very bullish about our transmission.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. That's helpful. And then just shifting gears a little bit. Rates moving up here. And so just wondering what you can say about that with regard to short-term rate moving higher and long-term debt issuance as being more expensive, just think about historic test years and lag in jurisdictions, wondering what could be done or how do you see that unfolding?\nNick Akins: Yes, Julie.\nJulie Sloat: Yes. No, thanks again for the question. We're keeping a watchful eye on that. You're absolutely right. So let me kind of compare and contrast. The short-term debt rate that we were realizing last year through the first 9 months was about 27 basis points. Today, through the first 9 months, that was about 1.46%. So a significant uptick. And so what we'll be doing is continuing to manage across the different buckets of tenor and using kind of barbell strategies to do our financings going forward. We still have a little bit of work we have yet to do this year, and that's at the parent. I mentioned that at our Analyst Day back on October 4. And we're assuming that rates would adjust to on a longer-term basis to about 5% to 6% for us. That compares to through the year-to-date rate of about 3.34%. We will and do have that embedded in our 2023 guidance, but we'll continue to work with that.  Let me give you another finer point to that what I pay attention to is how much of our debt is floating rate. We generally target somewhere between 15% and 20% of our total portfolio being floating rate. As of the end of the third quarter, we were at about 14.8%. About -- that equates to about the parent about $5. 7 billion, $1.95 billion of that being CP. So we've got a fair amount of fluctuation there, but that's already getting picked up in rates, and it's absolutely embedded in 2023 guidance. We'll have more for you to share and for your modeling efforts at the EEI conference when you get all the assumptions that we'll have behind the waterfall and details that you're typically used to seeing from us.\nOperator: And the next question will come from the line of Durgesh Chopra -- I'm sorry, from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. \nDurgesh Chopra: Good morning. Congrats on a solid quarter here. I have two questions. The first one -- just maybe can you elaborate to the extent you can, you mentioned Phase 1 of the unregulated renewable sale. Just who are the interested parties here are the strategics are these privates? Or any -- any additional color you can share there?\nNick Akins: I would certainly say that the list was robust. And all the usual suspects that you would think of and beyond. But there were a lot. And I'd say it was still generally half and half, 60-40, whatever it was of strategics and others financials. And so -- and actually, the Phase 2, we're going into a list with strategics and financials and it's a well-balanced group. One that I'm sure will hold each other accountable during the process, but we're very happy with the responses we received.\nDurgesh Chopra: Excellent. It sounds like you're making very good progress there.\nNick Akins: Yes. They'll go into the confidential rooms and all that kind of stuff and more due diligence will be done, and we'll go through the process with them. So that's just what the process is.\nJulie Sloat: And Durgesh, this is Julie. We have a 2-step bid process, and we would expect to be in a position to have a PSA signed in early 2023. With the closing in the first half of next year. I think we shared that with you on October 4. And we get the question around who is the primary regulatory authority or body that will govern this, and that's FERC, as you know.\nDurgesh Chopra: Got it. And then maybe just to pivot on to the second subpoena from SEC. Just how to read into that? What are the implications for you? I mean, does this increase the risk sort of potential?\nNick Akins: Yes. We view it as a continuing part of the process. And we said we would be transparent and we have been transparent and we'll continue to work in a positive fashion with the SEC during their investigation. And certainly, the issuance of a second subpoena is really -- they just need more information. So -- and we're going to supply it. So we're going to work with them and we'll continue doing so. So our response is essentially the same as the first one. We recognize there were governance issues we need to change relative to 501(c)4 and we made those changes. And certainly, from our perspective, we'll continue to work with them to get this thing resolved.\nOperator: The next question is from Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Bank of America.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Good morning. Congrats, Nick, Absolutely. If I can pivot still on this -- if I can continue with the last question a little bit and can ask again about this second subpoena. Just what's your understanding of the process from here on out? Again, I get that they continue to inquire here. Just -- can you elaborate a little bit further here? Again, obviously, you're complying, you're submitting documentation, but just a little bit of the sense of what you get from here out.\nNick Akins: I mean there's not much else we can say about it, obviously, because it is a process with the SEC, and it's really up to the SEC what -- how they want to continue to analyze the information, ask for new information. And typically, I guess, whenever they need new information, they'll issue new subpoena. So it's just part of the process, and it's really up to the SEC. And our only -- I mean the only control we have is to continue to cooperate very positively and respond, and we'll continue to do that.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Excellent. Okay, perfect. And then if I can, just with respect to West Virginia, can you guys talk a little bit about the fuel situation there? I mean is there an ability to leverage securitization here to address the balance there? And just to what extent can that sort of fully address that balance?\nNick Akins: Yes, Julie?\nJulie Sloat: Yes. No. Thanks for the question, Julien. And actually, as a matter of fact, that's exactly what we're contemplating. As you know, we've got a fair amount of exposure in excess of $400 million as of the end of the third quarter. of deferred fuel at West Virginia, in particular, we want to be very sensitive to customer bills. So the plan is to see what we can do around securitization of the outstanding balance and manage rates for customers. Right now, the current mechanism is we have a 12-month fuel cause to reset and account for the prior year. We're currently in hearing there, but we want to be extremely sensitive to our customer base as it relates to that particular area. So standby, we'll have more to tell you and more to share as we make some progress, but securitization is absolutely contemplated.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it right. So there's no qualification issues or needing to get clarification on legislation, right, that it should be directly applicable.\nNick Akins: That's right.\nJulie Sloat: Yes. But we do need some clarification on the legislation because it's very specific to what you're trying to securitize. So that will be a critical path for us.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Okay. So we should look for that next in terms of getting this done?\nJulie Sloat: Yes, yes, yes.\nOperator: Your next question is from Ross Fowler from UBS. Please go ahead. \nRoss Fowler: Good morning, Nick, good morning, Julie. How are you? Thank you for the quote. I very much appreciate that on this end of the phone, so.\nNick Akins: Good for you.\nRoss Fowler: So I just had a couple of questions here. I was going to ask about this peanut, but we've kind of beaten that to death. But the retail strategic computing, that's going to happen within sort of the first half of next year. Are there other businesses that sort of fit into that same sort of potential strategic category? I'm thinking about wholesale services or distributed resources. Are they core to you? Or is that something we could see in the future?\nNick Akins: Yes. So obviously, we have 3 -- I guess, 3 of the normal 4 burners already loaded. One's Kentucky, one is the contracted renewables and then the retail after that. And we have to do really a strategic review around retail because it includes some of Ohio and that kind of thing. So we need to fully understand that. And we said that we would look at other parts of the business, if it fuels the growth that we're focused on relative to transmission and the movement to a clean energy economy. And so we'll continue to do that. I don't want to -- I really don't want to position business versus another at this point. But we'll continue to look at all of our business to make sure that we are being as efficient as possible to -- as Julie always says, actively manage the portfolio to ensure that we are moving forward from a growth perspective, but also from a derisking perspective, to ensure that we are spending our capital on the right things and O&M as well. So that's probably all I'll say at this point, and I'll leave it to Julie in the future to answer those questions.\nJulie Sloat: Yes, yes. I would leave you with this thought. As it relates to on-site partners, which is our distributed energy solutions organization, and we have wholesale services as well when you look at the quadrants of our unregulated components of our total AEP business, I would submit to you that you should assume that they operate business as usual. Those are close to the customer. Those are things that we need to engage in to manage our day-to-day operations and we want to make sure that we're extracting all the intelligence we possibly can and taking care of the customer at the same time. But if there are things we can leverage to help us in the regulated envelope, we'll be doing that as well. So distributed energy solutions seems to scratch that itch. And we've gotten a lot of success and runway out of that. So business as usual. And we'll keep you apprised. Anything else that we put on deck like Nick said, we got all of our burners busy. You know what's on deck. But the point here is to get as efficient as we possibly can so that we can deliver the goods, take care of you, take care of our customer and then where we're good to go.\nRoss Fowler: Right. Fantastically. And then just maybe one more around sort of the flexibility of your capital spend. As you kind of iterated at the Analyst Day, many times you win a lot of the capital is in transmission. We've seen some other companies maybe struggle to get transmission projects on schedule given the signing and permitting issues. Is that just a large-scale transmission project issue? And do you have sort of just a lot of smaller-scale stuff you can move around in that transmission and even in the distribution bucket?\nNick Akins: Yes. So obviously, we've had the same conversation relative to [indiscernible] in Congress. We -- our transmission of large block of our transmission is transmission within our service territory. And actually, the -- just basically the nuts and bolts of making sure that we have rehabilitation of the grid, replacement of old resources. We have some transmission lines. And I just -- every time we have our subcompany Board meeting, I always comment about these 100-year old lines that come up for replacement. And we're still in the process of doing that. We've talked a lot about the amount is the sheer magnitude of AEP's transmission system and the average age being 57 years old or some number like that. And the spend that we have ongoing now just increases by a year, every year it goes by like a 57 to 56 by spending $3 billion. So really -- we have not had issues with the construction of our transmission. Now if you do a new transmission with new large-scale transmission, that's where you really get into permitting and right-of-way issues. And that's really part of the permit legislation. And then when you cross over states, obviously, the cost allocation issues occur. So -- but by and large, almost all of our transmission is really related to transmission that either already exist or within our territory that we have. We certainly have the ability to move forward with. And we also have -- and this is probably more than you asked for, but from a transmission perspective, we've increased our planning associated with that. We used to do 120% of the capital plan. Now we do 130%. And we're also looking at distribution actually to do the same thing around 120%. So those are mechanisms where we continue to be able to use bottles, we continue to be able to adjust based upon different projects being either slowed down, sped up or whatever, and we continually adjust to that because we have thousands of projects to be able to work that through. So that really drives that element of consistency around our ability to provide capital for transmission and in fact, distribution.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We will go to the line of Michael Lapides from Goldman Sachs.\nNick Akins: Looking for something from you, but go ahead.\nMichael Lapides: Big weekend coming up Alabama LSU. We got 10 days. I hope that's not what you're looking for me from because you're going to get a big role tide at none of us go to Tiger's business. Hey, couple of questions. First of all, I love Slide 41. When I'm looking at Slide 41, Nick, it's a trailing 12-month earned ROE chart. Just curious, when I think about what's embedded in 2023 guidance, which of those get materially better in '23? Which of those face even a little bit more lag in '23 than they do right now?\nNick Akins: Yes. Julie?\nJulie Sloat: Yes, yes. So Michael, what you should anticipate is movement on the PSO front. I mean we've got a little bit of momentum there. We've got the securitization taken care of now. We'll be making an application soon for a rate case. So anticipate that. We do expect over time that APCo is going to improve, too, particularly now that we've got the Virginia triennial behind us, and you're starting to see the fruits of that effort, already showing up in our waterfall slides. And then we've got activity, regulatory activity underway at SWEPCO 2. But we will give you more granular detail at the EEI conference on a company-by-company basis across the board. So stay tuned for that. But as you know, the entire objective is to move the needle and close the gap. And I would submit to you that that's how we describe another aspect of our active management. So we should be in good shape and moving in the right direction. Obviously, we're comfortable with the guidance we already put out there.\nMichael Lapides: Got it. And then speaking of APCO and the court case in Virginia, and the $37 million pretax benefit you took this quarter, how should we think about that for 2023? I mean, is that just a nonrecurring onetime or should we smooth that out over 23 quarters? I'm just trying to think about how to actually model that.\nJulie Sloat: Yes, yes. No, I love that question because fussing with that myself as we've got the good news. So yes, $0.06 that you saw in the third quarter, which is essentially like a catch-up from the under earnings from 2017 to 2019. So that's unique. So $0.06 this quarter. And I'll take it a step further. Let's go to the fourth quarter because you probably asked me about that, too. We should have about $0.01 of earnings associated with this particular outcome in the fourth quarter of 2022. So think about that when you're calibrating your model. And then for 2023, we'll have about $37 million of additional revenues from rate increases that effectively covers January of 2021 to September 2022 that in terms of what we should have been able to recognize, but we're spreading it over 16 months plus we have the going forward a benefit that starts October 2022. So what all does that mean? That means $0.06 spread across 2023, and that will be included in the waterfall guidance that we gave to you at EEI. So I hope that helps kind of in the word there for you.\nMichael Lapides: That does help. And then finally, I last thing. Can you remind us what your cash tax position will be in the coming years?\nJulie Sloat: Yes, cash tax gets really goofy with the BMT. So those numbers kind of floated all around, and we can always help you behind the scenes with modeling. But for cash tax in 2022, I want to say that the rate is something like 10.8% then go out to 2023. The way we're modeling it is just a little bit over 4%. But I would just direct you back to the GAAP annual effective tax rate. And so we're looking at the traditional 5.2% in 2022, and it pumps up a little bit to about 8.4% in 2023. And but we'll be able to give you more granular there, too, when we roll out all the backup to the 2023 guidance. Yes, the BMT -- it gets -- it almost looks geological when we're looking at some of the modeling -- I mean it works and it's accurate, but it just the rate kind of bounces all over the place from a cash perspective because you're using those tax credits.\nOperator: And at this time there are no further questions in queue. Please continue.\nDarcy Reese: Great. Thank you for joining us on today's call. As always, the IR team will be available to answer any additional questions you may have. Luis, please go ahead and give the replay information.\nOperator: Thank you.

        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Nick Akins",
            "content": "Okay, thanks, Darcy. Welcome everyone to American Electric Powers third quarter 2022 earnings call. We continue to make significant progress on our commitments, we have leveraged our scale, our financial strength, portfolio management and transition to a pure play regulated utility.  Over the past 10 years, we've had a great record of consistently exceeding our earnings projections and raising guidance, with this quarter being no exception. Today I'll provide a brief recap of the key financial highlights for the quarter, followed by updates on our Kentucky sale process, our unregulated contracted renewables portfolio sale, and the previously announced strategic review of our retail business, all of which are part of our strategy to simplify and derisk our business profile.  I will then spend time discussing our carbon emission reduction goals, in addition to our continued emphasis on regulated renewables execution, and generation fleet transformation. I'll conclude by providing insights into our other ongoing regulatory activities.  All of this summarized information can be found on slide six and seven of today's presentation with supporting details in the appendix. So, after the financials, we continue to build on our momentum delivering strong third quarter 2022, operating earnings $1.62 per share or $831 million.  Today, we are reaffirming our 2022 narrowed full year operating guidance range, as well as our newly introduced 2023 operating earnings guidance range, both of which we had announced at our recent Analyst Day.  As a reminder, we are going -- are guiding to a 2022 range of $4.97 to $5.07, with an increased midpoint of $5.02 per share, and our 2023 guidance range is $5.19 to $5.31, with a $5.29 per share midpoint. Our long term earnings growth rate guidance of 6% to 7% is underpinned by a robust $40 billion capital investment plan for 2023 to 2027, which includes $26 billion in wires and $9 billion in regulated renewables investments.  Moreover, our dividend growth is in line with our long-term growth rate and within our targeted payout ratio of 60% to 70%. We continue to derisk our platform and execute our strategy to ensure that we are best positioned for value creation in the face of global economic uncertainty and inflationary pressures. As part of this effort, we are continuing to work with states to drive reliability and resiliency in our service territory amidst customer bill considerations and other macroeconomic factors. In order to lessen the impact on our capital investment plan, we have also diversified our mix of suppliers, which has minimized customer and business supply chain disruptions to date. Later in today's call, Julie will walk through our third quarter performance drivers and share thoughts on the positive load outlook in our service territory as well as on our targeted 14% to 15% FFO to debt range. So now talking about some of the strategic reviews. True to our steadfast commitment to execution, we're in the final stretch to complete the sale of our Kentucky operations celebrity. As we previously mentioned, FERC told their approval date to December 16, and we have, therefore, signed with Liberty to plan for a January 2023 closing date. This date is keyed off of FERC's process and should give confidence to all stakeholders, including employees, customers, communities and shareholders. It also enables our transition teams to adequately and efficiently plan for the closing. While our sale time line has shifted over the past year, we are not revising our earnings guidance or any of our equity needs. We are pleased to reach this point and are confident in our ability to close the transaction shortly after the start of the new year. Related to our unregulated contracted renewals portfolio, we launched the sale process for this 1,365 megawatt portfolio in late August 2022 with strong buyer interest from both financial and strategic investors. We recently accepted bids for Phase 1 of the auction process and are proceeding into Phase II due diligence with selected bidders. We are on pace for closing for a closing date in the second quarter of 2023. Selling the portfolio will allow AEP to shift focus and rotate capital towards regulated businesses as we continue to transform our generation fleet and enhance transmission infrastructure.  As we announced earlier this month on our Analyst Day, we are pursuing a strategic review of our retail business as we adjust to how our interest in the competitive markets has changed over time. We'll keep you updated on our progress and expect to complete our review in the first half of 2023. We're always considering opportunities to enhance shareholder value, and we'll continue to evaluate potential value-additive opportunities for our regulated businesses against the backdrop of our goal to further simplify and derisk the business. Now regarding emission reduction goals, as we mentioned in the Analyst Day, AEP remains firmly grounded in our principles of resiliency, reliability and affordability, while recognizing the value of our diverse resource portfolio given today's world of energy-related volatility. We are undertaking one of the largest clean energy transformations in the country through our regulated renewable strategy, and we announced our enhanced and accelerated carbon emission reduction goals at our Analyst Day in early October, as I mentioned earlier. First, we have rebased our near-term emission reduction target of 80% by 2030 now pegged to a 2005 baseline instead of 2000. Second, we upgraded our near-term reduction target. And as such, all Scope one emissions are now included in our carbon emission reduction goals.  Lastly, we accelerated our net zero goal by five years from 2050 to 2045. We are confident in our path forward and our ability to hit key milestones in a steady and timely manner. Importantly, these goals are aligned and supported by our latest integrated resource lands that are in the various states. We will continue our planned retirement and disposition of select fossil fuel units while adding renewables to our generation portfolio. Our 1.5-gigawatt North Central wind portfolio, which became fully operational in March of this year, represents only the beginning of our clean energy fleet transition. In addition, we have 17-gigawatts of potential generation additions across different resource types within our vertically-integrated utilities over the next 10 years. Combined, this represents 18.5-gigawatts of new generation, which will significantly contribute to AEP's reduced carbon emissions profile and put us on a path to achieve net zero -- our net zero goal by 2045.  As an update, on October 19, related to SWEPCO's 999-megawatt renewables totaling $2.2 billion of investment, the Arkansas staff filed support of these resources subject to conditions. Commission orders are expected in 2023. As we look to the long term, we are committed to building a reliable and resilient grid to efficiently deliver clean energy to our customers, and we will continue to monitor new technologies that can help us close the gap to net zero, while maintaining the highly reliable and affordable delivery of energy that our customers expect. Moreover, newly passed provisions and the Inflation Reduction Act, which is foundational to our clean energy investment strategy should help bolster advancement of new carbon-free energy sources. The bill includes tax credits for technologies like clean hydrogen projection -- production and energy storage, in addition to the technology neutral tax credits for our carbon-free resources and we will continue to evaluate these resources through our integrated resource plans. With regard to our ongoing regulatory activities, our regulated ROE as of September 30, 2022, is 9.3% and continues to improve as we work through regulatory cases and continue to make strides in reducing our authorized versus actual ROE gap. In fact, as an update on SWEPCO on September 29, we filed notice to move the 88 megawatts of Turk Plant into rates in Arkansas. The full filing will occur within the November, December time frame, and we will seek a rider to place the 88-megawatt capacity in rates. With respect to our outstanding SWEPCO Louisiana rate case, we are expecting an order in the fourth quarter of 2022. We've also made notable progress on APCo's 2020 Virginia case. As many of you likely recall, we successfully appeal the triennial rate order the day following the issuance of the order in November 2020, giving confidence in our position that the order was inconsistent with Virginia statute. We are pleased that the court recently ruled in AEP's favor preserving our right to seek a retroactive adjustment in addition to the ongoing rate adjustment. Interim rates were implemented in Virginia on October First of this year. We've also actively managed the implications of increased fuel costs as we focus on maintaining a balance between cost recovery and customer impacts.  As part of this effort, our operating companies continue to work with commissions, regulators and other stakeholders to educate customers about surges and put mechanisms in place to alleviate these pressures. For example, we have 6-month and 2-month clauses in I&M and SWEPCO Louisiana respectively, to help ease the effect of longer-term fuel classes. We also -- we were also able to lengthen the months of fuel recovery in Virginia and Oklahoma and are working with our customers and commissions to make sure we recover that over a longer period of time. As you all know, this will be my last earnings call as I will be transitioning from CEO to Executive Chair on January 1, and Julie will become CEO of AEP. We're very excited to have an executive of Julie's caliber to lead our company. I'm confident in her deep knowledge of AEP as well as the emphasis she places on consistency, quality of earnings and dividends and shareholder and customer value creation that will be instrumental to AEP's continued success. I'm also confident that she has the heart to be a strong leader. I'm reminded of the lyrics of Rush's Closer to the Heart that I have always related to as a CEO, and it goes something like this. And the men and women who hold high places must be the ones who start to mold a new reality closer to the heart. The role of a CEO in the company, our communities and our country has changed during my tenure, Julie is the embodiment of the new CEO and will lead this company to even greater success. After 44 earnings call, my tenure will soon come to an end as CEO of this great company. So, I'll end this call with lyrics from a great Led Zeppelin song. And so today, my world at smiles. And song title is Merely Thank You. Julie? Yes, I'll just follow up with the -- did I mention transmission. So I'll turn it over to Julie, who respond to that. But the overarching theme around transmission is that with -- certainly with the movement to clean energy economy, and the focus we have on renewables being put in place, you can't put these renewables in place without additional transmission, transmission, is becoming more constrained. So it turns out to be very positive from an AEP perspective from an opportunities to really focus on not only the development of transmission, which were the largest in the country but also in terms of the renewables build-out and in fact, distribution with distributed energy resources that will drive different resource needs as well. So all in good shape from that perspective. So we feel very, very bullish about our transmission. Yes, Julie. I would certainly say that the list was robust. And all the usual suspects that you would think of and beyond. But there were a lot. And I'd say it was still generally half and half, 60-40, whatever it was of strategics and others financials. And so -- and actually, the Phase 2, we're going into a list with strategics and financials and it's a well-balanced group. One that I'm sure will hold each other accountable during the process, but we're very happy with the responses we received. Yes. They'll go into the confidential rooms and all that kind of stuff and more due diligence will be done, and we'll go through the process with them. So that's just what the process is. Yes. We view it as a continuing part of the process. And we said we would be transparent and we have been transparent and we'll continue to work in a positive fashion with the SEC during their investigation. And certainly, the issuance of a second subpoena is really -- they just need more information. So -- and we're going to supply it. So we're going to work with them and we'll continue doing so. So our response is essentially the same as the first one. We recognize there were governance issues we need to change relative to 501(c)4 and we made those changes. And certainly, from our perspective, we'll continue to work with them to get this thing resolved. I mean there's not much else we can say about it, obviously, because it is a process with the SEC, and it's really up to the SEC what -- how they want to continue to analyze the information, ask for new information. And typically, I guess, whenever they need new information, they'll issue new subpoena. So it's just part of the process, and it's really up to the SEC. And our only -- I mean the only control we have is to continue to cooperate very positively and respond, and we'll continue to do that. Yes, Julie? That's right. Good for you. Yes. So obviously, we have 3 -- I guess, 3 of the normal 4 burners already loaded. One's Kentucky, one is the contracted renewables and then the retail after that. And we have to do really a strategic review around retail because it includes some of Ohio and that kind of thing. So we need to fully understand that. And we said that we would look at other parts of the business, if it fuels the growth that we're focused on relative to transmission and the movement to a clean energy economy. And so we'll continue to do that. I don't want to -- I really don't want to position business versus another at this point. But we'll continue to look at all of our business to make sure that we are being as efficient as possible to -- as Julie always says, actively manage the portfolio to ensure that we are moving forward from a growth perspective, but also from a derisking perspective, to ensure that we are spending our capital on the right things and O&M as well. So that's probably all I'll say at this point, and I'll leave it to Julie in the future to answer those questions. Yes. So obviously, we've had the same conversation relative to [indiscernible] in Congress. We -- our transmission of large block of our transmission is transmission within our service territory. And actually, the -- just basically the nuts and bolts of making sure that we have rehabilitation of the grid, replacement of old resources. We have some transmission lines. And I just -- every time we have our subcompany Board meeting, I always comment about these 100-year old lines that come up for replacement. And we're still in the process of doing that. We've talked a lot about the amount is the sheer magnitude of AEP's transmission system and the average age being 57 years old or some number like that. And the spend that we have ongoing now just increases by a year, every year it goes by like a 57 to 56 by spending $3 billion. So really -- we have not had issues with the construction of our transmission. Now if you do a new transmission with new large-scale transmission, that's where you really get into permitting and right-of-way issues. And that's really part of the permit legislation. And then when you cross over states, obviously, the cost allocation issues occur. So -- but by and large, almost all of our transmission is really related to transmission that either already exist or within our territory that we have. We certainly have the ability to move forward with. And we also have -- and this is probably more than you asked for, but from a transmission perspective, we've increased our planning associated with that. We used to do 120% of the capital plan. Now we do 130%. And we're also looking at distribution actually to do the same thing around 120%. So those are mechanisms where we continue to be able to use bottles, we continue to be able to adjust based upon different projects being either slowed down, sped up or whatever, and we continually adjust to that because we have thousands of projects to be able to work that through. So that really drives that element of consistency around our ability to provide capital for transmission and in fact, distribution. Looking for something from you, but go ahead. Yes. Julie?"

            "name": "Julie Sloat",
            "content": "Oh, my goodness, Nick. Thank you. Thank you. Well, yes, all heart and all in. Absolutely, absolutely. So, thanks, everyone, for joining us today. I know you have a real busy morning with multiple companies reporting. So, we'll try to be as efficient as possible. But I'm going to walk us through the third quarter year-to-date results, share some updates on our service territory load and economy and finish with commentary on credit metrics and liquidity, as well as some thoughts on our guidance, financial targets and recap our commitments to stakeholders. So, I'm going to start on Slide eight which shows the comparison of GAAP to operating earnings. GAAP earnings for the third quarter were $1.33 per share compared to $1.59 per share in 2021. GAAP earnings through September were $3.76 per share compared to $3.90 per share in 2021. For the quarter, I'd like to mention two reconciling items. First, there's a write-off of a Virginia regulatory asset associated with previously closed coal plants. This is a result of the Virginia Supreme Court opinion that affirmed the company's original write-down of those plants in 2019 and allowed APCo to increase its Virginia rates on a going-forward basis. The other reconciling item that I'd like to mention related to the sale of Kentucky Power. You'll recall that we announced on September 30, that we'd entered into an amendment to the stock purchase agreement with Liberty that among other items resulted in a reduced purchase price. We've reflected the additional loss on the expected sale of Kentucky Power and Kentucky Transco as a non-operating cost. There's a detailed reconciliation of GAAP to operating earnings on Pages 16 and 17 of the presentation today. Let's walk through our quarterly operating earnings performance by segment on Slide nine. Operating earnings for the third quarter totaled $1.62 per share compared to $1.43 per share in 2021.  Operating earnings for the vertically-integrated utilities were $0.97 per share, up $0.10. Favorable drivers included rate changes across multiple jurisdictions, the impact of the Virginia Supreme Court ruling related to our APCo triennial review, which you'll see on the waterfall today is a $0.06 catch-up of the 2017 through 2019 under earnings, positive weather on our Western jurisdictions and increased transmission revenue. These items were somewhat offset by an increase in depreciation lower normalized load and increased income taxes. Just as a reminder on O&M and depreciation, as I mentioned on last quarter's call that included in our 2022 guidance details, we have a change in accounting related to the Rockport Unit 2 lease at I&M. We're seeing approximately $0.05 of favorable O&M offset by $0.05 of unfavorable depreciation in each quarter of 2022, but no consequential earnings impact. I'll talk a little bit more on load performance, but I'll get to that here in a minute. So, bear with me. The Transmission and Distribution Utilities segment earned $0.32 per share, up $0.01 compared to last year. Favorable drivers in this segment include rate changes and positive weather in Texas and Ohio and increased transmission revenue.  Offsetting these favorable items were unfavorable O&M depreciation and income taxes. The AEP transmission Holdco segment contributed $0.33 per share flat compared to last year, favorable investment growth of $0.2 was somewhat offset by unfavorable income taxes. Generation and marketing produced $0.14 per share up $0.10 from last year. The positive variance is primarily due to higher retail margins, increased renewable wind production, higher market prices impacting generation margins and favorable income taxes. Finally, Corporate and Other was down $0.02 per share driven by unfavorable interest expense, mainly as a result of the increase in short-term debt rates and increased O&M partially offset by reduced investment losses. The reduced investment losses are largely related to charge point losses that we had in the third quarter of 2021, that have reversed this year. I'll note that we exited our position in charge point during the third quarter so a side from the year-over-year comparison, we will not have any new volatility in this particular aspect of corporate and the -- corporate and other segment relating to our direct ownership of charge point shares since the position has been liquidated. So, let's go to Slide 10, and I'll talk about our year-to-date operating earnings performance. Year-to-date operating earnings total to $4.04 per share compared to $3.76 per share in 2021. Operating earnings for vertically integrated utilities were $2.15 per share, up $0.28. Similar to the quarter, favorable drivers included rate changes across multiple jurisdictions, the resolution of the APCo triennial, positive weather in our western jurisdictions, increased transmission revenue and favorable normalized retail load. These items were somewhat offset by increased depreciation and lower off-system sales. Once again, the change in accounting around the Rockport Unit two lease results in $0.17 of favorable O&M offset by $0.17 of unfavorable depreciation.  The Transmission and Distribution Utilities segment earned $0.95 per share, up $0.10 compared to last year. Favorable drivers in this segment included rate changes in Texas and Ohio, favorable weather and increased normalized retail load and transmission revenue. Offsetting these favorable items were unfavorable O&M, property taxes and depreciation. The AEP Transmission Holdco segment contributed $0.95 per share, down $0.07 per share compared to last year. Favorable investment growth of $0. 06 was more than offset by an unfavorable true-up of $0.07 and increased income taxes. As I mentioned last quarter, this is entirely consistent with our guidance. Our 2022 guidance had this segment down by $0.08 year-over-year as a result of the investment growth being more than offset by the annual true-up that occurred last quarter and some unfavorable comparisons on the tax and financing side. Generation and Marketing produced $0.34 per share, up $0.14 from last year. The positive variance is primarily due to the sale of renewable development sites improved retail margins, increased wholesale margins and land sales in the depreciate generation segment. Finally, Corporate and other was down $0.17 per share, driven by lower investment gains, unfavorable interest and increased O&M. The lower investment gains are largely related to charge point gains that we had in 2021 that reversed this year. Turning to Slide 11. Let me provide an update on our normalized load performance for the quarter. Overall, AEP service territory has maintained significant momentum through the first three quarters of the year despite increasing headwinds impacting the macro economy. Starting in the lower right corner, normalized retail sales increased by 2.6% in the third quarter compared to last year. Once again, every operating company experienced positive year-over-year growth for the quarter. Furthermore, the growth in the commercial and industrial sales this quarter more than offset the modest decline in residential sales. For the year-to-date comparison, AEP's normalized retail sales increased by 3.1%, with growth spread across all major retail classes and operating companies. In fact, we're on pace to experience the strongest year for load growth since the mid-1990s. And that's on top of the recovery year we had last year when the load increased by 2.1%. Moving to the upper left corner, normalized residential sales decreased by 0.8% in the third quarter but remained up 0.3% through September compared to last year. For the quarter, residential accounts increased by 0.4%, but this was offset by a 1.2% decline in weather-normalized usage. This is not surprising when you consider that last year, many of our customers were receiving extra income from the fiscal stimulus that is not happening in 2022. While the results were mixed by operating company, the strongest residential growth for the quarter was at SWEPCO. Moving right, weather normalized commercial sales increased by 3.4% for the quarter and were up 3.8% for the year-to-date comparison. The growth in commercial sales was spread across nearly every operating company and eight of our top 10 commercial sectors. The fastest-growing commercial sector is data centers, where loads up 33% compared to last year for the quarter and for the year-to-date comparisons. Finally, focusing on the lower left corner, you'll see that the industrial sales posted another strong quarter, up 6% for the quarter and up 5.5% for the year-to-date comparison to last year. Industrial sales were up at nearly every operating company in most of our largest sectors. We continue to experience double-digit growth in a number of key industries this quarter, including chemicals, manufacturing and oil and gas extraction. We also saw robust growth in primary metals manufacturing, pipeline transportation, paper manufacturing and coal mining. To summarize, the AEP service territory has maintained significant momentum through the first nine months of the year despite the challenging headwinds of inflation, higher interest rates, supply chain disruptions and the labor shortage.  We know the Federal Reserve's approach to address inflation is designed to slow down the economy, which will eventually work its way through our footprint. However, I'd like to remind you that there are things that we've done and will continue to do to help mitigate the impact of slowing economic conditions in our service territory specifically, we're talking about our economic development efforts.  So, turning to Slide 12, I want to highlight how our commitment to economic development is helping to sustain load growth even in the face of challenging economic conditions. The chart on this slide illustrates why this strategy is so important to us. The blue bars on this chart show the growth in gross regional product or GRP, for the AEP service territory over the past year. So, you can see that it has been slowing over the period. In fact, for the third quarter, growth in AEP's GRP was essentially flat. However, the green bars here show that our industrial sales growth over the same period, you'll notice that they've maintained their strength, even improving 6% without the help from GRP. How does this happen? That's because of our consistent and disciplined approach to economic development over the years. A lot of the growth in industrial load that we're seeing today is a consequence of economic development projects from previous years that are coming online this year.  Examples include a large steel plant and an LNG processing facility that are now online in the AEP Texas service territory, a new chemicals plant that is now operating in Tennessee or a paper plant that is now producing in Oklahoma. And these are just a few of the many examples that we could mention. But the key takeaway here is that AEP's commitment to economic development is what is allowing us to be on track to post our strongest year for load growth in decades despite an economy that is beginning to slow down. Another key point to remember is that you cannot turn it on or off like a light switch. Economic development projects take time to materialize, and the results that we see here today are largely the result of activities that occurred years ago. By making this a key component of our strategy, AEP is helping to mitigate the impact of economic downturns on our customers, our communities and our investors. And AEP's economic development team has a proven track record of helping bring these new customers to our service territory with an emphasis on jobs and load. In fact, the AEP service territory has added over 106,000 jobs this year. So, let's move down to Slide 13, to discuss the company's capitalization and liquidity position. We're doing well in this regard. On a GAAP basis, our debt-to-capital ratio held constant from the prior quarter at 61.4%. Taking a look at the left upper quadrant on this page, you'll see our FFO to debt metric stands at 14.5% on both the Moody's and a GAAP basis, which is an increase of 1.1% and 1.2%, respectively, the prior quarter. The primary reason for the increase is attributed to the completion of the PSO securitization efforts, which increased cash from operations. As we stated on our last earnings call, we anticipated trending toward our FFO debt targeted range of 14% to 15% as the year progressed, and we currently sit comfortably within that range. You can see our liquidity summer in the lower left quadrant on the slide, our 5-year $4 billion bank revolver and our 2-year $1 billion revolving credit facility to support our liquidity position, which remains strong at $3.6 billion. On the qualified pension front, while our funding status decreased 0.3% during the quarter, it remains comfortably strong at 105.3%. Negative returns on the risk seeking and fixed income assets during the quarter were primary drivers of the funded status decrease. However, rising interest rates cause plan liability to decrease, which provided a favorable offset to the negative asset returns. So, we're in a good place in terms of funding. Let's go to Slide 14, So I can do a quick recap of today's message. The third quarter continues to provide a solid foundation for the rest of 2022 and allowed us -- at our recent Analyst Day, in narrow and raise our operating earnings guidance range to $4.97 to $5.07 with a midpoint of $5.02. As you know, AEP offers steady and predictable growth driven by our low-risk regulated business, robust electric infrastructure investment pipeline and our proven track record of managing cost pressures over time while growing our rate base. This, along with the updated 2022 load forecast we provided at our October 4 Analyst Day and the Virginia Supreme Court ruling related to APCo's 2017 to 2019 triennial review, position us to navigate headwinds, remaining this year that you would expect, such as continued inflation, interest rates, weather risks, et cetera, which is why we maintained a $0.10 range when we recently lifted and tightened our 2022 guidance range. We continue to be committed to our long-term growth rate of 6% to 7%, continued dividend growth and a strong balance sheet while we are delisting the company, focusing on the customer and actively managing the portfolio. So, we really do appreciate your time and attention today and I know you guys are super busy with the all the earnings calls. So, with that, I'm going to kick it over to the operator, so we can hear what's on your mind and take your questions. Thank you, Nick. Thanks, Jeremy. Thanks for the question. Let me tell you, we've certainly got a lot of attention from our investor base. And so I'll answer it that way. So we appreciate that because that means we're doing our jobs. I think we still need to do a lot of work here to make sure that we make it easy for you all to understand what the earnings stream is in the earnings potential of that particular business. And so as we were getting ready for this call today, I'm looking at the waterfalls on Pages 9 and 10 of the presentation today. And so let me go to Page 10 just for real quickly. So the AEP Transmission Holdco, which is our pure play transmission component contributed $0.95 of the $4.04 year-to-date. And as you know, we've got more transmission and play across this waterfall too, that shows up in the vertically integrated utilities in the T&D segment. So as a swag and we'll do better with this as we go into 2023 to give you a more granular view of the transmission component in the aggregate from AEP, but assume that roughly 50% of the earnings on the vertically integrated utilities and T&D utilities is essentially the part of the 95% -- or I'm sorry, adding $0.95 to another -- let me say it in another way, I'm totally tripping over myself here. $0.95 from the AEP Transmission Holdco, essentially double that. So that's about half. So half of our earnings are coming from that particular segment. The other half is coming from vertically integrated utilities and in T&D utilities. So not insignificant when you compare that just under $2 to the 404. So we'll do better, and I'll do better explain in the stuff as we go forward in 2023, but I wanted to have that number kind of in the back of my pocket here in case you asked the question, so I'm glad you did. Yes. No, thanks again for the question. We're keeping a watchful eye on that. You're absolutely right. So let me kind of compare and contrast. The short-term debt rate that we were realizing last year through the first 9 months was about 27 basis points. Today, through the first 9 months, that was about 1.46%. So a significant uptick. And so what we'll be doing is continuing to manage across the different buckets of tenor and using kind of barbell strategies to do our financings going forward. We still have a little bit of work we have yet to do this year, and that's at the parent. I mentioned that at our Analyst Day back on October 4. And we're assuming that rates would adjust to on a longer-term basis to about 5% to 6% for us. That compares to through the year-to-date rate of about 3.34%. We will and do have that embedded in our 2023 guidance, but we'll continue to work with that.  Let me give you another finer point to that what I pay attention to is how much of our debt is floating rate. We generally target somewhere between 15% and 20% of our total portfolio being floating rate. As of the end of the third quarter, we were at about 14.8%. About -- that equates to about the parent about $5. 7 billion, $1.95 billion of that being CP. So we've got a fair amount of fluctuation there, but that's already getting picked up in rates, and it's absolutely embedded in 2023 guidance. We'll have more for you to share and for your modeling efforts at the EEI conference when you get all the assumptions that we'll have behind the waterfall and details that you're typically used to seeing from us. And Durgesh, this is Julie. We have a 2-step bid process, and we would expect to be in a position to have a PSA signed in early 2023. With the closing in the first half of next year. I think we shared that with you on October 4. And we get the question around who is the primary regulatory authority or body that will govern this, and that's FERC, as you know. Yes. No. Thanks for the question, Julien. And actually, as a matter of fact, that's exactly what we're contemplating. As you know, we've got a fair amount of exposure in excess of $400 million as of the end of the third quarter. of deferred fuel at West Virginia, in particular, we want to be very sensitive to customer bills. So the plan is to see what we can do around securitization of the outstanding balance and manage rates for customers. Right now, the current mechanism is we have a 12-month fuel cause to reset and account for the prior year. We're currently in hearing there, but we want to be extremely sensitive to our customer base as it relates to that particular area. So standby, we'll have more to tell you and more to share as we make some progress, but securitization is absolutely contemplated. Yes. But we do need some clarification on the legislation because it's very specific to what you're trying to securitize. So that will be a critical path for us. Yes, yes, yes. Yes, yes. I would leave you with this thought. As it relates to on-site partners, which is our distributed energy solutions organization, and we have wholesale services as well when you look at the quadrants of our unregulated components of our total AEP business, I would submit to you that you should assume that they operate business as usual. Those are close to the customer. Those are things that we need to engage in to manage our day-to-day operations and we want to make sure that we're extracting all the intelligence we possibly can and taking care of the customer at the same time. But if there are things we can leverage to help us in the regulated envelope, we'll be doing that as well. So distributed energy solutions seems to scratch that itch. And we've gotten a lot of success and runway out of that. So business as usual. And we'll keep you apprised. Anything else that we put on deck like Nick said, we got all of our burners busy. You know what's on deck. But the point here is to get as efficient as we possibly can so that we can deliver the goods, take care of you, take care of our customer and then where we're good to go. Yes, yes. So Michael, what you should anticipate is movement on the PSO front. I mean we've got a little bit of momentum there. We've got the securitization taken care of now. We'll be making an application soon for a rate case. So anticipate that. We do expect over time that APCo is going to improve, too, particularly now that we've got the Virginia triennial behind us, and you're starting to see the fruits of that effort, already showing up in our waterfall slides. And then we've got activity, regulatory activity underway at SWEPCO 2. But we will give you more granular detail at the EEI conference on a company-by-company basis across the board. So stay tuned for that. But as you know, the entire objective is to move the needle and close the gap. And I would submit to you that that's how we describe another aspect of our active management. So we should be in good shape and moving in the right direction. Obviously, we're comfortable with the guidance we already put out there. Yes, yes. No, I love that question because fussing with that myself as we've got the good news. So yes, $0.06 that you saw in the third quarter, which is essentially like a catch-up from the under earnings from 2017 to 2019. So that's unique. So $0.06 this quarter. And I'll take it a step further. Let's go to the fourth quarter because you probably asked me about that, too. We should have about $0.01 of earnings associated with this particular outcome in the fourth quarter of 2022. So think about that when you're calibrating your model. And then for 2023, we'll have about $37 million of additional revenues from rate increases that effectively covers January of 2021 to September 2022 that in terms of what we should have been able to recognize, but we're spreading it over 16 months plus we have the going forward a benefit that starts October 2022. So what all does that mean? That means $0.06 spread across 2023, and that will be included in the waterfall guidance that we gave to you at EEI. So I hope that helps kind of in the word there for you. Yes, cash tax gets really goofy with the BMT. So those numbers kind of floated all around, and we can always help you behind the scenes with modeling. But for cash tax in 2022, I want to say that the rate is something like 10.8% then go out to 2023. The way we're modeling it is just a little bit over 4%. But I would just direct you back to the GAAP annual effective tax rate. And so we're looking at the traditional 5.2% in 2022, and it pumps up a little bit to about 8.4% in 2023. And but we'll be able to give you more granular there, too, when we roll out all the backup to the 2023 guidance. Yes, the BMT -- it gets -- it almost looks geological when we're looking at some of the modeling -- I mean it works and it's accurate, but it just the rate kind of bounces all over the place from a cash perspective because you're using those tax credits."

There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements. Please refer to our SEC filings for a discussion of these factors. Joining me this morning for opening remarks are Nick Akins, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Julie Sloat, our Chief Financial Officer. We will take your questions following their remarks. I will now turn the call over to Nick.\nNick Akins: Okay. Thanks Darcy. Welcome everyone to American Electric Power's second quarter 2022 earnings call. AEP continues to make progress on the strategic initiatives we announced earlier this year with strong execution against our plan resulting in another solid quarter. Later in the call Julie will walk you through our second quarter performance drivers including the strong load increases we're experiencing in our territory, as well as provide additional details surrounding our financial position. But I'll start with the key financial highlights for the quarter. We'll then move to an update on our Kentucky operations sale process and timeline. I will also spend time discussing the progress we are making in our transition to a clean energy future as we simplify and derisk our business profile by divesting unregulated renewable assets while maintaining focus on our responsible generation fleet transformation and regulated renewables execution. I will close by providing some additional insights into our ongoing regulatory activities including our transmission business. We are very pleased with our positive momentum this quarter, delivering operating earnings of $1.20 per share or $618 million. We are moving full speed ahead towards the increased operating earnings guidance range and long-term earnings growth rate we provided during our fourth quarter 2021 earnings call and we are reaffirming both financial targets this quarter. As a reminder we are guiding to an operating earnings guidance range of $4.87 to $5.07 per share for 2022 with a $4.97 midpoint and a long-term earnings growth rate of 6% to 7%. We are also continuing to ensure we are best positioned for value creation as we navigate the macro trends impacting our industry and the broader economy. We are working with states to drive expansion in our service territory while considering global economic uncertainty inflationary pressures and of course customer bills. We're also diversifying our mix of suppliers to minimize supply chain disruptions for our customers in business while also lessening the impact on our capital investment plan. We know that timing of the closing of the sale of Kentucky Power and AEP Kentucky Transco to Liberty as top of mind, and we have been working with Liberty to obtain the approvals necessary for closing this summer. A regulatory timeline of the sale can be found on slide seven of today's presentation. We are pleased to report the Kentucky Commission approved the key milestone in the transaction with an order approving the sales transfer in early May. As we have discussed previously a prerequisite in our contract of Liberty for closing the sale is approving the approval of new Mitchell operating agreements by both the Kentucky Public Service Commission and the West Virginia Public Service Commission. While we receive the related Mitchell orders from the Kentucky Commission on May 3 and the West Virginia Commission on July 1, the two states approved the operating agreement with different formats and some divergent post 2028 plant provisions. However, through the two proceedings, both commissions have indicated an ability to use the existing agreement as a basis to operate the plant going forward and accomplish their differing expectations for investment in operations. For that reason, on July 11, we made a compliance filing in West Virginia, and filed an update with Kentucky, providing an alternative way to move forward with Mitchell operations in the near term. We inform both commissions that we will operate under the existing agreement and manage the new operational focus of the two commissions through the operating committee. In the absence of any new agreements, the existing Mitchell operating agreement is still in effect and we believe, no additional regulatory approvals should be required. Since regulatory approval of the new Mitchell operating agreements is a prerequisite in our contract with Liberty for the closing. In the absence of such proposal, we are working with Liberty on the commercial solution for Mitchell-related operations and both parties remain optimistic about reaching a resolution and closing the transaction. At this time, the only regulatory matter currently pending is the 203 application at FERC related to the cell transfer, which FERC is currently considering. We are in the final stages of the Kentucky operations sale process and expect to close this summer. Moving to our unregulated renewable portfolio, in May, we closed on the sale of five unregulated development sites located in the Southwest Power Pool area, marking the successful divestiture of the majority of our wind and solar development assets. As we mentioned last quarter, we have also signed an agreement to sell a solar development site in Ohio, with that transition close expected also in the third quarter. In addition, we are in discussions with an interested party sale of our Flat Ridge II Wind Farm ownership, consisting of 235 megawatts, simplifying the resulting portfolio for our upcoming auctions. These milestones demonstrate our commitment to continued execution. As we announced during our fourth quarter earnings call in February, we are selling our unregulated contracted renewables portfolio in order to simplify and derisk the company and facilitate investment in our regulated businesses. We are in the final stages of preparation of the marketing materials for the auction and expect an official launch of the process no later than early September. After the removal Flat Ridge II, the portfolio consists of 1,365 megawatts of contracted renewable assets, consisting of 1,200 megawatts of wind and 165 megawatts of solar, geographically diversified throughout the US. There has been robust, inbound interest in the portfolio and we expect the process to proceed quickly. As a reminder, utilization of contracted renewable sale proceeds is not yet reflected in our multiyear financing plan. We remain focused on maximizing transaction proceeds and directing additional capital to our regulated businesses, where we have meaningful pipeline of investment opportunities to better serve our customers, as we push toward a clean energy future and enhanced transmission infrastructure. As always, we are open-minded and we'll evaluate all value-additive potential activities, as we focus on our regulated businesses, where we see meaningful long-term opportunities for growth. AEP continues to make significant progress in our transition to clean energy resources through our regulated renewables execution. Details regarding the specific actions we are taking can be found on slides eight and nine in today's presentation. We are also firmly grounded in our principles of resiliency, reliability and affordability while recognizing the increasing value of our diverse resource portfolio against the backdrop of energy-related volatility. SWEPCO is taking steps to secure renewable resources, making regulatory filings in May in Arkansas, Louisiana and Texas to own three renewable turnkey projects totaling 999 megawatts. This $2.2 billion investment is currently reflected in our five-year $38 billion capital plan. SWEPCO expects to issue another RFP in the near term consistent with its RFP for energy and capacity needs. APCo's 409 megawatts of owned solar and wind resources were approved by West Virginia and Virginia, marking an $841 million capital investment that is also included in our current capital plan. Request for a proposal are in process in APCo, O&M and PSO with expected in-service dates in the year-end 2024 and 2025 timeframe. We also expect to make regulatory filings to acquire additional renewable resources prior to year-end 2022. Finally the US Supreme Court ruling at the end of June related to the federal EPA\u00e2\u0080\u0099s regulation of greenhouse gas emissions will not require any changes to AEP's current generation and compliance planning. Our generation fleet transformation plans are well on track. We remain fully committed to our target of an 80% carbon reduction emission -- emission reduction rate by 2030 and net zero by 2050 and we are proud of the work well underway at AEP to help us achieve this goal. Reaching these targets is foundational to our long-term strategy and we believe we are on the right path toward prioritizing regulated investment opportunities and transitioning our generation fleet. Turning now to a brief update on our regulatory activity. Our regulated ROE as of the end of June 2022 is 9.2%. We continue to work through regulatory cases and maintain our focus on reducing our authorized versus actual ROE spreads. Additional regulatory activity in the quarter included a commission order received in May on SWEPCO's Arkansas rate case, including a 9.5% ROE, marking a net revenue increase of $28 million and a capital structure of 55% debt to 45% equity. We are also expecting a decision on SWEPCO's losing out a rate case in the third quarter. Oral arguments related to APCo's 2020 Virginia base case were held in March 2022 at the Virginia Supreme Court, with an anticipated final decision later this year. FERC recently initiated several rule-making proceedings related to transmission planning, cost allocation, generation interconnection to the transmission grid and extreme weather preparedness. We support the commission in these actions and are in full support -- full agreement that that reform is needed to build the infrastructure necessary to transition our generation fleet in the most efficient and cost-effective way possible, while also helping achieve our carbon reduction goals. These proposed rules align with AEP\u00e2\u0080\u0099s objectives of developing a more robust, reliable and flexible grid of the future that ultimately reduces cost to customers and strengthens economic development in our communities. Before I turn it over to Julie, I want to take a moment to thank our team for the incredible work that they are doing as we execute against our strategic objectives and deliver for our stakeholders. What's going on today at AEP is a perfect blend of the execution of Bachman\u00e2\u0080\u0093Turner Overdrive\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \"Takin' Care Of Business\" with the edge of Prince\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \"Let's Go Crazy\" in a good sense, of course. We have an incredible market position, a bold mission and the foundation in place to achieve our goals to deliver on our vision of further modernizing our energy grid in order to supply reliable, cleaner, low-cost resources for all the communities serve. As we think about the future and the next chapter of AEP, we're excited to share more about our plans at AEP's upcoming Analyst Day on October 4 in New York City. We will provide additional detail soon and look forward to seeing you there. Julie, over to you. \nJulie Sloat: Thanks, Nick. Thanks, Darcy. It's good to be with everyone this morning. Good morning and thanks for dialing in. I'm going to walk us through our second quarter and year-to-date results, share some updates on our service territory load, and finish with commentary on our credit metrics and liquidity as well as some thoughts on our guidance, financial targets, and then recap our current portfolio management activities underway. So let's go to slide 10 which shows the comparison of GAAP to operating earnings. GAAP earnings for the second quarter were $1.02 per share compared to $1.16 per share in 2021. GAAP earnings through June were $2.43 per share compared to $2.31 per share in 2021. There's a detailed reconciliation of GAAP to operating earnings on pages 18 and 19 of the presentation today, but I'd like to call out three of the reconciling items that do not affect operating earnings, but relate to our asset optimization activities underway. Specifically, you'll see that we made an adjustment to arrive at our operating for the quarter and year-to-date periods consisting of Kentucky sale costs and the write-off of one of the unregulated universal scale wind projects that's included in the portfolio. We're in the process of preparing for sale. The Kentucky sale charge reflects an anticipated reduction in the sales price as we work with Liberty to accommodate adjustments for costs that have been identified through the regulatory approvals that we've received. Turning to the renewable investment write-off the Flat Ridge 2 projects specifically has continued to see deteriorating performance due to equipment issues and transmission congestions to avoid another otherwise necessary repowering investment to address the performance issue and complicate our portfolio sales process. We elected to write-off the equity investments are in discussions with an interested party for the sale of ownership interest in Flat Ridge 2. Consequently, this will remove the Flat Ridge 2 project from the portfolio we're preparing for auction, which should help improve the valuation opportunity as investors engage in the sales process, which is scheduled to launch no later than early September. Lastly, I'll mention that we monetize some mineral rights which give rise to a benefit to GAAP, but non-operating earnings, which helps offset the charges I just mentioned. So while I would typically not spend time walking through the GAAP to operating reconciliation, I thought it was appropriate at this time given the milestones we're clearing on the asset optimization front. And while these charges and gains are things that we need to recognize they are entirely driven by our efforts derisk, simplify and bring cash in the door to support our continued investment in the regulated business. So with that let's go to slide number 11 and walk through our quarterly operating earnings performance. Operating earnings for the second quarter totaled $1.20 per share or $618 million compared to $1.18 million per share or $590 million in 2021. Operating earnings for vertically integrated utilities were $0.59 per share up $0.14. Favorable drivers included rate changes across multiple jurisdictions, positive weather primarily in our western jurisdictions, increased transmission revenue and normalized retail load and income taxes. These items were somewhat offset by increased depreciation in O&M and lower off-system sales. Just as a reminder on the O&M and depreciation front, as I mentioned on the first quarter call and included in our 2022 guidance details because of a change in accounting related to the Rockport Unit 2 lease at I&M, we're seeing approximately $0.05 of favorable O&M offset by $0.05 of unfavorable depreciation in each quarter of 2022, but no consequential earnings impact. And so I'll have a little more to share on loan performance and I'll get to that in a minute here. So just hang with me. The Transmission and Distribution Utilities segment earned $0.32 per share, up $0.01 compared to last year. Favorable drivers in this segment included rate changes, load, positive weather in Texas and Ohio and increased transmission revenue. Offsetting these favorable items were unfavorable O&M and depreciation. AEP Transmission Holdco segment contributed $0.27 per share, down $0.07 compared to last year, favorable investment growth of $0.03 was more than offset by an unfavorable true-up of $0.07. As I mentioned last quarter, this is consistent with our guidance. Our 2022 guidance had this segment down by $0.08 year-over-year as a result of the $0.12 of investment growth being more than offset by the annual true-up that occurred this quarter and some favorable on comparisons on the tax and financing side. This segment continues to be an important part of our 6% to 7% EPS growth as you well know. Generation and Marketing produced $0.18 per share, up $0.09 from last year. The positive variance is primarily due to the sale of renewable development sites as well as increased generation margins and land sales. Finally, Corporate and Other was down $0.15 per share driven by lower investment gains increased income taxes and unfavorable interest. The lower investment gains are largely related to charge point gains that we had in the second quarter of 2021 that have reversed this year. The increased income taxes are related to the reduction of a consolidating tax adjustment at the parent. Let's turn to Slide 12 and our year-to-date operating earnings performance. Year-to-date operating earnings totaled $2.42 per share or $1.234 billion, compared to $2.33 per share or $1.160 billion in 2021. Operating earnings for the vertically integrated utilities were $1.18 per share, up $0.18. Similar to the quarter, favorable drivers included rate changes across multiple jurisdictions, positive weather mainly in our western jurisdictions, increased transmission revenue and normalized retail load and income taxes. These items were somewhat offset by increased depreciation and lower off-system sales. Once again the change in accounting around the Rockport Unit 2 lease results in $0.11 of favorable O&M offset by $0.11 of favorable -- unfavorable depreciation. The Transmission & Distribution Utilities segment earned $0.62 per share, up $0.08 compared to last year. Favorable drivers in this segment included rate changes in Texas and Ohio and increased normalized retail load and transmission revenue. Offsetting these favorable items were unfavorable O&M and depreciation. AEP Transmission Holdco segment $0.62 per share down $0.06 compared to last year. Favorable investment growth of $0.05 was more than offset by unfavorable true-up of $0.07 and increased property taxes. The Generation & Marketing segment produced $0.21 per share, up $0.05 from last year. The positive variance is primarily due to the sale of renewable development sites and increased wholesale margins offset by lower retail margins. Finally, Corporate and Other was down $0.16 per share driven by lower investment gains, unfavorable interest and increased O&M. The lower investment gains again are largely related to charge point gains that we had in 2021 that have reversed this year. Turning to Slide 13. I'm going to provide an update on our normalized load and performance for the quarter. And in general sense the AEP service territory has made significant momentum despite the well-publicized headwinds impacting the macro economy. Starting in the upper left corner, normalized residential sales increased by 1.2% in the second quarter and were up 1% year-to-date compared to 2021. This growth was comprised of growth in both customer counts and weather-normalized usage for both comparisons. While the results were mixed by operating the strongest residential growth was in the AEP Texas service territory, which consistently has the strongest customer growth across the AEP system due to favorable demographics. Moving to the right. Weather normalized commercial sales were up 4.1% compared to last year for both the quarter and year-to-date comparison. This consistent growth in 2022 is spread throughout the service territory. The growth in the commercial sales segment was spread across every operating company and nine of our 10 commercial sectors the only top commercial sector that is down versus last year's hospitals, which makes sense given that hospitalizations have dropped earlier in the pandemic. On the flip side, the fastest growing commercial sector is data centers were loaded up 32% compared to last year. Finally, focusing on the lower left corner, you see that industrial sales posted another strong quarter up 5% for the quarter, and up 5.3% year-to-date compared to last year. Industrial sales were up at every operating company in most of our largest sectors. We experienced double-digit growth in a number of key industries this quarter, including chemicals manufacturing and oil and gas extraction. We also saw robust growth in primary metals manufacturing, paper manufacturing, petroleum products, and coal mining. To summarize, we've experienced broad-based growth throughout the service territory on top of a recovery year. Every operating company has increased its sales in 2022 compared to last year. Growth is also consistent across every major retail class and most of the top commercial and industrial sectors served by AEP. We know the headlines are full of messages about a pending recession, but our sales statistics through the first half of the year show our service territory is still firmly in the expansion phase of the business cycle. We're mindful of the difficult monetary policy decisions being contemplated by the Federal Reserve to address inflationary pressures in the economy and recognize some of these decisions could impact our customer's growth opportunities going forward. But so far we're seeing little evidence that has dampened the economic activity within our footprint through the first two quarters of this year. Moving to slide 14, I want to provide additional context to the load we experience \u00e2\u0080\u0093 we've experienced so far in 2022, and how it compares to our pre-pandemic sales levels. Starting with the chart on the left, the bars show how the second quarter sales compared to the pre-pandemic baseline in the second quarter of 2019. You'll notice that, the total retail sales are 3.6% above pre-pandemic levels. Furthermore, every class is showing higher sales than before the pandemic began. This means that every class is fully recovered and is in the expansion phase of the business cycle. The chart on the right shows the same comparisons for the year-to-date period. You'll notice that, while the numbers are slightly different the message is the same. Through June AEP's normalized sales are 2% above the pre-pandemic levels. And just like the quarter, every class has exceeded pre-pandemic levels on a year-to-date basis. Last year's strong growth numbers were expected considering it was a recovery year from the pandemic shutdowns. This year's growth is perhaps even more impressive considering, the growth as compared to a strong recovery year. We'll continue to monitor the economy and its impact on our load over the summer months and we'll provide the results of our updated load forecast this fall. So let's move on to slide 15 to discuss the company's capitalization and liquidity position. On a GAAP basis, our debt-to-capital ratio decreased 0.1% from the prior quarter to 61.4%. Taking a look at the upper right quadrant on this page, you'll see that our FFO to debt metric stands at 13.4% on a Moody's basis, and 13.3% on a GAAP basis, which is a decrease of 0.3% and 0.4% respectively from the prior quarter. The slight decrease can be attributed to an increase in deferred fuel balances, as well as a slight increase in balance sheet debt. As we stated on our last earnings call, we anticipate trending toward our targeted FFO to debt range of 14% to 15% as the year progresses. You can see our liquidity summary on the lower right of the slide our five-year $4 billion bank revolver and our two-year $1 billion revolving credit facility support our liquidity position, which remains strong at $4.7 billion. On the qualified pension front, while our funding status decreased 0.8% during the quarter, it remains comfortably strong at 105.6%. Negative returns on risk seeking and fixed income assets during the quarter were the primary drivers of the funded status decrease. However rising interest rates caused plan liabilities to decrease which provided a favorable offset to the negative asset returns.  So, let's go to Slide 16 for a quick recap of today's message. The second quarter has provided a solid foundation for the rest of 2022 and we are reaffirming our operating earnings guidance range of $4.87 to $5.07. We continue to be committed to our long-term growth rate of 6% to 7%. We continue to work through the Kentucky Power sale to Liberty and are on-track for a closing later this summer and we'll be launching the auction process for our unregulated contracted renewables business, no later than early September.  So, before I hand things over to the operator, I'd like to mention one thing. We had previously announced that we would be having an investor conference this year and we've set a date for that. As Nick mentioned we'll be hosting at our investor conference in New York City on October 4. So, we really do appreciate your time and attention today. With that I'm going to ask the operator to open the call so we can hear what's on your mind and take any questions that you have. \nOperator:  We'll first go to the line of Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Go ahead.\nNick Akins: Good morning, Jeremy.\nJeremy Tonet: Just wanted to start off with load growth trends if I could. Just want to confirm here the full year load growth estimates have not been updated for year-to-date actuals or is there any reason to expect to fall off in the back half year?\nJulia Sloat: That is correct. We have not updated anything yet. We are cautiously optimistic. We'll give you an updated view as we get closer to our Analyst Day or at our Analyst Day on October 4. So, stand by for that. As far as what you can expect for the second half, you know if I look at for example the residential load, obviously talk of recession and how inflation is outpacing wage growth could potentially have residential customers shift in their behavior a little bit. We'll see.  So we're \u00e2\u0080\u0093 again, we're cautiously optimistic there, but we do expect that it could be a little bit tempered on this particular customer segment by inflation energy cost, mortgage rates the lack of new stimulus those things that everybody knows about. So no surprise there but just general trends. So we're going to continue to keep a close eye on that particular segment.  On the Commercial segment, I mentioned earlier that we had great performance in nine of the top sectors -- of our 10 top sectors with hospitals being the only one that was down. Again, we're keeping an eye on things like inflation, labor shortages, supply chain and borrowing costs. But again, at this point we don't have a reason to shift away and things continue to click along there.  And similar on the industrial side, we see a lot of large customer expansions that are expected to come online throughout the rest of the year, which should support the momentum, but at the end we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re cautiously optimistic because we know that the federal reserve has a big job in front of it and it has to tap the brakes. So, we'll see how that ultimately impacts all of these. But so far, we're in a really good place a really good place. So hang tight and we'll be able to give you a little more granular view in terms of our expectations when we come to you this fall. \nNick Akins: We said, we told you I guess, it's probably a quarter or two ago, about reinforcing our service territory particularly, as it relates to energy and as it relates to onshoring. And our \u00e2\u0080\u0093 certainly, our territory has been very strong in terms of both of those categories manufacturing as well. And that's clearly, become a benefit for us. So -- and really when you think about what's going on in the world today, associated with security aspects, that's really going to drive more towards the ability for onshoring to occur and certainly, for energy security. So it bodes well for our territory. \nJeremy Tonet: Got it. That's, great to hear there. And just want to pick up with -- I guess, we'll hear more details at the Analyst Day on these points with lower growth but also wanted to see what else, we might expect to hear at the Analyst Day. I suspect, the sales processes will get some more color there but is there anything else we should be looking for at the Analyst Day? \nNick Akins: Yes. There's \u00e2\u0080\u0093 actually, you have the sales process. Obviously, everybody want to know about Kentucky, but also the unregulated contracted renewables there will be new data points on that as well. And then of course, a 2022 earnings guidance update, 2023 guidance range will be introduced and also we'll probably roll forward the five year capital and financing plans through 2027 and there could be other things too. So we will hold that till October 4. \nJeremy Tonet: Got it. We'll wait for that. And just the last one, if I could. Any thoughts on the renewable sale whether it makes more sense to do as an entire pack \u00e2\u0080\u0093 package or in pieces I realize it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very early stages here, but just wondering if there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s any process share on that. \nNick Akins: Yes. The team is working at that. And certainly, I think the base case would be to sell all at one time. But if there are opportunities exist to stage that out with the capital needs, that would great. so we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re still going through that process and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll go through as we talk earlier, we'll be going out to the market here in the September time frame. So we'll know a lot more at that point. So more to come October. \nJeremy Tonet: Got it. Great. Thank you for that. \nNick Akins: Yes.\nOperator: We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll go next to the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith. Go ahead.\nNick Akins: Good morning., Julien.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Hi. Good morning, team. Thanks for the opportunity. Appreciate it. So maybe just a follow-up in brief on this operating arrangement in the two states here. I mean -- just what do you need to see from Liberty to be able to move forward here at this point in time? I just want to make sure I understand, exactly. Is this just about them acquiescing to sort of the updated position from the two states, or do you really need to resolve, say a specific transfer value et cetera here. \nNick Akins: Yes Julien. Certainly, Liberty has been great partners through this entire process. And we certainly, want to be fair to them because they were obviously, looking for certain things out of the transaction. We were looking for certain things. And I think, it's going to be just a matter of going through the process of defining risk, going forward. So it's not \u00e2\u0080\u0093 obviously, it's not as cut and dry and saying it's going to be the existing agreements and tough luck will move on. It's really an issue, where there is an opportunity for us to get together with them and define that future, because we're going to be partners in that individual going forward. So we might as well get comfortable with that relationship. 100%. \nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Yes. Nick, I noticed in the comment -- the various comments you made in the prepared remarks on inflation. Can you elaborate a little bit more in just to, how that ties into both near and longer term? Again I get that you guys are providing an update in a couple of months here. But just elaborate a little bit on the pressure points that you are seeing of late just if you can define that and how that's cascading through. Maybe speak a little bit to the cadence of labor arrangements for instance et cetera?\nNick Akins: Yes, I missed the first part.\nJulia Sloat: Yes. Yes. Yes. So, Julien I'll let Nick talk a little bit about supply and labor. But what we're also watching is in addition to our own costs and working with our individual parties around making sure we have material supplies equipment and folks that actually do the work. We're also paying attention to what's going on with our customers because as we talked earlier today load is a big piece of our driver for earnings year-to-date and this quarter so far and we hope to see that continue. But as we know as the Fed needs to take some action and tap on the brakes that could have some damn as it relates to actually all three of our individual customer segments. Now, as I mentioned earlier, Industrial segment looks reasonably healthy based on the customer expansions that we see in the pipeline, et cetera. But I don't think everyone can entirely escape the consequences. So, even from a commercial standpoint, if you look at the real estate segment, in particular, interest rates have a direct impact on that piece of that sector in that business and then of course, on the residential side that choose into the wallet because if you're sitting in a situation where your wage isn't growing as quickly as your costs are you may tend to want to tap the brakes there. Not to mention mortgage costs go up as well. So, keeping an eye on it from a customer perspective managing through it as it relates to our particular P&L. But I don't know Nick wanted to say anything about supply chain and labor?\nNick Akins: Yes. So -- and Julien sorry I missed the first part of your question. So, Julie filled in for me. Supply chain has certainly been an area of focus for the company and they've done a great job. The supply chain organization has done a great job of getting out ahead of that, understanding the delays that are occurring relative to delivery of transformers and those kinds of things. And then also size of inventories and other things come into question, but in our case we're a large electric utility with a lot of requirements, the largest transmission system in the country distribution obviously, wide spread. So, we have some -- we have abilities to really focus on the supply chain aspects in the positive way by expanding suppliers and certainly exerting the leverage we have associated with the large buying ability. So, we're in good shape from that perspective. Now, that being said, the entire industry and AEP are watching storm activity and those types of things and what implications that could have on the inventory levels and supply chain. So, we're watching that very closely. But we have time for the economy to really pick up and catch up from that perspective. Labor is an issue for everyone and certainly we continue to focus on that, particularly in our frontline employees to ensure that we're meeting the customers' requirements going forward. We're very tuned in to wage rates and those types of things that are changing dramatically. And certainly from a resource perspective we also have those relationships with not only attracting our own employees, but also contractors and so forth that we're able to pull from for various reasons. So, all-in-all, we're hanging in -- and the capital plan still remain secure in terms of the ability to move these projects forward. And we believe that AEP is in a great position to continue that process.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Super quick clarification on SPP, they're tweaked to the reserve margin. Does that impact your procurement efforts at all? I know you have a few things in flight just to clarify.\nNick Akins: No it doesn't. We're going through -- yeah we're going through regular as you've probably seen regular integrated resource planning processes with all of the Southwestern power approval states. And those processes will continue. I guess the good thing is that the things that we're putting in obviously we already talked about transmission and distribution in terms of supply chain activities. But in terms of resources, we're already putting integrated resource plans in for renewables. And the timing of those renewables, are such that we have time for the supply chain to catch-up relative to solar and wind components. So we're in good shape from that perspective.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Great. Thank you, guys.\nNick Akins: Sure.\nOperator: We'll go next to the line of Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Go ahead.\nNick Akins: Good morning, Shar.\nShar Pourreza: Good morning guys. How are you doing?\nNick Akins: Fine, how are you?\nShar Pourreza: Good. Nick just on the contracted renewable sales, we're kind of thinking about the process for the sale. There's obviously some conflicting data points out there right rates have picked up materially, there seems to be a few peers in the market selling as well. But on the other hand, just given supply chain issues deal on the ground is certainly more valuable. I guess, can you elaborate a bit more on the process when you plan on opening up the data rooms. And it's a tight time frame with the Analyst Day. So what data points can we get between September when you kick the process off in the Analyst Day which is only weeks process right? So I guess what's giving you a sense?\nNick Akins: Yeah. So these are well-known resources. And they're already there. And opened up a data room, can be done pretty quickly. And also review will be done quickly. I would say that the interest has been very robust and it will continue to be robust, because -- and you said it they have steel in the ground, but also the ability to continue on with these projects in a very positive sense. We took out Flat Ridge 2, so that makes the portfolio even better. And certainly from that perspective we expect the process to move very quickly. And when we bought the resources some of these resources from Sempra we visited sites and the data room was open. And we moved very quickly. And for these types of assets even though there may be others that are selling the assets, there is a robust focus by the market on certainly attracting these types of assets. So we feel very confident. We can move forward quickly and have certainly more information this year by the time we get to the Analyst Day.\nJulie Sloat: Shar, this is Julie. As an anecdote, when we initially made this announcement, I can tell you that not only was I receiving calls Nick was receiving calls. Chuck Zebula whose team is running the process was receiving calls so a lot of inbound calls coming in. And as far as what you can anticipate, I get it it's a shorter time line assuming we launch at the very latest in early September we should be able to come back to you by October 4th with color on how that process is going. And you're right. I mean there are other folks in the market as well. That's why I think we need to get out there as soon as we can and get business taken care of. So that is absolutely the objective. And stay tuned we'll have more color to share with you.\nShar Pourreza: Do you think you could actually announce a deal on the fourth of the proceeds or the tight.\nNick Akins: No.\nShar Pourreza: Okay.\nNick Akins: Yeah, that will be too tough for that. Obviously and then that will depend on what we get back to in terms of one-time versus stage in all those types of things will have to be considered. And certainly we'll have more information, but we won't have a finalization of that'll be probably by the end of the year.\nShar Pourreza: Got it. Got it. Thanks. And just one last one on \u00e2\u0080\u0093 I mean obviously your load growth and the backdrop in general has continued to show the ongoing strength, you highlight the fact that it's pre-pandemic levels. I guess how are you sort of thinking about 2022 in general and where you're within sort of that EPS range, especially given that we're kind of into the key months of the summer with Q3. I would think there's \u00e2\u0080\u0093 obviously \u00e2\u0080\u0093 this is a very strong tailwind for you especially as we're thinking about 2022, even though you guys are hedging ourselves a little bit on some of the uncertainties out there?\nNick Akins: Yes. It's always good to be ahead a little bit. Any time you go in the latter part of the year because summer is always good. And then you get in the fourth quarter with \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you don't know where storm activity is going to go and that kind of thing. But we feel really good about the position that have right now. And certainly, if you look at the fundamentals of what's going on I mean, you take charge point out of it is a very, very positive quarter and certainly one in which we continue to grow and see it \u00e2\u0080\u0093 our load guys are pretty optimistic. So \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and if you knew our load guy, you know he's \u00e2\u0080\u0093 it takes a long way for him to get there. But we feel really good about the position that we have. And I think as we see more towards the end of the year then we'll have more to say when it comes by the time the Analyst Day comes around. \nShahriar Pourreza: Okay. Terrific. Thank you, guys. Appreciate the color.\nOperator: We'll go next to Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Go ahead please.\nNick Akins: Good morning, Steve.\nSteve Fleishman: Hey, good morning. Thanks. So just a question I think Julie mentioned the \u00e2\u0080\u0093 on the Kentucky sale, the write-off you took of $0.15. Is that \u00e2\u0080\u0093 should we read out is effectively reflecting your expectation of what kind of price change needs to be renegotiated for the this Mitchell issue? Is that kind of reflecting that or is that...\nNick Akins: No. That one was really focused on when Liberty and AEP got together to focus on the Kentucky transaction order itself and there were requirements associated with that. So \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and we certainly were focused on making sure that that we completed that \u00e2\u0080\u0093 that order and this requirement. So that's what that is.\nSteve Fleishman: Okay. So I guess maybe then just on the difference between Kentucky and West Virginia and how Mitchell is treated. Could you just give a little more color on those differences and so we can kind of think about the value difference between the two? \nNick Akins: Yes. So \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and I think it's pretty obvious that Kentucky had its view of valuation in 2028 and West Virginia has its view of valuation and 2028 and the two are in very different positions. And it's probably not something you're going to resolve today. So really it becomes an issue of okay, how do we get together and think about our continued operating partnership, which could be done through the operating committee of the existing operating agreements and then certainly focus on a later date to consider the risk issues associated with that. So \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and I think for us I think it's sort of a realization that there will be no doubt that Kentucky Power will continue to be a partner in Mitchell. And then when the time comes before 2028, there'll have to be some reconciliation between what Kentucky wants and what the West Virginia Commission wants. And we just want to make sure those risk parameters are taken care of on the front end.\nSteve Fleishman: Okay. But I guess what matters in terms of closing is really the arrangement between you and I guess Liberty in terms of \nNick Akins: Yeah. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s right. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s right.\nSteve Fleishman: \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 closing. So is that there would be some kind of just ability to negotiate some kind of certainty on that?\nNick Akins: Yeah. Because we have -- now we have an outside party involved with a third-party from AEP's perspective with Mitchell going forward. So that sort of drives a different view when everything was already owned by AEP companies. So you have to go through that process and determine okay, what's the right approach for Liberty to have that ownership and for AEP to have ownership at arm's length.\nSteve Fleishman: Okay. But it sounds like you're confident this will be resolved with the buyer with the property relatively soon?\nNick Akins: Yeah. Yeah. Certainly, our people have been in constant contact on this issue. They're working very well together. I talked to Arun's as late as yesterday. So it's really both of us are very optimistic about this transaction.\nSteve Fleishman: Okay. That's good.\nNick Akins: But always there was a difference there.\nSteve Fleishman: Yeah. I'm sure he will when it's his chance for it to do a call. And then just on the -- on transmission, just anything that you kind of expect from FERC in the second half of the year to better identify both kind of their interest in getting a lot more transmission built, but at the same time still a little bit of kind of pressure on the ROEs. And just what are you watching there?\nNick Akins: Yeah. Obviously, reliability and resiliency is of central focus, not only to FERC, but the Congress as well. And I really believe they'll continue the process of all the areas of focus right now with NOPRs. They got several NOPRs out actually and they just put initiated around weatherization and making sure that we're as resilient as possible. And certainly from a transmission planning which was already done that NOPR along with they started the state process in terms of discussions relative to cost allocation those types of issues. So they're moving along. And when they issued that original NOPR under transmission, they made it clear that it wasn't going to be sequential. It's a multitasking opportunity for us to look at all these provisions. And then of course, the queues associated with the new resources and RTOs those are all being focused on. And I think FERC is doing a very credible job of marching through this and making sure that we are able to invest in transmission in a way that secures this country in so many ways. So I think that process will continue. Who knows what goes on with the ROEs, the 50 basis point adder and that kind of thing. That -- I mean that could take years to resolve. But, nevertheless, we'll continue moving forward with our investments and we'll continue to look forward to the rules, processes and procedures to be put in place where we as significant stakeholders in this process are allowed to make the investments that we need to make on a timely basis. There's no question that as we look at all the resources that are needed, the changes and the transmission system, fiber type issues that I'm sure that they'll be interested in as well in a regional activities associated with planning, ensuring that we're able to invest the way that we should on a timely basis with as little risk as possible. And that's really important because there are so many changes occurring. And for now you're seeing -- you really are seeing implications relative to resiliency and reliability. And I think everyone needs to take a pause and ensure that we're looking at that with our eyes wide open and that we're doing the right things at the right time. And that process continues. And I think FERC is doing a great job.\nSteve Fleishman: Great. Thank you very much.\nNick Atkins: By the way most of those offers are pretty consistent with AEP's positions. So we feel really good about our role in enabling the policy to move forward.\nOperator: We'll go next to the line of Durgesh Chopra with Evercore. Go ahead.\nNick Akins: Good morning Durgesh.\nDurgesh Chopra: Hey, good morning team. Quick clarification on the Kentucky sale process is my first question. Just to be clear your discussions with Liberty on the Michel operating agreement and then the FERC approval. Those are two independent processes, right? So you don't have to go back to FERC with asking for a revised approval or something like that once you settle with Liberty on as it relates to Michel?\nNick Akins: Yeah. Certainly we believe with the original agreements and the ability to operate under the operating committee under that agreement, we can really focus on the status quo and ensuring that we're able to move forward with a partner that's a third party, so that the provisions of the agreement already provide for the ability to make those kinds of adjustments. So it's our belief that we do not need to go back to FERC for additional approvals.\nDurgesh Chopra: Got it, okay. And then just maybe wanted to get your thoughts on valuation for your renewable assets. Maybe just -- how have they evolved since the first quarter call? It's been a volatile tape. Interest rates have been up. So just any color you can share with us there, you sort of, kick start this process in September?\nNick Akins: Well, obviously, we know that the headwinds of inflation and those types of things are areas of conflict with an increased valuation. But at the same time, you've got a lot of robust interest in these assets and the fact that continues to produce energy in a market that provides additional benefits for whoever winds up owning this asset. So, it's hard to tell what the valuations are going to look like right now. But I don't -- I mean certainly we're not concerned about all the macro issues that are involved because these assets stand pretty well in and out of itself and you have the positives and negatives. But now that -- and that's why we obviously took the adjustment on Flat Ridge 2, because we really wanted that out of the portfolio so that you wouldn't be arguing with bidders about what that valuation was and what the risks were of that particular project. The rest of them, or excellent projects that should bode well in the marketplace. So, like I said, I can't tell you any thoughts on what we see valuation to be. I think the market will tell us.\nJulie Sloat: Just to provide you a little more color if you're trying to model, aside from giving you market price point. We did include in the presentation today on slide number 44, the breakdown of all of the projects that are included in the portfolio. You'll see that we've essentially removed Flat Ridge 2 like we talked about today, as it relates to asset value and that type of thing that's on our balance sheet. If you look at our balance sheet, today our asset value associated with the portfolio as it stands is about $2.1 billion. The equity position is about $1.4 billion. We do have some projects, debt and tax equity that totaled about $272 million. So, you can plug that into your model as well. And then, we do get the question around how much did this contribute to earnings. So, for 2022 for the Generation & Marketing segment, which is $0.31 total for our guidance, kind of that midpoint about $0.13 to $0.17 relates specifically to this portfolio. So you can kind of begin to back into whatever valuation you want to assign to it. And there is a very low tax basis associated with it, but we do have some capacity to absorb a tax gain, because we've got some credits sitting on the bench that we can use to offset that. So, don't view that as problematic or seriously gating for us because it's not -- we'll be able to hurdle over that.\nDurgesh Chopra: Excellent. Thank you, both. Appreciate the color.\nNick Akins: Sure.\nOperator: We'll go next to the line of Nick Campanella with Credit Suisse. Go ahead.\nNick Akins: Good morning, Nick.\nNick Campanella: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions.\nNick Akins: Sure.\nNick Campanella: Just a really quick follow-up on the Kentucky sale reduction. I noticed you have, like $1,400 of proceeds in the funding slides bill. So just, can you just reaffirm that are -- is everything going on in the past quarter that cash proceeds when you close to be unchanged.\nJulie Sloat: We're good. You're good. No worries there. So, no change in that modeling or those assumptions. We're good.\nNick Campanella: Okay. Great, great. And then I guess just a question on strategy and Analyst Day. You've had some simplifying the business profile, the sale, the underwrite sales are on the horizon obviously. As we kind of think about funding this long-term CapEx plan, are you interested in pursuing further slated sales, unregulated sales, or are we kind of in the later innings of this portfolio rotation strategy?\nNick Akins: Yes. I'll say, obviously, we have a lot of capital to fund and we have a great plan to do it. I would probably look at the ownership levels of the new renewables projects and that's going to provide additional opportunity for us resilience and reliability certainly distributed energy resources. All these types of things in our plans are really providing us the opportunity to fine-tune our portfolio to match what the growth expectations we have around those areas. So, no, we're not done. We will continue to evaluate opportunities to add value from a shareholder perspective, but also to ensure that our customers are seeing the capital deployment that provides a better experience. And that's something that we're very focused on. So, this just going to \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you're only seeing, really the beginning of the part of our business that is going to endure going forward, as we transition this company. And that process will certainly continue. That's why I sort of said, it's a continued execution around, and I use taking care of business, but adding a dash of let's go crazy that sort of says we're going to be thinking on the edge about what can be done to make sure that we fund these real opportunities we have ahead of us.\nNick Campanella: All right. Thank you very much. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll look to you in October. Thanks.\nNick Akins: Yeah.\nOperator: And for our next question we'll go to the line of Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley.\nNick Akins: Good morning, Steve.\nDave Arcaro: Hi. It's Dave Arcaro on for Stephen. Thanks so much for taking our questions.\nNick Akins: Okay. Yeah. Hey, Dave.\nDave Arcaro: Wondering \u00e2\u0080\u0093 hey, how are you doing? Wondering if you could give your latest expectations around federal climate policy here? Do you expect renewable tax credits to be in an extenders bill potentially towards the end of the year? And just generally anything you would expect in terms of deal climate legislation this year?\nNick Akins: Yeah. I think, it certainly it's going to be a challenge. And I think I said that, last quarter, it is going to be a challenge. And the way it appears to be coming together is there were some \u00e2\u0080\u0093 there are some discussions going on. There may still be discussions going on. But right now, they're so focused on the healthcare pharmaceutical activities that may be bifurcated. And then \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and certainly the Chips Act now, we're obviously for the Chips Act, because Intel is locating within our territory with two fabs, up to eight fabs, and that's a huge, huge positive. So you have things like that that are going on now not only that, but obviously the midterms are providing some overhang to getting even a smaller package done, although there has been discussions of working on that and trying to get something done by September 30. But even that is going to be a really hard thing to do. So again, I would say, post election you're probably dealing with either some form of a smaller package, or extenders which that's a typical thing that happens toward the end of the year, when ITCs, PTCs start to roll off, again, you'll see extenders or the IRS of supply chain activities being able to extend it for some period of time. You'll probably see some Band-Aid solutions until you see solid solution going forward. So I just think the environment is certainly very volatile right now, and it will take time to work itself out. And maybe even post election, again, you'll maybe have some sense of calmness to be able to focus in on some of these things that are important, because our industry. And by the way, our 16,000 megawatts does not include any extension of ITCs, PTCs. But we are definitely for those extensions and expansions to nuclear and as well to storage. Those are clear opportunities for us to redefine the resource plans going forward. Direct Pay is also very important us, but we -- that would make -- at least at this point, as a test sale, maybe later on we can convince everybody that that truly is a benefit to our customers. So anything we get from that perspective will ultimately be a benefit to our customers from an economic standpoint and that will be good for, not only our movement to a clean energy economy, but the options that we have available to us, namely with storage, nuclear, hydrogen hubs, those kinds of things need to continue to be looked at to make sure we're resilient and reliable going forward. So that's where we stand right now, I think.\nDave Arcaro: Got it. Thanks. That's helpful color. Maybe, just one just small follow-up. I was just wondering, at Flat Ridge, if the issues that you found there? Is that just an exclusive to that project? It didn't have any other -- or none of the other assets in the portfolio had similar issues as\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\nNick Akins: That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s right.\nDave Arcaro:  -- going on at Flat Ridge and that was the only one you plan to extract.\nNick Akins: That's right. That's why we separated that one. Yes. The others are good.\nDave Arcaro: Understood. Okay, great. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Okay. We will go next to the line of Andrew Weisel with Scotiabank. Go ahead, please.\nNick Akins: Good morning, Andrew.\nAndrew Weisel: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Just one for me about coal. So between reliability concerns in the Supreme Court ruling that you mentioned, do you see any potential -- some coal plants online beyond their current schedule dates, beyond Mitchell, which is a bit of a unique situation. But would you consider extending them? And if so, would they be potential back up as peakers went, or keep some as either intermediate or baseload resources.\nNick Akins: Well, I think, that's exactly why, certainly, we said a rational and reasonable approach to moving forward from a resource perspective. We have to be able to maintain reliability, resiliency and economics for the grid and to our customers. And certainly, for our units, we continue to progress along the path that we've already placed in line. And actually, you have to do that to be able to define the future. And we're very, very focused on the just transitional aspects of our communities as we make any transition. So you touched on a point that's particularly important, for resiliency and reliability reasons, the capacity provided by these units is extremely important. And whether the capacity factors move down, as you bring in and layer in more renewable energy and clean energy, that's fine, as long as you have the resource to be able to meet the demands. And then, eventually, we have to find a path that ensures the communities continue to thrive from a tax standpoint, fire protection, police protection, school boards, all that kind of stuff. We have to be able to look at that. We can't just shut down these communities and then decide something else. So in areas like West Virginia with the coal-fired generation, we have to define what that path is. It may be small modular reactors, if we can define what that risk is and limit it from a shareholder perspective. Certainly, DOE is very interested in that. And it just so happens, the jobs of a small modular reactor is the same as a coal plant and paying the same taxes and those types of things that's an opportunity to take a look at whether it's hydrogen hubs or storage or other activities. So we've got to be able to rationalize that. But coal has provided an important benefit in coal generation particularly during these summer months. And obviously, during the winter months as well and we've got to be mindful of how that process continues. So that's why we have to say it has to be rational reasonable and with the time frame that makes sense.\nAndrew Weisel: Thanks. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very helpful.\nNick Akins : Yes.\nOperator: We'll go next to the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Go ahead.\nMichael Lapides: Good morning. Nick I know you're excited about the Analyst Day even you're probably equally as excited as having Brian Kelly down in Baton Rouge.\nNick Akins : Yes.\nMichael Lapides: I'm looking at the earned ROE versus authorized pivot. Just have a couple of questions about few of the subs. How are you thinking about what structural changes in rate making. Your team is going to seek in the next couple of years in a few of the jurisdictions that are earning a good bit below that. We think in PSO, we're honestly you fought under-earning for a number of years, but also thinking a little bit on APCo, a little bit on SWEPCO.\nNick Akins : Yes. So, obviously, there's been substantial opportunities there in those regions of the country, because actually when we put in renewables, the renewables is helping from an ROE perspective. So -- and obviously from -- as it reduces rates to customers from a fuel standpoint and overall in the savings gives us an opportunity to deploy capital investment in those areas. Sometimes obviously, we'll spend capital to make sure that we're doing those things to ensure resilience liability and all those activities. But particularly, from an ROE perspective, a ratemaking standpoint, equity layers has certainly been a big push of ours and certainly from a concurrent recovery standpoint with formula-based rates we have forward-looking rates in Indiana and Michigan. We like to see that in other jurisdictions with the massive amounts of capital that we're deploying. And then typically the renewables are tracked as part of the investment until we get it in rate base and that's worked out great for us. I think -- and you're also seeing opportunities for us to really get out ahead with the commissions on what we're trying to achieve in terms of not only benefits to our customers, but also the ability for our customers to use our product. I mean, I look at on the customer side with distributed energy resources with the analytics and all the equipment that can be put in place to enable customers to make wise judgments would be highly beneficial not just for the operations of the grid, but also to mitigate their own fuel costs and bills during periods of time and obviate the need for the securitization or other things that we have to do in huge storm-related environments. So, I think there's a lot of good things going on. And the trackers, I think, it's 85% of our recovery is tracker base. So we'd like to improve on that as well. I think there has to be a recognition that cash coming into the utility is particularly important and we always talk about FFO to debt and the utilities with all the massive investments necessary. We need to be able to see the cash coming in the door so that we can continue to make those kinds of investments. So that's going to be huge message for our regulators going forward as well. But we're doing good things. And as long as we're doing good things and spending on the right things, we believe we're aligned with our commissions and our customers on the right path forward and we feel very good about the path that we're on.\nJulie Sloat: Michael, maybe a little more help there too on PSO in particular. We've got securitization that we'll be completing here next month. So in August for the storm Yuri cost, so that should help to alleviate some of this pressure as well. And we'll be filing another base case. So stay tuned for that as well. And as Nick mentioned, just some refinement around utilization of different rate adjustment clauses, et cetera, not only in West Virginia, Virginia but then also as we take a look at SWEPCO, we still have the outstanding component that's not included in rates. So we've got different ways to get after it and you'll see us talk more about that as we come at you here on October 4. So stay tuned.\nMichael Lapides: That's great. And one quickly final up. Just Cardinal on the G&M segment had a big benefit during the quarter, just given where power prices were versus your delivered cost of coal. Can you remind us how you're thinking about the future for Cardinal going forward? \nNick Akins: Yes. So Cardinal, you're talking about the Cardinal plant. Yes. So\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\nMichael Lapides: Yes.\nNick Akins: So \u00e2\u0080\u0093 we plan on completing a transaction with Buckeye related to that particular plant. So they would take ownership of the plant and we would take a PPA back for a certain period. So \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and then that means we will not have any generation to speak of left in Ohio on the unregulated side. So \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and that it's a long way from where we were in Ohio. But I think it's also there's a message for Ohio in terms of generation that needs to be placed in this state. So that's probably another issue I can get into it but I'll stop there. But I think that's all in the plans already.\nJulie Sloat: Yes Michael. So that PPA with Cardinal goes I think through 2028 to give you a endpoint on that as well.\nMichael Lapides: Got it. Thank you, guys. Thanks, Nick. Thanks, Julie. Much appreciate it.\nNick Akins: Sure. Thanks. Talk to your later.\nOperator: We'll go to the line of Sophie Karp with KeyBanc. Go ahead.\nNick Akins: Good morning, Sophie.\nSophie Karp: Hi. Good morning. Thank you for squeezing me in. We have a lot has been discussed already, but if I may just ask a couple of questions. First on transmission. So you made a point of saying that transmission Transco remains one of your I guess key growth engines. So I don't want to miss quality base. But \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and also at the same time you're talking about not being done with divestitures of something it's a non-core business. Can you maybe help us frame how you think about transmission? Is it \u00e2\u0080\u0093 are you making these comments because you're getting questions about potential transmission sale? And how are you thinking about that, or should we not read too much in this.\nNick Akins: No I don't read too much into it because transmission is a key component for our not only for our investment in the company but also in terms of what we see relative to the transition to the future. Transmission is a key component for resiliency, reliability and optimization, as we move to a clean energy environment. So, no, we're -- from a transmission standpoint, we feel very good about our role relative to transmission. And actually, I see distribution continuing to grow and certainly the renewables transformation itself. So, no, don't read anything into that.\nSophie Karp: All right. Thank you for clarifying that. And then my second question was a little bit of a housekeeping question I guess. I'm looking at the -- related to new growth opportunity exhibit at slide 40. And it seems like for APCo, when the opportunity has been reduced a little bit and solar increase a little bit in the 2020 to 2030 time frame. I'm just kind of wondering, if that's just some project realignment, or should we be -- how should we be thinking about this?\nNick Akins: Yes. So the April integrated resource plan, certainly showed what was needed from an APCo perspective. So -- and I think there's probably more to come on that, but it's actually immaterial at this point.\nSophie Karp: All right. Thank you.\nOperator: And speakers' we have no further lines in queue at this time.\nDarcy Reese: Thank you for joining us on today's call. As always, the IR team will be available to answer any additional questions you may have. Alan, would you please give the replay information?\nOperator: Yes, I will.

            "content": "Okay. Thanks Darcy. Welcome everyone to American Electric Power's second quarter 2022 earnings call. AEP continues to make progress on the strategic initiatives we announced earlier this year with strong execution against our plan resulting in another solid quarter. Later in the call Julie will walk you through our second quarter performance drivers including the strong load increases we're experiencing in our territory, as well as provide additional details surrounding our financial position. But I'll start with the key financial highlights for the quarter. We'll then move to an update on our Kentucky operations sale process and timeline. I will also spend time discussing the progress we are making in our transition to a clean energy future as we simplify and derisk our business profile by divesting unregulated renewable assets while maintaining focus on our responsible generation fleet transformation and regulated renewables execution. I will close by providing some additional insights into our ongoing regulatory activities including our transmission business. We are very pleased with our positive momentum this quarter, delivering operating earnings of $1.20 per share or $618 million. We are moving full speed ahead towards the increased operating earnings guidance range and long-term earnings growth rate we provided during our fourth quarter 2021 earnings call and we are reaffirming both financial targets this quarter. As a reminder we are guiding to an operating earnings guidance range of $4.87 to $5.07 per share for 2022 with a $4.97 midpoint and a long-term earnings growth rate of 6% to 7%. We are also continuing to ensure we are best positioned for value creation as we navigate the macro trends impacting our industry and the broader economy. We are working with states to drive expansion in our service territory while considering global economic uncertainty inflationary pressures and of course customer bills. We're also diversifying our mix of suppliers to minimize supply chain disruptions for our customers in business while also lessening the impact on our capital investment plan. We know that timing of the closing of the sale of Kentucky Power and AEP Kentucky Transco to Liberty as top of mind, and we have been working with Liberty to obtain the approvals necessary for closing this summer. A regulatory timeline of the sale can be found on slide seven of today's presentation. We are pleased to report the Kentucky Commission approved the key milestone in the transaction with an order approving the sales transfer in early May. As we have discussed previously a prerequisite in our contract of Liberty for closing the sale is approving the approval of new Mitchell operating agreements by both the Kentucky Public Service Commission and the West Virginia Public Service Commission. While we receive the related Mitchell orders from the Kentucky Commission on May 3 and the West Virginia Commission on July 1, the two states approved the operating agreement with different formats and some divergent post 2028 plant provisions. However, through the two proceedings, both commissions have indicated an ability to use the existing agreement as a basis to operate the plant going forward and accomplish their differing expectations for investment in operations. For that reason, on July 11, we made a compliance filing in West Virginia, and filed an update with Kentucky, providing an alternative way to move forward with Mitchell operations in the near term. We inform both commissions that we will operate under the existing agreement and manage the new operational focus of the two commissions through the operating committee. In the absence of any new agreements, the existing Mitchell operating agreement is still in effect and we believe, no additional regulatory approvals should be required. Since regulatory approval of the new Mitchell operating agreements is a prerequisite in our contract with Liberty for the closing. In the absence of such proposal, we are working with Liberty on the commercial solution for Mitchell-related operations and both parties remain optimistic about reaching a resolution and closing the transaction. At this time, the only regulatory matter currently pending is the 203 application at FERC related to the cell transfer, which FERC is currently considering. We are in the final stages of the Kentucky operations sale process and expect to close this summer. Moving to our unregulated renewable portfolio, in May, we closed on the sale of five unregulated development sites located in the Southwest Power Pool area, marking the successful divestiture of the majority of our wind and solar development assets. As we mentioned last quarter, we have also signed an agreement to sell a solar development site in Ohio, with that transition close expected also in the third quarter. In addition, we are in discussions with an interested party sale of our Flat Ridge II Wind Farm ownership, consisting of 235 megawatts, simplifying the resulting portfolio for our upcoming auctions. These milestones demonstrate our commitment to continued execution. As we announced during our fourth quarter earnings call in February, we are selling our unregulated contracted renewables portfolio in order to simplify and derisk the company and facilitate investment in our regulated businesses. We are in the final stages of preparation of the marketing materials for the auction and expect an official launch of the process no later than early September. After the removal Flat Ridge II, the portfolio consists of 1,365 megawatts of contracted renewable assets, consisting of 1,200 megawatts of wind and 165 megawatts of solar, geographically diversified throughout the US. There has been robust, inbound interest in the portfolio and we expect the process to proceed quickly. As a reminder, utilization of contracted renewable sale proceeds is not yet reflected in our multiyear financing plan. We remain focused on maximizing transaction proceeds and directing additional capital to our regulated businesses, where we have meaningful pipeline of investment opportunities to better serve our customers, as we push toward a clean energy future and enhanced transmission infrastructure. As always, we are open-minded and we'll evaluate all value-additive potential activities, as we focus on our regulated businesses, where we see meaningful long-term opportunities for growth. AEP continues to make significant progress in our transition to clean energy resources through our regulated renewables execution. Details regarding the specific actions we are taking can be found on slides eight and nine in today's presentation. We are also firmly grounded in our principles of resiliency, reliability and affordability while recognizing the increasing value of our diverse resource portfolio against the backdrop of energy-related volatility. SWEPCO is taking steps to secure renewable resources, making regulatory filings in May in Arkansas, Louisiana and Texas to own three renewable turnkey projects totaling 999 megawatts. This $2.2 billion investment is currently reflected in our five-year $38 billion capital plan. SWEPCO expects to issue another RFP in the near term consistent with its RFP for energy and capacity needs. APCo's 409 megawatts of owned solar and wind resources were approved by West Virginia and Virginia, marking an $841 million capital investment that is also included in our current capital plan. Request for a proposal are in process in APCo, O&M and PSO with expected in-service dates in the year-end 2024 and 2025 timeframe. We also expect to make regulatory filings to acquire additional renewable resources prior to year-end 2022. Finally the US Supreme Court ruling at the end of June related to the federal EPAa\u0302\u0080\u0099s regulation of greenhouse gas emissions will not require any changes to AEP's current generation and compliance planning. Our generation fleet transformation plans are well on track. We remain fully committed to our target of an 80% carbon reduction emission -- emission reduction rate by 2030 and net zero by 2050 and we are proud of the work well underway at AEP to help us achieve this goal. Reaching these targets is foundational to our long-term strategy and we believe we are on the right path toward prioritizing regulated investment opportunities and transitioning our generation fleet. Turning now to a brief update on our regulatory activity. Our regulated ROE as of the end of June 2022 is 9.2%. We continue to work through regulatory cases and maintain our focus on reducing our authorized versus actual ROE spreads. Additional regulatory activity in the quarter included a commission order received in May on SWEPCO's Arkansas rate case, including a 9.5% ROE, marking a net revenue increase of $28 million and a capital structure of 55% debt to 45% equity. We are also expecting a decision on SWEPCO's losing out a rate case in the third quarter. Oral arguments related to APCo's 2020 Virginia base case were held in March 2022 at the Virginia Supreme Court, with an anticipated final decision later this year. FERC recently initiated several rule-making proceedings related to transmission planning, cost allocation, generation interconnection to the transmission grid and extreme weather preparedness. We support the commission in these actions and are in full support -- full agreement that that reform is needed to build the infrastructure necessary to transition our generation fleet in the most efficient and cost-effective way possible, while also helping achieve our carbon reduction goals. These proposed rules align with AEPa\u0302\u0080\u0099s objectives of developing a more robust, reliable and flexible grid of the future that ultimately reduces cost to customers and strengthens economic development in our communities. Before I turn it over to Julie, I want to take a moment to thank our team for the incredible work that they are doing as we execute against our strategic objectives and deliver for our stakeholders. What's going on today at AEP is a perfect blend of the execution of Bachmana\u0302\u0080\u0093Turner Overdrivea\u0302\u0080\u0099s \"Takin' Care Of Business\" with the edge of Princea\u0302\u0080\u0099s \"Let's Go Crazy\" in a good sense, of course. We have an incredible market position, a bold mission and the foundation in place to achieve our goals to deliver on our vision of further modernizing our energy grid in order to supply reliable, cleaner, low-cost resources for all the communities serve. As we think about the future and the next chapter of AEP, we're excited to share more about our plans at AEP's upcoming Analyst Day on October 4 in New York City. We will provide additional detail soon and look forward to seeing you there. Julie, over to you. Good morning, Jeremy. We said, we told you I guess, it's probably a quarter or two ago, about reinforcing our service territory particularly, as it relates to energy and as it relates to onshoring. And our a\u0302\u0080\u0093 certainly, our territory has been very strong in terms of both of those categories manufacturing as well. And that's clearly, become a benefit for us. So -- and really when you think about what's going on in the world today, associated with security aspects, that's really going to drive more towards the ability for onshoring to occur and certainly, for energy security. So it bodes well for our territory. Yes. There's a\u0302\u0080\u0093 actually, you have the sales process. Obviously, everybody want to know about Kentucky, but also the unregulated contracted renewables there will be new data points on that as well. And then of course, a 2022 earnings guidance update, 2023 guidance range will be introduced and also we'll probably roll forward the five year capital and financing plans through 2027 and there could be other things too. So we will hold that till October 4. Yes. The team is working at that. And certainly, I think the base case would be to sell all at one time. But if there are opportunities exist to stage that out with the capital needs, that would great. so wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re still going through that process and wea\u0302\u0080\u0099ll go through as we talk earlier, we'll be going out to the market here in the September time frame. So we'll know a lot more at that point. So more to come October. Yes. Good morning., Julien. Yes Julien. Certainly, Liberty has been great partners through this entire process. And we certainly, want to be fair to them because they were obviously, looking for certain things out of the transaction. We were looking for certain things. And I think, it's going to be just a matter of going through the process of defining risk, going forward. So it's not a\u0302\u0080\u0093 obviously, it's not as cut and dry and saying it's going to be the existing agreements and tough luck will move on. It's really an issue, where there is an opportunity for us to get together with them and define that future, because we're going to be partners in that individual going forward. So we might as well get comfortable with that relationship. 100%. Yes, I missed the first part. Yes. So -- and Julien sorry I missed the first part of your question. So, Julie filled in for me. Supply chain has certainly been an area of focus for the company and they've done a great job. The supply chain organization has done a great job of getting out ahead of that, understanding the delays that are occurring relative to delivery of transformers and those kinds of things. And then also size of inventories and other things come into question, but in our case we're a large electric utility with a lot of requirements, the largest transmission system in the country distribution obviously, wide spread. So, we have some -- we have abilities to really focus on the supply chain aspects in the positive way by expanding suppliers and certainly exerting the leverage we have associated with the large buying ability. So, we're in good shape from that perspective. Now, that being said, the entire industry and AEP are watching storm activity and those types of things and what implications that could have on the inventory levels and supply chain. So, we're watching that very closely. But we have time for the economy to really pick up and catch up from that perspective. Labor is an issue for everyone and certainly we continue to focus on that, particularly in our frontline employees to ensure that we're meeting the customers' requirements going forward. We're very tuned in to wage rates and those types of things that are changing dramatically. And certainly from a resource perspective we also have those relationships with not only attracting our own employees, but also contractors and so forth that we're able to pull from for various reasons. So, all-in-all, we're hanging in -- and the capital plan still remain secure in terms of the ability to move these projects forward. And we believe that AEP is in a great position to continue that process. No it doesn't. We're going through -- yeah we're going through regular as you've probably seen regular integrated resource planning processes with all of the Southwestern power approval states. And those processes will continue. I guess the good thing is that the things that we're putting in obviously we already talked about transmission and distribution in terms of supply chain activities. But in terms of resources, we're already putting integrated resource plans in for renewables. And the timing of those renewables, are such that we have time for the supply chain to catch-up relative to solar and wind components. So we're in good shape from that perspective. Sure. Good morning, Shar. Fine, how are you? Yeah. So these are well-known resources. And they're already there. And opened up a data room, can be done pretty quickly. And also review will be done quickly. I would say that the interest has been very robust and it will continue to be robust, because -- and you said it they have steel in the ground, but also the ability to continue on with these projects in a very positive sense. We took out Flat Ridge 2, so that makes the portfolio even better. And certainly from that perspective we expect the process to move very quickly. And when we bought the resources some of these resources from Sempra we visited sites and the data room was open. And we moved very quickly. And for these types of assets even though there may be others that are selling the assets, there is a robust focus by the market on certainly attracting these types of assets. So we feel very confident. We can move forward quickly and have certainly more information this year by the time we get to the Analyst Day. No. Yeah, that will be too tough for that. Obviously and then that will depend on what we get back to in terms of one-time versus stage in all those types of things will have to be considered. And certainly we'll have more information, but we won't have a finalization of that'll be probably by the end of the year. Yes. It's always good to be ahead a little bit. Any time you go in the latter part of the year because summer is always good. And then you get in the fourth quarter with a\u0302\u0080\u0093 you don't know where storm activity is going to go and that kind of thing. But we feel really good about the position that have right now. And certainly, if you look at the fundamentals of what's going on I mean, you take charge point out of it is a very, very positive quarter and certainly one in which we continue to grow and see it a\u0302\u0080\u0093 our load guys are pretty optimistic. So a\u0302\u0080\u0093 and if you knew our load guy, you know he's a\u0302\u0080\u0093 it takes a long way for him to get there. But we feel really good about the position that we have. And I think as we see more towards the end of the year then we'll have more to say when it comes by the time the Analyst Day comes around. Good morning, Steve. No. That one was really focused on when Liberty and AEP got together to focus on the Kentucky transaction order itself and there were requirements associated with that. So a\u0302\u0080\u0093 and we certainly were focused on making sure that that we completed that a\u0302\u0080\u0093 that order and this requirement. So that's what that is. Yes. So a\u0302\u0080\u0093 and I think it's pretty obvious that Kentucky had its view of valuation in 2028 and West Virginia has its view of valuation and 2028 and the two are in very different positions. And it's probably not something you're going to resolve today. So really it becomes an issue of okay, how do we get together and think about our continued operating partnership, which could be done through the operating committee of the existing operating agreements and then certainly focus on a later date to consider the risk issues associated with that. So a\u0302\u0080\u0093 and I think for us I think it's sort of a realization that there will be no doubt that Kentucky Power will continue to be a partner in Mitchell. And then when the time comes before 2028, there'll have to be some reconciliation between what Kentucky wants and what the West Virginia Commission wants. And we just want to make sure those risk parameters are taken care of on the front end. Yeah. Thata\u0302\u0080\u0099s right. Thata\u0302\u0080\u0099s right. Yeah. Because we have -- now we have an outside party involved with a third-party from AEP's perspective with Mitchell going forward. So that sort of drives a different view when everything was already owned by AEP companies. So you have to go through that process and determine okay, what's the right approach for Liberty to have that ownership and for AEP to have ownership at arm's length. Yeah. Yeah. Certainly, our people have been in constant contact on this issue. They're working very well together. I talked to Arun's as late as yesterday. So it's really both of us are very optimistic about this transaction. But always there was a difference there. Yeah. Obviously, reliability and resiliency is of central focus, not only to FERC, but the Congress as well. And I really believe they'll continue the process of all the areas of focus right now with NOPRs. They got several NOPRs out actually and they just put initiated around weatherization and making sure that we're as resilient as possible. And certainly from a transmission planning which was already done that NOPR along with they started the state process in terms of discussions relative to cost allocation those types of issues. So they're moving along. And when they issued that original NOPR under transmission, they made it clear that it wasn't going to be sequential. It's a multitasking opportunity for us to look at all these provisions. And then of course, the queues associated with the new resources and RTOs those are all being focused on. And I think FERC is doing a very credible job of marching through this and making sure that we are able to invest in transmission in a way that secures this country in so many ways. So I think that process will continue. Who knows what goes on with the ROEs, the 50 basis point adder and that kind of thing. That -- I mean that could take years to resolve. But, nevertheless, we'll continue moving forward with our investments and we'll continue to look forward to the rules, processes and procedures to be put in place where we as significant stakeholders in this process are allowed to make the investments that we need to make on a timely basis. There's no question that as we look at all the resources that are needed, the changes and the transmission system, fiber type issues that I'm sure that they'll be interested in as well in a regional activities associated with planning, ensuring that we're able to invest the way that we should on a timely basis with as little risk as possible. And that's really important because there are so many changes occurring. And for now you're seeing -- you really are seeing implications relative to resiliency and reliability. And I think everyone needs to take a pause and ensure that we're looking at that with our eyes wide open and that we're doing the right things at the right time. And that process continues. And I think FERC is doing a great job. Good morning Durgesh. Yeah. Certainly we believe with the original agreements and the ability to operate under the operating committee under that agreement, we can really focus on the status quo and ensuring that we're able to move forward with a partner that's a third party, so that the provisions of the agreement already provide for the ability to make those kinds of adjustments. So it's our belief that we do not need to go back to FERC for additional approvals. Well, obviously, we know that the headwinds of inflation and those types of things are areas of conflict with an increased valuation. But at the same time, you've got a lot of robust interest in these assets and the fact that continues to produce energy in a market that provides additional benefits for whoever winds up owning this asset. So, it's hard to tell what the valuations are going to look like right now. But I don't -- I mean certainly we're not concerned about all the macro issues that are involved because these assets stand pretty well in and out of itself and you have the positives and negatives. But now that -- and that's why we obviously took the adjustment on Flat Ridge 2, because we really wanted that out of the portfolio so that you wouldn't be arguing with bidders about what that valuation was and what the risks were of that particular project. The rest of them, or excellent projects that should bode well in the marketplace. So, like I said, I can't tell you any thoughts on what we see valuation to be. I think the market will tell us. Sure. Good morning, Nick. Sure. Yes. I'll say, obviously, we have a lot of capital to fund and we have a great plan to do it. I would probably look at the ownership levels of the new renewables projects and that's going to provide additional opportunity for us resilience and reliability certainly distributed energy resources. All these types of things in our plans are really providing us the opportunity to fine-tune our portfolio to match what the growth expectations we have around those areas. So, no, we're not done. We will continue to evaluate opportunities to add value from a shareholder perspective, but also to ensure that our customers are seeing the capital deployment that provides a better experience. And that's something that we're very focused on. So, this just going to a\u0302\u0080\u0093 you're only seeing, really the beginning of the part of our business that is going to endure going forward, as we transition this company. And that process will certainly continue. That's why I sort of said, it's a continued execution around, and I use taking care of business, but adding a dash of let's go crazy that sort of says we're going to be thinking on the edge about what can be done to make sure that we fund these real opportunities we have ahead of us. Yeah. Good morning, Steve. Okay. Yeah. Hey, Dave. Yeah. I think, it certainly it's going to be a challenge. And I think I said that, last quarter, it is going to be a challenge. And the way it appears to be coming together is there were some a\u0302\u0080\u0093 there are some discussions going on. There may still be discussions going on. But right now, they're so focused on the healthcare pharmaceutical activities that may be bifurcated. And then a\u0302\u0080\u0093 and certainly the Chips Act now, we're obviously for the Chips Act, because Intel is locating within our territory with two fabs, up to eight fabs, and that's a huge, huge positive. So you have things like that that are going on now not only that, but obviously the midterms are providing some overhang to getting even a smaller package done, although there has been discussions of working on that and trying to get something done by September 30. But even that is going to be a really hard thing to do. So again, I would say, post election you're probably dealing with either some form of a smaller package, or extenders which that's a typical thing that happens toward the end of the year, when ITCs, PTCs start to roll off, again, you'll see extenders or the IRS of supply chain activities being able to extend it for some period of time. You'll probably see some Band-Aid solutions until you see solid solution going forward. So I just think the environment is certainly very volatile right now, and it will take time to work itself out. And maybe even post election, again, you'll maybe have some sense of calmness to be able to focus in on some of these things that are important, because our industry. And by the way, our 16,000 megawatts does not include any extension of ITCs, PTCs. But we are definitely for those extensions and expansions to nuclear and as well to storage. Those are clear opportunities for us to redefine the resource plans going forward. Direct Pay is also very important us, but we -- that would make -- at least at this point, as a test sale, maybe later on we can convince everybody that that truly is a benefit to our customers. So anything we get from that perspective will ultimately be a benefit to our customers from an economic standpoint and that will be good for, not only our movement to a clean energy economy, but the options that we have available to us, namely with storage, nuclear, hydrogen hubs, those kinds of things need to continue to be looked at to make sure we're resilient and reliable going forward. So that's where we stand right now, I think. Thata\u0302\u0080\u0099s right. That's right. That's why we separated that one. Yes. The others are good. Good morning, Andrew. Well, I think, that's exactly why, certainly, we said a rational and reasonable approach to moving forward from a resource perspective. We have to be able to maintain reliability, resiliency and economics for the grid and to our customers. And certainly, for our units, we continue to progress along the path that we've already placed in line. And actually, you have to do that to be able to define the future. And we're very, very focused on the just transitional aspects of our communities as we make any transition. So you touched on a point that's particularly important, for resiliency and reliability reasons, the capacity provided by these units is extremely important. And whether the capacity factors move down, as you bring in and layer in more renewable energy and clean energy, that's fine, as long as you have the resource to be able to meet the demands. And then, eventually, we have to find a path that ensures the communities continue to thrive from a tax standpoint, fire protection, police protection, school boards, all that kind of stuff. We have to be able to look at that. We can't just shut down these communities and then decide something else. So in areas like West Virginia with the coal-fired generation, we have to define what that path is. It may be small modular reactors, if we can define what that risk is and limit it from a shareholder perspective. Certainly, DOE is very interested in that. And it just so happens, the jobs of a small modular reactor is the same as a coal plant and paying the same taxes and those types of things that's an opportunity to take a look at whether it's hydrogen hubs or storage or other activities. So we've got to be able to rationalize that. But coal has provided an important benefit in coal generation particularly during these summer months. And obviously, during the winter months as well and we've got to be mindful of how that process continues. So that's why we have to say it has to be rational reasonable and with the time frame that makes sense. Yes. Yes. Yes. So, obviously, there's been substantial opportunities there in those regions of the country, because actually when we put in renewables, the renewables is helping from an ROE perspective. So -- and obviously from -- as it reduces rates to customers from a fuel standpoint and overall in the savings gives us an opportunity to deploy capital investment in those areas. Sometimes obviously, we'll spend capital to make sure that we're doing those things to ensure resilience liability and all those activities. But particularly, from an ROE perspective, a ratemaking standpoint, equity layers has certainly been a big push of ours and certainly from a concurrent recovery standpoint with formula-based rates we have forward-looking rates in Indiana and Michigan. We like to see that in other jurisdictions with the massive amounts of capital that we're deploying. And then typically the renewables are tracked as part of the investment until we get it in rate base and that's worked out great for us. I think -- and you're also seeing opportunities for us to really get out ahead with the commissions on what we're trying to achieve in terms of not only benefits to our customers, but also the ability for our customers to use our product. I mean, I look at on the customer side with distributed energy resources with the analytics and all the equipment that can be put in place to enable customers to make wise judgments would be highly beneficial not just for the operations of the grid, but also to mitigate their own fuel costs and bills during periods of time and obviate the need for the securitization or other things that we have to do in huge storm-related environments. So, I think there's a lot of good things going on. And the trackers, I think, it's 85% of our recovery is tracker base. So we'd like to improve on that as well. I think there has to be a recognition that cash coming into the utility is particularly important and we always talk about FFO to debt and the utilities with all the massive investments necessary. We need to be able to see the cash coming in the door so that we can continue to make those kinds of investments. So that's going to be huge message for our regulators going forward as well. But we're doing good things. And as long as we're doing good things and spending on the right things, we believe we're aligned with our commissions and our customers on the right path forward and we feel very good about the path that we're on. Yes. So Cardinal, you're talking about the Cardinal plant. Yes. Soa\u0302\u0080\u00a6 So a\u0302\u0080\u0093 we plan on completing a transaction with Buckeye related to that particular plant. So they would take ownership of the plant and we would take a PPA back for a certain period. So a\u0302\u0080\u0093 and then that means we will not have any generation to speak of left in Ohio on the unregulated side. So a\u0302\u0080\u0093 and that it's a long way from where we were in Ohio. But I think it's also there's a message for Ohio in terms of generation that needs to be placed in this state. So that's probably another issue I can get into it but I'll stop there. But I think that's all in the plans already. Sure. Thanks. Talk to your later. Good morning, Sophie. No I don't read too much into it because transmission is a key component for our not only for our investment in the company but also in terms of what we see relative to the transition to the future. Transmission is a key component for resiliency, reliability and optimization, as we move to a clean energy environment. So, no, we're -- from a transmission standpoint, we feel very good about our role relative to transmission. And actually, I see distribution continuing to grow and certainly the renewables transformation itself. So, no, don't read anything into that. Yes. So the April integrated resource plan, certainly showed what was needed from an APCo perspective. So -- and I think there's probably more to come on that, but it's actually immaterial at this point."

            "content": "Thanks, Nick. Thanks, Darcy. It's good to be with everyone this morning. Good morning and thanks for dialing in. I'm going to walk us through our second quarter and year-to-date results, share some updates on our service territory load, and finish with commentary on our credit metrics and liquidity as well as some thoughts on our guidance, financial targets, and then recap our current portfolio management activities underway. So let's go to slide 10 which shows the comparison of GAAP to operating earnings. GAAP earnings for the second quarter were $1.02 per share compared to $1.16 per share in 2021. GAAP earnings through June were $2.43 per share compared to $2.31 per share in 2021. There's a detailed reconciliation of GAAP to operating earnings on pages 18 and 19 of the presentation today, but I'd like to call out three of the reconciling items that do not affect operating earnings, but relate to our asset optimization activities underway. Specifically, you'll see that we made an adjustment to arrive at our operating for the quarter and year-to-date periods consisting of Kentucky sale costs and the write-off of one of the unregulated universal scale wind projects that's included in the portfolio. We're in the process of preparing for sale. The Kentucky sale charge reflects an anticipated reduction in the sales price as we work with Liberty to accommodate adjustments for costs that have been identified through the regulatory approvals that we've received. Turning to the renewable investment write-off the Flat Ridge 2 projects specifically has continued to see deteriorating performance due to equipment issues and transmission congestions to avoid another otherwise necessary repowering investment to address the performance issue and complicate our portfolio sales process. We elected to write-off the equity investments are in discussions with an interested party for the sale of ownership interest in Flat Ridge 2. Consequently, this will remove the Flat Ridge 2 project from the portfolio we're preparing for auction, which should help improve the valuation opportunity as investors engage in the sales process, which is scheduled to launch no later than early September. Lastly, I'll mention that we monetize some mineral rights which give rise to a benefit to GAAP, but non-operating earnings, which helps offset the charges I just mentioned. So while I would typically not spend time walking through the GAAP to operating reconciliation, I thought it was appropriate at this time given the milestones we're clearing on the asset optimization front. And while these charges and gains are things that we need to recognize they are entirely driven by our efforts derisk, simplify and bring cash in the door to support our continued investment in the regulated business. So with that let's go to slide number 11 and walk through our quarterly operating earnings performance. Operating earnings for the second quarter totaled $1.20 per share or $618 million compared to $1.18 million per share or $590 million in 2021. Operating earnings for vertically integrated utilities were $0.59 per share up $0.14. Favorable drivers included rate changes across multiple jurisdictions, positive weather primarily in our western jurisdictions, increased transmission revenue and normalized retail load and income taxes. These items were somewhat offset by increased depreciation in O&M and lower off-system sales. Just as a reminder on the O&M and depreciation front, as I mentioned on the first quarter call and included in our 2022 guidance details because of a change in accounting related to the Rockport Unit 2 lease at I&M, we're seeing approximately $0.05 of favorable O&M offset by $0.05 of unfavorable depreciation in each quarter of 2022, but no consequential earnings impact. And so I'll have a little more to share on loan performance and I'll get to that in a minute here. So just hang with me. The Transmission and Distribution Utilities segment earned $0.32 per share, up $0.01 compared to last year. Favorable drivers in this segment included rate changes, load, positive weather in Texas and Ohio and increased transmission revenue. Offsetting these favorable items were unfavorable O&M and depreciation. AEP Transmission Holdco segment contributed $0.27 per share, down $0.07 compared to last year, favorable investment growth of $0.03 was more than offset by an unfavorable true-up of $0.07. As I mentioned last quarter, this is consistent with our guidance. Our 2022 guidance had this segment down by $0.08 year-over-year as a result of the $0.12 of investment growth being more than offset by the annual true-up that occurred this quarter and some favorable on comparisons on the tax and financing side. This segment continues to be an important part of our 6% to 7% EPS growth as you well know. Generation and Marketing produced $0.18 per share, up $0.09 from last year. The positive variance is primarily due to the sale of renewable development sites as well as increased generation margins and land sales. Finally, Corporate and Other was down $0.15 per share driven by lower investment gains increased income taxes and unfavorable interest. The lower investment gains are largely related to charge point gains that we had in the second quarter of 2021 that have reversed this year. The increased income taxes are related to the reduction of a consolidating tax adjustment at the parent. Let's turn to Slide 12 and our year-to-date operating earnings performance. Year-to-date operating earnings totaled $2.42 per share or $1.234 billion, compared to $2.33 per share or $1.160 billion in 2021. Operating earnings for the vertically integrated utilities were $1.18 per share, up $0.18. Similar to the quarter, favorable drivers included rate changes across multiple jurisdictions, positive weather mainly in our western jurisdictions, increased transmission revenue and normalized retail load and income taxes. These items were somewhat offset by increased depreciation and lower off-system sales. Once again the change in accounting around the Rockport Unit 2 lease results in $0.11 of favorable O&M offset by $0.11 of favorable -- unfavorable depreciation. The Transmission & Distribution Utilities segment earned $0.62 per share, up $0.08 compared to last year. Favorable drivers in this segment included rate changes in Texas and Ohio and increased normalized retail load and transmission revenue. Offsetting these favorable items were unfavorable O&M and depreciation. AEP Transmission Holdco segment $0.62 per share down $0.06 compared to last year. Favorable investment growth of $0.05 was more than offset by unfavorable true-up of $0.07 and increased property taxes. The Generation & Marketing segment produced $0.21 per share, up $0.05 from last year. The positive variance is primarily due to the sale of renewable development sites and increased wholesale margins offset by lower retail margins. Finally, Corporate and Other was down $0.16 per share driven by lower investment gains, unfavorable interest and increased O&M. The lower investment gains again are largely related to charge point gains that we had in 2021 that have reversed this year. Turning to Slide 13. I'm going to provide an update on our normalized load and performance for the quarter. And in general sense the AEP service territory has made significant momentum despite the well-publicized headwinds impacting the macro economy. Starting in the upper left corner, normalized residential sales increased by 1.2% in the second quarter and were up 1% year-to-date compared to 2021. This growth was comprised of growth in both customer counts and weather-normalized usage for both comparisons. While the results were mixed by operating the strongest residential growth was in the AEP Texas service territory, which consistently has the strongest customer growth across the AEP system due to favorable demographics. Moving to the right. Weather normalized commercial sales were up 4.1% compared to last year for both the quarter and year-to-date comparison. This consistent growth in 2022 is spread throughout the service territory. The growth in the commercial sales segment was spread across every operating company and nine of our 10 commercial sectors the only top commercial sector that is down versus last year's hospitals, which makes sense given that hospitalizations have dropped earlier in the pandemic. On the flip side, the fastest growing commercial sector is data centers were loaded up 32% compared to last year. Finally, focusing on the lower left corner, you see that industrial sales posted another strong quarter up 5% for the quarter, and up 5.3% year-to-date compared to last year. Industrial sales were up at every operating company in most of our largest sectors. We experienced double-digit growth in a number of key industries this quarter, including chemicals manufacturing and oil and gas extraction. We also saw robust growth in primary metals manufacturing, paper manufacturing, petroleum products, and coal mining. To summarize, we've experienced broad-based growth throughout the service territory on top of a recovery year. Every operating company has increased its sales in 2022 compared to last year. Growth is also consistent across every major retail class and most of the top commercial and industrial sectors served by AEP. We know the headlines are full of messages about a pending recession, but our sales statistics through the first half of the year show our service territory is still firmly in the expansion phase of the business cycle. We're mindful of the difficult monetary policy decisions being contemplated by the Federal Reserve to address inflationary pressures in the economy and recognize some of these decisions could impact our customer's growth opportunities going forward. But so far we're seeing little evidence that has dampened the economic activity within our footprint through the first two quarters of this year. Moving to slide 14, I want to provide additional context to the load we experience a\u0302\u0080\u0093 we've experienced so far in 2022, and how it compares to our pre-pandemic sales levels. Starting with the chart on the left, the bars show how the second quarter sales compared to the pre-pandemic baseline in the second quarter of 2019. You'll notice that, the total retail sales are 3.6% above pre-pandemic levels. Furthermore, every class is showing higher sales than before the pandemic began. This means that every class is fully recovered and is in the expansion phase of the business cycle. The chart on the right shows the same comparisons for the year-to-date period. You'll notice that, while the numbers are slightly different the message is the same. Through June AEP's normalized sales are 2% above the pre-pandemic levels. And just like the quarter, every class has exceeded pre-pandemic levels on a year-to-date basis. Last year's strong growth numbers were expected considering it was a recovery year from the pandemic shutdowns. This year's growth is perhaps even more impressive considering, the growth as compared to a strong recovery year. We'll continue to monitor the economy and its impact on our load over the summer months and we'll provide the results of our updated load forecast this fall. So let's move on to slide 15 to discuss the company's capitalization and liquidity position. On a GAAP basis, our debt-to-capital ratio decreased 0.1% from the prior quarter to 61.4%. Taking a look at the upper right quadrant on this page, you'll see that our FFO to debt metric stands at 13.4% on a Moody's basis, and 13.3% on a GAAP basis, which is a decrease of 0.3% and 0.4% respectively from the prior quarter. The slight decrease can be attributed to an increase in deferred fuel balances, as well as a slight increase in balance sheet debt. As we stated on our last earnings call, we anticipate trending toward our targeted FFO to debt range of 14% to 15% as the year progresses. You can see our liquidity summary on the lower right of the slide our five-year $4 billion bank revolver and our two-year $1 billion revolving credit facility support our liquidity position, which remains strong at $4.7 billion. On the qualified pension front, while our funding status decreased 0.8% during the quarter, it remains comfortably strong at 105.6%. Negative returns on risk seeking and fixed income assets during the quarter were the primary drivers of the funded status decrease. However rising interest rates caused plan liabilities to decrease which provided a favorable offset to the negative asset returns.  So, let's go to Slide 16 for a quick recap of today's message. The second quarter has provided a solid foundation for the rest of 2022 and we are reaffirming our operating earnings guidance range of $4.87 to $5.07. We continue to be committed to our long-term growth rate of 6% to 7%. We continue to work through the Kentucky Power sale to Liberty and are on-track for a closing later this summer and we'll be launching the auction process for our unregulated contracted renewables business, no later than early September.  So, before I hand things over to the operator, I'd like to mention one thing. We had previously announced that we would be having an investor conference this year and we've set a date for that. As Nick mentioned we'll be hosting at our investor conference in New York City on October 4. So, we really do appreciate your time and attention today. With that I'm going to ask the operator to open the call so we can hear what's on your mind and take any questions that you have. Shar, this is Julie. As an anecdote, when we initially made this announcement, I can tell you that not only was I receiving calls Nick was receiving calls. Chuck Zebula whose team is running the process was receiving calls so a lot of inbound calls coming in. And as far as what you can anticipate, I get it it's a shorter time line assuming we launch at the very latest in early September we should be able to come back to you by October 4th with color on how that process is going. And you're right. I mean there are other folks in the market as well. That's why I think we need to get out there as soon as we can and get business taken care of. So that is absolutely the objective. And stay tuned we'll have more color to share with you. Just to provide you a little more color if you're trying to model, aside from giving you market price point. We did include in the presentation today on slide number 44, the breakdown of all of the projects that are included in the portfolio. You'll see that we've essentially removed Flat Ridge 2 like we talked about today, as it relates to asset value and that type of thing that's on our balance sheet. If you look at our balance sheet, today our asset value associated with the portfolio as it stands is about $2.1 billion. The equity position is about $1.4 billion. We do have some projects, debt and tax equity that totaled about $272 million. So, you can plug that into your model as well. And then, we do get the question around how much did this contribute to earnings. So, for 2022 for the Generation & Marketing segment, which is $0.31 total for our guidance, kind of that midpoint about $0.13 to $0.17 relates specifically to this portfolio. So you can kind of begin to back into whatever valuation you want to assign to it. And there is a very low tax basis associated with it, but we do have some capacity to absorb a tax gain, because we've got some credits sitting on the bench that we can use to offset that. So, don't view that as problematic or seriously gating for us because it's not -- we'll be able to hurdle over that. We're good. You're good. No worries there. So, no change in that modeling or those assumptions. We're good. Michael, maybe a little more help there too on PSO in particular. We've got securitization that we'll be completing here next month. So in August for the storm Yuri cost, so that should help to alleviate some of this pressure as well. And we'll be filing another base case. So stay tuned for that as well. And as Nick mentioned, just some refinement around utilization of different rate adjustment clauses, et cetera, not only in West Virginia, Virginia but then also as we take a look at SWEPCO, we still have the outstanding component that's not included in rates. So we've got different ways to get after it and you'll see us talk more about that as we come at you here on October 4. So stay tuned. Yes Michael. So that PPA with Cardinal goes I think through 2028 to give you a endpoint on that as well."

        "content": "Operator: \nNick Akins: \u2026fourth quarter, we are maintaining that momentum and delivering strong results for the first quarter of 2022 with operating earnings for the first quarter coming in at $1.22 per share or $616 million. Earlier this year, we made a number of refinements to our strategic initiatives and financial targets. We raised our 2022 operating earnings guidance range and increased our long-term earnings growth rate and we have hit the ground running in 2022. Today we are reaffirming our 2022 full-year operating earnings guidance. As a reminder, we are guiding to a range of $4.87 to $5.07 per share for 2022 with a $4.97 midpoint and we also reaffirm our long-term earnings growth rate of 6% to 7%. As you'll recall, we announced several significant developments in connection with last quarter's earnings. In addition to lifting our 14% to 15% FFO to total debt targeted range, we announced on the decision to sell all or a portion of contracted renewable assets within the unregulated business. The announcement of this strategic divestiture allowed us to recalibrate our five-year capital plan of $38 billion with a $1.5 billion shift to transmission and the elimination of growth capital in the contracted renewables business. We are already seeing the positive impacts of these initiatives in quarter one, and we look forward to continue to execute in these important areas throughout the course of the year. We also expect to maintain positive momentum in our economic outlook as we work collaboratively with states to drive economic expansion in our service territory. There is more to come on all that, but I first want to take a step back and highlight some of the other proactive work our team has done. As macro trends continue to affect our industry in the economic landscape at large, we are focused on de-risking our platform and elevating our strategy to enhance shareholder value. For example, given lingering global supply chain issues, we are diversifying our mix of suppliers in order to reduce the impact on our capital investment plan. As a result, AEP has experienced minimal customer or business disruptions to-date. With these significant initiatives underway and a track record of thinking creatively, it is truly a team effort and we are lucky to have one of the most talented teams in the business. Regarding Kentucky, we expect to complete the sale of Kentucky Power and AEP Kentucky TransCo to Liberty in the second quarter of this year. A regulatory timeline of the sale is on Slide 7 of today's presentation. In 2021, we announced a comprehensive strategic review of our Kentucky operations resulting in an agreement to sell those assets for $2.846 billion enterprise value. Both parties have been steadily working to obtain the necessary approvals to complete this transaction, which is in the public interest. The Kentucky Public Service Commission hearing was held on March 28th and March 29th. We know that Liberty is well positioned to serve Kentucky customers and are confident our employees in Kentucky will continue to thrive within an organization that prioritizes safety and operational excellence. Based on the statutory requirements, we continue to expect to receive a decision from the commission on the sale transfer no later than May 4th. FERC approval on the sale transfer is also in process. Earlier this week, FERC notified us of a need for more information in the 203 transfer application. This request is not unusual as FERC looks to ensure its record is complete by seeking additional information. We do not believe this request will impact the closing of the deal in the second quarter. Once a decision is made by the state level next week, we will provide the requested information back to FERC, we'll plan to ask FERC to abide by the original approval timeline to ensure Kentucky customers receive benefits from this transaction in a timely manner. Another significant regulatory milestone for the transaction is gaining approvals on the Mitchell operating agreement, which were the condition of the final sale transfer. Both Kentucky and West Virginia are aware that updated Mitchell operating agreement approvals are needed to put in place the commission orders on environmental compliance issued 2021. The Kentucky Public Service Commission hearings were held on March 1st and March 30th and the West Virginia Public Service Commission was held on April 7th. Parties providing options allowing flexibility for both states to collaborate and reach a common agreement as Kentucky continues to wind down interest in Mitchell plant post 2028. We expect to receive commission decisions on the Mitchell agreements on an expedited basis in May of this year. We plan to file the related FERC application after State Commission approvals. Throughout this process, we have established a strong record of benefits of this transaction. Most notably, the clear and measurable customer benefits that we see. Okay. Now, moving onto the contracted renewable asset sale. During our fourth quarter earnings call in February, we announced the decision to sell all or a portion of our unregulated contracted renewables portfolio to simplify and de-risk the company and allow us to focus on our regulated business. Our portfolio consists of 1,600 megawatts of unregulated contracted renewables, the sale of which will help facilitate the investment of 16,000 megawatts of regulated renewables through 2030. In the last couple of months, we have made significant progress on this opportunity, including working with an advisor preparing outside consultant reviews of the technical and market aspects of our portfolio and evaluating our sales strategy and timing. Interest in the sale of the portfolio has been robust. The sale provides a unique opportunity to acquire large operating wind portfolio complemented with some solar operations as well. We expect to launch the sales process sometime during the second half of 2022, likely in the August-September timeframe and can be accelerated or deaccelerated as needed. Additionally, we are pleased to announce that we assigned a term sheet to sell most of our wind and solar development portfolio including five sites which are located in the Southwest Power Pool. We have also executed an agreement to sell a solar development site here in Ohio. Financial details of these upcoming sales are confidential and will not be disclosed, but demonstrate our commitment toward that execution. The reallocation of contracted renewables capital is assumed in our guidance, but utilization of proceeds is not yet reflected in guidance or our multi-year financing plan. We will seek to maximize transaction proceeds in the sale, avoid dilution and direct the proceeds to investments in our regulated business as we continue to enhance the transmission infrastructure and move forward with our generation fleet transformation. Looking ahead, we will continue our track record of optimizing the portfolio and reallocating capital to our regulated business where we continue to see a meaningful long-term opportunity for growth. AEP is making significant progress as well in our transition to a clean energy future. In fact, we already have several initiatives underway in line with our sustainability goals and through our regulated renewables execution. Details can be seen on Slides 8 and 9. In March we commissioned our third and final North Central Wind site Traverse Wind Energy Center, which is the largest single wind farm built at one time in North America and one of the largest wind facilities worldwide completing the $2 billion trifecta investment that includes Sundance and the Maverick Wind Energy centers. Combined, they are providing 14,084 megawatts of clean energy to our customers in Arkansas, Louisiana, and Oklahoma. North Central will save customers in an estimated $3 billion in electricity costs over the next 30 years. In March, we also issued a request for proposal at I&M for 800 megawatts of wind and 500 megawatts of solar. Additional RFPs are in process simultaneously at APCo, PSO and SWEPCO with expected in-service dates of 2024 to 2025. We expect to make a regulatory filing in the second quarter of this year related to the SWEPCO's June 2021 RFP. These are long-term investments, not just for our business in our local communities, but for the global environment as well. Through our current state of coal retirements, we are progressing towards our target of an 80% carbon emissions reduction rate by 2030 and net zero by 2050. Achieving this goal is an integral part of our long-term strategy to prioritize regulated investment opportunities and transition our generation portfolio. Our plans are a very well thought out, continue the movement to a clean energy economy, but remain firmly grounded in the principles of resiliency, reliability and affordability while recognizing the value of diverse portfolio of resources, particularly given today's world of energy related volatility. Last year we set regulatory foundations in a series of rate cases across multiple jurisdictions. Regulated ROE as of March 31st, 2022, is it a steady 9.2% as we continue to work through regulatory cases and focus on reducing authorized versus actual ROE spreads. I&M obtained Commission approval in February on our Indiana base case settlement. Ohio oral arguments of APCo's 2020 Virginia base case appeal were held in March at the Virginia Supreme Court with anticipated final decision this year. We expect to see Commission decisions as well on SWEPCO's rate cases this year in both Arkansas and Louisiana and look forward to keeping you informed on that progress too. Related to FERC, we command the commission for moving forward with proposed reforms to transmission planning and cost allocation. First proposed rulemaking aligns with our goals of developing a more robust reliable and flexible grid of the future that ultimately reduces cost to customers and strengthens economic development in the communities in which we serve. We believe many of these reforms are needed to build the infrastructure necessary to transition our generation fleet in the most efficient and cost-effective way possible and achieve our carbon reduction goals. We look forward to continuing to work collaboratively with the commission on this, and any subsequent rule makings and with the RTOs on implementing any new requirements. At the conclusion of our fourth quarter call, I told you all that AEP stood poised to make even greater headway in 2022 and I think it's fair to say we are making good on that promise. Capitalizing on our momentum from 2021, we have continued to execute against our strategic objective steadily and successfully. As we think about what's next for this year and beyond, we hope to further modernize our energy grid in order to supply a reliable cleaner low cost resources for all the communities we serve. We will also consider further asset rotation through the lens of de-risking and simplification and we'll evaluate any and all value additive potential activities as we focus on our regulated business. As I've said before, AEP is in a very unique position, the largest transmission system, one of the largest renewables build outs and the diverse territory to adjust from the risk of supply chain, load forecast, regulatory risks et cetera, AEP is the very definition of consistency and opportunity. We at AEP, as well as our shareholders and customers hold ourselves accountable on the continual execution of all of these strategic objectives. To paraphrase a big hit by the police, every breath you take, every move you make, every step you take, we'll be watching AEP, and as our CFO would say, we've got this, Julie?\nJulie Sloat: Thank you Nick, thanks Darcy. It's good to be with you this morning. Thanks for dialing in everyone. I'm going to walk us through our first quarter results, share some updates on our service territory load and finish with commentary on our credit metrics, liquidity, as well as some thoughts on our guidance, financial targets and recap our current portfolio management activities underway. So let's go to Slide 10, which shows the comparison of GAAP to operating earnings for the quarter. GAAP earnings for the first quarter were $1.41 per share compared to $1.16 per share in 2021. There is a reconciliation of GAAP to operating earnings on Page 16 of the presentation today. Let's walk through our quarterly operating earnings performance by segment on Slide 11. Operating earnings for the first quarter totaled $1.22 per share or $616 million compared to $1.15 per share or $571 million in 2021. Operating earnings for the Vertically Integrated Utilities were $0.59 per share, up $0.05, favorable drivers included rate changes across multiple jurisdictions, normalized load and O&M. These were somewhat offset by increased depreciation, lower off-system sales and wholesale load. I'd like to take a second to talk about O&M and depreciation in particular because of a change in accounting related to Rockport Unit II lease at I&M, we'll see approximately a $0.05 contribution of favorable O&M consequence offset by $0.05 of unfavorable depreciation in each quarter of 2022, but no consequential earnings impact. And to be clear, this is entirely consistent with the 2022 guidance details we posted in our investor presentations earlier this year. I have more to share on load and load performance here in a minute, so hang with me on this. The Transmission and Distribution Utilities segment earned $0.30 per share, up $0.07 compared to last year, favorable drivers in this segment included rate changes in Texas and Ohio, normalized load and transmission revenue. Offsetting these favorable items were unfavorable O&M and depreciation. The AEP Transmission Holdco segment contributed $0.34 per share, down a $0.01compared to last year. Investment growth was favorable by $0.03, offset by $0.02 of mainly property taxes, driven by the increased investment and a penny of income taxes. This is in line with the guidance that we provided to you earlier this year. You'll recall that our 2022 guidance had this segment down by $0.08 year-over-year as a result of the $0.12 of investment growth being more than offset by the annual true up that will occur in the second quarter and some unfavorable comparisons on the tax and financing side. As you know, this segment continues to be an important part of our 6% to 7% EPS growth. Generation and marketing produced $0.03 per share, down $0.03 from last year. The improvement in wholesale margins was more than offset by lower retail margins and reduced generation. You may recall that storm Yuri had an unfavorable impact on wholesale margins in the first quarter 2021. Finally, Corporate and Other was down a $0.01 per share, driven by increased O&M, lower investment gains and unfavorable interest. These were offset by favorable income taxes, the lower investment gains are largely related to charge point gains that we had in the first quarter of 2021. Turning to Slide 12, I'll provide an update on our normalized load performance for the quarter. In a general sense the AEP service territory is extremely fertile for economic growth right now, in fact as of the first quarter, our load has officially fully recovered from the pandemic recession and has now transitioned into the expansionary phase of this business cycle. Starting in the upper left corner, normalized residential sales increased by eight tenths of a percent, compared to the first quarter 2021. This growth was composed of growth in both customer counts and weather normalized usage for the quarter. While results were mixed by operating company, the strongest residential growth was at the AEP - was in the AEP service - AEP Texas service territory, which was partially influenced by the year-over-year comparison, given the customer outages driven by storm Yuri in the first quarter of 2021. A final data point to share regarding residential sales is that our first quarter sales were still 1.1% above their pre-pandemic levels, over two years after the pandemic began. This is driven by number of factors including higher numbers of people who are able to work remotely that used to work in offices prior to the pandemic. Moving to the right, weather normalized commercial sales increased by 4.2% compared to the first quarter of 2021, while growth in commercial sales is spread across every operating company and most industries, the largest increase in commercial sales is coming from data centers whose load was up 33% compared to last year. In addition, we continue to see strong recovery in the sectors most impacted by the pandemic such as hotels, schools, and churches, while real-estate has been booming throughout the entire pandemic. AEP normalize - AEP's normalized commercial sales in the first quarter were 2.5% above their pre-pandemic levels which shows that we've gone beyond recovery and are now in full expansion mode across the territory. If I can now focus your attention on the lower left corner, you'll see that industrial sales posted another very strong quarter up 5.6% compared to last year, industrial sales were up, at most operating companies and many of our largest sectors in the first quarter. We experienced double-digit growth in a number of key industries this quarter, including chemicals, manufacturing, oil and gas extraction, petroleum and petroleum products, we also saw robust growth in primary metals manufacturing, coal mining and food manufacturing. Having said that, first quarter industrial sales are still 1.6% behind their pre-pandemic levels. However, we have a large number of customer expansions that are expected to come online later this year and still fully expect to eclipse our pre-COVID industrial sales levels in 2022. We can continue to be confident in our full-year 2022 guidance for normalized retail load. While we certainly did not anticipate the Russian invasion in Ukraine when we developed the 2022 forecast. I'd like to remind you that AEP's service territory is uniquely positioned to benefit from higher energy prices, given the concentration of energy production that is located throughout the AEP footprint. Energy producers in our footprint have responded to higher energy prices, which has resulted in increased economic activity throughout this service territory. Finally, when you pull it all together in the lower-right corner, you'll see that AEP's normalized retail sales increased by 3.2% for the quarter. As I mentioned earlier, our load has gone beyond recovery mode and is in full expansion mode. For the quarter, every operating company posted higher normalized sales than last year. Furthermore, our first quarter retail sales were up, were 1.5% above their pre-pandemic levels. So 50 basis points above pre-pandemic levels. To use a sports analogy, I would say our load performance in the first quarter was in the zone. While there are many factors outside of our control that could influence our results, I want to stress that the positive load story we shared with you today is largely the result of intentional efforts by our employees to promote economic development as a part of our long-term strategy to strengthen the communities that we serve. We're fully aware of the increased uncertainty that exists in the macro economy, but if put into work that it takes to ensure that we continue to see growth in our service territory going forward. So let's go to Page 13 to check on the company's capitalization and liquidity position. On a GAAP basis, our debt to cap ratio increased 60 basis points from the prior quarter to 61.5%, primarily due to an increase in equity from our issuance of AEP common stock in March, which is consistent with our 2022 guidance as the $805 million - or the $805 million of equity units we issued three years ago converted to equity. Let's talk about our FFO to debt metric. Taking a look at the upper right quadrant on this page, you'll see our FFO to debt metric stands at 13.7% on both the Moody's and a GAAP basis, which is an increase of 3.8% and 3 9% respectively from the prior quarter. The metrics are calculated off of the 12 month rolling FFO total, so the increase in FFO to debt is mainly a result of the fact that the cash flow drag from February 2021 winter storm Yuri has now dropped off the cash flow from operations calculations. This improvement has significantly narrowed the gap toward achieving our FFO to debt target range of 14% to 15% . As we stated on the last earnings call, we anticipate trending toward this target range as the year progresses. Let's take a quick moment to visit our liquidity summary on the lower right side of Slide 13. Our five-year $4 billion bank revolver and two-year $1 billion revolving credit facility support our liquidity position, which remained strong at $3.8 billion. Switching gears, our qualified pension funding increased 1.6% during the quarter 106.4%. The rise in interest rates, the decreased plan liabilities was the primary driver for this quarter's gain and funded status. Let's go to Slide 14. This quarter has provided a solid foundation for the rest of 2022 and we're reaffirming our operating earnings guidance range of $4.87 per share to $5.07 per share. We continue to be committed to our long-term growth rate of 6% to 7% that we updated on our last earnings call. We're working through the Kentucky Power sale to Liberty and expect to close in the second quarter. And as Nick mentioned, we've signed an agreement to sell a solar development site in Ohio and have entered into a term sheet to sell five additional wind and solar sites in SPP on the unregulated side of the business. Additionally, we're preparing to market the unregulated contracted renewables portfolio in the second half of this year and are receiving a significant amount of interest on this. Beyond the portfolio optimization activities underway, we remain focused on the fundamentals, which are executing on the regulated renewables plan, disciplined capital allocation, and securing positive regulatory outcomes. Before we break, I want to mention one last thing before we get to your questions. And that's to remind everyone that while we have not yet set the date, we will be hosting an Investor conference sometime in late September, early fall timeframe to give you a broader AEP update. We truly do appreciate your time and attention today. With that I'm going to ask the operator to open the call, so we can hear what's on your mind and answer the questions that you have.\nOperator:  Our first question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith at Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith:  Maybe let's start with this, just in terms of the timing of the renewable sale here. Can you talk a little bit about how the AD/CVD steps could impact that, I mean is that  on just your sense of the ability to get it done? Just any comments on that, and or implications again I assume that was separately related, how do you think about the timing of proceeds here, admittedly this is a little bit faster than what we had perceived, just talk about the proceeds from Liberty and this coming in perhaps little bit faster than perhaps the equity issuances in your forward plan what you would suggest?\nNick Akins: Yes Julien, so most of our assets are wind assets, so - and as we go forward with the transactions, we don't see any issues with that. And as a matter of fact, even on the regulated side, the timing of which we actually need assets for solar and that kind of thing comes later. So it's a 2024/2025 timeframe. So on both sides of the ledger we're in good shape from that perspective and these assets, obviously we're going to try to time it appropriately as we talked about the large portion of the 1.6 gigawatts or the 1,600 megawatts, they will be marketed in the third quarter. And I'd say, we're getting very robust. It's amidst very robust interest on - really on both sides, strategics and in terms of any type of private equity that kind of thing. So, it's really to us, the process will continue and there is nothing stopping us. So, we're in good shape from that perspective. And then your second part of your question, Julie, did you have that part?\nJulie Sloat: Yes and Julien, let me know if I'm not answering this directly or if you need a little more granularity. Specifically as it relates to dollar flows associated with any type of transaction that we enter into, so today you're going to talk about the fact that we've had a term sheet in place for five development sites, those dollars are still small. And so, we'll see those, show up eventually priced second quarter or third quarter in operating earnings. But obviously - not even disclosing those not a needle mover for us and not going to change the earnings guidance or anything like that, so not to worry on that front. And then as it relates specifically to the broader unregulated renewables contracted portfolio, we'll start the marketing effort in the second half of this year. Obviously, we'll continue as we have a little more detail to share. We do have an upcoming on investor conference, so stay tuned for that, and then we'll be able to navigate any potential proceeds from transactions. As you know, we don't - even know exactly how that's ultimately going to look, do we sell them as an entire portfolio? Do we sell them in different pieces? So that's to be determined, so standby on that. And then obviously, we continue to work through the Kentucky process. We had expected to close that - we're trending toward the second quarter. As Nick mentioned and I mentioned in my opening remarks, that's already reflected as it relates to Kentucky bringing dollars in, in our plan. You may recall that we eliminated about $1.4 billion of equity that we originally had in our 2022 guidance. So I think we're moving on track. Let me know if there is something I didn't address there.\nNick Akins: Yes and since we're really moving on the universal scale assets, they're project specific. So we can go through that process and time at anyway that we wish to do it, so that's - and actually they are actual pretty quickly. So, we'll go through that process and will define that better and that will be part of our Analyst Day discussion.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Now speaking Analyst Day discussion, just super quick if I can, an important point. How do you think about just approaching your customers directly with energy prices environment, doing well on industrial and C&I sales growth, presumably your customers are interested. We heard this from Entergy, can you kind of elaborate how you're thinking about that opportunity here in this elevated environment as a further angle to your renewable aspiration?\nNick Akins: Well, certainly the renewables are a key part of being able to really mitigate cost to consumers going forward. So, from an industrial standpoint and manufacturing standpoint, we're going to see a lot of that movement to our territory, because when you think about onshoring, when you think about strategic reviews of supply chain actions that need to occur within this country, that's going to occur within our territory. So our focus will be, I think from the renewable side, particularly the regulated renewable side to be able to continue to progress on that is a benefit because a clear benefit for customers and certainly North Central showed that, but I think from an industrial standpoint, it's going to look very good for us. We have the resources for capacity and when you layer in the renewables for the incremental needs of capacity, it's really the best of both worlds to provide reliable secure supply to our industrials and really at a competitive price. So I think we're in great shape from that perspective going forward.\nOperator: Next we'll go to Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research.\nSteve Fleishman: That is enthusiastic for me, sorry. So, just on the Kentucky process, there does seem to be a decent amount of people that want different things on the Mitchell operating agreement. Can you just talk to your confidence in resolving those issues by the second quarter and just because - and just maybe frame the issues and how you think they can get resolved?\nNick Akins: Yes, obviously there has been a lot of focus on the Mitchell agreements themselves and we've certainly tried to accommodate the multiple parties that are involved and made as flexible as possible and obviously the issue is 2028 and how you reconcile that going forward. And from a state perspective, I think we're in a good place, because it does provide the flexibility to find whatever value proposition there is at that point and there also is optionality around the ability to potentially separate the units to allow each individual commission to make their own decisions relative to these units. So, I think it's positioned very well. There's been a lot of dialog, lot of settlement discussions associated with that and a lot of - of course there's a lot of varied opinions, but at the end of the day, we have to do this because we have two commissions that are going in different directions relative to the life of the Mitchell plant. And I think what we've arrived to is a very credible balanced view that allows the optionality that the parties need going forward, so. And of course, we certainly will continue to focus on the ELG and CCR expense associated with that in the appropriate manner, and that will improve the optionality going forward to where decision is going to be made at the appropriate time. But I would say we're in a good place as we expect, we expect the Mitchell approvals to occur very quickly after the transaction approval.\nSteve Fleishman: Okay, great. Thank you. And then just, you've been pretty good and right about Federal, the BBB legislation kind of to get done or whatever you want to call it these days, just curious if you have any latest thoughts and updates there - has anything changed?\nNick Akins: I'll say, I'll say this. Certainly, Senator Manchin is at the center of all of this, but there also is, I think from their original infrastructure package, a group of senators who were coming together to try to focus on some pretty substantial issues and really when you think about Senator Manchin being on both the Armed Services Committee and the Energy Committee and knowing the Ukraine situation and the focus on energy as it relates to it. I think you're going to see at least an attempt to a lot of focus on how to support natural gas, LNG, expansion for pipeline capability, and then of course he has also talked about the climate provisions, and I think there'll be a lot of interest too in the technologies of the hydrogen hubs and particularly in West Virginia. And then there is obviously Murkowski, Barrasso, there is others that they are engaging in that discussion. The ITCs, PTCs, the climate provisions that the industry is looking for, I think there is some bipartisan level of support for that. So the question really is, can they get together before - really before Memorial Day. And if there is still talking after Memorial Day it's probably a positive indication. My own personal belief is, if it's not successful, we'll probably see in the 11th hour type of - at the end of the year relative to ITCs and PTCs and perhaps Steve, an expansion of those. So I think you'll see us attempted a smaller bill, you'll still get hung up with the pay for, particularly with Manchin wanting to get it paid for and it's obviously a different, different view on that. So, but there is probably some element of recognition that something has to be done to have this country focus on the security of supply, not only for our sales that the Ukraine situation is demonstrated, but also for Europe and the rest of the world. So that's probably the impetus of getting something done and will define the framework of whether something gets done or not. If it doesn't after the election, I think like I said, it's the 11th hour or perhaps the RS and Treasury make adjustments based upon what's happened relative to supply chain activities. So, I think that would be my view of where things are going.\nOperator: Next we will go to Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead.\nShar Pourreza: Just - Nick, I just want to question on sort of the renewable comments. As we're looking kind of at your current RFPs that are in progress, there sort of a fairly healthy mix between wind and solar and storage. As we're thinking about kind of the upcoming 2021, 2022 RFPs, how are you sort of thinking about the potential tail risks around solar with circumvention investigation as pricing uncertainties, there is a lot of constraints. I guess these tail risk impact the mix for 2021 and 2022 and do you see any risk to the $8.2 billion you've allocated to renewables. I mean, we've already seen two peers provided some warnings around this and one this morning, as well as delays. So I'm just curious how this fits in with your plan?\nNick Akins: Yes. I don't see a lot of risk and the reason why is, because ours is more 2030, a lot of these projects will come into play in the 2024, 2025 timeframe. So, we have time for not only for the reviews of solar that's occurring with the administration, but also in terms of the supply chain activities just to level out somewhat before we're actually out back in the market acquiring these types of resources. So, we have a little bit of time, I think probably by first quarter next year we want to see things start to levelize so that we can get that process rolling. In the meantime, we got the resource planning filings that are being made. And keep in mind too, I made this point originally. These plans are really fungible from year to year based upon what we see in terms of the value proposition of each type of resources. So a lot of its wind, some of it's solar, solar picks up in the later years from a resource plan perspective, so there is time for the solar thing to get resolved. But even if it doesn't, that sales is probably going to be more wind or other types of resources that are put in place to support these objectives, because remember, they're driven by capacity requirements and we'll continue to evaluate that process. And I'll take a step further too on this is, we've always said that if something were they happen relative to the renewables build out, we've got transmission and transmission we can soak up a lot of capital from that perspective because of the focus on providing better customer service, more resilient and reliable grid. So we have that optionality, but I'm not, I'm not even there yet. I think we're - we may be because the $8.2 billion we have in there assumes a certain percentage of those types of resources that we would own. That could be higher, transmission could be higher. So we have optionality around all of that. So I'm not concerned from an AEP perspective.\nShar Pourreza: Sure. The current gas price environment helps the economic argument.\nNick Akins: Absolutely, absolutely because the $3 billion for North Central was down on our previous gas forecast and if you look at that today, it's probably much larger. I think it's really looking good for customers.\nShar Pourreza: Got it, got it. And Nick, just from a financing perspective is, we're thinking about incremental spending that's going to come from these future RFPs. Can you just be a little bit more specific on your prepared comments around further asset sales, I mean, you look at all your OpCos that remain, I guess what could a structure look like, what remains?\nNick Akins: Yes, so - and the point I'm making is obviously we're going through the process step by step with the unregulated contracted renewables parts, so there is different parts of that business. And then of course, just - I think Kentucky was the first shot at it. There is a lot of optimization that can occur. We'll just have to evaluate against what the opportunities look like. And if we're - if we have, I mean, if we have underperforming utilities that don't figure prominently into the, into the clean energy transformation where we're actually attracting capital and being able to provide higher levels of return, then we have to look at it, so. So I'm just saying that, that process will continue regardless, not saying and actually we're already too deep, and I've talked about the number too deep. In terms of sales, Kentucky, we still have to get across and then the contracted renewables, we still get across. And then we'll see where we're at that point, based upon what we're getting in terms of the feedback of the RFPs because when these RFPs are ultimately get approved, they will know exactly what the ownership looks like, what the financial requirements are and we'll do what we've always done. We'll make sure that we're going through this process, making to invest in the right places and we will look at the portfolio and see what makes sense and what doesn't make sense for us to continue to optimize that for shareholder benefit.\nShar Pourreza: And then just one quick follow-up from Steve's question is, obviously we appreciate the confidence around the operating agreement in the Kentucky sale and reiterating the timing of the deal, but just to book ended, assuming there is maybe an adverse ruling or something that's not palatable. Can you just remind us, I think does Algonquin have a material adverse change clause? Is there a timeframe when they could walk away from the deal as we're just thinking about a book end?\nNick Akins: It's typical to have those kinds of provisions in that kind of agreement, but I can tell you that we and Algonquin are arm-in-arm getting this thing across the finish line. They very much want to own this property and they've actually - they've actually stepped up in a considerable way to provide customer benefits to make this transaction attractive to the policymakers and to the customers. So, and of course - I think a seminal event here obviously is May 4th where the commission will come out with an order and we will look at that order, we will make determinations on what conditions are in place and at that point in time, we'll make decisions on what it looks like. But I think from the public interest standpoint, the things that the commission also be looking at, this transaction is very, very good for Kentucky customers and if there are - I think everyone has to be sort of level headed about all of this because when you get through this process, you actually have a - you have a timeframe now for customer benefits to occur, substantial benefits and that's really a driver to get this thing done as quickly as possible, particularly in this energy related environment. So, I really don't anticipate that happening, but if it did, we'll do what we always do, we'll figure out what the options are and what the possibilities are and go from there. But right now we're not planning on that.\nOperator: And next we'll go to the line of Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan.\nJeremy Tonet: Just want to pivot a little bit towards transmission here, and given the MISO planning makes a little bit outside of you guys footprint, but also as you mentioned the FERC transmission planning and AEP stepping up CapEx towards Transmission here. Just wondering if you could dive in a little bit more as far as what's - which specific areas projects might materialize or any other color you can provide on specific transmission opportunities incremental at this point?\nNick Akins: Well, typically, and we've done this, we actually plan for around 130% of the budget for transmission. So we have 30% more projects that are occurring that we already have planned scoped ready to go. So layering in these multiple projects is a way for us to not only as opportunities arrive, as the metrics for financials continue to improve, we can layer in more of that, we can adjust to that based on projects that go one way or another. And then also, recently we were awarded in Texas - a large project in Texas that's also incremental. So, it was like $1.3 billion or so, but that - those are the kinds of things that will come to pass and we have every bit of opportunity related to transmission not only within our own system, but also in terms of the incremental systems around us, and that's why - and you asked about FERC and transmission, FERC obviously is taking the right steps relative to long-term planning, getting the framework for long-term planning put in place. That's an important part of the process to speed up some of the planning aspects to ensure that we are making the right investments at the right places. We continue and I think FERC will continue to look at, even in parallel, these issues of cost allocation of even the incentive mechanism, but also in terms of - and the regional planning which AEP will bode well in terms of that because just about everyone interfaces with us. So, as you look at some of these aspects, the more renewables that are needed, certainly the more retirements that are occurring across RTOs is all going to bode well for transmission investment. And we - what we see today is not we're going to see tomorrow. And then if FERC is doing the right thing, which we think they are, is going to bolster the ability for us to have a more consistent, congruent, clean-energy type system across this nation and you can't do that without AEP.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it, thank you for that. And just shifting gears towards O&M, just wondering what trends you're seeing there? It looks like it was a nickel benefit and Vertically Integrated a little bit of a headwind in transmission and distribution, and just wondering if you could dive in a little bit more as far as what different trends you're seeing in O&M across the business?\nJulie Sloat: Yes, happy to, Jeremy, this is Julie. I did call specifically out, the O&M trend in Vertically Integrated Utilities. There's a little bit of a flipping and twitching going on between O&M and depreciation associated with the Rockport Unit II lease. That's included in that 2022 guidance that we had provided to you back in February, we've updated that page for your, so entirely consistent. Yes, and we're absolutely watching O&M as we continue to navigate inflationary pressures, et cetera. At this point, I would tell you, I think we're right in line with where we thought we'd be. So we're keeping our fingers crossed and the team is working like heck to make sure that we've got supply chain and supply chain is being addressed et cetera. But at this point, that guidance that we gave to you stands pat. So nothing new to report other than the fact that the team is working really hard to make sure that those numbers coming in line to the extent that we have many new developments, we will surely keep you apprised.\nOperator: And next we'll go to Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI.\nDurgesh Chopra: Congrats, this is a solid print here. Most of my questions have been asked and answered. I just had a quick clarification as it relates to the Kentucky sale. The May 4th is when we get the order for transfer and control. Do we need to get sort of the Mitchell operating plan agreement before then or how does that play into the May 4th order?\nNick Akins: No, that will likely come after shortly thereafter and the way we've looked at it is that, obviously you want the transfer agreement done. But as far as the Mitchell agreement approval, we expect that to occur shortly thereafter with both commissions because it's an important aspect of it and something I think that really helps for the transaction side as well.\nDurgesh Chopra: I understand. So they can actually issue an order, the Kentucky commission can before actually - on the trend or before resolving the Michelle sort of ongoing dates of different things.\nNick Akins: That's right, that's right.\nOperator: And next we will go to Sophie Karp with Keybanc.\nSophie Karp: Good morning. Thank you for including the names here at the end.\nNick Akins: Yes, sure.\nSophie Karp: I have a couple of questions here. So, first on the load growth, obviously very healthy numbers here. Above other industrial regions in the country, probably at this point. I'm not sure if two quarters is a trend, but let's say, how long do you need to see those numbers in this range that it would be enacting for maybe your reset in the long-term expectations for what this load should, does it make sense?\nNick Akins: Yes, it's great question, because you're right, two quarters doesn't, it doesn't make a trend. But when you look at the economy within our service territory, we're seeing some very positive indicators for continued expansion and continued economic development. We are - our economic development people are extremely busy with multiple opportunities that are coming throughout our territory actually. And so we look at that, we look at the sort of - if you were to look at our pipeline of potential opportunities, it is extremely robust and that gives us confidence in terms of where we think the economy is going to continue to go within our service territory. And of course, we don't see an end to the work from home environment. So we're feeling much better about the prospects of a more robust residential side of things. And then on the industrial, like I said, the onshoring, the security aspects, the energy play within our service territory. The other aspects of what's going on within the territory with chemicals manufacturing and so forth, that pace has picked up markedly with expansions and new developments and some of them are still years away, like the NTL manufacturing here in Ohio in our territory. It's substantial there'll be 20 to 40 more companies associated with that. It will be locating. So you see those types of prerequisites that are being put in place, that gives us a lot of positive views about where we think the economy is going. We'll watch it, we'll continue to evaluate it. If we go to the third quarter, see the same thing and fourth quarter, the same thing, then you'll probably see some adjusting going on relative to the 2023 forecast, but that's - our load guy will have to tell us that, he is very objective and he's is a professor at one of the universities and he - usually he is - let me put it this way, he is probably more optimistic now than I've ever seen him and that's a good thing.\nJulie Sloat: Nick, if I can just jump in there with a finer point or two as well. And Sophie as I made comments in my opening remarks, we are still about 1.6% behind pre-pandemic levels on the industrial side of the house. But as I mentioned and as Nick mentioned, we do see expansions that are going to allow us to not only get pass that 1.6%, but to go beyond that. So we do expect to be beyond the pre-pandemic levels. And as a matter of fact, what we've seen so far this year in the first quarter is that six of our top 10 sectors were up. So that's a good indication. And then looking forward, we expect to see strong growth in oil and gas as new LNG operations ramp up in Texas and that began a few quarters back. So we're going to start to see the fruits of that efforts as well, but stay tuned. As you know, we typically, if we're going to revise guidance, we've historically done it once we get past our peak season, which is summer, but to be perfectly candid, we're looking at this constantly. So we will be back to you if there is anything that requires us to get new information in front of you, because we'll definitely want to take advantage of that.\nSophie Karp: Perfect. Thank you. My other question is on the RFPs, not to beat the dead horse, I guess, but I can appreciate the fact that the projects are expected to be commissioned in 2024, 2025 timeframe, which is a couple of years away to sort out the physical disruption of equipment availability, et cetera. But in terms of pricing, what should be - typically bid into those RFPs, like what do you think they should be coming in terms of pricing. Does that make it difficult with volatility in the pricing of equipment, particularly solar, and unpredictability really where we are with the solar market or storage market might be a year from now. Does it make the, I guess, the process more complicated or addressed with it.\nNick Akins: Yes, I think it will make it more complicated, but not insurmountable, because whatever increases you may see from a solar perspective, the overall project benefits will still be part of it. Now it may change the relationship between wind and solar in the integrated resource plan. Solar may come later than what we thought because if wind continues to continues to progress as you go in our resource plan, a lot of it was when to start and then eventually it's based on pricing and everything else, solar would start to pick up and at some point overcome the wind asset and then you move into other technologies. That condition may change based on that, but you also, I mean, you'll probably see that in the framework of increased gas prices too. So really the renewables will be relative to each other not in terms of relative to whether they'll get done or not. So, and I really think we'll be in good shape from that perspective. The other part two is that, when you look at the other resources, really what you're doing is, you're putting in renewables and you're also layering in some natural gas in the plan to really give it 24/7 supplier. Natural gas also is a placeholder for other types of resources, whether it's hydrogen, whether it's small modular reactors, whatever that comes about with new technologies and the grid optimization itself will be a major part of that as well with transmission. So there is a multitude of answers there that will occur. But, yes, you're right, you would suspect solar, there'll be some short-term perturbation from an increase perspective that we'll have to deal with. But in the overall scheme of things, when you look at long-term, it will still be positive.\nOperator: And our last question comes from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.\nMichael Lapides: Nick, thanks for taking my questions. I have two and they are a little bit unrelated. I'm going to the appendices of your slide deck. I'm looking at what you used to call kind of, I don't know, the money chart, the ROE chart for trailing 12 month, the equalizer chart, thank you. And one of the things that stands out as public serve Oklahoma, just curious if you can talk a little bit about PSO and a little bit about maybe SWEPCO in APCo where the earned ROEs are decent bit below 8% and just kind of how you think about the trajectory of quote-unquote fixing the split between earned and authorized.\nNick Akins: Yes, so at SWEPCO we have rate cases there in two of the jurisdictions and PSO, we will have a rate case as well. And, but keep in mind too, we just brought in all of the renewables in play, particularly a large chunk of it for PSO and SWEPCO. So that's now rolling through rates and so we expect that to continue to pick up, those are - and really when you look at the industrial and manufacturing economic development part of what's going on in those jurisdictions, they are still very positive. So, and of course we continue to invest heavily in those jurisdiction so, and that's why we have equalizer chart that some of the peer lower until we file rate cases and when the investment changes itself, so we're not concerned by that at this point and actually we see PSO and the SWEPCO jurisdictions with Arkansas, Louisiana, in particular, very favorable.\nMichael Lapides: Got it, okay. And then one follow-up and this may be just a checking in on what was in our original guidance, but just curious, for the transmission segment, how much do you think  down a little bit on a net income and EPS perspective year-over-year for the first quarter. Can you remind me what you think the earnings growth trajectory is for the transmission segment in 2022 relative to 2021 and kind of the drivers behind that?\nJulie Sloat: Yes, and so, Michael, I don't have my guidance sheet in front of me for 2022, it's in our presentation that we put out there and our fourth quarter call, but effectively and actually somebody is going to hand it well, and going to hand it to me. But effectively, what we were anticipating was that year-over-year we'd be up about $0.08 and that was driven by investment growth being up $0.12. I mentioned this actually in my opening comments as well and then we had a true up that would occur and we knew that was going to be embedded. That's why we have it in the guidance, that's associated with the fact --\nNick Akins: The true up was positive the previous year, and yes, sort of double count.\nJulie Sloat: It would - so it's flipping back and forth so. So we had two reasons for that true up. I mean, we had spent just a little bit under our budget for the prior year and as you know, we got forward looking rate. So that's a catch up there and then we had higher load, so we had a catch up there too, so we get a little bit of a double-counting there. But that's why we had the 11% reduction in that true up. And then we had other financing and income taxes that kind of brought that number back down to, flip it to a negative $0.08. So in aggregate, for 2022, we assume that we'd have about $1.27 from that particular segment, again driven by investment growth, offset by a couple of these other bucket items that I threw out there. We are on that trajectory. And that's why I specifically called that out in my opening comments, because if I was trying to model this, that's exactly what I'd be asking.\nMichael Lapides: So then the growth would be more into the year --?\nJulie Sloat: It's, I guess, it's priced fair enough. We're a little short on the first quarter. But yes, I would just expect that we'll continue to see transmission investment continue to plug along through the remainder of the year, at this point, we don't have any changes as it relates to that specific guidance. And we have it out there year-by-year in our guidance forecast and assumptions pages in our traditional Investor Relations materials. Happy to walk through with you offline, if you'd like to do that too.\nMichael Lapides: I appreciate it. Thank you guys. Super-duper helpful and much appreciated you taking the time to get to my questions.\nNick Akins: Sure thing. Thanks Michael.\nDarcy Reese: Thank you for joining us on today's call.

            "content": "Yes Julien, so most of our assets are wind assets, so - and as we go forward with the transactions, we don't see any issues with that. And as a matter of fact, even on the regulated side, the timing of which we actually need assets for solar and that kind of thing comes later. So it's a 2024/2025 timeframe. So on both sides of the ledger we're in good shape from that perspective and these assets, obviously we're going to try to time it appropriately as we talked about the large portion of the 1.6 gigawatts or the 1,600 megawatts, they will be marketed in the third quarter. And I'd say, we're getting very robust. It's amidst very robust interest on - really on both sides, strategics and in terms of any type of private equity that kind of thing. So, it's really to us, the process will continue and there is nothing stopping us. So, we're in good shape from that perspective. And then your second part of your question, Julie, did you have that part? Yes and since we're really moving on the universal scale assets, they're project specific. So we can go through that process and time at anyway that we wish to do it, so that's - and actually they are actual pretty quickly. So, we'll go through that process and will define that better and that will be part of our Analyst Day discussion. Well, certainly the renewables are a key part of being able to really mitigate cost to consumers going forward. So, from an industrial standpoint and manufacturing standpoint, we're going to see a lot of that movement to our territory, because when you think about onshoring, when you think about strategic reviews of supply chain actions that need to occur within this country, that's going to occur within our territory. So our focus will be, I think from the renewable side, particularly the regulated renewable side to be able to continue to progress on that is a benefit because a clear benefit for customers and certainly North Central showed that, but I think from an industrial standpoint, it's going to look very good for us. We have the resources for capacity and when you layer in the renewables for the incremental needs of capacity, it's really the best of both worlds to provide reliable secure supply to our industrials and really at a competitive price. So I think we're in great shape from that perspective going forward. Yes, obviously there has been a lot of focus on the Mitchell agreements themselves and we've certainly tried to accommodate the multiple parties that are involved and made as flexible as possible and obviously the issue is 2028 and how you reconcile that going forward. And from a state perspective, I think we're in a good place, because it does provide the flexibility to find whatever value proposition there is at that point and there also is optionality around the ability to potentially separate the units to allow each individual commission to make their own decisions relative to these units. So, I think it's positioned very well. There's been a lot of dialog, lot of settlement discussions associated with that and a lot of - of course there's a lot of varied opinions, but at the end of the day, we have to do this because we have two commissions that are going in different directions relative to the life of the Mitchell plant. And I think what we've arrived to is a very credible balanced view that allows the optionality that the parties need going forward, so. And of course, we certainly will continue to focus on the ELG and CCR expense associated with that in the appropriate manner, and that will improve the optionality going forward to where decision is going to be made at the appropriate time. But I would say we're in a good place as we expect, we expect the Mitchell approvals to occur very quickly after the transaction approval. I'll say, I'll say this. Certainly, Senator Manchin is at the center of all of this, but there also is, I think from their original infrastructure package, a group of senators who were coming together to try to focus on some pretty substantial issues and really when you think about Senator Manchin being on both the Armed Services Committee and the Energy Committee and knowing the Ukraine situation and the focus on energy as it relates to it. I think you're going to see at least an attempt to a lot of focus on how to support natural gas, LNG, expansion for pipeline capability, and then of course he has also talked about the climate provisions, and I think there'll be a lot of interest too in the technologies of the hydrogen hubs and particularly in West Virginia. And then there is obviously Murkowski, Barrasso, there is others that they are engaging in that discussion. The ITCs, PTCs, the climate provisions that the industry is looking for, I think there is some bipartisan level of support for that. So the question really is, can they get together before - really before Memorial Day. And if there is still talking after Memorial Day it's probably a positive indication. My own personal belief is, if it's not successful, we'll probably see in the 11th hour type of - at the end of the year relative to ITCs and PTCs and perhaps Steve, an expansion of those. So I think you'll see us attempted a smaller bill, you'll still get hung up with the pay for, particularly with Manchin wanting to get it paid for and it's obviously a different, different view on that. So, but there is probably some element of recognition that something has to be done to have this country focus on the security of supply, not only for our sales that the Ukraine situation is demonstrated, but also for Europe and the rest of the world. So that's probably the impetus of getting something done and will define the framework of whether something gets done or not. If it doesn't after the election, I think like I said, it's the 11th hour or perhaps the RS and Treasury make adjustments based upon what's happened relative to supply chain activities. So, I think that would be my view of where things are going. Yes. I don't see a lot of risk and the reason why is, because ours is more 2030, a lot of these projects will come into play in the 2024, 2025 timeframe. So, we have time for not only for the reviews of solar that's occurring with the administration, but also in terms of the supply chain activities just to level out somewhat before we're actually out back in the market acquiring these types of resources. So, we have a little bit of time, I think probably by first quarter next year we want to see things start to levelize so that we can get that process rolling. In the meantime, we got the resource planning filings that are being made. And keep in mind too, I made this point originally. These plans are really fungible from year to year based upon what we see in terms of the value proposition of each type of resources. So a lot of its wind, some of it's solar, solar picks up in the later years from a resource plan perspective, so there is time for the solar thing to get resolved. But even if it doesn't, that sales is probably going to be more wind or other types of resources that are put in place to support these objectives, because remember, they're driven by capacity requirements and we'll continue to evaluate that process. And I'll take a step further too on this is, we've always said that if something were they happen relative to the renewables build out, we've got transmission and transmission we can soak up a lot of capital from that perspective because of the focus on providing better customer service, more resilient and reliable grid. So we have that optionality, but I'm not, I'm not even there yet. I think we're - we may be because the $8.2 billion we have in there assumes a certain percentage of those types of resources that we would own. That could be higher, transmission could be higher. So we have optionality around all of that. So I'm not concerned from an AEP perspective. Absolutely, absolutely because the $3 billion for North Central was down on our previous gas forecast and if you look at that today, it's probably much larger. I think it's really looking good for customers. Yes, so - and the point I'm making is obviously we're going through the process step by step with the unregulated contracted renewables parts, so there is different parts of that business. And then of course, just - I think Kentucky was the first shot at it. There is a lot of optimization that can occur. We'll just have to evaluate against what the opportunities look like. And if we're - if we have, I mean, if we have underperforming utilities that don't figure prominently into the, into the clean energy transformation where we're actually attracting capital and being able to provide higher levels of return, then we have to look at it, so. So I'm just saying that, that process will continue regardless, not saying and actually we're already too deep, and I've talked about the number too deep. In terms of sales, Kentucky, we still have to get across and then the contracted renewables, we still get across. And then we'll see where we're at that point, based upon what we're getting in terms of the feedback of the RFPs because when these RFPs are ultimately get approved, they will know exactly what the ownership looks like, what the financial requirements are and we'll do what we've always done. We'll make sure that we're going through this process, making to invest in the right places and we will look at the portfolio and see what makes sense and what doesn't make sense for us to continue to optimize that for shareholder benefit. It's typical to have those kinds of provisions in that kind of agreement, but I can tell you that we and Algonquin are arm-in-arm getting this thing across the finish line. They very much want to own this property and they've actually - they've actually stepped up in a considerable way to provide customer benefits to make this transaction attractive to the policymakers and to the customers. So, and of course - I think a seminal event here obviously is May 4th where the commission will come out with an order and we will look at that order, we will make determinations on what conditions are in place and at that point in time, we'll make decisions on what it looks like. But I think from the public interest standpoint, the things that the commission also be looking at, this transaction is very, very good for Kentucky customers and if there are - I think everyone has to be sort of level headed about all of this because when you get through this process, you actually have a - you have a timeframe now for customer benefits to occur, substantial benefits and that's really a driver to get this thing done as quickly as possible, particularly in this energy related environment. So, I really don't anticipate that happening, but if it did, we'll do what we always do, we'll figure out what the options are and what the possibilities are and go from there. But right now we're not planning on that. Well, typically, and we've done this, we actually plan for around 130% of the budget for transmission. So we have 30% more projects that are occurring that we already have planned scoped ready to go. So layering in these multiple projects is a way for us to not only as opportunities arrive, as the metrics for financials continue to improve, we can layer in more of that, we can adjust to that based on projects that go one way or another. And then also, recently we were awarded in Texas - a large project in Texas that's also incremental. So, it was like $1.3 billion or so, but that - those are the kinds of things that will come to pass and we have every bit of opportunity related to transmission not only within our own system, but also in terms of the incremental systems around us, and that's why - and you asked about FERC and transmission, FERC obviously is taking the right steps relative to long-term planning, getting the framework for long-term planning put in place. That's an important part of the process to speed up some of the planning aspects to ensure that we are making the right investments at the right places. We continue and I think FERC will continue to look at, even in parallel, these issues of cost allocation of even the incentive mechanism, but also in terms of - and the regional planning which AEP will bode well in terms of that because just about everyone interfaces with us. So, as you look at some of these aspects, the more renewables that are needed, certainly the more retirements that are occurring across RTOs is all going to bode well for transmission investment. And we - what we see today is not we're going to see tomorrow. And then if FERC is doing the right thing, which we think they are, is going to bolster the ability for us to have a more consistent, congruent, clean-energy type system across this nation and you can't do that without AEP. No, that will likely come after shortly thereafter and the way we've looked at it is that, obviously you want the transfer agreement done. But as far as the Mitchell agreement approval, we expect that to occur shortly thereafter with both commissions because it's an important aspect of it and something I think that really helps for the transaction side as well. That's right, that's right. Yes, sure. Yes, it's great question, because you're right, two quarters doesn't, it doesn't make a trend. But when you look at the economy within our service territory, we're seeing some very positive indicators for continued expansion and continued economic development. We are - our economic development people are extremely busy with multiple opportunities that are coming throughout our territory actually. And so we look at that, we look at the sort of - if you were to look at our pipeline of potential opportunities, it is extremely robust and that gives us confidence in terms of where we think the economy is going to continue to go within our service territory. And of course, we don't see an end to the work from home environment. So we're feeling much better about the prospects of a more robust residential side of things. And then on the industrial, like I said, the onshoring, the security aspects, the energy play within our service territory. The other aspects of what's going on within the territory with chemicals manufacturing and so forth, that pace has picked up markedly with expansions and new developments and some of them are still years away, like the NTL manufacturing here in Ohio in our territory. It's substantial there'll be 20 to 40 more companies associated with that. It will be locating. So you see those types of prerequisites that are being put in place, that gives us a lot of positive views about where we think the economy is going. We'll watch it, we'll continue to evaluate it. If we go to the third quarter, see the same thing and fourth quarter, the same thing, then you'll probably see some adjusting going on relative to the 2023 forecast, but that's - our load guy will have to tell us that, he is very objective and he's is a professor at one of the universities and he - usually he is - let me put it this way, he is probably more optimistic now than I've ever seen him and that's a good thing. Yes, I think it will make it more complicated, but not insurmountable, because whatever increases you may see from a solar perspective, the overall project benefits will still be part of it. Now it may change the relationship between wind and solar in the integrated resource plan. Solar may come later than what we thought because if wind continues to continues to progress as you go in our resource plan, a lot of it was when to start and then eventually it's based on pricing and everything else, solar would start to pick up and at some point overcome the wind asset and then you move into other technologies. That condition may change based on that, but you also, I mean, you'll probably see that in the framework of increased gas prices too. So really the renewables will be relative to each other not in terms of relative to whether they'll get done or not. So, and I really think we'll be in good shape from that perspective. The other part two is that, when you look at the other resources, really what you're doing is, you're putting in renewables and you're also layering in some natural gas in the plan to really give it 24/7 supplier. Natural gas also is a placeholder for other types of resources, whether it's hydrogen, whether it's small modular reactors, whatever that comes about with new technologies and the grid optimization itself will be a major part of that as well with transmission. So there is a multitude of answers there that will occur. But, yes, you're right, you would suspect solar, there'll be some short-term perturbation from an increase perspective that we'll have to deal with. But in the overall scheme of things, when you look at long-term, it will still be positive. Yes, so at SWEPCO we have rate cases there in two of the jurisdictions and PSO, we will have a rate case as well. And, but keep in mind too, we just brought in all of the renewables in play, particularly a large chunk of it for PSO and SWEPCO. So that's now rolling through rates and so we expect that to continue to pick up, those are - and really when you look at the industrial and manufacturing economic development part of what's going on in those jurisdictions, they are still very positive. So, and of course we continue to invest heavily in those jurisdiction so, and that's why we have equalizer chart that some of the peer lower until we file rate cases and when the investment changes itself, so we're not concerned by that at this point and actually we see PSO and the SWEPCO jurisdictions with Arkansas, Louisiana, in particular, very favorable. The true up was positive the previous year, and yes, sort of double count. Sure thing. Thanks Michael."

            "name": "Julie Sloat",
            "content": "Thank you Nick, thanks Darcy. It's good to be with you this morning. Thanks for dialing in everyone. I'm going to walk us through our first quarter results, share some updates on our service territory load and finish with commentary on our credit metrics, liquidity, as well as some thoughts on our guidance, financial targets and recap our current portfolio management activities underway. So let's go to Slide 10, which shows the comparison of GAAP to operating earnings for the quarter. GAAP earnings for the first quarter were $1.41 per share compared to $1.16 per share in 2021. There is a reconciliation of GAAP to operating earnings on Page 16 of the presentation today. Let's walk through our quarterly operating earnings performance by segment on Slide 11. Operating earnings for the first quarter totaled $1.22 per share or $616 million compared to $1.15 per share or $571 million in 2021. Operating earnings for the Vertically Integrated Utilities were $0.59 per share, up $0.05, favorable drivers included rate changes across multiple jurisdictions, normalized load and O&M. These were somewhat offset by increased depreciation, lower off-system sales and wholesale load. I'd like to take a second to talk about O&M and depreciation in particular because of a change in accounting related to Rockport Unit II lease at I&M, we'll see approximately a $0.05 contribution of favorable O&M consequence offset by $0.05 of unfavorable depreciation in each quarter of 2022, but no consequential earnings impact. And to be clear, this is entirely consistent with the 2022 guidance details we posted in our investor presentations earlier this year. I have more to share on load and load performance here in a minute, so hang with me on this. The Transmission and Distribution Utilities segment earned $0.30 per share, up $0.07 compared to last year, favorable drivers in this segment included rate changes in Texas and Ohio, normalized load and transmission revenue. Offsetting these favorable items were unfavorable O&M and depreciation. The AEP Transmission Holdco segment contributed $0.34 per share, down a $0.01compared to last year. Investment growth was favorable by $0.03, offset by $0.02 of mainly property taxes, driven by the increased investment and a penny of income taxes. This is in line with the guidance that we provided to you earlier this year. You'll recall that our 2022 guidance had this segment down by $0.08 year-over-year as a result of the $0.12 of investment growth being more than offset by the annual true up that will occur in the second quarter and some unfavorable comparisons on the tax and financing side. As you know, this segment continues to be an important part of our 6% to 7% EPS growth. Generation and marketing produced $0.03 per share, down $0.03 from last year. The improvement in wholesale margins was more than offset by lower retail margins and reduced generation. You may recall that storm Yuri had an unfavorable impact on wholesale margins in the first quarter 2021. Finally, Corporate and Other was down a $0.01 per share, driven by increased O&M, lower investment gains and unfavorable interest. These were offset by favorable income taxes, the lower investment gains are largely related to charge point gains that we had in the first quarter of 2021. Turning to Slide 12, I'll provide an update on our normalized load performance for the quarter. In a general sense the AEP service territory is extremely fertile for economic growth right now, in fact as of the first quarter, our load has officially fully recovered from the pandemic recession and has now transitioned into the expansionary phase of this business cycle. Starting in the upper left corner, normalized residential sales increased by eight tenths of a percent, compared to the first quarter 2021. This growth was composed of growth in both customer counts and weather normalized usage for the quarter. While results were mixed by operating company, the strongest residential growth was at the AEP - was in the AEP service - AEP Texas service territory, which was partially influenced by the year-over-year comparison, given the customer outages driven by storm Yuri in the first quarter of 2021. A final data point to share regarding residential sales is that our first quarter sales were still 1.1% above their pre-pandemic levels, over two years after the pandemic began. This is driven by number of factors including higher numbers of people who are able to work remotely that used to work in offices prior to the pandemic. Moving to the right, weather normalized commercial sales increased by 4.2% compared to the first quarter of 2021, while growth in commercial sales is spread across every operating company and most industries, the largest increase in commercial sales is coming from data centers whose load was up 33% compared to last year. In addition, we continue to see strong recovery in the sectors most impacted by the pandemic such as hotels, schools, and churches, while real-estate has been booming throughout the entire pandemic. AEP normalize - AEP's normalized commercial sales in the first quarter were 2.5% above their pre-pandemic levels which shows that we've gone beyond recovery and are now in full expansion mode across the territory. If I can now focus your attention on the lower left corner, you'll see that industrial sales posted another very strong quarter up 5.6% compared to last year, industrial sales were up, at most operating companies and many of our largest sectors in the first quarter. We experienced double-digit growth in a number of key industries this quarter, including chemicals, manufacturing, oil and gas extraction, petroleum and petroleum products, we also saw robust growth in primary metals manufacturing, coal mining and food manufacturing. Having said that, first quarter industrial sales are still 1.6% behind their pre-pandemic levels. However, we have a large number of customer expansions that are expected to come online later this year and still fully expect to eclipse our pre-COVID industrial sales levels in 2022. We can continue to be confident in our full-year 2022 guidance for normalized retail load. While we certainly did not anticipate the Russian invasion in Ukraine when we developed the 2022 forecast. I'd like to remind you that AEP's service territory is uniquely positioned to benefit from higher energy prices, given the concentration of energy production that is located throughout the AEP footprint. Energy producers in our footprint have responded to higher energy prices, which has resulted in increased economic activity throughout this service territory. Finally, when you pull it all together in the lower-right corner, you'll see that AEP's normalized retail sales increased by 3.2% for the quarter. As I mentioned earlier, our load has gone beyond recovery mode and is in full expansion mode. For the quarter, every operating company posted higher normalized sales than last year. Furthermore, our first quarter retail sales were up, were 1.5% above their pre-pandemic levels. So 50 basis points above pre-pandemic levels. To use a sports analogy, I would say our load performance in the first quarter was in the zone. While there are many factors outside of our control that could influence our results, I want to stress that the positive load story we shared with you today is largely the result of intentional efforts by our employees to promote economic development as a part of our long-term strategy to strengthen the communities that we serve. We're fully aware of the increased uncertainty that exists in the macro economy, but if put into work that it takes to ensure that we continue to see growth in our service territory going forward. So let's go to Page 13 to check on the company's capitalization and liquidity position. On a GAAP basis, our debt to cap ratio increased 60 basis points from the prior quarter to 61.5%, primarily due to an increase in equity from our issuance of AEP common stock in March, which is consistent with our 2022 guidance as the $805 million - or the $805 million of equity units we issued three years ago converted to equity. Let's talk about our FFO to debt metric. Taking a look at the upper right quadrant on this page, you'll see our FFO to debt metric stands at 13.7% on both the Moody's and a GAAP basis, which is an increase of 3.8% and 3 9% respectively from the prior quarter. The metrics are calculated off of the 12 month rolling FFO total, so the increase in FFO to debt is mainly a result of the fact that the cash flow drag from February 2021 winter storm Yuri has now dropped off the cash flow from operations calculations. This improvement has significantly narrowed the gap toward achieving our FFO to debt target range of 14% to 15% . As we stated on the last earnings call, we anticipate trending toward this target range as the year progresses. Let's take a quick moment to visit our liquidity summary on the lower right side of Slide 13. Our five-year $4 billion bank revolver and two-year $1 billion revolving credit facility support our liquidity position, which remained strong at $3.8 billion. Switching gears, our qualified pension funding increased 1.6% during the quarter 106.4%. The rise in interest rates, the decreased plan liabilities was the primary driver for this quarter's gain and funded status. Let's go to Slide 14. This quarter has provided a solid foundation for the rest of 2022 and we're reaffirming our operating earnings guidance range of $4.87 per share to $5.07 per share. We continue to be committed to our long-term growth rate of 6% to 7% that we updated on our last earnings call. We're working through the Kentucky Power sale to Liberty and expect to close in the second quarter. And as Nick mentioned, we've signed an agreement to sell a solar development site in Ohio and have entered into a term sheet to sell five additional wind and solar sites in SPP on the unregulated side of the business. Additionally, we're preparing to market the unregulated contracted renewables portfolio in the second half of this year and are receiving a significant amount of interest on this. Beyond the portfolio optimization activities underway, we remain focused on the fundamentals, which are executing on the regulated renewables plan, disciplined capital allocation, and securing positive regulatory outcomes. Before we break, I want to mention one last thing before we get to your questions. And that's to remind everyone that while we have not yet set the date, we will be hosting an Investor conference sometime in late September, early fall timeframe to give you a broader AEP update. We truly do appreciate your time and attention today. With that I'm going to ask the operator to open the call, so we can hear what's on your mind and answer the questions that you have. Yes and Julien, let me know if I'm not answering this directly or if you need a little more granularity. Specifically as it relates to dollar flows associated with any type of transaction that we enter into, so today you're going to talk about the fact that we've had a term sheet in place for five development sites, those dollars are still small. And so, we'll see those, show up eventually priced second quarter or third quarter in operating earnings. But obviously - not even disclosing those not a needle mover for us and not going to change the earnings guidance or anything like that, so not to worry on that front. And then as it relates specifically to the broader unregulated renewables contracted portfolio, we'll start the marketing effort in the second half of this year. Obviously, we'll continue as we have a little more detail to share. We do have an upcoming on investor conference, so stay tuned for that, and then we'll be able to navigate any potential proceeds from transactions. As you know, we don't - even know exactly how that's ultimately going to look, do we sell them as an entire portfolio? Do we sell them in different pieces? So that's to be determined, so standby on that. And then obviously, we continue to work through the Kentucky process. We had expected to close that - we're trending toward the second quarter. As Nick mentioned and I mentioned in my opening remarks, that's already reflected as it relates to Kentucky bringing dollars in, in our plan. You may recall that we eliminated about $1.4 billion of equity that we originally had in our 2022 guidance. So I think we're moving on track. Let me know if there is something I didn't address there. Yes, happy to, Jeremy, this is Julie. I did call specifically out, the O&M trend in Vertically Integrated Utilities. There's a little bit of a flipping and twitching going on between O&M and depreciation associated with the Rockport Unit II lease. That's included in that 2022 guidance that we had provided to you back in February, we've updated that page for your, so entirely consistent. Yes, and we're absolutely watching O&M as we continue to navigate inflationary pressures, et cetera. At this point, I would tell you, I think we're right in line with where we thought we'd be. So we're keeping our fingers crossed and the team is working like heck to make sure that we've got supply chain and supply chain is being addressed et cetera. But at this point, that guidance that we gave to you stands pat. So nothing new to report other than the fact that the team is working really hard to make sure that those numbers coming in line to the extent that we have many new developments, we will surely keep you apprised. Nick, if I can just jump in there with a finer point or two as well. And Sophie as I made comments in my opening remarks, we are still about 1.6% behind pre-pandemic levels on the industrial side of the house. But as I mentioned and as Nick mentioned, we do see expansions that are going to allow us to not only get pass that 1.6%, but to go beyond that. So we do expect to be beyond the pre-pandemic levels. And as a matter of fact, what we've seen so far this year in the first quarter is that six of our top 10 sectors were up. So that's a good indication. And then looking forward, we expect to see strong growth in oil and gas as new LNG operations ramp up in Texas and that began a few quarters back. So we're going to start to see the fruits of that efforts as well, but stay tuned. As you know, we typically, if we're going to revise guidance, we've historically done it once we get past our peak season, which is summer, but to be perfectly candid, we're looking at this constantly. So we will be back to you if there is anything that requires us to get new information in front of you, because we'll definitely want to take advantage of that. Yes, and so, Michael, I don't have my guidance sheet in front of me for 2022, it's in our presentation that we put out there and our fourth quarter call, but effectively and actually somebody is going to hand it well, and going to hand it to me. But effectively, what we were anticipating was that year-over-year we'd be up about $0.08 and that was driven by investment growth being up $0.12. I mentioned this actually in my opening comments as well and then we had a true up that would occur and we knew that was going to be embedded. That's why we have it in the guidance, that's associated with the fact -- It would - so it's flipping back and forth so. So we had two reasons for that true up. I mean, we had spent just a little bit under our budget for the prior year and as you know, we got forward looking rate. So that's a catch up there and then we had higher load, so we had a catch up there too, so we get a little bit of a double-counting there. But that's why we had the 11% reduction in that true up. And then we had other financing and income taxes that kind of brought that number back down to, flip it to a negative $0.08. So in aggregate, for 2022, we assume that we'd have about $1.27 from that particular segment, again driven by investment growth, offset by a couple of these other bucket items that I threw out there. We are on that trajectory. And that's why I specifically called that out in my opening comments, because if I was trying to model this, that's exactly what I'd be asking. It's, I guess, it's priced fair enough. We're a little short on the first quarter. But yes, I would just expect that we'll continue to see transmission investment continue to plug along through the remainder of the year, at this point, we don't have any changes as it relates to that specific guidance. And we have it out there year-by-year in our guidance forecast and assumptions pages in our traditional Investor Relations materials. Happy to walk through with you offline, if you'd like to do that too."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the American Electric Power Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the conference over to Darcy Reese, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nDarcy Reese : Thank you, Regina. Good morning, everyone. And welcome to the fourth quarter 2023 earnings call for American Electric Power. We appreciate you taking time today to join us. Our earnings release, presentation slides and related financial information are available on our website at aep.com.  Today we will be making forward-looking statements during the call. There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements. Please refer to our SEC filings for a discussion of these factors.  Joining me this morning for opening remarks are Ben Fowke, our Interim President and Chief Executive Officer; Chuck Zebula, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer and Peggy Simmons, our Executive Vice President of Utilities. We will take your questions following their remarks.  I will now turn the call over to Ben. \nBen Fowke : Well, thank you, Darcy. Good morning and welcome to American Electric Power\u2019s fourth quarter 2023 earnings call. It's great to have a chance to reconnect with you, although I never thought it would be under these circumstances.  As you know the AEP board of directors made a decision to remove Julie Sloat from her duties as Chair, President and CEO. Taking this action was not easy, but the board believes it was in the best interest of AEP and its stakeholders to do so. On behalf of the board and the entire AEP family. I would like to wish Julie well and thank her for all her contributions. I would also like to assure everyone that Julie's departure was not due to any unethical behavior, disagreements of financial policy or because of any violation of AEP\u2019s code of conduct.  Now, as many of you are aware after my retirement from Xcel Energy, I joined the AEP board in February of 2022. I was attracted to this board because I was impressed with AEP\u2019s business model, its strong asset base and the quality of its leadership team and board. I'm even more impressed two years later. In my tenure here,  I've seen the AEP team rise to meet multiple challenges. Let me give you some examples starting with earnings. For 14 years in a row, AEP has met or exceeded earnings guidance, and 2023 is no exception. Our operating earnings came in at $5.25, that's within our guidance range despite $0.37 of unfavorable weather and $.45 of increased interest cost over the prior year. As you know, controlling O&M expense has been a challenge for the industry. And AEP has met that challenge, essentially keeping O&M flat for the last 10 years, while at the same time doubling its asset base. This team's continuous focus on O&M efficiency is nothing short of excellent.  You may also recall that in early 2023, the Texas Commission denying a petition to be part of SWEPCO is 999-megawatt renewables project for $2.2 billion. But the team didn't miss a beat and put the project back on track with Arkansas and Louisiana ultimately stepping up to move forward with the full project. As a result, and including SWEPCO. Today, we have commission approval of $6.6 billion of new renewable projects throughout AEP\u2019s service territory, representing a 70% achievement of our current 5-year $9.4 billion new generation capital plan. I hope you would agree with me that that is really solid execution.  Initiatives to simplify and de-risk our portfolio are squarely in the focus of the board and the management team. And we are pleased with the great progress made. Last year, we completed the sale of our unregulated renewables portfolio, bringing in $1.2 billion of cash proceeds. We should be closing on our New Mexico renewable development solar portfolio within the next day or two. This in combination with the expected conclusion of our retail and distributed resources sales process in the second quarter, keeps us on schedule to achieve our 2024 asset sales targets.  Now as we move forward, AEP will continue to be a disciplined portfolio manager and we will be willing to take action when price and the ability to execute intersect. To that end, we've made the decision to retain our ownership interest in both our Prairie Wind and Pioneer Transmission joint ventures. We also completed the review of Transource and ultimately determined that owning this joint venture fits strategically within our portfolio. We'd like our remaining assets. And we'll focus going forward on doubling down on our efforts to achieve constructive regulatory outcomes that will allow us to provide the quality of service our customers need and expect.  Regarding Icahn Capital, our recent agreement came about from a combination of a constructive dialogue between AEP and the Icahn teams. Like us, the Icahn team believes AEP shares are undervalued and there's meaningful upside potential for our investors. The addition to AEP\u2019s board will bring fresh perspective as we continue to execute on strategic priorities and enhance value for our stakeholders.  Looking ahead, today, we are reaffirming our 2024 full year operating earnings guidance range of $5.53 to $5.73, as well as our long-term earnings growth rate of 6% to 7%, which is underpinned by a $43 billion 5-year capital plan, in addition to 14% to 15% FFO to debt target, which Chuck will expand upon shortly.  You should know that I am committed to my role as Interim President and CEO. And I believe I can add value while the board works to identify a permanent successor. So before I turn it over to Peggy for regulatory updates and Chuck for financial review, let me also acknowledge that 2023 has been at times a challenging year at AEP. There's certainly been some twists and turns and a few bumps in the road. But I would encourage all of you to focus on the key opportunities that lie ahead. I have tremendous confidence in our team's ability to achieve our objectives as we work every day to deliver safe, reliable and affordable energies to our customer.  With that, I'll turn it over to Peggy.\nPeggy Simmons : Thanks, Ben. And good morning, everyone. Now I'd like to turn to update on our ongoing regulatory and legislative efforts. While we made important regulatory progress in 2023, it is clear that we can do even more to facilitate successful and constructive outcomes. Details of related activities can be found in the appendix on Slides 29 through 31.  Closing the authorized versus earned ROE gap is a key area of focus for us. Our fourth quarter ROE came in at 8.8% a slight improvement over third quarter. This also reflects impacts of approximately 40 basis points from mild weather conditions in 2023. Our efforts to improve and bridge the ROE gap is supported by work we've done related to the recent passage of legislation that will help position us to provide safe and reliable service while managing costs and reducing regulatory lag.  Most importantly, we obtained securitization in Kentucky, a biannual Distribution Cost Recovery Factor or DCRF in Texas, and rate reviews every two years in Virginia.  On the regulatory front, we secured several important wins over the course of 2023, including achieving constructive base rate case outcomes in Louisiana, Oklahoma, and Virginia, reestablishing formula rate plans in Arkansas and Louisiana and reaching a settlement and our Ohio ESP V filings, which were waiting to commission order. Overall, in 2023, we secured $312 million and rate relief. We also filed new base cases in Indiana, Michigan and Kentucky in 2023. In Indiana, we have already reached a settlement, which we filed in December, and we expect the commission decision by June of this year. In Michigan, we continue to advance through the process and currently expect a ruling in the case in July. In Kentucky, the base case and securitization application was approved by the commission earlier this year.  Other upcoming cases include a new Oklahoma base rate case for PSO, which we filed last month. Additional filings in the first quarter will include an AEP Texas base rate case and the APCo Virginia biennial rate review that should have the benefits of legislative changes attained in 2023. While we reached many constructive outcomes in 2023, we are disappointed in a couple disallowances recently received. First, in Texas, the commission issued a decision disallowing capitalization of AFUDC related to our Turk plant in mid-December 2023. And we filed a motion for reconsideration a week later. In West Virginia, last month, the commission disallowed a portion of our March 2021 to February 2023 under recovered fuel, and we recently filed an appeal with the West Virginia Supreme Court on February 8.  We are also disappointed with the FERC order we received in January 2024 related to treatment of accumulated deferred income taxes associated with net operating loss carryforwards, or NOLC, mostly affecting our Transmission Holdco segment. We just filed for rehearing on February 20. Shortly, Chuck will discuss the related unfavorable net financial impact to 2023 operating earnings. Looking ahead, we know there is more work to be done as we advance our regulatory strategies in 2024 to achieve a forecasted regulated ROE of 9.1%. We are well on our way this year with almost 70% of rate relief either secured or related to mechanisms that are more administrative in nature. We look forward to continuing to engage constructively with our regulators and strengthening relationships at all levels. As Ben mentioned, this year, AEP continued to advance our 5-year $9.4 billion regulated renewables capital plan and now have a total of $6.6 billion approved by various state commissions. More detail of resource additions can be viewed in the appendix on Slides 32 through 34.  As previously disclosed, we received approval for APCo's 143 megawatts of wind generation, totaling more than $400 million of investment. This is in addition to the previously approved 209 megawatts of solar and wind projects for approximately $500 million. In 2023, we also received commission approval in both Indiana and Michigan for I&M 469 megawatts of solar projects, representing $1 billion of investment, PSO's 995.5-megawatt renewables portfolio for $2.5 billion and SWEPCO's 999-megawatt renewables for $2.2 billion.  Our fleet transformation goals are aligned with and supported by our integrated resource plan. We have pending requests for proposals for a diverse set of additional generation resources at I&M in Kentucky, PSO and SWEPCO, with more to come from other operating companies, including APCo. These generation investments are an integral part of our broader capital program, which is 100% focused on regulated assets and the production tax credits that are generated from our renewable energy projects, our path along to and provide great value to our customers. In addition to these projects, AEP is advancing an additional $27 billion in investments in our transmission and distribution systems to support reliability and resiliency. These combined investments underpin our 6% to 7% EPS growth commitment while mitigating customer bill impacts.  With that, I'll pass it over to Chuck to walk through the performance drivers in details supporting our financial commitments.\nChuck Zebula : Thanks, Peggy. And good morning to everyone on the call. I'll walk us through the fourth quarter and full year results for 2023, share some updates on our service territory load, our outlook for this year and finish with commentary on credit metrics and liquidity. Let's go to Slide 9, which shows the comparison of GAAP to operating earnings for the quarter and year-to-date periods. GAAP earnings for the fourth quarter were $0.64 per share compared to $0.75 per share in 2022. For the year, GAAP earnings were $4.26 compared to $4.51 in 2022. As we have highlighted throughout 2023, our year-to-date comparison of GAAP to operating earnings reflects the gain or loss related to the sale of certain businesses, regulatory outcomes as well as our typical mark-to-market adjustments as non-operating.  Our team is committed to minimizing the variances between GAAP and operating earnings as we go forward. Detailed reconciliations of GAAP to operating earnings are shown on Slide 16 and 17 of the presentation today. Let's quickly cover the fourth quarter. Our fourth quarter earnings came in at $1.23 per share, which was a $0.18 improvement over the same period in 2022. Note that we had $0.25 of favorable O&M and strong performance in our Generation and Marketing segment, partially offset by $0.06 of unfavorable weather, $0.09 of higher interest costs and lower performance in Transmission Holdco. December weather, in particular, was the 28th warmest out of the last 30 years. For reference, the full details of our fourth quarter results are shown on Slide 15 of the presentation. Let's have a look at our full year results for 2023 on Slide 10. Operating earnings were $5.25 per share compared to $5.09 per share in 2022. Looking at the drivers by segment. Operating earnings for Vertically Integrated Utilities were $2.47 per share, down $0.09, mostly due to unfavorable weather, higher interest expense and higher income taxes. These items were partially offset by rate changes across various operating companies, increased transmission revenue, higher normalized retail load, favorable depreciation and lower O&M. Once again, depreciation is favorable at the Vertically Integrated segment, primarily due to the expiration of the Rockport Unit 2 lease in December 2022. The Transmission and Distribution Utility segment earned $1.30 per share, up $0.14 from last year. Positive drivers in this segment included increased transmission revenue, rate changes in Texas and Ohio and lower O&M. Partially offsetting these items were unfavorable weather, higher depreciation and higher interest expense. The AEP Transmission Holdco segment contributed $1.43 per share, up $0.11 from last year. Positive investment growth of $0.09 and favorable income taxes of $0.05 were the main drivers in this segment. As Peggy mentioned, we received the FERC NOLC order in January, resulting in an unfavorable net impact to consolidated earnings of $0.07 per share, with the majority of that impact occurring at the Transmission Holdco. The impact of this order to our 2024 plan is approximately $0.03 per share. Generation and Marketing produced $0.59 per share, up $0.09 from last year. The positive variance here is primarily due to improved retail and wholesale power margins, the sale of renewable development sites and favorable impacts associated with the contracted renewable sale in August. These items were partially offset by higher interest expense and unfavorable income taxes. Finally, Corporate and Other was down $0.09 per share, driven by higher interest expense, partially offset by a favorable year-over-year change in investment gains, largely due to investment losses that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2022. As we mentioned earlier, we are reaffirming our guidance range for 2024. For convenience, we've included an updated waterfall bridging our actual 2023 results to the midpoint of our guidance this year in Slide 24. While some variances changed due to last year's actual results, there is no change to our segments or overall guidance. Turning to Slide 11, I'll provide an update on weather normalized load performance. Overall retail load grew 2.5% in 2023. This was stronger than the 0.7% in our original guidance, thanks to an acceleration in data center growth and our commitment to economic development across our service territory. This is most apparent when looking at the incredible expansion in commercial load, shown in the upper right-hand quadrant of the slide.  Commercial sales grew 7.8% for the year, and were again dominated by data centers. We are encouraged that the gains are becoming more geographically diverse. New projects have come online in Michigan, Kentucky and Oklahoma to supplement the development of what we see in Ohio and Texas. This is a trend we expect to continue over the next several years as the global demand for data storage and processing accelerates through the growth of AI and other technologies.  We expect commercial load to continue to grow from its new higher base this year as projects work their way through the queue and commitments for 2025 are exceptionally robust. I believe that some of the 2025 load is going to accelerate and bleed into this year. Industrial sales grew at 1.6%, which you can see in the lower left-hand quadrant of the slide. This is mostly attributable to a number of large industrial loads we've recently added across our service territories, which are more than offsetting any economic challenges seen by our existing customers. We expect industrial load growth to continue to reflect the softness in manufacturing nationally, with only a modest increase this year. However, growth in industrial sales beyond this year should accelerate as borrowing costs moderate and several large loads currently under construction come online. In the upper left-hand corner of the slide, you'll see that residential load declined slightly in 2023. Usage per residential customer has declined for the past two years, as homes have become more energy efficient and workers spend more time in an office instead of at home. The negative impact of inflation on household budgets may be influencing usage as well. On a positive note, we've seen our residential customer base grow consistently in certain regions. In 2023, we added almost 31,000 net new residential customers across our footprint, resulting in a positive offset to this segment. Overall, we're optimistic about the positive trends in load over the next several years, especially from a commercial and industrial perspective. Our conservative approach to estimating large loads gives us a lot of confidence in the growth we forecasted.  In our next update, however, I would expect to see some upside in this area. Let's move on to Slide 12 to discuss the company's capitalization and liquidity position. In the top left table, you can see the FFO to debt metric stands at 13.2% for 2023. Positive changes in FFO were as outlined on the third quarter call, and included favorable changes in cash collateral, fuel recovery and other various drivers. These positive changes were somewhat offset by an $830 million increase in debt during the quarter primarily due to the issuance of long-term debt to prefund our March 2024 AEP parent maturity.  We are pleased that the team has overcome strong financial headwinds due to unfavorable weather and an unprecedented increase in interest rates to end the year above Moody's downgrade threshold of 13%. We expect our FFO to debt metric to continue to improve throughout 2024 as we progress towards our targeted range of 14% to 15%. This continued positive trend assumes normal weather for 2024 and continued growth in our cash flows through various regulatory activities, including recovery of our deferred fuel balances of approximately $425 million. Our debt to cap increased from the prior quarter by 60 basis points to 63%, and our parent debt to total debt is approximately 21.7%. In the lower left quadrant of this slide, you can see our liquidity summary, which remains strong at $3.4 billion, and is supported by our bank revolver and credit facility. Lastly, on the qualified pension front, our funding status remains unchanged from the prior quarter to end the year at just over 100%. While falling interest rates increased the liability during the quarter, this increase was offset by positive asset returns. Turning to Slide 13. I'll give a quick recap of today's message. We delivered on our commitments for 2023 despite the significant challenges we faced. Weather was one of the most mild years on record for the AEP system in the past 30 years, resulting in a negative $0.37 impact year-over-year and $0.21 versus normal weather. To put a little more context to those numbers, our heating degree days were down 36% compared to normal across the system. Also, interest expense was a $0.45 hurdle to overcome versus 2022 results.  We work diligently throughout the year to reprioritize and balance our plan by adjusting the timing of discretionary spend while staying focused on meeting our core business needs. While admittedly facing some challenges on the regulatory front, we secured many rate outcomes that were critical in supporting our objectives to provide reliable service to our customers. Looking into this year, we are optimistic about the opportunities and prepared to face any challenges ahead of us. We reaffirm our guidance for 2024 of $5.53 to $5.73 per share, our long-term growth rate of 6% to 7% and an improved balance sheet while continuing to implement our capital program, taking care of the customer, earning our authorized return and executing on our strategic priorities. I would like to take a moment and thank Julie Sloat for her 23 years with AEP. Julie has made a positive impact on AEP and will be missed by many. Ben, we welcome you to the AEP management team. Your leadership in the industry is well respected, and you will be embraced by the employees of AEP. The entire management team looks forward to working with you and the board as we look to enhance value for all AEP stakeholders.  Thank you for your time today. Operator, can you open up the call for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead.\nShar Pourreza : Hey, guys. Good morning. \nChuck Zebula : Good morning. So obviously, the slides are leaning on the successes of AEP. You've reiterated your earnings guidance, balance sheet targets, growth rate, CapEx numbers. I guess outside of some management shuffling, what do you see is broken? I guess, what's the goal of the review? What's on the table, what's off the table?\nBen Fowke : Well, this is Ben. And I can tell you that I don't think I would use the word broken. I think there's areas where we can do better. I think -- and I think we showed you in the script, many of the accomplishments we made. We also recognize that we can do better on getting constructive regulatory outcomes. So strategically, our priorities remain the same. We have completed, as we mentioned, a review of Transource. We want to keep that asset. We think it's a great asset. And I think given the various changes that FERC is looking at, I think it gives us a lot of optionality. We'll continue to be very disciplined portfolio managers. I said it on my scripted remarks, but always willing to transact where price and the ability to execute intersect, and that's a key point. And finally, though, if you step back, I think one of the ways you add value in this industry long term is by placing CapEx at one times book, investing in CapEx at one times book and getting constructive recovery of that. And again, we've done pretty good on that, but we can do better. And we're going to look at the people, the process and the planning that goes into that. Those constructive outcomes, and we're going to do it through the lens of what's important to our local leaders and stakeholders.  Extremely important that we keenly listen to what they want and what they need at a local level. And I think you can translate that then to a much better chance for success, and then you get into that virtuous circle where invested capital not only is good for customers and the communities, but good for shareholders as well. So that's the plan going forward.\nShar Pourreza : And do you believe, sort of, do you believe there's some jurisdictions that AEP currently operates where you may not be able to hit those sort of targets as you're thinking about people, process, et cetera?\nBen Fowke : Well, I think there's areas where we have improvement, but I will turn it over to Peggy and/or Chuck to elaborate on that.\nPeggy Simmons : I think as it relates from a regulatory perspective, I do think what we're going to do is continue to build on the constructive legislative and regulatory outcomes that we have had. We're going to further strengthen our regulatory relationships, and we're really going to be keenly focused on execution.  I think that some of the disappointments that we had in 2023, we're going to learn from them, and we're going to go back out and focus on execution from that standpoint.\nShar Pourreza : Okay. Perfect. And then just lastly for me, just -- Ben, as you and the board are sort of thinking about where AEP stands today, I guess, what are you looking for in the next CEO? Are you kind of looking for a prior CEO or President of an OpCo, someone with a finance background, regulatory background, internal, external? I guess, can you just maybe specify exactly what you're looking for in the next successor?\nBen Fowke : Well, it's definitely an external search. I'll start with that. And I don't want to narrow down to any specific background, but ideally -- and by the way, I think we're going to get a very robust list of candidates. So AEP is a great company with great assets. And I think it's going to be an attractive destination for many, many talented people. So I think it's going to be great to pick from that talent.  Ideally, you get a -- somebody that is a seasoned executive in the utility industry, is well known in the investor community. I think that's extremely important, has great leadership qualities. We've got a lot of talent at AEP, and we want to develop that talent. And ultimately, it would be ideal if they have multi-jurisdictional experience and the ability to achieve regulatory success.  Those are -- that's a big wish list. But again, I think we're going to get a lot of great candidates.\nShar Pourreza : Got it. Terrific. Thank you, guys. I'll pass it to someone else, and good luck on Phase 2. I appreciate it.\nBen Fowke : Thank you. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nBen Fowke : Hey, Jeremy.\nOperator: Jeremy, your line is on mute. \nJeremy Tonet : Hi, good morning. \nBen Fowke : Good morning. \nJeremy Tonet : I just want to kind of continue along these lines, if I could. And I was wondering if you're able to comment, I guess, on the recent agreement AEP announced with Icahn Capital and kind of how that ties into the change at the top here given the relatively short tenure? And just wondering if there's anything else we should be expecting, I guess, along these lines looking forward with Icahn's recent announcement?\nBen Fowke : Yeah. I really just will probably just rehash what we've said in the press release and in our scripted remarks. I mean the Icahn -- additional board members came after discussions with the Icahn team and the AEP team. We actually welcome their perspective. They share the opinion as we do that AEP shares are undervalued, and we want to work together to unleash shareholder value. Regarding Julie's departure, I mean, I really can't go into any more details than what we've already said. It was a full board decision after discussions with Julie, and we decided that the best path forward is to transition to a new CEO. We're going to continue to work hard to deliver shareholder value. I think the Icahn board members will give us a fresh perspective as we pursue those goals.\nJeremy Tonet : Got it. That's very helpful. And just as we think about the strategic path going forward at this juncture, are all options on the table or any options off the table? Just want to kind of see the parameters of what we could expect going forward.\nBen Fowke : Well, we really like the assets we have, okay? We've completed the strategic reviews, but I mean, the price -- we're going to continue to look for opportunities to do the right thing for our shareholders. But I think we're in a -- an enviable position, that the assets we have can also achieve our strategic goals.  And Chuck mentioned where we are with FFO to debt and those targets. So I think we're in a pretty good position, quite honestly. So again, as I said before, not to be redundant, but I guess it will be. We'll be good portfolio managers, and we'll continue to be open to transactions if the price is right and the ability to execute is viable. But in the meantime, we're going to do the blocking and tackling that in the long term, gets you the result that -- results that you're going to want to see.\nJeremy Tonet : Wonderful. Very helpful. Thank you for that.\nBen Fowke : You\u2019re welcome. \nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Nick Campanella with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nNick Campanella : Hey, good morning, everyone. Thanks for the prepared remarks and taking my questions. Good morning. So I guess, you acknowledged in your remarks, there's been some twists and turns and some regulatory volatility in '23. You had some headwinds that you highlighted from the FERC order on taxes, the Oklahoma rate order, among a few other items. But just the 6% to 7% has been pretty resilient and unchanged this entire time. So can you just maybe help us all understand just what's kind of allowing AEP to absorb these issues and where the offsets have been kind of in the 5-year plan that allows you to continue to reaffirm?\nBen Fowke : Well, I mean, I'll kick it over to Chuck in a minute, but the $43 billion on the 5-year capital plan underpins the 6% to 7%. In the years where we might have unfavorable weather or other things like that, that's the resiliency of this AEP management team that I talked about. And it's not just one year. It's a -- look back, I mentioned 14 years of hitting what we said we were going to do. Yeah, sometimes you get regulatory bumps in the road and other things that might happen. But if you look back historically, and we look forward, we produce. I mean, we're in 11 jurisdictions. We're going to file rate cases. But if you look at history, we generally do pretty well. And when we have a bump in the road, we figure out how to absorb it and what we need to do better going forward.  Chuck, I don't know if you want to add to that?\nChuck Zebula : Yeah. No, Ben, as you said, it's underpinned by the $43 billion 5-year capital plan. I'd also point to what Ben made an observation as a board member and in his opening remarks about our O&M. There's a chart in our deck that you can refer to, right? We've doubled the rate base of this company while basically keeping O&M flat over that entire 10-year period. I think that's a remarkable accomplishment and that's our plan going forward as we continue to grow this company and basically repurpose and reallocate O&M. I also talked in my remarks about the load opportunities. I tend to kind of take a measured approach to this. But we really are optimistic about the opportunities that we're seeing there. As I said, the commercial load growth is just amazing. And we're seeing some good opportunities in economic development activities in industrial as well.  And then lastly, of course, underpinning that plan is improved returns. Right? We are not earning where we need to earn, and we need to have the regulatory execution and prudency reviewed to make sure, right, that we are hitting the mark there. So I think all in all, that kind of underpins the plan going forward.\nNick Campanella : Got it. And definitely appreciate the comments on diversification and the size of the overall plan as well as the O&M. Thank you for that. And then I guess, just -- I guess just sticking with the 6% to 7% CAGR, is there any kind of shaping to that over the 5-year plan? Is there anywhere that you kind of see yourself in that range right now?  And then as we kind of think about a new CEO coming in, hopefully, in the back half of this year, is it your expectation that they would come in to embrace that plan? Or would they have more say in where they're taking the company? Thank you.\nChuck Zebula : Yeah. So I'll take the first question. Our 5-year plan is really based off the midpoint of the current year's guidance. And our plan is to grow basically on that midpoint between the 6% to 7% range with no real kind of ups and downs identified through there.  I'll let Ben answer the --\nBen Fowke : Yeah. I mean I think, first of all, we'll take our time, and we'll find the absolute best successor permanent successor that we can. I think as part of that process, we obviously will have the strategic discussions. I mean, I think the board is very comfortable with our strategy and our strategic priorities. I suspect that the ultimate permanent successor CEO will also be comfortable with those strategies and perhaps can figure out a better way to execute on them. That would be the goal. But we're not looking at a complete dismantling of our strategic priorities.\nNick Campanella : Thanks a lot for answering the questions today. I appreciate it.\nBen Fowke : You\u2019re welcome, Nick. \nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Carly Davenport with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nCarly Davenport : Hey, good morning. Thank you for taking the questions. A bit of a shift on the asset sale program, I guess, in terms of the decision to retain the transmission JV. So could you just talk a little bit about the rationale there and how we should think about your view on transmission as part of the portfolio or potentially as an area of sort of value monetization going forward?\nBen Fowke : Well, I mean -- and I'll let Chuck -- this is Ben. I'll let Chuck augment what I'm going to say, which is pretty much what I said before. Transmission is a great asset. And we are, obviously, the largest transmission provider in the United States, and we like that position. We will be open to things that make sense that would do even better for shareholders. But we don't feel compelled we have to do anything. So I think that puts us in a better position as we move forward.  Chuck, I don't know if you want to add to that.\nChuck Zebula : Yeah. I think you -- we're also referring maybe to pioneer in Prairie Wind and our decision to keep those assets. The reality is, right, these contribute earnings to AEP, their attractive returns. And overall, it was really insignificant, right, to our overall financing plan if we were planning on selling those assets. So it really goes back to the root of what Ben said, as we reviewed the opportunities before us in competitive transmission and then looked at other transmission assets that we have, we -- we're embracing it. It's time for us as the leader in transmission to continue, right, to lead that space, and that's what we plan to do.\nCarly Davenport : That's helpful. Appreciate that. And then, Chuck, probably for you, just a little bit of a shift in tone around the FFO to debt metrics as well for '24. Can you just talk about what we should expect relative to that 14% to 15% range for 2024 on FFO to debt and what the moving pieces are that you're kind of watching that could move you outside of that range?\nChuck Zebula : Yeah. So thank you for that question. And our message has changed a bit there on the timing. But what I would tell you is really kind of timing is not what is most important. It's really the trend that we're on, and then it's hitting the mark of 14%. And it's the sustainability on staying in that range as we go through the 5-year plan. So let me comment on a couple of things. Right? We said we would be above 13% by year-end, and we were. And we didn't make any excuses for the soft weather that happened in 2023. Note also that 13% is the downgrade threshold at Moody's.  And second, right, the trend is very positive. Right? This quarter, we're going to have another roll off of cash collateral in Q1. I think the number is around $390 million that will come out of the 12-month average. And also, we are working on down our deferred fuel balances. And then lastly, right, we clearly show our models and review those with the agencies. Those models indicate that we would be in the range this year and be in the range over the longer term. That's what's most important, right, hitting the mark, trending in that positive direction and staying in the range.  So again, the timing, which month or which quarter is not important, it's the three things that I mentioned earlier.\nCarly Davenport : Got it. Thanks very much for the time. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Levine with Citi. Please go ahead.\nRyan Levine : Good morning. \nBen Fowke : Good morning. \nRyan Levine : Given the focus on people and processes, how long do you view the company's review of its regulatory strategy to take? And in that context, how is the new review different from how AEP has reviewed its regulatory strategy historically?\nBen Fowke : Well, I'm going to turn it over to Peggy, who is the point on that. But this -- it isn't like this is something we're just initiating. This is something that I've heard discussed as a board member at the board level. It's something I'm going to get very much involved in with Peggy. We've got a good team, but we're going to have to -- we'll make sure that we do what we need to do to get better outcomes in the future.  And I mean, there's a lot of blocking and tackling, that really behind the scene stuff that goes into the actual processing, executing and planning of a rate case. And it gets really down in the weeds pretty quickly, but those things add up. Peggy, I'll turn it over to you.\nPeggy Simmons : Yeah. I would just add -- and looking forward to working with Ben and talking through the regulatory strategy. We've had positive regulatory outcomes in 2023. And when we shared some of those earlier, there were some disappointments that we highlighted. But I would bring forth the legislative work that we have done, and that's going to help to address lag. We've done work that's going to help to remove some of the lag in Virginia with our biannual rate review for Virginia, where it was three years before. We're going to also look at improving on -- we said with Kentucky that it was going to be a two-step process, and we very much view that we had a constructive outcome in the order that we received earlier in January with the securitization.  So we're going to continue to build upon that. I agree, we do have a talented team, and we're just going to keep moving forward, and I look forward, again, as I said, to working with Ben on ways we can continue to improve there.\nRyan Levine : Great. And then unrelated, where do you see the biggest opportunities to benefit from the data center build-out in your service territory? And given your balance sheet constraints, do you have any reservations or concerns around that opportunity?\nBen Fowke : The biggest opportunity so far have been in Ohio and Texas. And in our forecast, for our 5-year plan, we have included the capital needed to serve those customers. If there is incremental growth beyond that, it would be an opportunity that we'd have to evaluate and figure out how we would smartly finance it. And meet the generation needs that come with it. Yeah.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Anthony Crowdell with Mizuho. Please go ahead.\nAnthony Crowdell : Hey, good morning, Ben. Good morning, Chuck. Hopefully, two easy ones, one for you, Ben, one for Chuck. Just, Ben, I don't know what kind of insight you could provide. But just -- if I think about the -- excuse me, 1% position that Icahn has taken and it seems that there's been some major changes in the board. I don't think that would be a big position that yet, I think, two voting seats and then a non-advisory seat. Just thoughts on what change in the Board that maybe to expand the board?\nBen Fowke : Well, I mean, you're right. There's like -- I think there's 5.3 million shares that -- something like that that Icahn holds. And we had discussions with Icahn. And we settled on the two incremental board seats and advisory position.  I think back to Julie, I'll just repeat what I said. This was a full board decision after discussions with Julie and the board, and we determined it was best for AEP to transition to a new CEO. So you can read what you want into that, but I think I'm just going to just keep it as it is. It's a full board decision, and you need the full board to make a decision to remove the CEO.\nAnthony Crowdell : Great. And then, Chuck, two quick ones. It looks like the equity timing had moved. I understand your questions to Carly earlier on -- you are targeting to above the 13% threshold, but I think the equity may be slid off of the near term? And then lastly, on earned returns, what type of improvement could we expect each year? And I'll leave it there.\nChuck Zebula : Okay. Thanks, Anthony. Our equity needs haven't changed since EEI. You may be referring to maybe an older forecast we had some months back. But what you're seeing in our deck today is consistent, right, with what we've shown at EEI.  I'll let Peggy go ahead and mark -- talk about the returns.\nPeggy Simmons : Yeah. As it relates to -- for 2024, our ROE, we're projecting at 9.1% is what we're -- for our regulated segments. And we're going to continue to work on closing the gap, a lot of what I've already said earlier, just kind of building off with some of those legislative successes that we were able to have, reducing some of the lag from that perspective.\nAnthony Crowdell : Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Appreciate it. \nChuck Zebula : Thank you. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Sophie Karp with KeyBanc. Please go ahead.\nSophie Karp : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. \nBen Fowke : Good morning. \nSophie Karp : Hi. Just a quick one for me. I guess like when you think about your jurisdictions, right? And the ones we've got constructive outcomes, regulatory and the ones where you got non-constructive outcomes. And how should we think about you allocating this increase in capital across these jurisdictions? Like, is there a strategy there to proactively reduce capital allocations to jurisdictions where you earned ROE just don't make a hurdle for what's attractive?\nBen Fowke : I'm going to turn it over to Peggy and Chuck in a minute, Sophie. But I mean, we're always going to look to put capital where we can get the best returns. There's baseline capital that you need to do to make sure that you never compromise resiliency, reliability or safety. So we -- but apart from that, I think it gets back to what I said. It's listening to what those local jurisdictions really want and need. And that can also shape your capital needs because, quite frankly, it can shape your regulatory outcomes. So I'll turn it over to the team if they have anything to add to that.\nPeggy Simmons : I would just say, yeah, I echo Ben's comments there on -- there's a certain amount of capital we need to continue to be resilient and meet the reliability needs of our customers. And as well as from a safety perspective. Those where we have really constructive outcomes, clearly, we know in I&M, we have the forward-looking test years. We're able to continue to have that capital to allocate there to meet what those needs are. And we just continue to look at what our outcomes are by jurisdiction.\nSophie Karp : Okay. And then maybe going back to data centers, right? Do you see more attractive opportunities around incremental generation to support those customers or the T&D investment?\nChuck Zebula : Yeah, in Ohio and Texas, right? We're -- those are deregulated states. In our Indiana, Michigan territory, clearly, there would be opportunities for generation there to serve those customers.\nSophie Karp : Okay, thank you. \nBen Fowke : Thank you. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Paul Fremont with Ladenburg. Please go ahead.\nPaul Fremont : Thank you very much. I guess first question would be on the '24 guidance. Does that continue to include contribution from the retail and the distributed resources as was sort of outlined at EEI?\nChuck Zebula : Yeah. Our EEI guidance, right, we kind of change the waterfall based on the actual, right? But what's in or out hasn't changed, Paul. As Ben mentioned, we're in the process that we plan to conclude here in the next several months on retail and distributed businesses. He also mentioned that we're closing NMRD today, which there'll be a benefit from that sale coming through. But everything is underpinned. Remember, too, when you look at the waterfall, we took the Generation and Marketing segment down to what we would call much more normal contributions. I'm not concerned that about the ability to take the proceeds, use them as appropriate to get that accretion as we go forward. But no, it's still the same plan, if you will, as we put out at EEI.\nPaul Fremont : And then Chuck mentioned that the FERC decision is expected to have a $0.03 negative impact on '24. Is that going to be treated as operating EPS? Or is that going to be excluded as non-recurring?\nChuck Zebula: No, it's operating.\nPaul Fremont : And then I guess the last question I have is, currently, there's a proceeding in Kentucky where, I guess, there's recommendations for potential disallowance of fuel and purchased power costs. I think there's also a fuel review that could take place or may be taking place in Louisiana. Can you give us, I guess, an update on what your expectations are and what's happening in those proceedings?\nPeggy Simmons : Yeah. In Kentucky, we do have a 2-year fuel review that has been underway, and we are waiting, the outcome as it relates to that. We had a hearing earlier this month actually. And then from -- what was your other question with it related to SWEPCO?\nPaul Fremont : Yeah. I think as part of that settlement on the renewables, there was, I guess, the ability of staff to do a review of the fuel?\nPeggy Simmons : Yeah, that was part -- excuse me, sorry, go ahead, finish your question.\nPaul Fremont : No, that's it.\nPeggy Simmons : Yeah. That was part of the review, and that is ongoing as well. So -- but Darcy can definitely give you some more information on that, if that wasn't clear enough.\nPaul Fremont : And last question for me. In terms of the 9.1% that you're targeting for this year, I think what type of an improvement do you see as being necessary in order to hit the 6% to 8%? I think in the past, you've talked about needing to improve the earned ROE as part of hitting your targeted growth rate?\nPeggy Simmons : Yeah. So over our 5-year plan, we look to be typically to be in the 9.5% range. So what we're looking to do is increase by 10 basis points each year. And we think that that achieve ongoing. We continue to work through our regulatory outcomes to be able to close that gap.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question will come from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock. Please go ahead.\nPaul Patterson : Hey, good morning. How are you? So just -- it doesn't sound to me like there really is much of a change in strategy with the new chapter and the managerial change that you're looking at. Am I thinking about this correctly?\nBen Fowke : Yeah, I think so. It's -- the strategy is great. We just have to execute, and that's what we're keenly focused on, Paul.\nPaul Patterson : Okay. I just want to make sure I'm hearing -- and then the second thing that I guess -- and I think this was asked before, but is there any timing that we should be thinking about in terms of when a new CEO would be in place?\nBen Fowke : Well, let me just say I'm committed to stay as long as it takes. So no shortcuts. But I can't see it being shorter than six months, and hopefully, it doesn't take more than a year. But again, it's going to -- the process will take the time it needs to take to get the absolute right candidate in place.\nPaul Patterson : Okay. And then finally, when we're talking about regulatory desires and goals, having watched the various jurisdictions, there are a number of jurisdictions that I get the sense -- and this isn't going to surprise you, Ben -- they want lower prices. And I'm just wondering, is there any sort of new or innovative way you're looking at the regulatory approach in terms of addressing maybe those concerns, increasing investment, but -- but addressing those two concerns other than obviously, the general concern that I'm sure you guys have. But do you follow what I'm saying in terms of making investments? And perhaps not seeing the resistance that I think if you look at a number of the AEP jurisdictions that they just ease to new investment leading to higher rates. Do you follow what I'm saying?\nBen Fowke : Yeah. I mean I think -- I mean I'm going to turn it over to the team, Paul, but the amount of load growth that we see in our jurisdictions, I mean that's a great opportunity, economic development that we can be a big part of, either helping to drive it or certainly providing the infrastructure to allow it. Those are great opportunities. And that's -- everybody wants that in all jurisdictions. But again, we're going to be -- very carefully listen to what our jurisdictions want and need and respond accordingly. Peggy or Chuck?\nPeggy Simmons : And I'll just briefly add to that. In 2023, we landed 92 new customer load additions totaling about 5-gig and adding additional jobs to our service territory. So I think that that's certainly 1 area and aspect of how we're going to help with affordability as well.\nChuck Zebula : Yeah. And Paul, clearly, the data center load that we're experiencing is going to create an opportunity, right, to spread fixed costs, right, along a bigger base and improve the headroom opportunity there as well.\nPaul Patterson : Okay. Great. And I appreciate it. And good to see you back, then hopeful as well.\nBen Fowke : Thank you. Thank you, Paul. I appreciate that.\nDarcy Reese: Thank you for joining us on today\u2019s call. As always, the Investor Relations team will be available to answer any additional questions you may have. Regina, would you please give the replay information?\nOperator: Today's conference will be available for replay beginning approximately two hours after the conclusion of this call and will run through 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on March 5, 2024.

            "name": "Chuck Zebula",
            "content": "Thanks, Peggy. And good morning to everyone on the call. I'll walk us through the fourth quarter and full year results for 2023, share some updates on our service territory load, our outlook for this year and finish with commentary on credit metrics and liquidity. Let's go to Slide 9, which shows the comparison of GAAP to operating earnings for the quarter and year-to-date periods. GAAP earnings for the fourth quarter were $0.64 per share compared to $0.75 per share in 2022. For the year, GAAP earnings were $4.26 compared to $4.51 in 2022. As we have highlighted throughout 2023, our year-to-date comparison of GAAP to operating earnings reflects the gain or loss related to the sale of certain businesses, regulatory outcomes as well as our typical mark-to-market adjustments as non-operating.  Our team is committed to minimizing the variances between GAAP and operating earnings as we go forward. Detailed reconciliations of GAAP to operating earnings are shown on Slide 16 and 17 of the presentation today. Let's quickly cover the fourth quarter. Our fourth quarter earnings came in at $1.23 per share, which was a $0.18 improvement over the same period in 2022. Note that we had $0.25 of favorable O&M and strong performance in our Generation and Marketing segment, partially offset by $0.06 of unfavorable weather, $0.09 of higher interest costs and lower performance in Transmission Holdco. December weather, in particular, was the 28th warmest out of the last 30 years. For reference, the full details of our fourth quarter results are shown on Slide 15 of the presentation. Let's have a look at our full year results for 2023 on Slide 10. Operating earnings were $5.25 per share compared to $5.09 per share in 2022. Looking at the drivers by segment. Operating earnings for Vertically Integrated Utilities were $2.47 per share, down $0.09, mostly due to unfavorable weather, higher interest expense and higher income taxes. These items were partially offset by rate changes across various operating companies, increased transmission revenue, higher normalized retail load, favorable depreciation and lower O&M. Once again, depreciation is favorable at the Vertically Integrated segment, primarily due to the expiration of the Rockport Unit 2 lease in December 2022. The Transmission and Distribution Utility segment earned $1.30 per share, up $0.14 from last year. Positive drivers in this segment included increased transmission revenue, rate changes in Texas and Ohio and lower O&M. Partially offsetting these items were unfavorable weather, higher depreciation and higher interest expense. The AEP Transmission Holdco segment contributed $1.43 per share, up $0.11 from last year. Positive investment growth of $0.09 and favorable income taxes of $0.05 were the main drivers in this segment. As Peggy mentioned, we received the FERC NOLC order in January, resulting in an unfavorable net impact to consolidated earnings of $0.07 per share, with the majority of that impact occurring at the Transmission Holdco. The impact of this order to our 2024 plan is approximately $0.03 per share. Generation and Marketing produced $0.59 per share, up $0.09 from last year. The positive variance here is primarily due to improved retail and wholesale power margins, the sale of renewable development sites and favorable impacts associated with the contracted renewable sale in August. These items were partially offset by higher interest expense and unfavorable income taxes. Finally, Corporate and Other was down $0.09 per share, driven by higher interest expense, partially offset by a favorable year-over-year change in investment gains, largely due to investment losses that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2022. As we mentioned earlier, we are reaffirming our guidance range for 2024. For convenience, we've included an updated waterfall bridging our actual 2023 results to the midpoint of our guidance this year in Slide 24. While some variances changed due to last year's actual results, there is no change to our segments or overall guidance. Turning to Slide 11, I'll provide an update on weather normalized load performance. Overall retail load grew 2.5% in 2023. This was stronger than the 0.7% in our original guidance, thanks to an acceleration in data center growth and our commitment to economic development across our service territory. This is most apparent when looking at the incredible expansion in commercial load, shown in the upper right-hand quadrant of the slide.  Commercial sales grew 7.8% for the year, and were again dominated by data centers. We are encouraged that the gains are becoming more geographically diverse. New projects have come online in Michigan, Kentucky and Oklahoma to supplement the development of what we see in Ohio and Texas. This is a trend we expect to continue over the next several years as the global demand for data storage and processing accelerates through the growth of AI and other technologies.  We expect commercial load to continue to grow from its new higher base this year as projects work their way through the queue and commitments for 2025 are exceptionally robust. I believe that some of the 2025 load is going to accelerate and bleed into this year. Industrial sales grew at 1.6%, which you can see in the lower left-hand quadrant of the slide. This is mostly attributable to a number of large industrial loads we've recently added across our service territories, which are more than offsetting any economic challenges seen by our existing customers. We expect industrial load growth to continue to reflect the softness in manufacturing nationally, with only a modest increase this year. However, growth in industrial sales beyond this year should accelerate as borrowing costs moderate and several large loads currently under construction come online. In the upper left-hand corner of the slide, you'll see that residential load declined slightly in 2023. Usage per residential customer has declined for the past two years, as homes have become more energy efficient and workers spend more time in an office instead of at home. The negative impact of inflation on household budgets may be influencing usage as well. On a positive note, we've seen our residential customer base grow consistently in certain regions. In 2023, we added almost 31,000 net new residential customers across our footprint, resulting in a positive offset to this segment. Overall, we're optimistic about the positive trends in load over the next several years, especially from a commercial and industrial perspective. Our conservative approach to estimating large loads gives us a lot of confidence in the growth we forecasted.  In our next update, however, I would expect to see some upside in this area. Let's move on to Slide 12 to discuss the company's capitalization and liquidity position. In the top left table, you can see the FFO to debt metric stands at 13.2% for 2023. Positive changes in FFO were as outlined on the third quarter call, and included favorable changes in cash collateral, fuel recovery and other various drivers. These positive changes were somewhat offset by an $830 million increase in debt during the quarter primarily due to the issuance of long-term debt to prefund our March 2024 AEP parent maturity.  We are pleased that the team has overcome strong financial headwinds due to unfavorable weather and an unprecedented increase in interest rates to end the year above Moody's downgrade threshold of 13%. We expect our FFO to debt metric to continue to improve throughout 2024 as we progress towards our targeted range of 14% to 15%. This continued positive trend assumes normal weather for 2024 and continued growth in our cash flows through various regulatory activities, including recovery of our deferred fuel balances of approximately $425 million. Our debt to cap increased from the prior quarter by 60 basis points to 63%, and our parent debt to total debt is approximately 21.7%. In the lower left quadrant of this slide, you can see our liquidity summary, which remains strong at $3.4 billion, and is supported by our bank revolver and credit facility. Lastly, on the qualified pension front, our funding status remains unchanged from the prior quarter to end the year at just over 100%. While falling interest rates increased the liability during the quarter, this increase was offset by positive asset returns. Turning to Slide 13. I'll give a quick recap of today's message. We delivered on our commitments for 2023 despite the significant challenges we faced. Weather was one of the most mild years on record for the AEP system in the past 30 years, resulting in a negative $0.37 impact year-over-year and $0.21 versus normal weather. To put a little more context to those numbers, our heating degree days were down 36% compared to normal across the system. Also, interest expense was a $0.45 hurdle to overcome versus 2022 results.  We work diligently throughout the year to reprioritize and balance our plan by adjusting the timing of discretionary spend while staying focused on meeting our core business needs. While admittedly facing some challenges on the regulatory front, we secured many rate outcomes that were critical in supporting our objectives to provide reliable service to our customers. Looking into this year, we are optimistic about the opportunities and prepared to face any challenges ahead of us. We reaffirm our guidance for 2024 of $5.53 to $5.73 per share, our long-term growth rate of 6% to 7% and an improved balance sheet while continuing to implement our capital program, taking care of the customer, earning our authorized return and executing on our strategic priorities. I would like to take a moment and thank Julie Sloat for her 23 years with AEP. Julie has made a positive impact on AEP and will be missed by many. Ben, we welcome you to the AEP management team. Your leadership in the industry is well respected, and you will be embraced by the employees of AEP. The entire management team looks forward to working with you and the board as we look to enhance value for all AEP stakeholders.  Thank you for your time today. Operator, can you open up the call for questions. Good morning. So obviously, the slides are leaning on the successes of AEP. You've reiterated your earnings guidance, balance sheet targets, growth rate, CapEx numbers. I guess outside of some management shuffling, what do you see is broken? I guess, what's the goal of the review? What's on the table, what's off the table? Yeah. No, Ben, as you said, it's underpinned by the $43 billion 5-year capital plan. I'd also point to what Ben made an observation as a board member and in his opening remarks about our O&M. There's a chart in our deck that you can refer to, right? We've doubled the rate base of this company while basically keeping O&M flat over that entire 10-year period. I think that's a remarkable accomplishment and that's our plan going forward as we continue to grow this company and basically repurpose and reallocate O&M. I also talked in my remarks about the load opportunities. I tend to kind of take a measured approach to this. But we really are optimistic about the opportunities that we're seeing there. As I said, the commercial load growth is just amazing. And we're seeing some good opportunities in economic development activities in industrial as well.  And then lastly, of course, underpinning that plan is improved returns. Right? We are not earning where we need to earn, and we need to have the regulatory execution and prudency reviewed to make sure, right, that we are hitting the mark there. So I think all in all, that kind of underpins the plan going forward. Yeah. So I'll take the first question. Our 5-year plan is really based off the midpoint of the current year's guidance. And our plan is to grow basically on that midpoint between the 6% to 7% range with no real kind of ups and downs identified through there.  I'll let Ben answer the -- Yeah. I think you -- we're also referring maybe to pioneer in Prairie Wind and our decision to keep those assets. The reality is, right, these contribute earnings to AEP, their attractive returns. And overall, it was really insignificant, right, to our overall financing plan if we were planning on selling those assets. So it really goes back to the root of what Ben said, as we reviewed the opportunities before us in competitive transmission and then looked at other transmission assets that we have, we -- we're embracing it. It's time for us as the leader in transmission to continue, right, to lead that space, and that's what we plan to do. Yeah. So thank you for that question. And our message has changed a bit there on the timing. But what I would tell you is really kind of timing is not what is most important. It's really the trend that we're on, and then it's hitting the mark of 14%. And it's the sustainability on staying in that range as we go through the 5-year plan. So let me comment on a couple of things. Right? We said we would be above 13% by year-end, and we were. And we didn't make any excuses for the soft weather that happened in 2023. Note also that 13% is the downgrade threshold at Moody's.  And second, right, the trend is very positive. Right? This quarter, we're going to have another roll off of cash collateral in Q1. I think the number is around $390 million that will come out of the 12-month average. And also, we are working on down our deferred fuel balances. And then lastly, right, we clearly show our models and review those with the agencies. Those models indicate that we would be in the range this year and be in the range over the longer term. That's what's most important, right, hitting the mark, trending in that positive direction and staying in the range.  So again, the timing, which month or which quarter is not important, it's the three things that I mentioned earlier. Okay. Thanks, Anthony. Our equity needs haven't changed since EEI. You may be referring to maybe an older forecast we had some months back. But what you're seeing in our deck today is consistent, right, with what we've shown at EEI.  I'll let Peggy go ahead and mark -- talk about the returns. Thank you. Yeah, in Ohio and Texas, right? We're -- those are deregulated states. In our Indiana, Michigan territory, clearly, there would be opportunities for generation there to serve those customers. Yeah. Our EEI guidance, right, we kind of change the waterfall based on the actual, right? But what's in or out hasn't changed, Paul. As Ben mentioned, we're in the process that we plan to conclude here in the next several months on retail and distributed businesses. He also mentioned that we're closing NMRD today, which there'll be a benefit from that sale coming through. But everything is underpinned. Remember, too, when you look at the waterfall, we took the Generation and Marketing segment down to what we would call much more normal contributions. I'm not concerned that about the ability to take the proceeds, use them as appropriate to get that accretion as we go forward. But no, it's still the same plan, if you will, as we put out at EEI. No, it's operating. Yeah. And Paul, clearly, the data center load that we're experiencing is going to create an opportunity, right, to spread fixed costs, right, along a bigger base and improve the headroom opportunity there as well."

            "name": "Ben Fowke",
            "content": "Well, thank you, Darcy. Good morning and welcome to American Electric Power's fourth quarter 2023 earnings call. It's great to have a chance to reconnect with you, although I never thought it would be under these circumstances.  As you know the AEP board of directors made a decision to remove Julie Sloat from her duties as Chair, President and CEO. Taking this action was not easy, but the board believes it was in the best interest of AEP and its stakeholders to do so. On behalf of the board and the entire AEP family. I would like to wish Julie well and thank her for all her contributions. I would also like to assure everyone that Julie's departure was not due to any unethical behavior, disagreements of financial policy or because of any violation of AEP's code of conduct.  Now, as many of you are aware after my retirement from Xcel Energy, I joined the AEP board in February of 2022. I was attracted to this board because I was impressed with AEP's business model, its strong asset base and the quality of its leadership team and board. I'm even more impressed two years later. In my tenure here,  I've seen the AEP team rise to meet multiple challenges. Let me give you some examples starting with earnings. For 14 years in a row, AEP has met or exceeded earnings guidance, and 2023 is no exception. Our operating earnings came in at $5.25, that's within our guidance range despite $0.37 of unfavorable weather and $.45 of increased interest cost over the prior year. As you know, controlling O&M expense has been a challenge for the industry. And AEP has met that challenge, essentially keeping O&M flat for the last 10 years, while at the same time doubling its asset base. This team's continuous focus on O&M efficiency is nothing short of excellent.  You may also recall that in early 2023, the Texas Commission denying a petition to be part of SWEPCO is 999-megawatt renewables project for $2.2 billion. But the team didn't miss a beat and put the project back on track with Arkansas and Louisiana ultimately stepping up to move forward with the full project. As a result, and including SWEPCO. Today, we have commission approval of $6.6 billion of new renewable projects throughout AEP's service territory, representing a 70% achievement of our current 5-year $9.4 billion new generation capital plan. I hope you would agree with me that that is really solid execution.  Initiatives to simplify and de-risk our portfolio are squarely in the focus of the board and the management team. And we are pleased with the great progress made. Last year, we completed the sale of our unregulated renewables portfolio, bringing in $1.2 billion of cash proceeds. We should be closing on our New Mexico renewable development solar portfolio within the next day or two. This in combination with the expected conclusion of our retail and distributed resources sales process in the second quarter, keeps us on schedule to achieve our 2024 asset sales targets.  Now as we move forward, AEP will continue to be a disciplined portfolio manager and we will be willing to take action when price and the ability to execute intersect. To that end, we've made the decision to retain our ownership interest in both our Prairie Wind and Pioneer Transmission joint ventures. We also completed the review of Transource and ultimately determined that owning this joint venture fits strategically within our portfolio. We'd like our remaining assets. And we'll focus going forward on doubling down on our efforts to achieve constructive regulatory outcomes that will allow us to provide the quality of service our customers need and expect.  Regarding Icahn Capital, our recent agreement came about from a combination of a constructive dialogue between AEP and the Icahn teams. Like us, the Icahn team believes AEP shares are undervalued and there's meaningful upside potential for our investors. The addition to AEP's board will bring fresh perspective as we continue to execute on strategic priorities and enhance value for our stakeholders.  Looking ahead, today, we are reaffirming our 2024 full year operating earnings guidance range of $5.53 to $5.73, as well as our long-term earnings growth rate of 6% to 7%, which is underpinned by a $43 billion 5-year capital plan, in addition to 14% to 15% FFO to debt target, which Chuck will expand upon shortly.  You should know that I am committed to my role as Interim President and CEO. And I believe I can add value while the board works to identify a permanent successor. So before I turn it over to Peggy for regulatory updates and Chuck for financial review, let me also acknowledge that 2023 has been at times a challenging year at AEP. There's certainly been some twists and turns and a few bumps in the road. But I would encourage all of you to focus on the key opportunities that lie ahead. I have tremendous confidence in our team's ability to achieve our objectives as we work every day to deliver safe, reliable and affordable energies to our customer.  With that, I'll turn it over to Peggy. Well, this is Ben. And I can tell you that I don't think I would use the word broken. I think there's areas where we can do better. I think -- and I think we showed you in the script, many of the accomplishments we made. We also recognize that we can do better on getting constructive regulatory outcomes. So strategically, our priorities remain the same. We have completed, as we mentioned, a review of Transource. We want to keep that asset. We think it's a great asset. And I think given the various changes that FERC is looking at, I think it gives us a lot of optionality. We'll continue to be very disciplined portfolio managers. I said it on my scripted remarks, but always willing to transact where price and the ability to execute intersect, and that's a key point. And finally, though, if you step back, I think one of the ways you add value in this industry long term is by placing CapEx at one times book, investing in CapEx at one times book and getting constructive recovery of that. And again, we've done pretty good on that, but we can do better. And we're going to look at the people, the process and the planning that goes into that. Those constructive outcomes, and we're going to do it through the lens of what's important to our local leaders and stakeholders.  Extremely important that we keenly listen to what they want and what they need at a local level. And I think you can translate that then to a much better chance for success, and then you get into that virtuous circle where invested capital not only is good for customers and the communities, but good for shareholders as well. So that's the plan going forward. Well, I think there's areas where we have improvement, but I will turn it over to Peggy and/or Chuck to elaborate on that. Well, it's definitely an external search. I'll start with that. And I don't want to narrow down to any specific background, but ideally -- and by the way, I think we're going to get a very robust list of candidates. So AEP is a great company with great assets. And I think it's going to be an attractive destination for many, many talented people. So I think it's going to be great to pick from that talent.  Ideally, you get a -- somebody that is a seasoned executive in the utility industry, is well known in the investor community. I think that's extremely important, has great leadership qualities. We've got a lot of talent at AEP, and we want to develop that talent. And ultimately, it would be ideal if they have multi-jurisdictional experience and the ability to achieve regulatory success.  Those are -- that's a big wish list. But again, I think we're going to get a lot of great candidates. Thank you. Hey, Jeremy. Good morning. Yeah. I really just will probably just rehash what we've said in the press release and in our scripted remarks. I mean the Icahn -- additional board members came after discussions with the Icahn team and the AEP team. We actually welcome their perspective. They share the opinion as we do that AEP shares are undervalued, and we want to work together to unleash shareholder value. Regarding Julie's departure, I mean, I really can't go into any more details than what we've already said. It was a full board decision after discussions with Julie, and we decided that the best path forward is to transition to a new CEO. We're going to continue to work hard to deliver shareholder value. I think the Icahn board members will give us a fresh perspective as we pursue those goals. Well, we really like the assets we have, okay? We've completed the strategic reviews, but I mean, the price -- we're going to continue to look for opportunities to do the right thing for our shareholders. But I think we're in a -- an enviable position, that the assets we have can also achieve our strategic goals.  And Chuck mentioned where we are with FFO to debt and those targets. So I think we're in a pretty good position, quite honestly. So again, as I said before, not to be redundant, but I guess it will be. We'll be good portfolio managers, and we'll continue to be open to transactions if the price is right and the ability to execute is viable. But in the meantime, we're going to do the blocking and tackling that in the long term, gets you the result that -- results that you're going to want to see. You're welcome. Well, I mean, I'll kick it over to Chuck in a minute, but the $43 billion on the 5-year capital plan underpins the 6% to 7%. In the years where we might have unfavorable weather or other things like that, that's the resiliency of this AEP management team that I talked about. And it's not just one year. It's a -- look back, I mentioned 14 years of hitting what we said we were going to do. Yeah, sometimes you get regulatory bumps in the road and other things that might happen. But if you look back historically, and we look forward, we produce. I mean, we're in 11 jurisdictions. We're going to file rate cases. But if you look at history, we generally do pretty well. And when we have a bump in the road, we figure out how to absorb it and what we need to do better going forward.  Chuck, I don't know if you want to add to that? Yeah. I mean I think, first of all, we'll take our time, and we'll find the absolute best successor permanent successor that we can. I think as part of that process, we obviously will have the strategic discussions. I mean, I think the board is very comfortable with our strategy and our strategic priorities. I suspect that the ultimate permanent successor CEO will also be comfortable with those strategies and perhaps can figure out a better way to execute on them. That would be the goal. But we're not looking at a complete dismantling of our strategic priorities. You're welcome, Nick. Well, I mean -- and I'll let Chuck -- this is Ben. I'll let Chuck augment what I'm going to say, which is pretty much what I said before. Transmission is a great asset. And we are, obviously, the largest transmission provider in the United States, and we like that position. We will be open to things that make sense that would do even better for shareholders. But we don't feel compelled we have to do anything. So I think that puts us in a better position as we move forward.  Chuck, I don't know if you want to add to that. Good morning. Well, I'm going to turn it over to Peggy, who is the point on that. But this -- it isn't like this is something we're just initiating. This is something that I've heard discussed as a board member at the board level. It's something I'm going to get very much involved in with Peggy. We've got a good team, but we're going to have to -- we'll make sure that we do what we need to do to get better outcomes in the future.  And I mean, there's a lot of blocking and tackling, that really behind the scene stuff that goes into the actual processing, executing and planning of a rate case. And it gets really down in the weeds pretty quickly, but those things add up. Peggy, I'll turn it over to you. The biggest opportunity so far have been in Ohio and Texas. And in our forecast, for our 5-year plan, we have included the capital needed to serve those customers. If there is incremental growth beyond that, it would be an opportunity that we'd have to evaluate and figure out how we would smartly finance it. And meet the generation needs that come with it. Yeah. Well, I mean, you're right. There's like -- I think there's 5.3 million shares that -- something like that that Icahn holds. And we had discussions with Icahn. And we settled on the two incremental board seats and advisory position.  I think back to Julie, I'll just repeat what I said. This was a full board decision after discussions with Julie and the board, and we determined it was best for AEP to transition to a new CEO. So you can read what you want into that, but I think I'm just going to just keep it as it is. It's a full board decision, and you need the full board to make a decision to remove the CEO. Good morning. I'm going to turn it over to Peggy and Chuck in a minute, Sophie. But I mean, we're always going to look to put capital where we can get the best returns. There's baseline capital that you need to do to make sure that you never compromise resiliency, reliability or safety. So we -- but apart from that, I think it gets back to what I said. It's listening to what those local jurisdictions really want and need. And that can also shape your capital needs because, quite frankly, it can shape your regulatory outcomes. So I'll turn it over to the team if they have anything to add to that. Thank you. Yeah, I think so. It's -- the strategy is great. We just have to execute, and that's what we're keenly focused on, Paul. Well, let me just say I'm committed to stay as long as it takes. So no shortcuts. But I can't see it being shorter than six months, and hopefully, it doesn't take more than a year. But again, it's going to -- the process will take the time it needs to take to get the absolute right candidate in place. Yeah. I mean I think -- I mean I'm going to turn it over to the team, Paul, but the amount of load growth that we see in our jurisdictions, I mean that's a great opportunity, economic development that we can be a big part of, either helping to drive it or certainly providing the infrastructure to allow it. Those are great opportunities. And that's -- everybody wants that in all jurisdictions. But again, we're going to be -- very carefully listen to what our jurisdictions want and need and respond accordingly. Peggy or Chuck? Thank you. Thank you, Paul. I appreciate that."

            "name": "Peggy Simmons",
            "content": "Thanks, Ben. And good morning, everyone. Now I'd like to turn to update on our ongoing regulatory and legislative efforts. While we made important regulatory progress in 2023, it is clear that we can do even more to facilitate successful and constructive outcomes. Details of related activities can be found in the appendix on Slides 29 through 31.  Closing the authorized versus earned ROE gap is a key area of focus for us. Our fourth quarter ROE came in at 8.8% a slight improvement over third quarter. This also reflects impacts of approximately 40 basis points from mild weather conditions in 2023. Our efforts to improve and bridge the ROE gap is supported by work we've done related to the recent passage of legislation that will help position us to provide safe and reliable service while managing costs and reducing regulatory lag.  Most importantly, we obtained securitization in Kentucky, a biannual Distribution Cost Recovery Factor or DCRF in Texas, and rate reviews every two years in Virginia.  On the regulatory front, we secured several important wins over the course of 2023, including achieving constructive base rate case outcomes in Louisiana, Oklahoma, and Virginia, reestablishing formula rate plans in Arkansas and Louisiana and reaching a settlement and our Ohio ESP V filings, which were waiting to commission order. Overall, in 2023, we secured $312 million and rate relief. We also filed new base cases in Indiana, Michigan and Kentucky in 2023. In Indiana, we have already reached a settlement, which we filed in December, and we expect the commission decision by June of this year. In Michigan, we continue to advance through the process and currently expect a ruling in the case in July. In Kentucky, the base case and securitization application was approved by the commission earlier this year.  Other upcoming cases include a new Oklahoma base rate case for PSO, which we filed last month. Additional filings in the first quarter will include an AEP Texas base rate case and the APCo Virginia biennial rate review that should have the benefits of legislative changes attained in 2023. While we reached many constructive outcomes in 2023, we are disappointed in a couple disallowances recently received. First, in Texas, the commission issued a decision disallowing capitalization of AFUDC related to our Turk plant in mid-December 2023. And we filed a motion for reconsideration a week later. In West Virginia, last month, the commission disallowed a portion of our March 2021 to February 2023 under recovered fuel, and we recently filed an appeal with the West Virginia Supreme Court on February 8.  We are also disappointed with the FERC order we received in January 2024 related to treatment of accumulated deferred income taxes associated with net operating loss carryforwards, or NOLC, mostly affecting our Transmission Holdco segment. We just filed for rehearing on February 20. Shortly, Chuck will discuss the related unfavorable net financial impact to 2023 operating earnings. Looking ahead, we know there is more work to be done as we advance our regulatory strategies in 2024 to achieve a forecasted regulated ROE of 9.1%. We are well on our way this year with almost 70% of rate relief either secured or related to mechanisms that are more administrative in nature. We look forward to continuing to engage constructively with our regulators and strengthening relationships at all levels. As Ben mentioned, this year, AEP continued to advance our 5-year $9.4 billion regulated renewables capital plan and now have a total of $6.6 billion approved by various state commissions. More detail of resource additions can be viewed in the appendix on Slides 32 through 34.  As previously disclosed, we received approval for APCo's 143 megawatts of wind generation, totaling more than $400 million of investment. This is in addition to the previously approved 209 megawatts of solar and wind projects for approximately $500 million. In 2023, we also received commission approval in both Indiana and Michigan for I&M 469 megawatts of solar projects, representing $1 billion of investment, PSO's 995.5-megawatt renewables portfolio for $2.5 billion and SWEPCO's 999-megawatt renewables for $2.2 billion.  Our fleet transformation goals are aligned with and supported by our integrated resource plan. We have pending requests for proposals for a diverse set of additional generation resources at I&M in Kentucky, PSO and SWEPCO, with more to come from other operating companies, including APCo. These generation investments are an integral part of our broader capital program, which is 100% focused on regulated assets and the production tax credits that are generated from our renewable energy projects, our path along to and provide great value to our customers. In addition to these projects, AEP is advancing an additional $27 billion in investments in our transmission and distribution systems to support reliability and resiliency. These combined investments underpin our 6% to 7% EPS growth commitment while mitigating customer bill impacts.  With that, I'll pass it over to Chuck to walk through the performance drivers in details supporting our financial commitments. I think as it relates from a regulatory perspective, I do think what we're going to do is continue to build on the constructive legislative and regulatory outcomes that we have had. We're going to further strengthen our regulatory relationships, and we're really going to be keenly focused on execution.  I think that some of the disappointments that we had in 2023, we're going to learn from them, and we're going to go back out and focus on execution from that standpoint. Yeah. I would just add -- and looking forward to working with Ben and talking through the regulatory strategy. We've had positive regulatory outcomes in 2023. And when we shared some of those earlier, there were some disappointments that we highlighted. But I would bring forth the legislative work that we have done, and that's going to help to address lag. We've done work that's going to help to remove some of the lag in Virginia with our biannual rate review for Virginia, where it was three years before. We're going to also look at improving on -- we said with Kentucky that it was going to be a two-step process, and we very much view that we had a constructive outcome in the order that we received earlier in January with the securitization.  So we're going to continue to build upon that. I agree, we do have a talented team, and we're just going to keep moving forward, and I look forward, again, as I said, to working with Ben on ways we can continue to improve there. Yeah. As it relates to -- for 2024, our ROE, we're projecting at 9.1% is what we're -- for our regulated segments. And we're going to continue to work on closing the gap, a lot of what I've already said earlier, just kind of building off with some of those legislative successes that we were able to have, reducing some of the lag from that perspective. I would just say, yeah, I echo Ben's comments there on -- there's a certain amount of capital we need to continue to be resilient and meet the reliability needs of our customers. And as well as from a safety perspective. Those where we have really constructive outcomes, clearly, we know in I&M, we have the forward-looking test years. We're able to continue to have that capital to allocate there to meet what those needs are. And we just continue to look at what our outcomes are by jurisdiction. Yeah. In Kentucky, we do have a 2-year fuel review that has been underway, and we are waiting, the outcome as it relates to that. We had a hearing earlier this month actually. And then from -- what was your other question with it related to SWEPCO? Yeah, that was part -- excuse me, sorry, go ahead, finish your question. Yeah. That was part of the review, and that is ongoing as well. So -- but Darcy can definitely give you some more information on that, if that wasn't clear enough. Yeah. So over our 5-year plan, we look to be typically to be in the 9.5% range. So what we're looking to do is increase by 10 basis points each year. And we think that that achieve ongoing. We continue to work through our regulatory outcomes to be able to close that gap. And I'll just briefly add to that. In 2023, we landed 92 new customer load additions totaling about 5-gig and adding additional jobs to our service territory. So I think that that's certainly 1 area and aspect of how we're going to help with affordability as well."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the American Electric Power Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the call over to Darcy Reese, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nDarcy Reese: Thank you, Eric. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the third quarter 2023 earnings call for American Electric Power. We appreciate you taking time today to join us. Our earnings release, presentation slides and related financial information are available on our website at AEP.com.  Today, we will be making forward-looking statements during the call. There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements. Please refer to our SEC filings for a discussion of these factors.  Joining me this morning for opening remarks are Julia Sloat, our Chair, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Chuck Zebula, our Chief Financial Officer. We will take your questions following their remarks. I will now turn the call over to Julie.\nJulia Sloat: Thanks, Darcy. Welcome to American Electric Power's third quarter 2023 earnings call. It's good to be with everyone this morning. Before I discuss our third quarter performance, I would like to introduce our CFO, Chuck Zebula, who will walk us through the results today. Chuck has been with the company for 25 years and has a deep understanding of our business. He hit the ground running in his new role, and we're grateful for his leadership. Many of you are familiar with Chuck, and I'm confident that you enjoy working with him in the CFO role.  I'm pleased to share that the execution of our strategy is on track. AEP is well positioned to deliver on a robust and flexible 5-year $40 billion capital plan with an emphasis on our generation fleet transformation and investments in our energy delivery infrastructure as we need our customer needs. While our industry continues to transform amid this dynamic environment characterized by more extreme weather, rising interest rates and supply chain constraints, AEP has continued to adapt and take thoughtful actions to stay our course. We're keeping the customer at the center of every decision we make, while also balancing and listening to our stakeholders who are critical to our success.  This quarter, we made progress on our ongoing efforts to simplify and derisk our business profile through portfolio management, directing all proceeds of those efforts to the regulated business and to balance sheet management, which I'll speak to in more detail in a moment. We've also been working hard on the regulatory front. I'll provide insight into our success in the addition of renewable store portfolio and the many positive developments on regulatory and legislative initiatives.  A summary of our third quarter 2023 business updates can be found on Slide 6 of today's presentation. AEP reported strong third quarter operating earnings of $1.77 per share or $924 million. We have a flexible business plan that allows us to deliver on our financial commitments while taking into account mild weather in the first half of the year and the higher for longer interest rate environment. As we actively manage the business today, we're narrowing our guidance for 2023 full year operating earnings to a range of $5.24 to $5.34 while reaffirming the $5.29 midpoint and our long-term earnings growth rate of 6% to 7%. Moreover, last week, we announced an increase in our dividend, which is consistent with our earnings growth rate and within our targeted payout ratio of 60% to 70%.  In a few minutes, Chuck will talk about the support we have for our narrow 2023 earnings guidance range, which includes O&M management and positive load outlook as we drive economic development within our service territory. While our FFO to debt was 11.4% this quarter, we expect that this metric will improve materially by year-end and fall within the targeted rate of 14% to 15% in early 2024. Chuck will also touch on the short path to this balance sheet target.  We continue to make progress in our efforts to simplify and derisk our portfolio. In August, we announced the completion of the sale of our 1,365 megawatt unregulated renewables portfolio to IRG acquisition Holdings, which resulted in after-tax proceeds totaling $1.2 billion. A summary of this sale can be seen on Slide 7.  We've also made headway on some of our other asset sales that we previously discussed. A summary of this can be referenced on Slide 8. In May, we announced the sale of our New Mexico renewable development solar portfolio, also known as NMRD. The book value of AP's investment as of September 30 was $119 million. We're currently on track with our 550 joint venture partner, PNM Resources, as we target to close on this transaction in the late fourth quarter of this year or early first quarter of next.  We expect to continue the noncore business sales processes we have underway as we enter 2024. The sales of our retail and distributed resources businesses were launched in August with book value of $244 million and $353 million, respectively, as of the end of the third quarter. We expect to reach a sale agreement in the first quarter of next year with an anticipated closing in the first half of 2024. In July, we announced the sales of Prairie Wind transmission and Pioneer Transmission, our noncore transmission joint ventures, as of the end of the third quarter, AEP's portion of rate base associated with these investments was $107 million. We expect to launch the sales process soon and close in 2024.  Finally related to , while there are no new updates for now. We anticipate completing the strategic review by the end of this year. So please stay tuned. AEP portion of rate base for this particular investment joint venture was $348 million as of quarter end.  Let me shift gears and provide you with an update on our regulated renewables investment plan. The teams remain focused and made solid progress. As you know, we have $8.6 billion of regulated renewables in our 5-year capital plan. We now have a total of $6 billion of the investment plan approved and an additional $800 million currently before commissions for approval with each of these projects providing valuable fuel savings for our customers. More detail on our renewable resource additions can be viewed in the appendix on Slides 32 through 34.  As we've previously disclosed, both PSO's 995.5-megawatt renewable portfolio for $2.5 billion and SWEPCO's 999-megawatt renewable portfolio over $2.2 billion were approved earlier this year. At a collective $4.7 billion, these two portfolios alone comprise a large component of the approved $6 billion amount I just mentioned.  Additionally, in APCo service territory, we're also pleased to report a positive development. In September, Virginia approved 143 megawatts of owned wind for more than $400 million, building upon APCo's existing 29 megawatts of wind and solar projects that were approved last year, which totaled approximately $500 million.  Moving across our service territory to I&M, we filed to seek approval for recovery of two investment -- of investment in two owned solar projects totaling 469 megawatts, which represents $1 billion of total investment. We're making progress on this front as we received commission approval last month in Indiana for both the 224-megawatt May Apple and 245-megawatt Lake Trout solar projects. In Michigan the Commission approved May Apple back in August, and we'll decide on Lake Trout in the first quarter of next year.  We also await a commission order expected any time now for the 154-megawatt rock balls wind farm at PSO for approximately $150 million. Importantly, our regulated renewables plants are aligned with and supported by our integrated resource plans. We have issued a request for proposals for additional owned resources at APCo and IM with more to come from other operating companies in the near future as we listen and learn and respond to state preferences.  Now I'd like to turn to updates on our ongoing regulatory and legislative initiatives. We've been engaged in efforts across our service territory to close the authorized versus earned ROE gap. Our third quarter ROE came in at 8.7%, driven in part by the unfavorable weather in the first half of 2023 that I mentioned earlier, which depressed this measure by 40 basis points. While this is a modest improvement over the last quarter, we are aware that more can be done and more needs to be done on this front. Closing the gap will remain a primary focus into 2024 as we take federal state and customer preferences top of mind, along with meeting the needs of our communities.  We remain focused on reducing the gap going into year-end, while still meeting our earnings guidance. To that end, I'm happy to confirm that we have settlement in place for APCo Virginia's 2020 to 2022 triennial and APO Ohio's ESP5, both cases which were filed earlier this year. we're awaiting commission decisions in these states and Virginia's orders expected in the fourth quarter of this year and Ohio will likely be issued in the first quarter of 2024. In addition, we filed new base cases in Indiana and Michigan in the third quarter. Both filings we requested -- in both on we requested a 10.5% ROE and taste drivers included distribution investment in technology, enhanced reliability and grid modernization using 2024 forecast and test years. We anticipate the new rates will be an effective next year.  The team has been active on the legislative front in Texas -- with Texas legislation pass and June allowing utilities to file the distribution cost recovery factor mechanism or DCRF twice per year, sit of once per year. This legislation also allows the DCRF mechanism to be used by utility, even if it has a pending rate case for seating underway. Consequently, the legislation will help improve AEP's regulatory lag in Texas to the tune of approximately 50 basis points and earned ROE starting in 2024. In fact, our April 2023 DCRF filing was approved and rates went into effect in September.  For Kentucky Power, our June 2023 based base application incorporated the comprehensive rate review, a 9.9% ROE and a request to allow for the securitization of $471 million of regulatory assets, ensuring Kentucky Power is best positioned to provide safe and reliable service while managing costs. Constructive intervener testimony was filed in October, including support for securitization. By statute, implementation of interim rates is permissible in January 2024.  Moving to PSO, you'll recall that in May, we reached a settlement with the commission staff, the attorney general and other parties in Oklahoma's PSO base case, which included a 9.5% ROE and provided for approval for more efficient cost recovery mechanisms. We implemented interim rates in June while we await a commission order, which is expected any time now.  As you know, the management of fuel cost recovery is a top priority with AP's deferred fuel balance across our vertically integrated utilities shrinking sequentially and totaling $1.2 billion as of the end of the third quarter of this year. We have worked with stakeholders to intentionally adapt our fuel cost recovery mechanisms across our jurisdictions with the objective being to balance cost recovery with customer impact. So West Virginia fuel proceeding is approaching resolution. Recall in our April 2023 fuel recovery application, we filed two options for consideration. One option amortizes the fuel balance over 3 years. In the second option, we have respectively set forth for the West Virginia Commission consideration, the use of the 2023 securitization legislation to manage our $553 million deferred fuel balance along with securitizing store cost balances and net plant balances of generation assets. The generation assets are currently embedded in rate and assume to operate through 2040 and securitizing those assets nearly fully offset the fuel cost recovery impacts to customers.  We appreciate the engagement with all the stakeholder parties as we work toward a conclusion in this case by year-end and a constructive path for West Virginia. More detail on regulated activities can be found in the appendix on Slides 35 through 38.  I'm pleased with the progress we've made this quarter and by the great work underway to actively manage the business, deliver on our commitments and create value for our investors, all while keeping affordability and reliability for our customers at the center of everything we do. We have a strong team in place, and I'm confident that we'll continue to execute on our strategic priorities and advance our capital investment plan to deliver reliable, affordable power to our customers. I look forward to seeing many of you in person at the EEI Conference in a couple of weeks. At the conference in Phoenix will provide some additional color on our business strategy, share our 2024 guidance and other financial details, including our 2024 through 2028 capital plan and related 5-year cash flows. Now with that, I'll hand it off to Chuck, we'll walk through performance drivers and details supporting our financial targets. Chuck?\nCharles Zebula: Thank you, Julie. It's good to be with you and everyone on the call this morning. As many of you know, I've been in many different roles at AP, but this is my first earnings call as the CFO. I'm truly honored to return to the exceptional finance team at AEP and lead this area as we embrace the opportunity to invest in our regulated utilities and serve our customers with affordable and reliable electric service.  Today, I will discuss our third quarter and year-to-date results. share some updates on our service territory load and economy and finish with commentary on credit metrics and liquidity as well as confirming our guidance financial targets and a recap of our commitments to stakeholders.  Let's go to Slide 9, which shows the comparison of GAAP to operating earnings GAAP earnings for the third quarter were $1.83 per share compared to $1.33 per share in 2022. Year-to-date GAAP earnings through September were $3.62 per share compared to $3.76 per share in 2022. As was mentioned on the second quarter earnings call, our year-to-date comparison of GAAP to operating earnings reflects the loss on the sale of the contracted renewables business as a nonoperating cost as well as an adjustment to true-up costs related to the terminated Kentucky transaction. In addition, we have reflected our typical mark-to-market adjustment and the impact of capitalized incentive compensation in Texas as nonoperating earnings as well. There's a detailed reconciliation of GAAP to operating earnings on Pages 17 and 18 of the presentation today.  Moving to Slide 10. Operating earnings for the third quarter totaled $1.77 per share or $924 million compared to $1.62 per share or $831 million last year. The higher performance compared to last year was primarily driven by favorable rate changes and transmission project execution, increased retail load and favorable O&M across our segments. Operating earnings for vertically integrated utilities were $1 per share, up $0.03 from last year. Favorable drivers included rate changes across multiple jurisdictions, increases in retail load, depreciation, transmission revenue and O&M. These items were somewhat offset by higher interest expense and unfavorable weather year-over-year. the vertically integrated segment did see positive weather versus normal in the third quarter of about $0.04 per share, but this was compared to positive weather in the third quarter last year of about $0.06 per share.  Consistent with our first and second quarter results, depreciation was favorable at the vertically integrated segment by $0.01 in quarter 3, primarily due to the expiration of the Rockport Unit 2 lease in December 2022. However, if we exclude the impact of the lease depreciation would have been about $0.02 unfavorable, which is consistent with incremental investment activity in our vertically integrated segment. INM should see an additional $0.02 favorable net depreciation in the fourth quarter as well.  The Transmission & Distribution Utility segment earned $0.39 per share, up $0.07 compared to last year. Favorable drivers in this segment included increased retail load, transmission revenue, positive rate changes in Texas and Ohio and favorable O&M Partially offsetting these favorable items were higher depreciation and higher interest expense. The AEP Transmission Holdco segment contributed $0.39 per share, up $0.06 compared to last year. Favorable investment growth of $0.02, coupled with favorable income taxes of $0.02 are largely driving the change here.  Generation and Marketing produced $0.18 per share, up $0.04 from last year. The positive variance is primarily due to favorable impacts associated with the contracted renewable sale in August, along with higher generation margins and land sales. These favorable items were partially offset by lower retail and wholesale power margins.  Finally, Corporate and Other was down $0.05 per share, driven by unfavorable interest and partially offset by favorable O&M. Please note that our year-to-date operating earnings performance by segment is shown on Slide 16 in the appendix of our presentation today.  Many of the positive drivers are the same for the year as for the quarter, and the negative year-to-date variance is driven largely by unfavorable weather and higher interest expenses. Before we move on, I want to add a few more comments on O&M, including our outlook for the remainder of the year. We saw favorable O&M in the third quarter compared to the prior year, which was consistent with our expectations. For the fourth quarter, we are expecting more than $100 million of favorable O&M versus the prior year, which would bring us to a net favorable position for the full year from a consolidated perspective. The favorable change anticipated in the fourth quarter is largely a result of the timing of O&M spending in the prior year, including employee-related expenses and a contribution to the AEP Foundation in the fourth quarter of last year, along with continued actions we have taken, such as holding employment positions open, reducing travel and adjusting the timing of discretionary spending.  Turning to Slide 11. I will provide an update on whether normalized low performance for the quarter and our expectations through the end of the year. Overall, load has come in ahead of plan all year, and the third quarter was no exception. Looking to the bottom right-hand quadrant. Normalized retail load grew 2.1% in Q3 from a year earlier. You also noticed that we have updated our full year 2023 estimates based on the strong loan growth we've experienced year-to-date. Weather normalized retail load is now expected to finish this year 2.3% higher than 2022, an increase that is nearly 3x higher than our original expectations. This strength comes from exceptional growth in commercial load driven by data centers in Ohio, Texas and Indiana, but the third quarter also saw positive trends in our residential class, which is shown in the upper left-hand quadrant of the slide.  Residential load increased for the first time in more than a year in Q3 with growth of 0.6% from a year earlier. The relationship between customer incomes and inflation is a key driver of residential usage and has begun to stabilize as expected in the second half of this year. This month's CPI data point was yet another encouraging sign that inflationary pressures on our residential customers are continuing to lessen. We note that residential usage per customer have seen slight declines this year as energy efficiencies increase, more workers return to offices and customers change behavior due to inflation.  Fortunately, we are seeing strong enough growth in our customer base, especially in Texas and Ohio to help partially offset these trends. Year-to-date, we have added nearly 30,000 residential customers across our footprint.  Moving to the lower left-hand quadrant of the slide, our investor load declined in the third quarter, driven by a pullback in usage by some of our key manufacturing customers. namely chemical, plastic and tire producers as well as downstream participants of the energy industry. This reflects some of the softness in manufacturing nationally as producers have slowed activity in response to uncertainty around the economic outlook. We expect this to reverse itself in the months ahead as recent inflation and jobs data have reduced the probability of a recession occurring in the next year. We are forecasting industrial load to remain positive through the end of next year and beyond.  Moving to the upper right-hand quadrant of the slide, we see another impressive quarter for commercial load. In the third quarter, commercial load was 7.5% higher than a year ago, driven by the addition of new data center customers, mostly in Ohio, Texas and Indiana. We expect the pace of year-over-year growth in our commercial load to moderate some in 2024 as new projects work their way through the queue. Many of the large projects currently underway within our footprint won't come fully online until 2025. However, there is upside if a few of these projects move forward earlier than expected. Many of these gains are directly attributable to our ongoing efforts to facilitate more economic development across our operating footprint. We know that working with local stakeholders to attract more economic activity is a key strategy to providing value to the communities we serve. It allows us to prioritize investments that improve the customer experience while also mitigating rate impacts on our customer base.  Moving to Slide 12. In the lower left corner, you can see our FFO to debt metric stands at 11.4%, which is an increase of 30 basis points from last quarter but continues to be well below our targeted range of 14% to 15%. The primary reason for the increase is a $1.8 billion decrease in debt during the quarter due to long and short-term debt retirements, driven by proceeds received from our contracted renewable sale and the successful completion of our planned equity units conversion, both of which occurred in August. We expect this metric will continue to improve throughout the remainder of this year and anticipate reaching our targeted range in early next year as we see an improvement in FFO during that time.  We have included a table on the slide that shows the path to the targeted FFO to debt range early next year. These items -- these are items that impact both the 12-month rolling average as well as an estimated increase in the quarterly FFO. We anticipate a 180 to 190 basis point positive impact on FFO that enables the metric to be in the 13% to 14% range by year-end based on the following items: a roll-off of roughly $600 million in cash collateral, deferred fuel and other outflows from the fourth quarter of 2022 and continued cash recovery of deferred fuel balances in the fourth quarter of this year that total between $150 million and $200 million in accordance with the regulatory orders we have already received.  Moving into 2024, the continued roll-off of prior year cash collateral outfall in the amount of $390 million in the first quarter of 2023 and a $90 million adjustment from unfavorable weather in the first quarter of this year to normal weather in our forecast for next year, will result in an incremental 100 basis point improvement put us within our target range of 14% to 15%. Also, please note that we have updated our 2023 cash flow, as shown on Page 29 in the appendix. An increase of $1.2 billion in required capital is shown versus the original forecast, mostly due to a decrease of $800 million in cash from ops largely due to fuel inventory and an increase of $300 million in capital expenditures. Please note that our equity needs for 2023 are unchanged. The remaining years 2024 to 2027, along with rebilling 2028, will be updated at the upcoming EEI conference. Expect that this update will be consistent with our prior equity meetings and disclosures.  Moving to Slide 13. You can see our liquidity summary in the middle of the slide. Our 5-year $4 billion bank revolver and our 2-year $1 billion revolving credit facility to support our liquidity position, which remains strong at $3.5 billion. On a GAAP basis, our debt to cap decreased from the prior quarter by 220 basis points to 62.4%. This large change can be attributed to the large reduction in debt, driven by our contracted renewable sale and the completion of our planned equity units that I mentioned earlier.  On the qualified pension front, our funding status decreased 1.9% during the quarter to 100.3%. This is largely due to equity and fixed income losses in the third quarter as interest rates increased and equity indices fell in both August and September. These losses are partially offset by a decreased liability due to rising interest rates.  Let's go to Slide 14 for a quick recap of today's message. The third quarter produced growth in earnings well above the prior year, driven primarily by favorable rate changes, increased load and favorable O&M offsetting milder weather and increased interest expense. As we continue to move through the fourth quarter, we are focused on cost management efforts with the goal of mitigating the headwinds we have faced this year, primarily unfavorable weather and higher interest costs. The strong third quarter results and low growth, coupled with our proactive plan for the balance of the year, allow us to confidently narrow our operating guidance range to $5.24 to $5.34 per share. We also continue to be committed to our long-term growth rate of 6% to 7%. And as Julie mentioned earlier, our sales efforts to simplify and derisk the AEP portfolio remain on track. We really appreciate your time and our management team and I look forward to seeing you at the upcoming EEI Financial Conference in Phoenix. With that, I'm going to ask the operator to open the call so we can hear your questions or comments.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Nick Campanella with Barclays.\nNicholas Campanella: And congrats, Chuck on the new role. I wanted to actually start there, if I can. I know that there was just some language in the 8-K when you made the executive switch around the mandatory retirement age, in your interest in retiring before you reach that age. But I just wanted to ask, are your intentions here to stay on to the foreseeable future? Is this more temporary? Just how should we kind of think about your new role in company.\nCharles Zebula: Yes. No, thank you for the question. And look, I am absolutely embracing this opportunity that we have before us. It's very energizing to enter into a role like this. And although -- the AK did indicate that I'm committed to Julie and AEP to write this out as long as needed. And as long as I'm adding value right to the opportunity. So thank you for the question.\nNicholas Campanella: I appreciate the answer. And then I appreciate the walk on the FFO. That's helpful. I just wanted to confirm because S&P did move you to negative outlook. And I think in your prepared remarks, you said as you get to EEI, you anticipate equity needs being somewhat unchanged. So is it the right understanding that if you are in a CapEx rate scenario that your equity needs to still be modest and unchanged versus your prior view? And then secondly, understanding that the 11.4% has some reduction in debt from the renewable proceeds. The cash flow from those renewal proceeds, I guess, would be rolling off into next year. And I just want to triple check, that even with the asset sales, cash flow dilution, you still see yourselves above 14%.\nCharles Zebula: Yes. Yes, thanks for both questions. So yes, our equity needs will be consistent, right, with what we have disclosed prior. I mean, clearly, we'll be updating, right, the years in the cash flow forecast, but expect no surprises there. . On to your second question, yes, we tried to highlight right, on the slide, the FFO slide, the major drivers that you can point to and see what is rolling out as outflow. But absolutely, right, in our financial models, right? It takes into account, right, the absence of that cash flow. So we do expect to be in those ranges.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan.\nJeremy Tonet: We've seen a bit of a regime change as it relates to interest rates out there, given the sharp moves recently. Just wondering if you could talk a bit more about that and how AP is able to affirm the 6% to 7% long-term CAGR there in what could be higher for longer interest rate environment? What impact do you see on EPS 2023? And kind of how do you think about offsetting those headwinds?\nCharles Zebula: Yes. Joe, thank you for the question. I mean, look, we'll be giving you a walk right on 2024 at EEI. But there's no question that we are planning for an interest rate higher for longer environment. We've clearly been able to overcome those headwinds this year, but they will persist. So our plan is to, a, sensibly finance this company, right, continue to remain committed to mid-grade investment-grade credit. And our recovery mechanisms on interest rates, some of them are somewhat immediate or very near term, right? Some of them are kind of medium term and then some of them do have some lag associated with them. So the reality is some of this will begin to flow through. We remain committed to keeping parent debt in that range, well below 25%, 19% to 21% is ideal and offsetting those headwinds like with continued investment, we're seeing strong loan growth and the positive regulatory outcomes and closing the ROE gap that Julie just mentioned.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. That's very helpful there. Maybe kind of picking up on that last point there. I think on the last call, we discussed a bit -- or there's some questions regarding outreach to commissions and just building regulatory relationships across the jurisdictions. I'm just wondering if you can provide a bit more detail, I guess, on specific initiatives done so far, where do you see that going? How you see that kind of transpiring so far?\nJulia Sloat: Yes. Nick, thanks for the question. This is Julie. We continue on with that effort. In terms of engagement with our various state commissions as well as talking with folks at the FERC level. it's important to note that we do this in conjunction with our operating company presidents and leadership there. And my objective and your senior leadership team's objective is to clear the path operating company presidents and those teams so that they can have a very good traction with their respective commissions and their respective economies in the state.  So those continue to occur. And honestly, just keeps me educated so that I can make sure that when we build the strategic plan at the aggregate level that it makes sense, and we're taking into consideration our customers' needs and also the economies that are driving all this magic that's happening across our entire footprint. So it continues as she goes in terms of those conversations, and we'll continue to stay out in front of folks and do our best to support our operating companies. So nothing super exciting to report other than the action is absolutely happening, and we'll see that embedded in the cases that we're filing.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. And just to confirm, the plan is still for you to meet each of the commissions when you're able to do so?\nJulia Sloat: Yes. Honestly, I enjoyed getting out anyway and talking with everybody. Like I said, I think it makes me better at my job. I'm making the round. And I got to be sensitive to what we've got going on in our respective jurisdictions. In some cases, I've got export issues I got to be sensitive to. But I'm absolutely making the rounds, and we'll continue to do that because the business is incredibly dynamic more so than ever. And we need to make sure that we're staying in touch with everything that's going on across the entire organization. So that will continue on.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. That's very helpful. And just the last one, if I could. The waterfall chart through 9 months in the presentation today, it was a bit different than, I guess, what we saw on EEI. Just wondering if you could walk us through some of the puts and takes, the drivers to this, and across the different segments and what do you see, I guess, in the fourth quarter that maybe narrows the gap or just kind of the different trends happening such as in vertically integrated with renewables as well?\nJulia Sloat: Yes. So I'll start and I'll hand it off the Chuck. So what gives us comfort in terms of narrowing the guidance range when you -- I look at Page 16, I sum that's where everybody is right now in terms of that waterfall chart. So what gives us a comfort is Chuck mentioned that we are able to effectively, I guess, take our low forecast predominantly driven by the commercial load that we're seeing. So that's going to be incorporated into our thoughts for the remainder of the year. We're trying to manage the interest expense that's also incredibly important.  Another data point to throw out there. No question we keep getting is -- what percentage of your debt outstanding is floating rate is about 12.5%, if I remember correctly, as of the end of the third quarter. So that's something that we're being remindful of. We're also thinking about what regulatory cases that we have already in hand. As a matter of fact, you may recall that when we began the year, we had something like $290 million of new rate release embedded in our forecast. Actually well north of that. We're at about $303 million of secured rate relief in hand. So that gives us a little more confidence and comfort to as we proceed through the end of the year. So again, it's really just steady as she goes and plug in Chuck. I don't know, Chuck, had anything else you want to add to that?\nCharles Zebula: Yes. Sure, Julie. Look, the other thing is the O&M Management. As I mentioned during my comments, if you look at Slide 16, right, you'll see that O&M is a drag two through three quarters, right? We expect that to completely reverse itself for year-end and actually have a net positive on O&M year-over-year, meaning that the fourth quarter will have a substantial difference in O&M versus last year.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Shahriar Purreza with Guggenheim Partners.\nJamieson Ward: It's Jamieson Ward on for Shar. Looking at your new FFO to debt pass side, could you give us a sense on what if anything could cause any potential slippage like the deferred fuel recovery? And what might dictate you being at the bottom or the top end of that 14% to 15% in 2024? I know you talked previously about being at the midpoint by the end of the year. But since we've got an updated disclosure here, I just wanted to ask that again here.\nCharles Zebula: Yes. No, sure. When you look at the chart, several of these are just simply facts, right, that are going to come out. All the outflows, right, are no numbers, right, that are rolling out of the 12-month average. So then we're just subject to the normal variances. In FFO that would occur. It's a preworking capital number. And the reality is, right, softer weather, better weather, all those things will influence it. But I think we'll be solidly in both ranges, right, by the time frames that we talked about. .\nJamieson Ward: Got it. And one more from us. On load growth, what's driving the large -- I know you mentioned data centers, but -- if you could just talk a bit more about what's driving the large increase for the guidance this year? And then more specifically, as we think about the updated capital plan, which you'll be providing, just directionally, should we expect this higher load growth to be a driver of capital growth opportunities?\nJulia Sloat: Yes. This is Julie. I'll pass off the Chuck here to we'll take him a little bit. But as Chuck mentioned, the primary driver for our loan growth as we go into the end of 2023 is all around that commercial segment. So if you look at Page #11, look in that upper right-hand quadrant, you're going to see a serious or material shift in what our updated guidance looks like versus what we originally had for 2023. The vast majority of that loan growth is coming from data centers located in Ohio, Texas and also in the [indiscernible].  And if you look across the rest of the segments there. So residential, a little soft. We talked a little bit about at the beginning of the call here on our monologue our prepared remarks about the fact that customers are feeling this in the wallet as it relates to inflation, et cetera. We expect that that's going to improve over time. But nevertheless, what's allowing us to get a little more comfort the residential side is we've added 30,000 customers year-to-date. So that offset a lot of the otherwise pressure we would have seen in that segment as usage for customers come off a little bit. And on the industrial side, it's really driven by interest rates. And the expectation, I guess, concerns that there could be some softening in the economy. So we've seen certain customer segments within that industrial aspect kind of come off a little bit. But we expect over time that will improve I don't know Chuck, is there anything else to come on hand?\nCharles Zebula: You mentioned that the drive your capital forecast. And of course, the new data centers, of course, require capital to hook those customers up. We do have what is known and customers that are coming into our capital forecast going forward. And there are lots of discussions otherwise, right, in our economic development activities. But everything that we know of and its firm is in our capital forecast.\nJamieson Ward: Got you. Just one clarifying -- one last clariffying question. So question is really focused around that 7.3% guidance for '23 for commercial versus the 80 basis points originally, Presumably, the infrastructure necessary for those data centers to be receiving a load that they are in place, especially extremely about a couple months left in the year. And we obviously saw that you'll be providing '24 and '25 guidance on the EEI. So we're just directionally trying to think, is this a trend likely? Is this isolated to '23? Or is this something that could continue and could drive, therefore, capital opportunities as you look to sort of about increasing commercial data center load and then that's it for me.\nJulia Sloat: No, I appreciate the question so much. Yes. That trend, we expect that to continue. I mean you see the fluctuation a little bit in the commercial segment up in the upper right quadrant that slide I mentioned earlier. We have projects in the Q so you kind of see those ebb and flow, but you're right the infrastructure is in place today the pending or incoming request for additional capacity from our customers. So that customer touch point or our economic development team is incredibly important because that allows us to not only have confidence around what our forecast is, but it also drives what the CapEx program needs to be. yes, we think that, that's going to continue, and we will keep a keen eye on that in particular because the infrastructure gotten be there. We got to make sure that we're communicating with our customers that they know exactly what the appropriate and realistic time line is for them to enter into our service territory so that the infrastructure is there because it's not something that's done overnight. So I appreciate that question so much because it is a fine orchestration that absolutely has to happen. .\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Carly Davenport with Goldman Sachs.\nCarly Davenport: Maybe to start, as we just think about the moving pieces on cash sources going forward, could you talk a little bit about how the asset sales processes are progressing in terms of interest that you're seeing but ask. And then on the timing side, it seems like a little bit of a narrowing of the time frame for NMRD. But anything else on the timing side that you highlight?\nJulia Sloat: Yes, I can start in Chuck and jump here too because tucking really close to the optimization that we've been doing. Anyway, yes, so from an MRB perspective, we're getting close here. So I would anticipate a contract being signed in a not-too-distant future and isn't really going to be a story around when can you close? So that can be driven also by our regulatory and won't probably get FERC approval depending on who the purchaser is that can drive other issues that we'll need to address. So we can give you a more precise time on when we can land that jet. So stay tuned, that ones in the hopper and coming along here relatively quickly. And then Chuck, do you want to talk little bit about retail and distributed?\nCharles Zebula: Yes, you did ask a question, I do want to address, right, what's the data asking, of course, we're not going to reveal anything like that in a public forum, but we are pleased with the response we received in some of the early results. that are indicative of course, but the process kind of goes on. Greg Hall and his team are leading that effort. There are in the queue remaining this year the typical process of management meetings and moving on to final bids either late this year or early next year. So the reality is, right, that's going to take some time to progress. I expect to complete that in the first half of next year. and the other sales processes are just shortly behind that.\nCarly Davenport: Great. That's helpful. And then I appreciate the color on the drivers on O&M heading into 4Q and for the full year. I guess how are you thinking about managing O&M into 2024? Should we expect to see an uptick that kind of offset some of the efficiencies that you've driven this year that have addressed the mode weather and allow you to continue to execute on the earnings guidance for 2023?\nCharles Zebula: Yes. So that's a good question. I can tell you what the discussion amongst the executive leadership team here are really focused on prioritizing O&M spend and spending both capital and O&M dollars that benefit and provide value to our customers. So we're really targeting the prioritization. We'll be giving guidance on O&M for next year in our waterfall at EEI, but expect us to be conservative, right? We're going to manage O&M to the levels, right, that are needed to run our business, right, but begin to eliminate things that are what we may consider to be discretionary going forward. .\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of David Arcaro with Morgan Stanley.\nDavid Arcaro: I think thanks again for the disclosure around the [indiscernible] into the first quarter of 2021, and you've touched on this a little bit, but I was just wondering how you see that metric track after that point from getting to the range as a stable to rising from there and kind of staying within the target range going forward when you look at the core business outlook?\nCharles Zebula: Yes. We absolutely plan to target and be in that 14% to 15% range. I will tell you that the introduction of large projects on a year-to-year basis, right, may swing that around some. So as you add renewable projects, in particular, if they come at the end of the calendar year, right? You have the financing costs related to that, but you don't have the FFO. The rating agencies are very well of that pattern. But absolutely, when you pro forma that, right, 14% to 15% is where we intend to be.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Anthony Crowdell with Mizuho.\nAnthony Crowdell: Welcome back, Chuck. Great to hear from you again. Just only two quick ones. I think Nick touched on it earlier on recent S&P had revised their outlook on the holding company. I'm just curious I guess your discussions with the rating agencies. We appreciate the detail you provided in the slide deck specially on your credit improvement. But have you been in discussion how you unveil that previously to S&P prior to their rating to or their outlook change?\nCharles Zebula: Yes. So Anthony, I talked to all three rating agencies since it's coming in and as well as our treasury team obviously talks to them all the time. I don't think the S&P move to negative outlook was a particular surprise, given the downgrade threshold and are rating a split, right? They're at a higher rating, right, than Moody's and Fitch currently. So it wasn't a surprise. We continue to work with the agencies to explain our business risk because we think as we continue to execute on exiting the unregulated businesses, our business makes sure to improve. And they should begin to reflect that in their evaluations. So not a surprise. If and when it is downgraded, their ratings would be on par with Moody's and Fitch. .\nAnthony Crowdell: Great. And then just lastly, you laid out the two scenarios regarding West Virginia fuel cost recovery. One is an amortization over 2 years. The other one is the securitization, which also includes accelerating coal plant closures, Given, I guess, the impact of the balance sheet and all the other moving pieces, does the company have a preferred path in West Virginia? And then also, when do we get resolution on that from the regulator?\nJulia Sloat: Yes, I appreciate that question. And let me just clarify the question as well right out of the gate here. To the extent that we've included securitization as an option, that does not assume an acceleration of coal plant closures, just to be very clear on that. We have those embedded in rates today going through 2040. So that is the current plan of thinking. So the idea of using securitization was entirely driven by how do we minimize the impact on customer rates. Period.  And so that was the spirit of why we even contemplated the utilization of the securitization. And that second scenario option that I mentioned where we not only securitize the fuel, but we have, I think, a little bit of storm cost in there as well as those plant balances would effectively render customer rates neutral. So no impact, okay, de minimis. And then the other alternative was just a 3-year smoothing of those deferrals -- or those deferred costs. And that was to the two, I want to say it was maybe 12% increase in customer rates associated with that subject to check. So as far as our preference would be, our preference is to get it recover. Our preference is to be able to work with all the different stakeholders, which is precisely why we put out the different options and listen to the different stakeholders in the case just with complete appreciation sensitivity to the customers in West Virginia that the general median household income tends to be a bit lower than most definitely the national average, but even across AEP's footprint, it's lower. So we need to be incredibly sensitive to those wallets. As far as preference. Our preference simply is to work with it in the stakeholders and get it done. And as far as when we might be able to get that done, our expectation is that we get that done here in the fourth quarter. So tic tok, any time here, okay?\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Weisel with Scotiabank.\nAndrew Weisel: Good morning, everybody. Good morning. A lot of information already. So I've only got one less if you can clarify here. I want to ask about the three moving pieces between equity asset sales and CapEx. And I know you're going to talk about this at a couple of weeks, but my question is that if equity needs are generally going to be consistent, how do we think about how you'll finance incremental CapEx? You typically roll forward the CapEx plan, it tends to go up most years. It's currently $40 billion. Does that mean that cash proceeds from these asset sales should help to finance whatever upside there is on the CapEx plan? Or will you have additional equity until the asset sales are announced? How do you think about that bouncing act?\nJulia Sloat: Yes. So I'll let my CFO jump in here. But first things first, we want to have a healthy balance sheet, okay? So dollars come in the door. We're going to make sure that our metrics work. We talked a little bit or a lot about 14% to 15% FFO to debt. We also pay attention to our debt-to-cap ratios, but 14% to 15% is our gating item for us in metric. So we will look to that metric to see where we're shaking out. Dollars will be placed accordingly as we bring those in the dollar associated with sales.  As far as equity needs go, as Chuck mentioned, I guess, again, the free study issue goes on average, we're around $700 million, plus or minus any given year to see that in cash flow that we have out here on Page #29. We are going to continue on with a healthy CapEx program. You'll see that extended into 2028 when we talk to you at EEI. But there may be fluctuations like sequentially year-to-year. But I wouldn't anticipate any material shift or change, again, getting item dollars in the door, take care of the balance sheet, and then we'll fund the rest of the regulated business that way. And, Chuck, there anything as you add to that?\nCharles Zebula: No. Julie, I think your answer is -- I really can't add anything. I would just say, embrace the capital opportunity and sensibly and smartly finance.\nAndrew Weisel: Okay. Great. That's helpful. And if you can just remind us what are the downgrade thresholds for Moody's and Fitch?\nJulia Sloat: 13% FFO to debt.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI.\nDurgesh Chopra: Chuck will come the forward work with you. Just real quick on the FFO to debt metric. I just want to clarify the 13% to 14% target for end of this year. Are you assuming that Virginia fuel recovery that's resolved?\nJulia Sloat: No. As a matter of fact, what is assumed in that forecast that walk as today is everything that we already have in hand. So West Virginia fuel outcome does not disrupt that path at all. That's prospective for us.\nDurgesh Chopra: Got it. So okay. So any sort of -- any incremental sort of cash flow bump from that would be accretive to what you show on this slide, right, even for 2014?\nJulia Sloat: That would be helpful, yes.\nDurgesh Chopra: Okay. Perfect. And then maybe just one quick -- one real quick -- what's the balance the total deferred fuel cost balance that hasn't been covered as of the Q3, I know the $1.4 billion as of Q2? .\nJulia Sloat: Yes. $1.2 billion as of the end of the third quarter, and that's in aggregate across the AEP footprint of fleet of utility companies. .\nDurgesh Chopra: West Virginia roughly like $500 million, correct? .\nJulia Sloat: West Virginia. Yes, West Virginia is what can be specific, $574.8 million. So call it $575 million. We're paying attention to this. So that's why a little bit of detail here. That's important.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: So just coming back to that O&M piece, obviously, you put some comments in the script here. 100 million. Look, I think that's a solid number. I'm just curious, how do you think about that annualizing here and the ability to annualize in those sectors? I get that some of them are kind of discrete in nature here, certain elections. But in an effort to kind of preview a little bit more on that '24 trajectory. I know you made a couple of allusions to it here. Can you perhaps lean in a bit further and describing how you think about what that could do for next year on the cost side?\nCharles Zebula: So we're going to lead into that PEI in about 7 or 8 days or 9 days, whatever it is. But the folks right at the management team, as I said earlier, is really on prioritizing the spend and spending dollars where it matters most to our customers. That's the most important thing we can do in our O&M budget will reflect that.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Yes. No, I respect that, hence the interest. Okay. One while I'll leave it there. And you mind just on the low side just to clarify it a little bit further here. I mean, obviously, you have an updated load in the near year that is sensitively more robust and you have a backward dated load growth profile here for '24,'25. How do you think about the time line for revisions and the extent of those revisions as you see it today, again, I know this is probably more in the EEI 4Q conversation. But I mean, clearly, we see this kind of revisions across the PJM footprint. How do you think about that? And also maybe how does that tee up with PJM itself here and potential further transmission-oriented opportunities?\nCharles Zebula: Yes. So as you can see, right, the low growth in particular in commercial is pretty robust. Those numbers will be updated when we on the EEI. And as I said earlier, it's embraced the opportunity. This is a good opportunity for us. I think you have to be smart about it and kind of vet out what is real and what is a real load is going to come on. and plan your capital investment profile around that. So lots of activity, lots of discussions. Our economic development team is very busy talking and dealing with the opportunity.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Sophie Karp with KeyBanc.\nSophie Karp: Can you please clarify, you mentioned that you could implement or that it's possible to implement interim rates in Kentucky in January? Do you actually intend to do that? Or how does it take sort of politically it would work out for you there?\nJulia Sloat: Yes. Generally, we try to take advantage of that. So that would be the plan. And of course, we'll stay in close contact with all the stakeholders store case and the commission. And so other than that, just as we have done in say, for example, the PSO that is typical for us if there's an opportunity to implement rates. We go ahead and do that and kind of risk-adjusted in terms of our forecast and understand when cash has been coming the door alters items that are so important as we put the forecast out to you guys and have confidence around that. But short answer is, yes, generally speaking, that, we would expect to put those in place or implement the rates.\nSophie Karp: Got it. And then just a broad question, I guess. Is there any interest to approach state regulators in stake mechanisms to reduce weather volatility impact on your earnings. I know you're not decoupled in most of our jurisdictions. So kind of curious if you like that type of rate mechanisms or would you drive transition time to situation whether doesn't impact you earn that much.\nJulia Sloat: Yes. We engage in those conversations. And again, that's more of a stakeholder discussion and see what the temperature and tolerance would be as it relates to not only just out preferences the preferences and tones of other party to the cases. That being said, we did have the coupling hi for a while that is installed by the wayside, but that's something that we have a regular conversation about. So I wouldn't say that we have a push or a thrust towards getting a decoupling in place, but it's absolutely a tool in the toolbag.\nDarcy Reese: Thank you for joining us on today's call. always, IR team will be available to answer any additional questions you may have. Eric, would you please give the replay information?\nOperator: Thank you.

        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Charles Zebula",
            "content": "Thank you, Julie. It's good to be with you and everyone on the call this morning. As many of you know, I've been in many different roles at AP, but this is my first earnings call as the CFO. I'm truly honored to return to the exceptional finance team at AEP and lead this area as we embrace the opportunity to invest in our regulated utilities and serve our customers with affordable and reliable electric service.  Today, I will discuss our third quarter and year-to-date results. share some updates on our service territory load and economy and finish with commentary on credit metrics and liquidity as well as confirming our guidance financial targets and a recap of our commitments to stakeholders.  Let's go to Slide 9, which shows the comparison of GAAP to operating earnings GAAP earnings for the third quarter were $1.83 per share compared to $1.33 per share in 2022. Year-to-date GAAP earnings through September were $3.62 per share compared to $3.76 per share in 2022. As was mentioned on the second quarter earnings call, our year-to-date comparison of GAAP to operating earnings reflects the loss on the sale of the contracted renewables business as a nonoperating cost as well as an adjustment to true-up costs related to the terminated Kentucky transaction. In addition, we have reflected our typical mark-to-market adjustment and the impact of capitalized incentive compensation in Texas as nonoperating earnings as well. There's a detailed reconciliation of GAAP to operating earnings on Pages 17 and 18 of the presentation today.  Moving to Slide 10. Operating earnings for the third quarter totaled $1.77 per share or $924 million compared to $1.62 per share or $831 million last year. The higher performance compared to last year was primarily driven by favorable rate changes and transmission project execution, increased retail load and favorable O&M across our segments. Operating earnings for vertically integrated utilities were $1 per share, up $0.03 from last year. Favorable drivers included rate changes across multiple jurisdictions, increases in retail load, depreciation, transmission revenue and O&M. These items were somewhat offset by higher interest expense and unfavorable weather year-over-year. the vertically integrated segment did see positive weather versus normal in the third quarter of about $0.04 per share, but this was compared to positive weather in the third quarter last year of about $0.06 per share.  Consistent with our first and second quarter results, depreciation was favorable at the vertically integrated segment by $0.01 in quarter 3, primarily due to the expiration of the Rockport Unit 2 lease in December 2022. However, if we exclude the impact of the lease depreciation would have been about $0.02 unfavorable, which is consistent with incremental investment activity in our vertically integrated segment. INM should see an additional $0.02 favorable net depreciation in the fourth quarter as well.  The Transmission & Distribution Utility segment earned $0.39 per share, up $0.07 compared to last year. Favorable drivers in this segment included increased retail load, transmission revenue, positive rate changes in Texas and Ohio and favorable O&M Partially offsetting these favorable items were higher depreciation and higher interest expense. The AEP Transmission Holdco segment contributed $0.39 per share, up $0.06 compared to last year. Favorable investment growth of $0.02, coupled with favorable income taxes of $0.02 are largely driving the change here.  Generation and Marketing produced $0.18 per share, up $0.04 from last year. The positive variance is primarily due to favorable impacts associated with the contracted renewable sale in August, along with higher generation margins and land sales. These favorable items were partially offset by lower retail and wholesale power margins.  Finally, Corporate and Other was down $0.05 per share, driven by unfavorable interest and partially offset by favorable O&M. Please note that our year-to-date operating earnings performance by segment is shown on Slide 16 in the appendix of our presentation today.  Many of the positive drivers are the same for the year as for the quarter, and the negative year-to-date variance is driven largely by unfavorable weather and higher interest expenses. Before we move on, I want to add a few more comments on O&M, including our outlook for the remainder of the year. We saw favorable O&M in the third quarter compared to the prior year, which was consistent with our expectations. For the fourth quarter, we are expecting more than $100 million of favorable O&M versus the prior year, which would bring us to a net favorable position for the full year from a consolidated perspective. The favorable change anticipated in the fourth quarter is largely a result of the timing of O&M spending in the prior year, including employee-related expenses and a contribution to the AEP Foundation in the fourth quarter of last year, along with continued actions we have taken, such as holding employment positions open, reducing travel and adjusting the timing of discretionary spending.  Turning to Slide 11. I will provide an update on whether normalized low performance for the quarter and our expectations through the end of the year. Overall, load has come in ahead of plan all year, and the third quarter was no exception. Looking to the bottom right-hand quadrant. Normalized retail load grew 2.1% in Q3 from a year earlier. You also noticed that we have updated our full year 2023 estimates based on the strong loan growth we've experienced year-to-date. Weather normalized retail load is now expected to finish this year 2.3% higher than 2022, an increase that is nearly 3x higher than our original expectations. This strength comes from exceptional growth in commercial load driven by data centers in Ohio, Texas and Indiana, but the third quarter also saw positive trends in our residential class, which is shown in the upper left-hand quadrant of the slide.  Residential load increased for the first time in more than a year in Q3 with growth of 0.6% from a year earlier. The relationship between customer incomes and inflation is a key driver of residential usage and has begun to stabilize as expected in the second half of this year. This month's CPI data point was yet another encouraging sign that inflationary pressures on our residential customers are continuing to lessen. We note that residential usage per customer have seen slight declines this year as energy efficiencies increase, more workers return to offices and customers change behavior due to inflation.  Fortunately, we are seeing strong enough growth in our customer base, especially in Texas and Ohio to help partially offset these trends. Year-to-date, we have added nearly 30,000 residential customers across our footprint.  Moving to the lower left-hand quadrant of the slide, our investor load declined in the third quarter, driven by a pullback in usage by some of our key manufacturing customers. namely chemical, plastic and tire producers as well as downstream participants of the energy industry. This reflects some of the softness in manufacturing nationally as producers have slowed activity in response to uncertainty around the economic outlook. We expect this to reverse itself in the months ahead as recent inflation and jobs data have reduced the probability of a recession occurring in the next year. We are forecasting industrial load to remain positive through the end of next year and beyond.  Moving to the upper right-hand quadrant of the slide, we see another impressive quarter for commercial load. In the third quarter, commercial load was 7.5% higher than a year ago, driven by the addition of new data center customers, mostly in Ohio, Texas and Indiana. We expect the pace of year-over-year growth in our commercial load to moderate some in 2024 as new projects work their way through the queue. Many of the large projects currently underway within our footprint won't come fully online until 2025. However, there is upside if a few of these projects move forward earlier than expected. Many of these gains are directly attributable to our ongoing efforts to facilitate more economic development across our operating footprint. We know that working with local stakeholders to attract more economic activity is a key strategy to providing value to the communities we serve. It allows us to prioritize investments that improve the customer experience while also mitigating rate impacts on our customer base.  Moving to Slide 12. In the lower left corner, you can see our FFO to debt metric stands at 11.4%, which is an increase of 30 basis points from last quarter but continues to be well below our targeted range of 14% to 15%. The primary reason for the increase is a $1.8 billion decrease in debt during the quarter due to long and short-term debt retirements, driven by proceeds received from our contracted renewable sale and the successful completion of our planned equity units conversion, both of which occurred in August. We expect this metric will continue to improve throughout the remainder of this year and anticipate reaching our targeted range in early next year as we see an improvement in FFO during that time.  We have included a table on the slide that shows the path to the targeted FFO to debt range early next year. These items -- these are items that impact both the 12-month rolling average as well as an estimated increase in the quarterly FFO. We anticipate a 180 to 190 basis point positive impact on FFO that enables the metric to be in the 13% to 14% range by year-end based on the following items: a roll-off of roughly $600 million in cash collateral, deferred fuel and other outflows from the fourth quarter of 2022 and continued cash recovery of deferred fuel balances in the fourth quarter of this year that total between $150 million and $200 million in accordance with the regulatory orders we have already received.  Moving into 2024, the continued roll-off of prior year cash collateral outfall in the amount of $390 million in the first quarter of 2023 and a $90 million adjustment from unfavorable weather in the first quarter of this year to normal weather in our forecast for next year, will result in an incremental 100 basis point improvement put us within our target range of 14% to 15%. Also, please note that we have updated our 2023 cash flow, as shown on Page 29 in the appendix. An increase of $1.2 billion in required capital is shown versus the original forecast, mostly due to a decrease of $800 million in cash from ops largely due to fuel inventory and an increase of $300 million in capital expenditures. Please note that our equity needs for 2023 are unchanged. The remaining years 2024 to 2027, along with rebilling 2028, will be updated at the upcoming EEI conference. Expect that this update will be consistent with our prior equity meetings and disclosures.  Moving to Slide 13. You can see our liquidity summary in the middle of the slide. Our 5-year $4 billion bank revolver and our 2-year $1 billion revolving credit facility to support our liquidity position, which remains strong at $3.5 billion. On a GAAP basis, our debt to cap decreased from the prior quarter by 220 basis points to 62.4%. This large change can be attributed to the large reduction in debt, driven by our contracted renewable sale and the completion of our planned equity units that I mentioned earlier.  On the qualified pension front, our funding status decreased 1.9% during the quarter to 100.3%. This is largely due to equity and fixed income losses in the third quarter as interest rates increased and equity indices fell in both August and September. These losses are partially offset by a decreased liability due to rising interest rates.  Let's go to Slide 14 for a quick recap of today's message. The third quarter produced growth in earnings well above the prior year, driven primarily by favorable rate changes, increased load and favorable O&M offsetting milder weather and increased interest expense. As we continue to move through the fourth quarter, we are focused on cost management efforts with the goal of mitigating the headwinds we have faced this year, primarily unfavorable weather and higher interest costs. The strong third quarter results and low growth, coupled with our proactive plan for the balance of the year, allow us to confidently narrow our operating guidance range to $5.24 to $5.34 per share. We also continue to be committed to our long-term growth rate of 6% to 7%. And as Julie mentioned earlier, our sales efforts to simplify and derisk the AEP portfolio remain on track. We really appreciate your time and our management team and I look forward to seeing you at the upcoming EEI Financial Conference in Phoenix. With that, I'm going to ask the operator to open the call so we can hear your questions or comments. Yes. No, thank you for the question. And look, I am absolutely embracing this opportunity that we have before us. It's very energizing to enter into a role like this. And although -- the AK did indicate that I'm committed to Julie and AEP to write this out as long as needed. And as long as I'm adding value right to the opportunity. So thank you for the question. Yes. Yes, thanks for both questions. So yes, our equity needs will be consistent, right, with what we have disclosed prior. I mean, clearly, we'll be updating, right, the years in the cash flow forecast, but expect no surprises there. . On to your second question, yes, we tried to highlight right, on the slide, the FFO slide, the major drivers that you can point to and see what is rolling out as outflow. But absolutely, right, in our financial models, right? It takes into account, right, the absence of that cash flow. So we do expect to be in those ranges. Yes. Joe, thank you for the question. I mean, look, we'll be giving you a walk right on 2024 at EEI. But there's no question that we are planning for an interest rate higher for longer environment. We've clearly been able to overcome those headwinds this year, but they will persist. So our plan is to, a, sensibly finance this company, right, continue to remain committed to mid-grade investment-grade credit. And our recovery mechanisms on interest rates, some of them are somewhat immediate or very near term, right? Some of them are kind of medium term and then some of them do have some lag associated with them. So the reality is some of this will begin to flow through. We remain committed to keeping parent debt in that range, well below 25%, 19% to 21% is ideal and offsetting those headwinds like with continued investment, we're seeing strong loan growth and the positive regulatory outcomes and closing the ROE gap that Julie just mentioned. Yes. Sure, Julie. Look, the other thing is the O&M Management. As I mentioned during my comments, if you look at Slide 16, right, you'll see that O&M is a drag two through three quarters, right? We expect that to completely reverse itself for year-end and actually have a net positive on O&M year-over-year, meaning that the fourth quarter will have a substantial difference in O&M versus last year. Yes. No, sure. When you look at the chart, several of these are just simply facts, right, that are going to come out. All the outflows, right, are no numbers, right, that are rolling out of the 12-month average. So then we're just subject to the normal variances. In FFO that would occur. It's a preworking capital number. And the reality is, right, softer weather, better weather, all those things will influence it. But I think we'll be solidly in both ranges, right, by the time frames that we talked about. . You mentioned that the drive your capital forecast. And of course, the new data centers, of course, require capital to hook those customers up. We do have what is known and customers that are coming into our capital forecast going forward. And there are lots of discussions otherwise, right, in our economic development activities. But everything that we know of and its firm is in our capital forecast. Yes, you did ask a question, I do want to address, right, what's the data asking, of course, we're not going to reveal anything like that in a public forum, but we are pleased with the response we received in some of the early results. that are indicative of course, but the process kind of goes on. Greg Hall and his team are leading that effort. There are in the queue remaining this year the typical process of management meetings and moving on to final bids either late this year or early next year. So the reality is, right, that's going to take some time to progress. I expect to complete that in the first half of next year. and the other sales processes are just shortly behind that. Yes. So that's a good question. I can tell you what the discussion amongst the executive leadership team here are really focused on prioritizing O&M spend and spending both capital and O&M dollars that benefit and provide value to our customers. So we're really targeting the prioritization. We'll be giving guidance on O&M for next year in our waterfall at EEI, but expect us to be conservative, right? We're going to manage O&M to the levels, right, that are needed to run our business, right, but begin to eliminate things that are what we may consider to be discretionary going forward. . Yes. We absolutely plan to target and be in that 14% to 15% range. I will tell you that the introduction of large projects on a year-to-year basis, right, may swing that around some. So as you add renewable projects, in particular, if they come at the end of the calendar year, right? You have the financing costs related to that, but you don't have the FFO. The rating agencies are very well of that pattern. But absolutely, when you pro forma that, right, 14% to 15% is where we intend to be. Yes. So Anthony, I talked to all three rating agencies since it's coming in and as well as our treasury team obviously talks to them all the time. I don't think the S&P move to negative outlook was a particular surprise, given the downgrade threshold and are rating a split, right? They're at a higher rating, right, than Moody's and Fitch currently. So it wasn't a surprise. We continue to work with the agencies to explain our business risk because we think as we continue to execute on exiting the unregulated businesses, our business makes sure to improve. And they should begin to reflect that in their evaluations. So not a surprise. If and when it is downgraded, their ratings would be on par with Moody's and Fitch. . No. Julie, I think your answer is -- I really can't add anything. I would just say, embrace the capital opportunity and sensibly and smartly finance. So we're going to lead into that PEI in about 7 or 8 days or 9 days, whatever it is. But the folks right at the management team, as I said earlier, is really on prioritizing the spend and spending dollars where it matters most to our customers. That's the most important thing we can do in our O&M budget will reflect that. Yes. So as you can see, right, the low growth in particular in commercial is pretty robust. Those numbers will be updated when we on the EEI. And as I said earlier, it's embraced the opportunity. This is a good opportunity for us. I think you have to be smart about it and kind of vet out what is real and what is a real load is going to come on. and plan your capital investment profile around that. So lots of activity, lots of discussions. Our economic development team is very busy talking and dealing with the opportunity."

            "name": "Julia Sloat",
            "content": "Thanks, Darcy. Welcome to American Electric Power's third quarter 2023 earnings call. It's good to be with everyone this morning. Before I discuss our third quarter performance, I would like to introduce our CFO, Chuck Zebula, who will walk us through the results today. Chuck has been with the company for 25 years and has a deep understanding of our business. He hit the ground running in his new role, and we're grateful for his leadership. Many of you are familiar with Chuck, and I'm confident that you enjoy working with him in the CFO role.  I'm pleased to share that the execution of our strategy is on track. AEP is well positioned to deliver on a robust and flexible 5-year $40 billion capital plan with an emphasis on our generation fleet transformation and investments in our energy delivery infrastructure as we need our customer needs. While our industry continues to transform amid this dynamic environment characterized by more extreme weather, rising interest rates and supply chain constraints, AEP has continued to adapt and take thoughtful actions to stay our course. We're keeping the customer at the center of every decision we make, while also balancing and listening to our stakeholders who are critical to our success.  This quarter, we made progress on our ongoing efforts to simplify and derisk our business profile through portfolio management, directing all proceeds of those efforts to the regulated business and to balance sheet management, which I'll speak to in more detail in a moment. We've also been working hard on the regulatory front. I'll provide insight into our success in the addition of renewable store portfolio and the many positive developments on regulatory and legislative initiatives.  A summary of our third quarter 2023 business updates can be found on Slide 6 of today's presentation. AEP reported strong third quarter operating earnings of $1.77 per share or $924 million. We have a flexible business plan that allows us to deliver on our financial commitments while taking into account mild weather in the first half of the year and the higher for longer interest rate environment. As we actively manage the business today, we're narrowing our guidance for 2023 full year operating earnings to a range of $5.24 to $5.34 while reaffirming the $5.29 midpoint and our long-term earnings growth rate of 6% to 7%. Moreover, last week, we announced an increase in our dividend, which is consistent with our earnings growth rate and within our targeted payout ratio of 60% to 70%.  In a few minutes, Chuck will talk about the support we have for our narrow 2023 earnings guidance range, which includes O&M management and positive load outlook as we drive economic development within our service territory. While our FFO to debt was 11.4% this quarter, we expect that this metric will improve materially by year-end and fall within the targeted rate of 14% to 15% in early 2024. Chuck will also touch on the short path to this balance sheet target.  We continue to make progress in our efforts to simplify and derisk our portfolio. In August, we announced the completion of the sale of our 1,365 megawatt unregulated renewables portfolio to IRG acquisition Holdings, which resulted in after-tax proceeds totaling $1.2 billion. A summary of this sale can be seen on Slide 7.  We've also made headway on some of our other asset sales that we previously discussed. A summary of this can be referenced on Slide 8. In May, we announced the sale of our New Mexico renewable development solar portfolio, also known as NMRD. The book value of AP's investment as of September 30 was $119 million. We're currently on track with our 550 joint venture partner, PNM Resources, as we target to close on this transaction in the late fourth quarter of this year or early first quarter of next.  We expect to continue the noncore business sales processes we have underway as we enter 2024. The sales of our retail and distributed resources businesses were launched in August with book value of $244 million and $353 million, respectively, as of the end of the third quarter. We expect to reach a sale agreement in the first quarter of next year with an anticipated closing in the first half of 2024. In July, we announced the sales of Prairie Wind transmission and Pioneer Transmission, our noncore transmission joint ventures, as of the end of the third quarter, AEP's portion of rate base associated with these investments was $107 million. We expect to launch the sales process soon and close in 2024.  Finally related to , while there are no new updates for now. We anticipate completing the strategic review by the end of this year. So please stay tuned. AEP portion of rate base for this particular investment joint venture was $348 million as of quarter end.  Let me shift gears and provide you with an update on our regulated renewables investment plan. The teams remain focused and made solid progress. As you know, we have $8.6 billion of regulated renewables in our 5-year capital plan. We now have a total of $6 billion of the investment plan approved and an additional $800 million currently before commissions for approval with each of these projects providing valuable fuel savings for our customers. More detail on our renewable resource additions can be viewed in the appendix on Slides 32 through 34.  As we've previously disclosed, both PSO's 995.5-megawatt renewable portfolio for $2.5 billion and SWEPCO's 999-megawatt renewable portfolio over $2.2 billion were approved earlier this year. At a collective $4.7 billion, these two portfolios alone comprise a large component of the approved $6 billion amount I just mentioned.  Additionally, in APCo service territory, we're also pleased to report a positive development. In September, Virginia approved 143 megawatts of owned wind for more than $400 million, building upon APCo's existing 29 megawatts of wind and solar projects that were approved last year, which totaled approximately $500 million.  Moving across our service territory to I&M, we filed to seek approval for recovery of two investment -- of investment in two owned solar projects totaling 469 megawatts, which represents $1 billion of total investment. We're making progress on this front as we received commission approval last month in Indiana for both the 224-megawatt May Apple and 245-megawatt Lake Trout solar projects. In Michigan the Commission approved May Apple back in August, and we'll decide on Lake Trout in the first quarter of next year.  We also await a commission order expected any time now for the 154-megawatt rock balls wind farm at PSO for approximately $150 million. Importantly, our regulated renewables plants are aligned with and supported by our integrated resource plans. We have issued a request for proposals for additional owned resources at APCo and IM with more to come from other operating companies in the near future as we listen and learn and respond to state preferences.  Now I'd like to turn to updates on our ongoing regulatory and legislative initiatives. We've been engaged in efforts across our service territory to close the authorized versus earned ROE gap. Our third quarter ROE came in at 8.7%, driven in part by the unfavorable weather in the first half of 2023 that I mentioned earlier, which depressed this measure by 40 basis points. While this is a modest improvement over the last quarter, we are aware that more can be done and more needs to be done on this front. Closing the gap will remain a primary focus into 2024 as we take federal state and customer preferences top of mind, along with meeting the needs of our communities.  We remain focused on reducing the gap going into year-end, while still meeting our earnings guidance. To that end, I'm happy to confirm that we have settlement in place for APCo Virginia's 2020 to 2022 triennial and APO Ohio's ESP5, both cases which were filed earlier this year. we're awaiting commission decisions in these states and Virginia's orders expected in the fourth quarter of this year and Ohio will likely be issued in the first quarter of 2024. In addition, we filed new base cases in Indiana and Michigan in the third quarter. Both filings we requested -- in both on we requested a 10.5% ROE and taste drivers included distribution investment in technology, enhanced reliability and grid modernization using 2024 forecast and test years. We anticipate the new rates will be an effective next year.  The team has been active on the legislative front in Texas -- with Texas legislation pass and June allowing utilities to file the distribution cost recovery factor mechanism or DCRF twice per year, sit of once per year. This legislation also allows the DCRF mechanism to be used by utility, even if it has a pending rate case for seating underway. Consequently, the legislation will help improve AEP's regulatory lag in Texas to the tune of approximately 50 basis points and earned ROE starting in 2024. In fact, our April 2023 DCRF filing was approved and rates went into effect in September.  For Kentucky Power, our June 2023 based base application incorporated the comprehensive rate review, a 9.9% ROE and a request to allow for the securitization of $471 million of regulatory assets, ensuring Kentucky Power is best positioned to provide safe and reliable service while managing costs. Constructive intervener testimony was filed in October, including support for securitization. By statute, implementation of interim rates is permissible in January 2024.  Moving to PSO, you'll recall that in May, we reached a settlement with the commission staff, the attorney general and other parties in Oklahoma's PSO base case, which included a 9.5% ROE and provided for approval for more efficient cost recovery mechanisms. We implemented interim rates in June while we await a commission order, which is expected any time now.  As you know, the management of fuel cost recovery is a top priority with AP's deferred fuel balance across our vertically integrated utilities shrinking sequentially and totaling $1.2 billion as of the end of the third quarter of this year. We have worked with stakeholders to intentionally adapt our fuel cost recovery mechanisms across our jurisdictions with the objective being to balance cost recovery with customer impact. So West Virginia fuel proceeding is approaching resolution. Recall in our April 2023 fuel recovery application, we filed two options for consideration. One option amortizes the fuel balance over 3 years. In the second option, we have respectively set forth for the West Virginia Commission consideration, the use of the 2023 securitization legislation to manage our $553 million deferred fuel balance along with securitizing store cost balances and net plant balances of generation assets. The generation assets are currently embedded in rate and assume to operate through 2040 and securitizing those assets nearly fully offset the fuel cost recovery impacts to customers.  We appreciate the engagement with all the stakeholder parties as we work toward a conclusion in this case by year-end and a constructive path for West Virginia. More detail on regulated activities can be found in the appendix on Slides 35 through 38.  I'm pleased with the progress we've made this quarter and by the great work underway to actively manage the business, deliver on our commitments and create value for our investors, all while keeping affordability and reliability for our customers at the center of everything we do. We have a strong team in place, and I'm confident that we'll continue to execute on our strategic priorities and advance our capital investment plan to deliver reliable, affordable power to our customers. I look forward to seeing many of you in person at the EEI Conference in a couple of weeks. At the conference in Phoenix will provide some additional color on our business strategy, share our 2024 guidance and other financial details, including our 2024 through 2028 capital plan and related 5-year cash flows. Now with that, I'll hand it off to Chuck, we'll walk through performance drivers and details supporting our financial targets. Chuck? Yes. Nick, thanks for the question. This is Julie. We continue on with that effort. In terms of engagement with our various state commissions as well as talking with folks at the FERC level. it's important to note that we do this in conjunction with our operating company presidents and leadership there. And my objective and your senior leadership team's objective is to clear the path operating company presidents and those teams so that they can have a very good traction with their respective commissions and their respective economies in the state.  So those continue to occur. And honestly, just keeps me educated so that I can make sure that when we build the strategic plan at the aggregate level that it makes sense, and we're taking into consideration our customers' needs and also the economies that are driving all this magic that's happening across our entire footprint. So it continues as she goes in terms of those conversations, and we'll continue to stay out in front of folks and do our best to support our operating companies. So nothing super exciting to report other than the action is absolutely happening, and we'll see that embedded in the cases that we're filing. Yes. Honestly, I enjoyed getting out anyway and talking with everybody. Like I said, I think it makes me better at my job. I'm making the round. And I got to be sensitive to what we've got going on in our respective jurisdictions. In some cases, I've got export issues I got to be sensitive to. But I'm absolutely making the rounds, and we'll continue to do that because the business is incredibly dynamic more so than ever. And we need to make sure that we're staying in touch with everything that's going on across the entire organization. So that will continue on. Yes. So I'll start and I'll hand it off the Chuck. So what gives us comfort in terms of narrowing the guidance range when you -- I look at Page 16, I sum that's where everybody is right now in terms of that waterfall chart. So what gives us a comfort is Chuck mentioned that we are able to effectively, I guess, take our low forecast predominantly driven by the commercial load that we're seeing. So that's going to be incorporated into our thoughts for the remainder of the year. We're trying to manage the interest expense that's also incredibly important.  Another data point to throw out there. No question we keep getting is -- what percentage of your debt outstanding is floating rate is about 12.5%, if I remember correctly, as of the end of the third quarter. So that's something that we're being remindful of. We're also thinking about what regulatory cases that we have already in hand. As a matter of fact, you may recall that when we began the year, we had something like $290 million of new rate release embedded in our forecast. Actually well north of that. We're at about $303 million of secured rate relief in hand. So that gives us a little more confidence and comfort to as we proceed through the end of the year. So again, it's really just steady as she goes and plug in Chuck. I don't know, Chuck, had anything else you want to add to that? Yes. This is Julie. I'll pass off the Chuck here to we'll take him a little bit. But as Chuck mentioned, the primary driver for our loan growth as we go into the end of 2023 is all around that commercial segment. So if you look at Page #11, look in that upper right-hand quadrant, you're going to see a serious or material shift in what our updated guidance looks like versus what we originally had for 2023. The vast majority of that loan growth is coming from data centers located in Ohio, Texas and also in the [indiscernible].  And if you look across the rest of the segments there. So residential, a little soft. We talked a little bit about at the beginning of the call here on our monologue our prepared remarks about the fact that customers are feeling this in the wallet as it relates to inflation, et cetera. We expect that that's going to improve over time. But nevertheless, what's allowing us to get a little more comfort the residential side is we've added 30,000 customers year-to-date. So that offset a lot of the otherwise pressure we would have seen in that segment as usage for customers come off a little bit. And on the industrial side, it's really driven by interest rates. And the expectation, I guess, concerns that there could be some softening in the economy. So we've seen certain customer segments within that industrial aspect kind of come off a little bit. But we expect over time that will improve I don't know Chuck, is there anything else to come on hand? No, I appreciate the question so much. Yes. That trend, we expect that to continue. I mean you see the fluctuation a little bit in the commercial segment up in the upper right quadrant that slide I mentioned earlier. We have projects in the Q so you kind of see those ebb and flow, but you're right the infrastructure is in place today the pending or incoming request for additional capacity from our customers. So that customer touch point or our economic development team is incredibly important because that allows us to not only have confidence around what our forecast is, but it also drives what the CapEx program needs to be. yes, we think that, that's going to continue, and we will keep a keen eye on that in particular because the infrastructure gotten be there. We got to make sure that we're communicating with our customers that they know exactly what the appropriate and realistic time line is for them to enter into our service territory so that the infrastructure is there because it's not something that's done overnight. So I appreciate that question so much because it is a fine orchestration that absolutely has to happen. . Yes, I can start in Chuck and jump here too because tucking really close to the optimization that we've been doing. Anyway, yes, so from an MRB perspective, we're getting close here. So I would anticipate a contract being signed in a not-too-distant future and isn't really going to be a story around when can you close? So that can be driven also by our regulatory and won't probably get FERC approval depending on who the purchaser is that can drive other issues that we'll need to address. So we can give you a more precise time on when we can land that jet. So stay tuned, that ones in the hopper and coming along here relatively quickly. And then Chuck, do you want to talk little bit about retail and distributed? Yes, I appreciate that question. And let me just clarify the question as well right out of the gate here. To the extent that we've included securitization as an option, that does not assume an acceleration of coal plant closures, just to be very clear on that. We have those embedded in rates today going through 2040. So that is the current plan of thinking. So the idea of using securitization was entirely driven by how do we minimize the impact on customer rates. Period.  And so that was the spirit of why we even contemplated the utilization of the securitization. And that second scenario option that I mentioned where we not only securitize the fuel, but we have, I think, a little bit of storm cost in there as well as those plant balances would effectively render customer rates neutral. So no impact, okay, de minimis. And then the other alternative was just a 3-year smoothing of those deferrals -- or those deferred costs. And that was to the two, I want to say it was maybe 12% increase in customer rates associated with that subject to check. So as far as our preference would be, our preference is to get it recover. Our preference is to be able to work with all the different stakeholders, which is precisely why we put out the different options and listen to the different stakeholders in the case just with complete appreciation sensitivity to the customers in West Virginia that the general median household income tends to be a bit lower than most definitely the national average, but even across AEP's footprint, it's lower. So we need to be incredibly sensitive to those wallets. As far as preference. Our preference simply is to work with it in the stakeholders and get it done. And as far as when we might be able to get that done, our expectation is that we get that done here in the fourth quarter. So tic tok, any time here, okay? Yes. So I'll let my CFO jump in here. But first things first, we want to have a healthy balance sheet, okay? So dollars come in the door. We're going to make sure that our metrics work. We talked a little bit or a lot about 14% to 15% FFO to debt. We also pay attention to our debt-to-cap ratios, but 14% to 15% is our gating item for us in metric. So we will look to that metric to see where we're shaking out. Dollars will be placed accordingly as we bring those in the dollar associated with sales.  As far as equity needs go, as Chuck mentioned, I guess, again, the free study issue goes on average, we're around $700 million, plus or minus any given year to see that in cash flow that we have out here on Page #29. We are going to continue on with a healthy CapEx program. You'll see that extended into 2028 when we talk to you at EEI. But there may be fluctuations like sequentially year-to-year. But I wouldn't anticipate any material shift or change, again, getting item dollars in the door, take care of the balance sheet, and then we'll fund the rest of the regulated business that way. And, Chuck, there anything as you add to that? 13% FFO to debt. No. As a matter of fact, what is assumed in that forecast that walk as today is everything that we already have in hand. So West Virginia fuel outcome does not disrupt that path at all. That's prospective for us. That would be helpful, yes. Yes. $1.2 billion as of the end of the third quarter, and that's in aggregate across the AEP footprint of fleet of utility companies. . West Virginia. Yes, West Virginia is what can be specific, $574.8 million. So call it $575 million. We're paying attention to this. So that's why a little bit of detail here. That's important. Yes. Generally, we try to take advantage of that. So that would be the plan. And of course, we'll stay in close contact with all the stakeholders store case and the commission. And so other than that, just as we have done in say, for example, the PSO that is typical for us if there's an opportunity to implement rates. We go ahead and do that and kind of risk-adjusted in terms of our forecast and understand when cash has been coming the door alters items that are so important as we put the forecast out to you guys and have confidence around that. But short answer is, yes, generally speaking, that, we would expect to put those in place or implement the rates. Yes. We engage in those conversations. And again, that's more of a stakeholder discussion and see what the temperature and tolerance would be as it relates to not only just out preferences the preferences and tones of other party to the cases. That being said, we did have the coupling hi for a while that is installed by the wayside, but that's something that we have a regular conversation about. So I wouldn't say that we have a push or a thrust towards getting a decoupling in place, but it's absolutely a tool in the toolbag."

At this time, all parties are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the conference over to our host, Vice President of Investor Relations, Ms. Darcy Reese. Please go ahead.\nDarcy Reese: Thank you, Brad. Good morning everyone, and welcome to the second quarter 2023 earnings call for American Electric Power. We appreciate you taking time today to join us. Our earnings release, presentation slides and related financial information are available on our website at aep.com. Today, we will be making forward-looking statements during the call. There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements. Please refer to our SEC filings for a discussion of these factors. Joining me this morning for opening remarks are Julie Sloat, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Ann Kelly, our Chief Financial Officer. We will take your questions following their remarks. I will now turn the call over to Julie.\nJulie Sloat: Thanks Darcy. Welcome everyone to American Electric Power's second quarter 2023 earnings call. Good to be with everyone this morning. It's a rapid time of change in our industry with new opportunities resulting from federal policy shifts and evolving state and customer priorities. We also continue to navigate a dynamic environment with rising interest rates and supply chain constraints. In short, it's definitely an exciting time to be at AEP as we make significant progress on our important stakeholder commitments and strategic objectives, including delivering on our 2023 operating earnings guidance and 6% to 7% annual operating earnings growth, providing dividend growth in line with earnings, strengthening our balance sheet as we move through the next few quarters, actively managing our portfolio, achieving net-zero by 2045 and central to our purpose, keeping our customer rates affordable. We recently made some organizational adjustments such as the restructuring of our Federal Affairs function, the realignment of our regulatory team, and the refreshment of some of our operating company presidents. These changes will help us to operate more effectively and facilitate our success in this ever-changing environment. As always, we keep the customer at the center of every decision we make. This is why we engage with our federal and state regulators so we know how to best support our operating companies while we balance investor preferences as we grow the business and invest $40 billion over the next five years in new generation resources and our energy delivery infrastructure. This morning, I'll provide a brief overview of our second quarter financial performance before getting into our measured and disciplined approach to simplifying and de-risking our business profile through our portfolio management activities. Related to this, I'll share some updates regarding our unregulated contracted renewables portfolio, retail and distributed resources businesses, and the status of our strategic review of our non-core transmission joint ventures. While we still have a lot of work to do on the regulatory front, I'll conclude by providing insight into the recent successes related to our renewables execution and developments on our regulatory and legislative initiatives as we keep our customers\u2019 needs top of mind. A summary of our second quarter 2023 business highlights and a high level overview of our financial results can be found on Slide 6 of today's presentation. AEP delivered second quarter 2023 operating earnings of $1.13 per share or $582 million compared to $1.20 per share or $618 million last year. The year-over-year decline reflects the timing of higher interest rates in the reversal of last year's second quarter 2022 favorable weather. Today we're pleased to reaffirm our 2023 full year operating earnings guidance range of $5.19 to $5.39 with a $5.29 midpoint and long-term earnings growth rate is 6% to 7%. Given our line of sight at this point in the year, I believe we have the operational flexibility and leverage to pool to ensure that we will deliver on our commitment. Later on, Ann's going to talk or walk through our second quarter of 2023 performance drivers and share some perspectives on our load outlook as we drive economic development within our service territory. She'll also share some details supporting our targeted 14% to 15% FFO to debt range. While our FFO to debt is 11.1% this quarter, our forecasts show material improvement in this metric as we approach year-end and we fully expect to be in our targeted range in early 2024. As we continue to execute on our strategic objectives, we remain focused on simplifying and de-risking our business profile. To that end, you'll recall that in February of this year, we announced a signed agreement with IRG Acquisition Holdings for the sale of our 1,365 megawatt unregulated renewables portfolio. A summary of the renewable sale can be found on Slide 7. In the second quarter, we received FERC 203 approval and clearance from antitrust authorities. The only remaining approval is from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., which we expect to see receive in the near-term and subsequently close on the sale in August. As we've said, the proceeds from this transaction will be directed to our core regulated businesses and strengthening of our balance sheet. Turning to Slide 8, let's touch on some other asset sales that we have in progress. In May, 2023, we also announced the sale of our New Mexico Renewable Development Solar portfolio, also known as NMRD. We are currently on track with our 50/50 joint venture partner, PNM Resources to close on this transaction by the end of 2023. The sales of our retail and distributed resources businesses are also on schedule to close in the first half of 2024 as previously announced. Please keep in mind that other than the unregulated renewables portfolio proceeds of $1.2 billion, no other sales proceeds are reflected in our five year cash flow outlook. We\u2019ll first obtain the signed sales agreements for NMRD and our retail and distributed resources businesses, and then incorporate the related proceeds into our cash flow outlook. As part of our commitment to portfolio management, I\u2019m pleased to share some additional news with you today. We\u2019re announcing that we\u2019ve completed the strategic review of two of our three non-core transmission joint ventures and have determined that the sale of AEP\u2019s interest in Prairie Wind Transmission and Pioneer Transmission as our preferred path forward. We expect to launch the sales processes soon and we\u2019ll keep you updated on our progress. In the meantime, we continue our strategic review of Transource Energy and expect to complete that review by year end. Now let\u2019s switch gears to AEP\u2019s regulated renewables execution and recent successes. Through our five year $8.6 billion regulated renewables capital plan, we now have a total of $5.2 billion approved and an additional $1.7 billion currently before our commissions for approval. You can find more detail on activities to acquire additional generation resources in the appendix on Slides 31 through 33. In May 2023, the Oklahoma Commission approved PSO\u2019s 995.5 megawatt renewables portfolio for $2.5 billion, which includes three wind and three solar projects. These projects are projected to be in service toward the end of 2025. For SWEPCO\u2019s 999 megawatt renewables portfolio totaling $2.2 billion of investments, I\u2019m happy to report that last month, both the Arkansas and Louisiana Commissions approved the full portfolio containing two wind projects and one solar project. We expect the projects will be going into service by the 2025 timeframe. Since the Texas Commission denied SWEPCO\u2019s application related to these projects, Arkansas will move forward with the 20% of the portfolio total and Louisiana will flex up with 70% giving wholesale customers the remaining 10%. We\u2019re excited to deliver the benefits of lowest reasonable cost and reliable energy to these communities we serve in Arkansas and Louisiana. We\u2019re also currently awaiting for commission decisions expected as early as in the third quarter of 2023 for 151 megawatts of owned wind and energy storage at APCo, 469 megawatts of owned solar at I&M and 154 megawatts of owned wind at PSO. Importantly, our regulated renewables goals are aligned and supported by our integrated resources plans. Accordingly, we\u2019ve issued requests for proposals for generation resources at APCo and I&M with more to come from operating companies soon. I\u2019ll turn now to updates on several of our ongoing regulatory and legislative initiatives. More detail on our regulatory activities can be found in the appendix on Slides 34 through 36. We\u2019re unquestionably focused on closing the gap between our authorized versus earned ROEs. While our second quarter ROE came in at 8.6%, this measure was depressed by 40 basis points due to mild weather. Closing this gap is going to take a little longer than we had anticipated in our 2023 guidance, which you may recall included a 9.4% ROE. But I\u2019m confident that we\u2019ll reduce this gap by year end and still meet our earnings guidance. As we make needed progress in this regard, we are continuing to prioritize federal, state and customer preferences to meet the needs of our communities that we serve. We look forward to building on our constructive relationships with all of our stakeholders and clearing the path for our operating companies to be effective and successful in their respective service territories. In fact, while being mindful of any ex-parte restrictions, I\u2019m personally meeting with many commissioners across AEP\u2019s footprint to engage in discussions about our company and what is top of mind for them in the way of priorities and expectations as we work together to do our best to provide this product that is the fundamental enabler for society. In June 2023, we filed a new base case in Kentucky to address the financial health of the company and established a path for future investment. The application incorporated a comprehensive rate review and a proposed 9.9% ROE with a request to allow for the securitization of $471 million of regulatory assets. This will help to ensure that Kentucky Power is best positioned to provide safe and reliable service, while managing costs to provide affordable service to our customers. We expect that the new rates will be in effect in early 2024. In May 2023, we settled PSO\u2019s base case with the commission staff, attorney general and other parties in Oklahoma providing a path for approval for more efficient cost recovery mechanisms with continuation of the transmission tracker and reestablishment of a distribution tracker. While we await commission \u2013 a commission decision expected in the third quarter of 2023, we implemented interim rates starting in early June. For APCo Virginia\u2019s 2022 \u2013 2020 to 2022 triennial filed in March of 2023. We\u2019re working through regulatory \u2013 the regulatory calendar and expect an order later this year. And Texas legislation was passed last month, which permits utilities to file the Distribution Cost Recovery Factor or DCRF twice per year instead of once per year. The bill also allows DCRF to be used by a utility even if it has a pending base case review proceeding. This important legislation will help improve AEP\u2019s regulatory lag in Texas, as we make needed distribution investments to bolster the grid in this region. AEPs management of fuel cost recovery remains a top priority with deferred fuel balance at $1.4 billion as of the second quarter 2023. We\u2019ve adapted fuel cost recovery mechanisms across most of our jurisdictions with a focus on balancing customer impact. Notably, we are awaiting a decision on our fuel case in West Virginia. Through this spring we were active at the state legislature and collaborated on a new securitization bill to provide an effective path forward on fuel recovery and other legacy costs while mitigating customer bill impact. In April, 2023, \u2013 in our April, 2023 fuel recovery application, we filed two options for consideration, one which amortizes the fuel balance over three years, and alternatively, in an effort to even further minimize cost impacts to customers, we requested West Virginia Commission approval to use securitization to manage our $553 million deferred fuel balance. We also proposed an opportunity within that second option to apply the securitization mechanism to $88 million of deferred storm costs and $1.2 billion of legacy coal plant balances with the intention of offering a solution that would essentially have a neutral impact on customer rate. Keep in mind; securitization is the mechanism we can use to address affordability in West Virginia. While it\u2019s important that we addressed fuel and storm cost recovery in the state, let me be clear that the possible securitization of $1.2 billion for our Amos and Mountaineer coal plant balances is not required to hit our credit metrics, nor does it suggest that there\u2019s a change in our current plant \u2013 our current plant retirement schedule of 2040 for these units. Rather, this is entirely driven by the desire to consider all options to mitigate impact to customer bills. The West Virginia Commission subsequently issued a procedural schedule in the fuel case, including the April, 2023 prudence [ph] report, which will be addressed in an evidentiary hearing beginning on September 5. This schedule provides an opportunity to ensure focus on cost concerns and a constructive future in West Virginia balancing customer and financial impacts. Pending the commission\u2019s decision later this year, we could issue bonds to securitize a possible combination of the deferred fuel balance, deferred storm cost, and legacy coal plant balances in the first half of 2024. I\u2019m pleased with the progress we\u2019ve made so far. We still have a lot of work to do as we execute on our plans to meet our commitments, overcome challenges, reach our strategic objectives, engage with stakeholders, and keep customers a top priority. Together we deliver safe, clean, reliable, and affordable energy to our communities while creating value for our investors. With that, Ann will now walk you through our second quarter, 2023 performance drivers and details supporting our financial target. Ann?\nAnn Kelly: Thank you, Julie and Darcy. It\u2019s good to be with you all this morning. Thanks for dialing in. I\u2019m going to walk us through our second quarter and year-to-date results, share some updates on our service territory load and finish with commentary on credit metrics and liquidity, as well as some thoughts on our guidance, financial targets and portfolio management activities underway. Let\u2019s go to Slide 9, which shows the comparison of GAAP to operating earnings. GAAP earnings for the second quarter were a $1.01 per share compared to a $1.02 per share in 2022. Year-to-date GAAP earnings through June, were a $1.78 per share compared to $2.43 per share in 2022. In our year-to-date comparison of GAAP to operating earnings, we\u2019ve reflected the expected loss on the sale of the contracted renewables business as a non-operating cost, as well as an adjustment true of cost related to the terminated Kentucky transaction in addition to our typical mark-to-market adjustment. Also due to new legislation in Texas allowing the recovery of incentive compensation, favorable entry was booked in the second quarter to capitalize previously incurred costs, which was almost entirely reflected as non-operating earnings. There is a detailed reconciliation of GAAP to operating earnings on Pages 16 and 17 of the presentation today. Let\u2019s walk through our quarterly operating earnings performance by segment on Slide 10. Operating earnings for the second quarter totaled $1.13 per share or $582 million compared to a $1.20 per share, or $618 million in 2022. The lower performance compared to last year was primarily driven by weather, interest and O&M, partially offset by rate increases in our utility and transmission revenue growth in both our Utilities and the Transmission Holding Company segment. The unfavorable weather was largely due to positive weather we saw in the second quarter of 2022, while weather was mild begin in the second quarter of 2023; the unfavorable impact was less significant in comparison to the first quarter of this year. Interest continues to be unfavorable versus the prior year, and that is primarily driven by higher debt balances as well as the higher interest rates. The higher debt balance also has resulted in an increase in interest expense as compared to our guidance, but we continue to adjust in other areas to offset this impact. Again, we were expecting this variance to be more pronounced in the first half of 2023 as interest rates somewhat stabilized. We also expect the announced sale of our contracted renewables business to close this quarter and the conversion of the $850 million equity units in August to lessen the burden in the second half of the year. Finally, I\u2019d like to note as well that we still expect to see favorable O&M in the second half of the year compared to the prior year, reflecting the timing of O&M spending and near term actions that we are taking to help offset the unfavorable weather, such as holding positions open, reducing travel, and adjusting the timing and of discretionary spending. These actions are in addition to our ongoing efficiency efforts that we target to offset the impact of inflation each year. Operating earnings for our vertically integrated utilities were $0.51 per share, down $0.08. Favorable drivers included rate changes across multiple jurisdictions, depreciation and off-system sales. These items were more than offset by the unfavorable weather interest expense, O&M and lower retail and wholesale load. I will touch on our retail load trends in a couple minutes. Consistent with our first quarter results, depreciation is favorable at the vertically integrated utility segment, primarily due to the expiration of the Rockport Unit 2 lease in December of 2022. I&M should continue to see about $0.055 net favorable depreciation in each of the first three quarters of 2023, plus an additional $0.035 in Q4. Including the impact of the Rockport lease, depreciation was $0.04 favorable in Q2. However, if we exclude the impact of the lease, depreciation would've been about $0.02 unfavorable, which is consistent with the incremental investment in this segment. I also want to mention that the favorable off system sales showing up again in the second quarter is due to the fact that Rockport Unit 2 margins are no longer shared with our retail customers. The Transmission and Distribution Utilities segment earned $0.30 per share, down $0.02 compared to last year. Favorable drivers in this segment including transmission revenue and rate changes largely due to the distribution investment rider in Ohio and the distribution cost recovery factor rider in Texas. Offsetting these favorable items were unfavorable weather, lower retail load, depreciation, O&M and interest. The AEP Transmission Holdco segment contributed $0.38 per share up $0.11 compared to last year. The main drivers here included favorable investment growth and a favorable year-over-year change in the true-up. You'll recall that we had a negative true-up in 2022.  Generation & Marketing produced $0.13 per share down $0.05 from last year. The negative variance is primarily due to the development asset sale and other one-time favorable items in 2022 as well as higher interest expense in 2023. These unfavorable items were partially offset by higher retail power margins in 2023. Finally, corporate and other was down $0.03 per share, driven primarily by higher interest expense and O&M. These unfavorable items are partially offset by a favorable change in investment gain and income taxes. The favorable change in investment gain is primarily due to investment loss incurred in the second quarter of 2022. Before we move on to the next slide, to give an update on load, I want to briefly mention that the details of our year-to-date operating earnings performance will be shown in the appendix of supplemental information going forward. You can find these details on Slide 15 of the presentation today. Turning to Slide 11. I'll provide an update on our normalized load performance for the quarter. Overall load continues to come in ahead of budget, but we're closely monitoring key components of our retail sales in the context of the slowing economy, and we are seeing different trends between our retail customer classes. As we discussed last quarter, our projections already assume that economic conditions will slow in the second half of the year. Recent positive economic data on inflation supports that any slowdown will be in line with our previous expectations. Beginning in the upper left hand quadrant of the slide, we see a slowing in our residential load compared to a year ago. Our residential customer counts continue to grow, but we are seeing usage decline as many of our customers return to the office and even more squeezed by the relationship between inflation and income growth. That relationship is a key driver of residential usage and we expect to see it stabilize in the second half of the year. This month's CPI data point was an encouraging sign that inflationary pressures on our residential customers are continuing to lessen into the fall. Moving to the lower left hand quadrant of the slide, we can see a noticeable slowing in the industrial class. So still ahead of year end budget projections, industrial load is beginning to reflect the expected slowdown in the outlook for manufacturing across the country. This slowing has been broad based across industries and operating companies, but would've been even worse without an our ongoing commitment to economic development. We estimate that total industrial load through the quarter would've actually declined by 1.2% if not for growth tied to our economic development efforts. Even with these efforts, however, we do expect industrial load growth to remain subdued due to the tighter financial conditions and slowing levels of demand for finished goods through the end of the year. Offsetting this slowing is a significant boost to our normalized commercial sales that you can see in the upper right corner driven by new large customer volumes from our ongoing economic development efforts. Year-to-date commercial load has grown almost 8% year-over-year in each of the last two quarters. We expect our commercial load to continue to outperform through the end of the year. Thanks to ongoing technology development across our operating footprint. Gains in AEP Texas and AEP Ohio should continue to be especially robust with several new projects scheduled to come online through the end of the year. With the June CPI data, we've now seen a material deceleration in key components of inflation that the economy has been waiting to see. We think this progress on inflation coupled with continued resilience in the labor market dramatically reduces the probability of a severe economic contraction in 2023. Our near and long-term load projections are bolstered by our discipline commitment to economic development across the service area. We know that working with local stakeholders to attract more economic activity is a key strategy to providing value to our customers. This allows us to continue to prioritize investments that will improve customer experience while mitigating the rate impact on our customer base.  Great examples of our recent successes are NL and Tulsa and GM and Samsung in Indiana. Both of these economic development wins will not only add load to our industrial segment, but each is also expected to bring more than a 1,000 full-time jobs that will ultimately benefit our residential segment and boost the local economy. Let\u2019s move on to Slide 12 to discuss the company\u2019s capitalization and liquidity position. Taking a look at the upper left quadrant in the page, you can see our FFO to debt metric stands at 11.1%, which is a decrease of 30 basis points from last quarter and continues to be below our target. The primary reason for this decrease is a $1.3 billion increase in debt during the quarter, partially due to long-term debt issuances at the operating company level to support our capital investments and the return of mark-to-market collateral positions associated with decline in natural gas and power prices. Return of collateral reduces our funds from operations, so hits us on both sides of the equation without the fluctuations in our mark-to-market collateral positions over the past 12 months and some remaining impact of deferred fuel, our FFO to debt metric will be closer to 13.7%. We expect that this metric will improve by year end as we reduce debt after the close of the announced renewable sale and our 2020 equity unit conversion and we see the improvement in funds from operations over prior year in the fourth quarter. We remain committed to our targeted FFO to debt range of 14% to 15% and we expect material improvement by the end of 2023 and to achieve our target in early 2024. You can see our liquidity summary in the lower left quadrant of the slide. Our five-year $4 billion bank revolver and two-year $1 billion revolving credit facility support our liquidity position, which remains strong at $3.1 billion.  On a GAAP basis, our debt-to-capital ratio increased from the prior quarter by 50 basis points to 64.6%. We plan to reduce this percentage in the third quarter as we eliminate debt when we close our announced contracted renewable sale transaction and complete our previously planned equity unit conversion. On the qualified pension front, our funding status increased during the quarter to 102.2%. The funded status improved due to rising rates during the quarter that decrease the liability while solid equity returns positively impacted plan access. Let\u2019s go to Slide 13 for a quick recap of today\u2019s message. The unfavorable change in weather primarily due to positive effects in the second quarter of 2022 is a significant driver in our quarter-over-quarter earnings comparison. If we removed this effect, we would\u2019ve been $0.05 favorable compared to the prior year and our results were roughly in line with our expectations for the company as a whole. I will note from a year-to-date perspective 2023 weather has been the most mild on record for the AEP system in the past 30 years, resulting in $0.29 EPS impacts year-over-year and about $0.20 versus normal weather. So as we progress through the remainder of the year, we will continue to focus on taking action to mitigate this and other headwinds. Overall, our business remains in a strong position and we are reaffirming our operating earnings guidance of $5.19 to $5.39 per share. We also continue to be committed to our long-term growth rate of 6% to 7%. As Julie previously addressed, we are on track to close the sale of our unregulated contracted renewables portfolio in the third quarter this year, and our retail and distributed resources business in the first half of 2024. We\u2019ve concluded that the sale of our interest in two of our transmission joint ventures, Prairie Wind Transmission and Pioneer Transmission is our preferred path, and we continue a strategic review of our Transource Energy joint venture. These initiatives will help simplify and de-risk our business going forward. We really appreciate your time and attention today and with that and going to ask Brad to open the call, that we can hear what\u2019s on your mind and answer any questions that you have.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Give us just a moment here. And I can go to Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead.\nShar Pourreza: Hey, good morning guys.\nJulie Sloat: Good morning.\nShar Pourreza: Good morning. Just on the credit metrics, obviously, a little bit more slippage this quarter, which you highlighted. I guess can you talk about the pathway to get to that 14% to 15%, a little bit more detail? I think 300 basis points seems like a lot of improvement that\u2019s needed in a short timeframe, being that it\u2019s your early 2024 target. I mean, could we see incremental equity in plan? Is the asset sales enough to get you there? And how important is collecting the unrecovered fuel balance in terms of being able to hit that target, which I guess it still stands around $1.4 billion. Thanks.\nAnn Kelly: Yes. Shar, I\u2019ll take that. As we mentioned, the main impact to our FFO to debt is the timing of the collateral payment. So that\u2019s about a 240 basis point impact to our FFO to debt, and so that should resolve itself by year end and result in a noticeable improvement. We also have about a 100 basis points of favorable impact from the proceeds of the contracted renewable sale and the equity unit conversion. So we are, confident that we are going to have measure improvement by the end of the year and be into the range by next year. In our forecast we don\u2019t have any of the securitization in our cash flows. We do have recovery of deferred fuel, but that is not necessary to be able to get into our current range.\nShar Pourreza: Got it. Okay, perfect. And then maybe just a more of a strategic question for Julie. I mean, obviously, AEP is never CapEx constrained, right? I guess how do we sort of think about overall financing, especially given the current interest rate environment and kind of where the stock currently trades? Do you have ongoing; you do have ongoing needs, right? So as we\u2019re thinking about parent leverage and equity are more non-core asset sales out there, or could we actually start to see some more core assets sales to kind of fund the plan and maybe further simplify the story? Thanks\nJulie Sloat: Yes, no, Shar. I so appreciate the question. And you\u2019re right, we have a lot of opportunity to put capital to work as it relates to taking care of the customer and delivering reliable, affordable service. But as you point out, we need to make sure that we\u2019re hitting all the metrics too. So not only do you need to be real mindful of where customer rates are going, when we put money to work, I need to make sure that all my earnings growth targets are going to be hit. Because I think you guys would be upset with me if that didn\u2019t happen, so we\u2019ll make sure that happens. But I also need to make sure that my balance sheet\u2019s really strong too. So let me get to your question around asset sales. We\u2019ve really been focused on, as you know, the non-core related activities that when people buy AEP shares or invest in our bonds, they\u2019re not necessarily looking to buy something that is not a traditional regulated utility type business. So to that end, that\u2019s why you see us kind of going through the paces today where we\u2019ve talked about the unregulated components of our business and, while we love transmission even looking at some of these transmission investments of the joint ventures that are off our footprint, because if we can channel all of our efforts and dollars to taking care of our customers that are regulated in our footprint, that\u2019s where we want to play. So, I wouldn\u2019t anticipate, a significant additional activity coming from us for a couple of reasons. I think we\u2019re pretty cleaned up once we get some of this non-core stuff taken care of. I think we\u2019re in a good place. I think that, there may be some opportunities, on the edges, but for the most part we\u2019re \u2013 we should be in a really good space to be continuing to look at the regulated pieces of our business. But we also and very candid Shar, we don\u2019t need to engage in asset sales to make the balance sheet work. What we need to do is make sure we\u2019re being as efficient as possible, and that\u2019s another reason why I want to make sure that every dollar we do put to work is one that a, makes sense for our customers, but also is something that makes sense for our service territories. And specifically why I am calling that out is another reason why I\u2019m out talking with folks in our community. So whether its commissioners, customers, et cetera, need to make sure that we\u2019re aligned or at least absolutely aware of one another\u2019s priorities and then we can make refinements based on those conversations. So, I would never say that we\u2019re not at all capital constraints because I think we naturally are because we put our own constraints on because we got to take care of customer rates and make sure that we\u2019re going to have a really strong balance sheet. We\u2019re working on that. As Ann just mentioned, we expect that FFO to debt to look a lot better once we get to year end and going into 2024. I think in the interim here, it\u2019s going to be just a little bumpy as we work through a couple of the next few months. So I wouldn\u2019t be too concerned about that. I feel comfortable with the numbers I\u2019m seeing, but we\u2019ll continue to be very disciplined around, which dollars we put to work where that it\u2019s consistent with what our stakeholders need and want taking care of our customer and then just being as efficient as we can. So my focus is going to be more at this point on let\u2019s close that gap on the ROE. That\u2019s the piece that I can try to do my best to control.\nShar Pourreza: Got it, terrific. And then no, it does. And then we do appreciate some of the salient points you brought up in your prepared remarks as far as the outreach to the regulatory folks and various stakeholders. So thank you for that points.\nJulie Sloat: Yep. Thank you for the coverage.\nOperator: And next we go to Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nJeremy Tonet: Hi, good morning.\nJulie Sloat: Good morning.\nJeremy Tonet: I wanted to kind of follow up on some of the points that you were just touching on here because, some of the dockets and local media attention have highlighted some regulatory pushback in certain areas of ablate, and you mentioned, reaching out to local commissioners to build relations there. Just wondering over what timeframe, you expect to kind of meet all of them? Is this a change in regulatory strategy where they hear from headquarters more regularly here? Just wondering how you think about this type of outreach going forward?\nJulie Sloat: Oh, Jeremy, I love that question. So I\u2019m going to tell you from my perspective, this is coming from a former operating company president. So I keep that hat kind of in my back pocket that I got to throw on from time to time. And so let me start with this. What my hope to do, well I, what I hope to do or achieve is, pay [ph] the way or clear the path for our operating companies so that they can do the best they can do boots on the ground. And so my objective is to get out, to make sure that I\u2019m talking with different commissioners. And by the way, that\u2019s already underway. So, I\u2019ve already been out talking with several folks and I\u2019ve got my calendar lined up over the next few months to continue to that effort. So I\u2019m not going to get into necessarily exactly who I\u2019m talking to when, but that, that\u2019s well underway. So rest assured that\u2019s happening. But I just, I want to make sure that they\u2019re hearing from me and that they understand that AEP, the parent or the service core is here to provide clearance and service and support for the individual operating companies. Really, that\u2019s the only reason the service core exists, is to support the operating companies. And I need them to hear that from me. And more importantly I just want to be a really good listener so that I can be really good at my job so I can take care of our customers, take care of my team, and then ultimately take care of my investors and the other stakeholders that are party to everything that we're doing here. So I don't want people to think that I'm stepping in the way or thinking that something's not right because that's not the case at all. I just want to make sure that we're doing everything we can to support the teams so that they can be as successful as they possibly can be. Because here's the other point, right. You call out the fact that there are pressure points as it relates to regulatory activities. I think that's going to be what we're dealing with for the next several years. We got a lot of headwinds now. The game's changed, the industry's going through a material transition. Each of our states is in a different place as it relates to their economies. And so I think everybody is doing their jobs and that means we got to do ours too. We have been doing it, but we have to be really good listeners and learners and adjusters. And I think that goes for all the different stakeholders. So the more dialogue we can have, I think the smarter we're going to be and if nothing else that will \u2013 we only be able to take care of the customer and make sure we're keeping the lights on and delivering this product that make life possible. But I think we're going to be doing it in a much more effective way, and we're going to have to pick up the pace too. So we got to do it in a faster way than we've ever done it in our history. So I think it's exciting. I love getting out and talking with people. You guys know from The Street, I love getting out and talking with you too, so that's not going to stop. So I just got to work my calendar and I'll be out front and I'm happy to talk about any of the conversations that I've had.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. That's very helpful. And just one more along these lines, dialing in a little bit more. In Kentucky, our local stakeholder conversations highlight a focus on increased distribution investment as a priority as opposed to the more recent, I guess, transmission investment which could help local stakeholder relations there with a focus on distribution. Just wondering how you see a Kentucky strategy evolving over time here?\nJulie Sloat: Yes, I'll tell you, let me start with this. Again, having been a former CFO as well. At 1.6% ROE, yes, we got to work on that. And that to me, when I see that number that's not a financially healthy, sustainably healthy entity so that's why we're going through the case activities. So we're going to work on that and that's exactly why we went out and socialized the case well in advance with dozens of meetings with a variety of different stakeholders. So again, listening and learning so we understand where everybody's kind of shaken out, but also understanding what it is that we need to do so that we're successful, not only in taking care of our customers, but making sure we're doing everything we can to make sure that the stakeholders understand what our objectives are and are comfortable with it. So yes, the objective is to, A, get a plan in place that will allow us to improve the financial positioning of the company, which then enables us to make future investments to take care of the customers, they need the power too. It doesn't matter which state you're sitting in, but the idea is to engage in these activities, hopefully have a really good case. And I don't expect it to be easy. It's not supposed to be easy. If it was easy, everybody would be doing it. So we'll engage in those activities and hopefully get us on a path forward that enables us to continue to invest in a really smart way in the state that everybody can feel good about.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. So there's room to pivot towards more distribution over transmission. Sounds like you're working with stakeholders there?\nJulie Sloat: We, absolutely and so those are the conversations that we're having. We do know that transmission has been very important to the commission. And so that is top of mind for us as well. And we've worked that into the structures that we've essentially set forth in our case. But at the end of the day, it's the distribution that also matters because we got to keep the lights on.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. I'll leave it there. Thank you very much.\nJulie Sloat: You bet. Thank you.\nOperator: And next, we'll move to Anthony Crowdell with Mizuho. Please go ahead.\nAnthony Crowdell: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question.\nJulie Sloat: You bet.\nAnthony Crowdell: Just \u2013 first off, Slide 12, maybe I've been following it too long, but I think over the last 10 years, the total debt to total capitalization has gone from 53%. Now it sits at 65%. I'm just wondering, does that stabilize or where do you see the sweet spot for total debt to total capitalization?\nAnn Kelly: Yes, absolutely. Thanks for the question. So it has inched up, as you can see on the graph. I mean, 60% is our sweet spot and that's what we're targeting going forward. As you can see, we're above that right now. We do expect that to decrease with the contracted renewable sale proceeds and also the equity unit conversion. So that's a couple hundred basis points, that'll reduce that closer to the 60%, but we still have some work to do.\nAnthony Crowdell: Great. And then if I stayed on the balance sheet here, I think you've talked about, you've planned to be in a target, and I hope this correct in 2024. If I could get real granular, when do you think you're going to get into the midpoint of your 14% to 15% range? Is that something you'd talk about?\nJulie Sloat: Yes, I mean, I would say we're going to be, we say we're going to be in the target in 2024 and I think approaching the midpoint probably by the end of 2024. There are the fluctuations as I mentioned in FFO that we're experiencing. And that's just really due to timing of quarter-over-quarter fund flows. And so, you will see especially in 2023 that it will be press till the fourth quarter when we really see that switch in the collateral collections and improving our FFO there, so that's what's going to take some time. But we do expect it to increase, like I said, materially by the fourth quarter and then into next year. And Anthony, just to put a little finer point on it too, remember, our threshold that we're sensitive to is 13% as it relates to our Baa2 rating from Moody's. And so that's why we toggle to the 14% to 15% because what we want to have is cushion. So 14% definitely gives us some cushion, so keep that in mind as well. And the other thing I mentioned in my comments too is as we proceed through the rest of this year, you can expect maybe a little more pressure as we go through the next couple of months with some improvement as we get to the fourth quarter. Just want to manage those expectations.\nAnn Kelly: Yes. The other thing just to highlight is that, we're talking a lot about the timing of collateral payments, but 80% of that volatility that we're seeing relates to our retail business, which as you know, is for sale. So once we sell that business, we would expect that reduction in volatility going forward.\nAnthony Crowdell: And then just lastly, Julie, I appreciate all the commentary you've given on the regulatory strategy and especially Kentucky. And I know Kentucky's a very small piece, but when you look at the equalizer chart, I mean the ROE is pretty low. What\u2019s a reasonable assumption for us to use? Where that ROE could go in 20 \u2013 by 2024? I mean, does that go to an allowed of 9.9%? I\u2019m just curious, how long does it take to recover the regulated returns of the utility?\nJulie Sloat: Yes, Anthony, it\u2019s going to take a while. Do not expect a flash cut. And so remember in our case, we requested a 9.9% ROE, our current authorized is 9.3%. I\u2019m looking at Page number 34 in the slide deck right now. It will be a walk. So that\u2019s something we\u2019re trying to manage our own expectations around as well as for you all, as you work to model. So stay tuned and let this case proceed and see how things move along and then we can continue to kind of dial that in and give you more direct guidance.\nAnthony Crowdell: Great. Thanks so much for taking my questions. I really appreciate it.\nJulie Sloat: You bet. Thanks for being on the call.\nOperator: And we can go to Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Thank you Julie and team. Good morning. Appreciate it. Maybe to follow-up on some of the last few questions here, if I can. Just as you think about some of these headwinds here with respect to securitization heading into 2024, obviously you down fairly confident, not just in offsetting the weather year today, but in the 2024 items here. Can you talk about some of those tailwinds here or some of the forthcoming offsets? What else gives you the confidence in having that linear trajectory on the 6% to 7% here? If you can speak to that a little bit more. And maybe related to that, can you talk about maybe the timing of some of these items to the extent, which some of those headwinds on securitization bleed into 2025 as well? I don\u2019t want to be too myopic on the next year.\nAnn Kelly: Yes. I mean, what I\u2019ll do is I\u2019ll start with kind of addressing the 2023 earnings guidance question. As you look, we\u2019re $0.18 below prior year and we guided to year-over-year for the full year it\u2019s about $0.20 improvement. So that\u2019s $0.38 that we need to outperform last year for the second half of the year. When I look at this, I think it\u2019s helpful to break it down into components. So weather was $0.29 over 2022, about $0.20 of that impact is versus normal. And that\u2019s where we\u2019ve taken some action to offset those headwinds. Interest also is about $0.29 unfavorable year-to-date. It\u2019s running a bit above expectations. We had guided to $0.20, but that also didn\u2019t include interest on Kentucky, because we had expected to sell the business. So that\u2019s about $0.10 per year and that\u2019s covered in revenue. So we had anticipated much of our year-over-year increase to be in the first half of the year because of the timing of the Fed actions. So while we are a little bit short coming into the back half of the year, we also have the proceeds from the contracted renewable sale and equity unit conversion that\u2019ll help reduce our debt somewhat. And we\u2019ve taken other actions to offset the increase in rates because it has been \u2013 the Fed has been tightening a little bit longer. When you look at O&M, unfavorable to last year in the first half, but we expect this to reverse due to timing of our O&M spending. Our original guidance planned for reduction of O&M during the second half of the year because last year\u2019s spending was a little bit robust on the O&M side in the back half. And so we had already anticipated a reduction and then we\u2019ve taken additional actions like those that I\u2019ve mentioned to be able to make up for the reduction in weather volumes. And then lastly, there\u2019s a couple other things that we\u2019re pointing to. One is the favorable trends in commercial load that we expect to continue. And then we\u2019ve also seen favorable results in our generation and marketing business that\u2019ll benefit us this year. So, putting that all together that what give us the confidence and our ability to meet our earnings guidance for this year. In terms of maintaining the 6% to 7% EPS growth going forward, it\u2019s really a story on our capital deployment and we have a very robust capital pipeline that allows us to do just that.\nJulie Sloat: And Julien, on that note, just to kind of put an end cap on this. I think the core is solid. And so when you look out in the next few years, as Ann mentioned, we got $40 billion we\u2019re put into work in terms of capital investment over the next five years. We\u2019ll continue to work with our regulators to make sure that we\u2019re deploying the dollars where we all agree that they need to go. And then at that point it\u2019s really around making sure that we also execute on not only the regulatory plans that we lay out there, but as you know, we\u2019ve got some strategic asset sales that are underway. So we\u2019ll deal with the fact that some of those businesses are falling away, rechanneling those dollars to the regulated pieces of the business that will help us from the math perspective and making sure that we\u2019re hitting all of those other balance sheet metrics that we need to make sure that we hit, so people aren\u2019t worried or concerned. And we got a little more flexibility. So when we have a weather event or something of that nature, we can easily sustain that. But the core is solid and at this point it\u2019s around being efficient, putting the dollars to work where it makes sense and closing the gap on the ROEs.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. All right. Excellent. And then if I could follow-up briefly on a couple details. Just with respect to PSO, obviously dynamic situation with the ALJ and settlement, can you talk a little bit about your expectations here and maybe about what you had been planning in interim rates? Just ultimately what happens, how you\u2019ve been planning, what\u2019s reflected in rates? If you don\u2019t mind a little bit of an update there.\nJulie Sloat: Yes. So we implemented interim rates in early June I think it was, as it relates to the settlement that we had put in place. And at this point, as you mentioned, the ALJ had its report that it is submitted and then file \u2013 exceptions were filed, I think it was yesterday to the ALJ report. So if you haven\u2019t taken a look at that I would encourage you to take a look at that. But effectively the parties to the settlement agreement were absolutely supportive of the settlement agreement, which we would\u2019ve expected anyway. So we felt good about that. And we\u2019re going to let this thing play out over the next couple of weeks really, because we\u2019re getting pretty close here. Parties have four days to response the exceptions that were filed. And that is effectively August 1st. And then we will have an oral argument of the exceptions that\u2019s scheduled for mid-August and we would expect to get an order in September. So stay tuned. The process is working and like I mentioned, we\u2019ve got inter rate \u2013 interim rates in effect. And we will keep you apprised, but do go take a look at the exceptions. I thought that was interesting.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Duly noted. Thank you. All right, I\u2019ll leave it there. Good luck guys. Speak to you soon.\nJulie Sloat: Excellent. Thanks, Julien.\nOperator: Next we\u2019ll go to David Arcaro with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nDavid Arcaro: Hey, good morning. Thanks for the questions.\nJulie Sloat: Good morning.\nDavid Arcaro: Wanted to, let\u2019s see \u2013 could you give some color on what your plans are going forward for Texas in terms of the generation outlook you\u2019ve had some challenges there just with the repeat renewables proposal. I\u2019m wondering how you\u2019re thinking about that going forward in terms of strategy and generation pollution?\nJulie Sloat: Yes, absolutely. Yes. So we did file for rehearing, because we need to make sure that we\u2019re doing all we need to do from a traditional regulatory and administrative perspective. And then what you can anticipate AEP doing is essentially running another RFP and running another process so that we can make sure that we\u2019re doing what we need to accommodate the capacity situation in Texas. I do believe that Texas understands there is an adequacy issue that we would otherwise have to deal with. So that\u2019s something that we will be proceeding forward with. So standby and you\u2019ll see what we come to the street with here in the not too distant future.\nDavid Arcaro: Got it. And could there be a cell phone [ph] option in there? And to the extent there was, would that be, I guess, incremental to what\u2019s currently in the renewable generation outlook for CapEx plan?\nJulie Sloat: Yes, that\u2019s a possibility. That\u2019s a possibility. But what we would do is, accommodate any type of investment in the current CapEx forecast.\nDavid Arcaro: Okay. Got it. Understood. And then you do have a couple other renewable projects out there for approval this quarter in several states. I was just wondering if you could give a sense of your confidence level in those before the proposals that you\u2019ve put forth and what alternatives you might have if there end up being challenges in any of those?\nJulie Sloat: Yes, and actually I\u2019m trying to flip the page so we can kind of draw everyone\u2019s attention to them. Right now, I\u2019m looking at Page 32. So for example, we\u2019ve got an application open in Virginia and we made the same filing in West Virginia. For Appalachian Power Company, we\u2019re talking about 151 megawatts, about a $500 million investment for wind and storage capacity there. At this point the process is proceeding along as we would expect. So, I have nothing new to report.  So, standby there. And trying to think of where else we have open cases in Indiana, Michigan. Looks like staff has been supportive on the Michigan side, through those applications. And Indiana order is expected in 3Q, so the third quarter of this year. So stay tuned there as well. But so far constructive and productive and we\u2019re moving forward. Then of course we also have, I guess I should call out the wind out \u2013 the Wind investment Rock Falls that\u2019s included in the base case at PSO. But that\u2019s part of the base case settlement. So as you know, I just mentioned that we\u2019re well underway in that proceeding.\nDavid Arcaro: Got it. Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks so much.\nJulie Sloat: Thank you.\nOperator: And we can go to Sophie Karp with KeyBanc. Please go ahead.\nSophie Karp: Hi. Good morning and thank you for taking my questions. I have a couple of questions here. First is on the renewables, right? So clearly Texas maybe has lesser appetite for renewables at this point. And I\u2019m just curious if you how much of the incremental appetite for this do you think is left in Louisiana and like other states that picked up slack in this particular instance? Is there risk in the near term, I guess in your mind, that those states would also turn down potential future proposals because of their perception that they have? They\u2019re pretty much like full as far as renewable generation goes.\nJulie Sloat: Sophie, I appreciate that question very much, because as you know, that\u2019s been top of mind for us as we worked through that proceeding. So, we obviously got the approval for the 999 megawatts and Louisiana flexed up, so we\u2019re moving along in that regard. You may recall that we also had another process that was underway for SWEPCO in particular, I want to say it was 2,400 megawatts that we were seeking interest in as it relates to how we would put that portfolio together. And so what we\u2019ve done is, we\u2019ve actually tabled that and we\u2019ll be coming back to everyone to say, look, we want to look at this from an all source perspective, including PPAs. So stay tuned on that because there is absolutely a capacity need. It\u2019s just going to take a little different shape than what we were initially expecting as we were running that RFP process. And remember when you probably heard me saying earlier here today on the call; we need to make sure that we\u2019re listening to our regulators. And so this is exactly what we\u2019re doing as it relates to the conversation and the experience that we just had in Louisiana, Arkansas, and Texas. And so we are adjusting and moving forward. So there will be more RFPs stay tuned for that. And they will be more all source oriented, no different than what we would be doing in Texas as you call out. Yeah, it looks like not a lot of interest in renewables there right now. So we need to think about what the other alternatives are, but we will work together with our regulators so that we can make sure that we\u2019re doing what the state needs. Because at the end of the day, this is all about making sure that our customers have reliable, affordable electricity period.\nAnn Kelly: Yes. And just to reiterate on our capital plan, so far $5.2 billion of projects have already been approved and we have another $1.7 billion that, that Julie just talked about in the regulatory process that\u2019s out of our $8.6 billion. So we are well on our way and we also have flexibility with our transmission and distribution investments to fill in to the extent that anything else gets delayed a little bit in the process with these RFPs.\nSophie Karp: Great, great. Thank you. My other question was in the ROEs, maybe I\u2019m referencing Slide 34 here, my reading this right, that the 40 bps \u2013 depressed by 40 bps per mild weather is sort of average across the board. So if it wasn\u2019t for weather, all of these bubbles would be like roughly 40 bps higher or how should we think about this? There\u2019s like a lot of numbers here.\nAnn Kelly: Yes. That 40 bps is on average. Okay. So let me answer it this way though, because when I\u2019m thinking about what does this mean for the rest of the year, and as I mentioned in my opening comments, we had initially anticipated or expected on a weighted average basis. We'd be about a 9.4% ROE across our operating companies in our 2023 guidance. And so now what we're suggesting is now that we have a little bit of a hole that is associated with weather on that ROE can't make all that up, I don't think, unless we had some ridiculous weather circumstance in the back half of this year. So we're not going to bet on that because we're going to bet on normal. And so what I would expect is we expect to improve from 8.6%, it will not get to that 9.4%. So even if you get closer to 9%, I think that's reasonable. And our point that we want to make today is despite the fact that we've had pressure as a result of weather, we're adjusting the sales and we fully well expect to be within our guidance range. And so that's the important key to take away today as it relates to our messaging. Then with also the understanding behind the scenes we just need to fundamentally do our very best to make sure we're earning as close as possible to those authorized ROEs beyond the weather situation.\nSophie Karp: Got it. So just to be clear, the 8.6% is the average with the Transmission Holdco?\nJulie Sloat: Yes.\nSophie Karp: Of all distribution\u2026\nJulie Sloat: Weighted average. Yes.\nSophie Karp: Okay. Got it.\nJulie Sloat: Thank you. You bet.\nAnn Kelly: Thank you.\nOperator: And next we go to Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please go ahead.\nJulie Sloat: Hey, Paul.\nPaul Patterson: [Indiscernible] I'm managing. So just \u2013 most of my questions have been answered. Only I have a question for you that's a little bit different and that is the Chevron's defense. It looks like that know that the Supreme Court might act on it. And I'm kind of scratching my head and I was thinking what you guys might be thinking about what might happen if in fact, the Chevron doctrine or whatever you want to call it is substantially changed or were repealed or what have you. Do \u2013 have you guys thought about this or I'm sure you've thought about it, but any ideas about what you think that might mean for you guys on the ground?\nJulie Sloat: Paul, I don't have a lot of detail to share with you today. I do know that our legal team is looking into this and our strategy team. But for my day to day right now at the moment, not been top of mind I'm just taking comfort knowing that the rest of the team's working on it. But hey, if you have a conversation, I'm happy to circle back.\nPaul Patterson: Okay, sure.\nJulie Sloat: Yes.\nPaul Patterson: It was my first question, but the rest were answered, so thanks so much and I'll follow up with you guys later.\nJulie Sloat: That'd be great. Thank you.\nPaul Patterson: Okay, great. Thank you\nOperator: We'll go to Paul Fremont with Ladenburg. Please go ahead.\nPaul Fremont: Thank you very much. I guess my first question is if you were to get the securitization proceeds, does that change the equity issuance plans that you lay out on Slide 28?\nJulie Sloat: No. No, it really doesn't. So if we get the securitization proceeds, what we would do is reinvest that into the other areas within the AEP footprint. So not in APCo but in the other areas so that we're in making sure that we continue to earn on the investment while getting the benefits to the Appalachian Power customers.\nPaul Fremont: And then my second question sort of related is if you were to get incremental CapEx, what percent should we assume would be equity funded versus let's say debt funded?\nJulie Sloat: Yes, I mean I would assume just kind of the average of what we have in the current plant. Yes, Paul, we typically get, if we have an opportunity to invest more we're going to try to manage directly back to those target ratios that we throw out there and obviously be mindful of debt to cap as well. So at this point, we're focused entirely on executing on the plant that we already have out in front of you. The issue could be from time to time is how much slides from one year to the next. So you're kind of playing with the toothpaste tube, right? So you're just on passing the CapEx back and forth, because we got $40 billion that we're put into work. And again, at this point, while we always have more opportunities we need to make sure that this is affordable for our customers as well. So that's going to be another stopping point for us too because we're essentially trying to thread the needle, make sure the balance sheet stays strong, make sure those metrics are absolutely in place, but make sure that, our customers are able to afford what we're essentially providing. Our regulators definitely help us with that, but that's also precisely why we have to be really disciplined and not just continuing to spend CapEx that would be fun and nice to spend and actually absolutely make our system stronger and absolutely reliable. But is that what is necessary to keep the lights on and what customers can afford. So it is a constant balancing act for us.\nPaul Fremont: Great. Thank you very much.\nJulie Sloat: You bet. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]\nDarcy Reese: Thank you for joining us on today's call. As always, IR team will be available to answer any additional questions you may have.

            "name": "Julie Sloat",
            "content": "Thanks Darcy. Welcome everyone to American Electric Power's second quarter 2023 earnings call. Good to be with everyone this morning. It's a rapid time of change in our industry with new opportunities resulting from federal policy shifts and evolving state and customer priorities. We also continue to navigate a dynamic environment with rising interest rates and supply chain constraints. In short, it's definitely an exciting time to be at AEP as we make significant progress on our important stakeholder commitments and strategic objectives, including delivering on our 2023 operating earnings guidance and 6% to 7% annual operating earnings growth, providing dividend growth in line with earnings, strengthening our balance sheet as we move through the next few quarters, actively managing our portfolio, achieving net-zero by 2045 and central to our purpose, keeping our customer rates affordable. We recently made some organizational adjustments such as the restructuring of our Federal Affairs function, the realignment of our regulatory team, and the refreshment of some of our operating company presidents. These changes will help us to operate more effectively and facilitate our success in this ever-changing environment. As always, we keep the customer at the center of every decision we make. This is why we engage with our federal and state regulators so we know how to best support our operating companies while we balance investor preferences as we grow the business and invest $40 billion over the next five years in new generation resources and our energy delivery infrastructure. This morning, I'll provide a brief overview of our second quarter financial performance before getting into our measured and disciplined approach to simplifying and de-risking our business profile through our portfolio management activities. Related to this, I'll share some updates regarding our unregulated contracted renewables portfolio, retail and distributed resources businesses, and the status of our strategic review of our non-core transmission joint ventures. While we still have a lot of work to do on the regulatory front, I'll conclude by providing insight into the recent successes related to our renewables execution and developments on our regulatory and legislative initiatives as we keep our customers' needs top of mind. A summary of our second quarter 2023 business highlights and a high level overview of our financial results can be found on Slide 6 of today's presentation. AEP delivered second quarter 2023 operating earnings of $1.13 per share or $582 million compared to $1.20 per share or $618 million last year. The year-over-year decline reflects the timing of higher interest rates in the reversal of last year's second quarter 2022 favorable weather. Today we're pleased to reaffirm our 2023 full year operating earnings guidance range of $5.19 to $5.39 with a $5.29 midpoint and long-term earnings growth rate is 6% to 7%. Given our line of sight at this point in the year, I believe we have the operational flexibility and leverage to pool to ensure that we will deliver on our commitment. Later on, Ann's going to talk or walk through our second quarter of 2023 performance drivers and share some perspectives on our load outlook as we drive economic development within our service territory. She'll also share some details supporting our targeted 14% to 15% FFO to debt range. While our FFO to debt is 11.1% this quarter, our forecasts show material improvement in this metric as we approach year-end and we fully expect to be in our targeted range in early 2024. As we continue to execute on our strategic objectives, we remain focused on simplifying and de-risking our business profile. To that end, you'll recall that in February of this year, we announced a signed agreement with IRG Acquisition Holdings for the sale of our 1,365 megawatt unregulated renewables portfolio. A summary of the renewable sale can be found on Slide 7. In the second quarter, we received FERC 203 approval and clearance from antitrust authorities. The only remaining approval is from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., which we expect to see receive in the near-term and subsequently close on the sale in August. As we've said, the proceeds from this transaction will be directed to our core regulated businesses and strengthening of our balance sheet. Turning to Slide 8, let's touch on some other asset sales that we have in progress. In May, 2023, we also announced the sale of our New Mexico Renewable Development Solar portfolio, also known as NMRD. We are currently on track with our 50/50 joint venture partner, PNM Resources to close on this transaction by the end of 2023. The sales of our retail and distributed resources businesses are also on schedule to close in the first half of 2024 as previously announced. Please keep in mind that other than the unregulated renewables portfolio proceeds of $1.2 billion, no other sales proceeds are reflected in our five year cash flow outlook. We'll first obtain the signed sales agreements for NMRD and our retail and distributed resources businesses, and then incorporate the related proceeds into our cash flow outlook. As part of our commitment to portfolio management, I'm pleased to share some additional news with you today. We're announcing that we've completed the strategic review of two of our three non-core transmission joint ventures and have determined that the sale of AEP's interest in Prairie Wind Transmission and Pioneer Transmission as our preferred path forward. We expect to launch the sales processes soon and we'll keep you updated on our progress. In the meantime, we continue our strategic review of Transource Energy and expect to complete that review by year end. Now let's switch gears to AEP's regulated renewables execution and recent successes. Through our five year $8.6 billion regulated renewables capital plan, we now have a total of $5.2 billion approved and an additional $1.7 billion currently before our commissions for approval. You can find more detail on activities to acquire additional generation resources in the appendix on Slides 31 through 33. In May 2023, the Oklahoma Commission approved PSO's 995.5 megawatt renewables portfolio for $2.5 billion, which includes three wind and three solar projects. These projects are projected to be in service toward the end of 2025. For SWEPCO's 999 megawatt renewables portfolio totaling $2.2 billion of investments, I'm happy to report that last month, both the Arkansas and Louisiana Commissions approved the full portfolio containing two wind projects and one solar project. We expect the projects will be going into service by the 2025 timeframe. Since the Texas Commission denied SWEPCO's application related to these projects, Arkansas will move forward with the 20% of the portfolio total and Louisiana will flex up with 70% giving wholesale customers the remaining 10%. We're excited to deliver the benefits of lowest reasonable cost and reliable energy to these communities we serve in Arkansas and Louisiana. We're also currently awaiting for commission decisions expected as early as in the third quarter of 2023 for 151 megawatts of owned wind and energy storage at APCo, 469 megawatts of owned solar at I&M and 154 megawatts of owned wind at PSO. Importantly, our regulated renewables goals are aligned and supported by our integrated resources plans. Accordingly, we've issued requests for proposals for generation resources at APCo and I&M with more to come from operating companies soon. I'll turn now to updates on several of our ongoing regulatory and legislative initiatives. More detail on our regulatory activities can be found in the appendix on Slides 34 through 36. We're unquestionably focused on closing the gap between our authorized versus earned ROEs. While our second quarter ROE came in at 8.6%, this measure was depressed by 40 basis points due to mild weather. Closing this gap is going to take a little longer than we had anticipated in our 2023 guidance, which you may recall included a 9.4% ROE. But I'm confident that we'll reduce this gap by year end and still meet our earnings guidance. As we make needed progress in this regard, we are continuing to prioritize federal, state and customer preferences to meet the needs of our communities that we serve. We look forward to building on our constructive relationships with all of our stakeholders and clearing the path for our operating companies to be effective and successful in their respective service territories. In fact, while being mindful of any ex-parte restrictions, I'm personally meeting with many commissioners across AEP's footprint to engage in discussions about our company and what is top of mind for them in the way of priorities and expectations as we work together to do our best to provide this product that is the fundamental enabler for society. In June 2023, we filed a new base case in Kentucky to address the financial health of the company and established a path for future investment. The application incorporated a comprehensive rate review and a proposed 9.9% ROE with a request to allow for the securitization of $471 million of regulatory assets. This will help to ensure that Kentucky Power is best positioned to provide safe and reliable service, while managing costs to provide affordable service to our customers. We expect that the new rates will be in effect in early 2024. In May 2023, we settled PSO's base case with the commission staff, attorney general and other parties in Oklahoma providing a path for approval for more efficient cost recovery mechanisms with continuation of the transmission tracker and reestablishment of a distribution tracker. While we await commission \u2013 a commission decision expected in the third quarter of 2023, we implemented interim rates starting in early June. For APCo Virginia's 2022 \u2013 2020 to 2022 triennial filed in March of 2023. We're working through regulatory \u2013 the regulatory calendar and expect an order later this year. And Texas legislation was passed last month, which permits utilities to file the Distribution Cost Recovery Factor or DCRF twice per year instead of once per year. The bill also allows DCRF to be used by a utility even if it has a pending base case review proceeding. This important legislation will help improve AEP's regulatory lag in Texas, as we make needed distribution investments to bolster the grid in this region. AEPs management of fuel cost recovery remains a top priority with deferred fuel balance at $1.4 billion as of the second quarter 2023. We've adapted fuel cost recovery mechanisms across most of our jurisdictions with a focus on balancing customer impact. Notably, we are awaiting a decision on our fuel case in West Virginia. Through this spring we were active at the state legislature and collaborated on a new securitization bill to provide an effective path forward on fuel recovery and other legacy costs while mitigating customer bill impact. In April, 2023, \u2013 in our April, 2023 fuel recovery application, we filed two options for consideration, one which amortizes the fuel balance over three years, and alternatively, in an effort to even further minimize cost impacts to customers, we requested West Virginia Commission approval to use securitization to manage our $553 million deferred fuel balance. We also proposed an opportunity within that second option to apply the securitization mechanism to $88 million of deferred storm costs and $1.2 billion of legacy coal plant balances with the intention of offering a solution that would essentially have a neutral impact on customer rate. Keep in mind; securitization is the mechanism we can use to address affordability in West Virginia. While it's important that we addressed fuel and storm cost recovery in the state, let me be clear that the possible securitization of $1.2 billion for our Amos and Mountaineer coal plant balances is not required to hit our credit metrics, nor does it suggest that there's a change in our current plant \u2013 our current plant retirement schedule of 2040 for these units. Rather, this is entirely driven by the desire to consider all options to mitigate impact to customer bills. The West Virginia Commission subsequently issued a procedural schedule in the fuel case, including the April, 2023 prudence [ph] report, which will be addressed in an evidentiary hearing beginning on September 5. This schedule provides an opportunity to ensure focus on cost concerns and a constructive future in West Virginia balancing customer and financial impacts. Pending the commission's decision later this year, we could issue bonds to securitize a possible combination of the deferred fuel balance, deferred storm cost, and legacy coal plant balances in the first half of 2024. I'm pleased with the progress we've made so far. We still have a lot of work to do as we execute on our plans to meet our commitments, overcome challenges, reach our strategic objectives, engage with stakeholders, and keep customers a top priority. Together we deliver safe, clean, reliable, and affordable energy to our communities while creating value for our investors. With that, Ann will now walk you through our second quarter, 2023 performance drivers and details supporting our financial target. Ann? Good morning. Yes, no, Shar. I so appreciate the question. And you're right, we have a lot of opportunity to put capital to work as it relates to taking care of the customer and delivering reliable, affordable service. But as you point out, we need to make sure that we're hitting all the metrics too. So not only do you need to be real mindful of where customer rates are going, when we put money to work, I need to make sure that all my earnings growth targets are going to be hit. Because I think you guys would be upset with me if that didn't happen, so we'll make sure that happens. But I also need to make sure that my balance sheet's really strong too. So let me get to your question around asset sales. We've really been focused on, as you know, the non-core related activities that when people buy AEP shares or invest in our bonds, they're not necessarily looking to buy something that is not a traditional regulated utility type business. So to that end, that's why you see us kind of going through the paces today where we've talked about the unregulated components of our business and, while we love transmission even looking at some of these transmission investments of the joint ventures that are off our footprint, because if we can channel all of our efforts and dollars to taking care of our customers that are regulated in our footprint, that's where we want to play. So, I wouldn't anticipate, a significant additional activity coming from us for a couple of reasons. I think we're pretty cleaned up once we get some of this non-core stuff taken care of. I think we're in a good place. I think that, there may be some opportunities, on the edges, but for the most part we're \u2013 we should be in a really good space to be continuing to look at the regulated pieces of our business. But we also and very candid Shar, we don't need to engage in asset sales to make the balance sheet work. What we need to do is make sure we're being as efficient as possible, and that's another reason why I want to make sure that every dollar we do put to work is one that a, makes sense for our customers, but also is something that makes sense for our service territories. And specifically why I am calling that out is another reason why I'm out talking with folks in our community. So whether its commissioners, customers, et cetera, need to make sure that we're aligned or at least absolutely aware of one another's priorities and then we can make refinements based on those conversations. So, I would never say that we're not at all capital constraints because I think we naturally are because we put our own constraints on because we got to take care of customer rates and make sure that we're going to have a really strong balance sheet. We're working on that. As Ann just mentioned, we expect that FFO to debt to look a lot better once we get to year end and going into 2024. I think in the interim here, it's going to be just a little bumpy as we work through a couple of the next few months. So I wouldn't be too concerned about that. I feel comfortable with the numbers I'm seeing, but we'll continue to be very disciplined around, which dollars we put to work where that it's consistent with what our stakeholders need and want taking care of our customer and then just being as efficient as we can. So my focus is going to be more at this point on let's close that gap on the ROE. That's the piece that I can try to do my best to control. Yep. Thank you for the coverage. Good morning. Oh, Jeremy, I love that question. So I'm going to tell you from my perspective, this is coming from a former operating company president. So I keep that hat kind of in my back pocket that I got to throw on from time to time. And so let me start with this. What my hope to do, well I, what I hope to do or achieve is, pay [ph] the way or clear the path for our operating companies so that they can do the best they can do boots on the ground. And so my objective is to get out, to make sure that I'm talking with different commissioners. And by the way, that's already underway. So, I've already been out talking with several folks and I've got my calendar lined up over the next few months to continue to that effort. So I'm not going to get into necessarily exactly who I'm talking to when, but that, that's well underway. So rest assured that's happening. But I just, I want to make sure that they're hearing from me and that they understand that AEP, the parent or the service core is here to provide clearance and service and support for the individual operating companies. Really, that's the only reason the service core exists, is to support the operating companies. And I need them to hear that from me. And more importantly I just want to be a really good listener so that I can be really good at my job so I can take care of our customers, take care of my team, and then ultimately take care of my investors and the other stakeholders that are party to everything that we're doing here. So I don't want people to think that I'm stepping in the way or thinking that something's not right because that's not the case at all. I just want to make sure that we're doing everything we can to support the teams so that they can be as successful as they possibly can be. Because here's the other point, right. You call out the fact that there are pressure points as it relates to regulatory activities. I think that's going to be what we're dealing with for the next several years. We got a lot of headwinds now. The game's changed, the industry's going through a material transition. Each of our states is in a different place as it relates to their economies. And so I think everybody is doing their jobs and that means we got to do ours too. We have been doing it, but we have to be really good listeners and learners and adjusters. And I think that goes for all the different stakeholders. So the more dialogue we can have, I think the smarter we're going to be and if nothing else that will \u2013 we only be able to take care of the customer and make sure we're keeping the lights on and delivering this product that make life possible. But I think we're going to be doing it in a much more effective way, and we're going to have to pick up the pace too. So we got to do it in a faster way than we've ever done it in our history. So I think it's exciting. I love getting out and talking with people. You guys know from The Street, I love getting out and talking with you too, so that's not going to stop. So I just got to work my calendar and I'll be out front and I'm happy to talk about any of the conversations that I've had. Yes, I'll tell you, let me start with this. Again, having been a former CFO as well. At 1.6% ROE, yes, we got to work on that. And that to me, when I see that number that's not a financially healthy, sustainably healthy entity so that's why we're going through the case activities. So we're going to work on that and that's exactly why we went out and socialized the case well in advance with dozens of meetings with a variety of different stakeholders. So again, listening and learning so we understand where everybody's kind of shaken out, but also understanding what it is that we need to do so that we're successful, not only in taking care of our customers, but making sure we're doing everything we can to make sure that the stakeholders understand what our objectives are and are comfortable with it. So yes, the objective is to, A, get a plan in place that will allow us to improve the financial positioning of the company, which then enables us to make future investments to take care of the customers, they need the power too. It doesn't matter which state you're sitting in, but the idea is to engage in these activities, hopefully have a really good case. And I don't expect it to be easy. It's not supposed to be easy. If it was easy, everybody would be doing it. So we'll engage in those activities and hopefully get us on a path forward that enables us to continue to invest in a really smart way in the state that everybody can feel good about. We, absolutely and so those are the conversations that we're having. We do know that transmission has been very important to the commission. And so that is top of mind for us as well. And we've worked that into the structures that we've essentially set forth in our case. But at the end of the day, it's the distribution that also matters because we got to keep the lights on. You bet. Thank you. You bet. Yes, I mean, I would say we're going to be, we say we're going to be in the target in 2024 and I think approaching the midpoint probably by the end of 2024. There are the fluctuations as I mentioned in FFO that we're experiencing. And that's just really due to timing of quarter-over-quarter fund flows. And so, you will see especially in 2023 that it will be press till the fourth quarter when we really see that switch in the collateral collections and improving our FFO there, so that's what's going to take some time. But we do expect it to increase, like I said, materially by the fourth quarter and then into next year. And Anthony, just to put a little finer point on it too, remember, our threshold that we're sensitive to is 13% as it relates to our Baa2 rating from Moody's. And so that's why we toggle to the 14% to 15% because what we want to have is cushion. So 14% definitely gives us some cushion, so keep that in mind as well. And the other thing I mentioned in my comments too is as we proceed through the rest of this year, you can expect maybe a little more pressure as we go through the next couple of months with some improvement as we get to the fourth quarter. Just want to manage those expectations. Yes, Anthony, it's going to take a while. Do not expect a flash cut. And so remember in our case, we requested a 9.9% ROE, our current authorized is 9.3%. I'm looking at Page number 34 in the slide deck right now. It will be a walk. So that's something we're trying to manage our own expectations around as well as for you all, as you work to model. So stay tuned and let this case proceed and see how things move along and then we can continue to kind of dial that in and give you more direct guidance. You bet. Thanks for being on the call. And Julien, on that note, just to kind of put an end cap on this. I think the core is solid. And so when you look out in the next few years, as Ann mentioned, we got $40 billion we're put into work in terms of capital investment over the next five years. We'll continue to work with our regulators to make sure that we're deploying the dollars where we all agree that they need to go. And then at that point it's really around making sure that we also execute on not only the regulatory plans that we lay out there, but as you know, we've got some strategic asset sales that are underway. So we'll deal with the fact that some of those businesses are falling away, rechanneling those dollars to the regulated pieces of the business that will help us from the math perspective and making sure that we're hitting all of those other balance sheet metrics that we need to make sure that we hit, so people aren't worried or concerned. And we got a little more flexibility. So when we have a weather event or something of that nature, we can easily sustain that. But the core is solid and at this point it's around being efficient, putting the dollars to work where it makes sense and closing the gap on the ROEs. Yes. So we implemented interim rates in early June I think it was, as it relates to the settlement that we had put in place. And at this point, as you mentioned, the ALJ had its report that it is submitted and then file \u2013 exceptions were filed, I think it was yesterday to the ALJ report. So if you haven't taken a look at that I would encourage you to take a look at that. But effectively the parties to the settlement agreement were absolutely supportive of the settlement agreement, which we would've expected anyway. So we felt good about that. And we're going to let this thing play out over the next couple of weeks really, because we're getting pretty close here. Parties have four days to response the exceptions that were filed. And that is effectively August 1st. And then we will have an oral argument of the exceptions that's scheduled for mid-August and we would expect to get an order in September. So stay tuned. The process is working and like I mentioned, we've got inter rate \u2013 interim rates in effect. And we will keep you apprised, but do go take a look at the exceptions. I thought that was interesting. Excellent. Thanks, Julien. Good morning. Yes, absolutely. Yes. So we did file for rehearing, because we need to make sure that we're doing all we need to do from a traditional regulatory and administrative perspective. And then what you can anticipate AEP doing is essentially running another RFP and running another process so that we can make sure that we're doing what we need to accommodate the capacity situation in Texas. I do believe that Texas understands there is an adequacy issue that we would otherwise have to deal with. So that's something that we will be proceeding forward with. So standby and you'll see what we come to the street with here in the not too distant future. Yes, that's a possibility. That's a possibility. But what we would do is, accommodate any type of investment in the current CapEx forecast. Yes, and actually I'm trying to flip the page so we can kind of draw everyone's attention to them. Right now, I'm looking at Page 32. So for example, we've got an application open in Virginia and we made the same filing in West Virginia. For Appalachian Power Company, we're talking about 151 megawatts, about a $500 million investment for wind and storage capacity there. At this point the process is proceeding along as we would expect. So, I have nothing new to report.  So, standby there. And trying to think of where else we have open cases in Indiana, Michigan. Looks like staff has been supportive on the Michigan side, through those applications. And Indiana order is expected in 3Q, so the third quarter of this year. So stay tuned there as well. But so far constructive and productive and we're moving forward. Then of course we also have, I guess I should call out the wind out \u2013 the Wind investment Rock Falls that's included in the base case at PSO. But that's part of the base case settlement. So as you know, I just mentioned that we're well underway in that proceeding. Thank you. Sophie, I appreciate that question very much, because as you know, that's been top of mind for us as we worked through that proceeding. So, we obviously got the approval for the 999 megawatts and Louisiana flexed up, so we're moving along in that regard. You may recall that we also had another process that was underway for SWEPCO in particular, I want to say it was 2,400 megawatts that we were seeking interest in as it relates to how we would put that portfolio together. And so what we've done is, we've actually tabled that and we'll be coming back to everyone to say, look, we want to look at this from an all source perspective, including PPAs. So stay tuned on that because there is absolutely a capacity need. It's just going to take a little different shape than what we were initially expecting as we were running that RFP process. And remember when you probably heard me saying earlier here today on the call; we need to make sure that we're listening to our regulators. And so this is exactly what we're doing as it relates to the conversation and the experience that we just had in Louisiana, Arkansas, and Texas. And so we are adjusting and moving forward. So there will be more RFPs stay tuned for that. And they will be more all source oriented, no different than what we would be doing in Texas as you call out. Yeah, it looks like not a lot of interest in renewables there right now. So we need to think about what the other alternatives are, but we will work together with our regulators so that we can make sure that we're doing what the state needs. Because at the end of the day, this is all about making sure that our customers have reliable, affordable electricity period. Yes. Weighted average. Yes. Thank you. You bet. Hey, Paul. Paul, I don't have a lot of detail to share with you today. I do know that our legal team is looking into this and our strategy team. But for my day to day right now at the moment, not been top of mind I'm just taking comfort knowing that the rest of the team's working on it. But hey, if you have a conversation, I'm happy to circle back. Yes. That'd be great. Thank you. No. No, it really doesn't. So if we get the securitization proceeds, what we would do is reinvest that into the other areas within the AEP footprint. So not in APCo but in the other areas so that we're in making sure that we continue to earn on the investment while getting the benefits to the Appalachian Power customers. Yes, I mean I would assume just kind of the average of what we have in the current plant. Yes, Paul, we typically get, if we have an opportunity to invest more we're going to try to manage directly back to those target ratios that we throw out there and obviously be mindful of debt to cap as well. So at this point, we're focused entirely on executing on the plant that we already have out in front of you. The issue could be from time to time is how much slides from one year to the next. So you're kind of playing with the toothpaste tube, right? So you're just on passing the CapEx back and forth, because we got $40 billion that we're put into work. And again, at this point, while we always have more opportunities we need to make sure that this is affordable for our customers as well. So that's going to be another stopping point for us too because we're essentially trying to thread the needle, make sure the balance sheet stays strong, make sure those metrics are absolutely in place, but make sure that, our customers are able to afford what we're essentially providing. Our regulators definitely help us with that, but that's also precisely why we have to be really disciplined and not just continuing to spend CapEx that would be fun and nice to spend and actually absolutely make our system stronger and absolutely reliable. But is that what is necessary to keep the lights on and what customers can afford. So it is a constant balancing act for us. You bet. Thank you."

            "name": "Ann Kelly",
            "content": "Thank you, Julie and Darcy. It's good to be with you all this morning. Thanks for dialing in. I'm going to walk us through our second quarter and year-to-date results, share some updates on our service territory load and finish with commentary on credit metrics and liquidity, as well as some thoughts on our guidance, financial targets and portfolio management activities underway. Let's go to Slide 9, which shows the comparison of GAAP to operating earnings. GAAP earnings for the second quarter were a $1.01 per share compared to a $1.02 per share in 2022. Year-to-date GAAP earnings through June, were a $1.78 per share compared to $2.43 per share in 2022. In our year-to-date comparison of GAAP to operating earnings, we've reflected the expected loss on the sale of the contracted renewables business as a non-operating cost, as well as an adjustment true of cost related to the terminated Kentucky transaction in addition to our typical mark-to-market adjustment. Also due to new legislation in Texas allowing the recovery of incentive compensation, favorable entry was booked in the second quarter to capitalize previously incurred costs, which was almost entirely reflected as non-operating earnings. There is a detailed reconciliation of GAAP to operating earnings on Pages 16 and 17 of the presentation today. Let's walk through our quarterly operating earnings performance by segment on Slide 10. Operating earnings for the second quarter totaled $1.13 per share or $582 million compared to a $1.20 per share, or $618 million in 2022. The lower performance compared to last year was primarily driven by weather, interest and O&M, partially offset by rate increases in our utility and transmission revenue growth in both our Utilities and the Transmission Holding Company segment. The unfavorable weather was largely due to positive weather we saw in the second quarter of 2022, while weather was mild begin in the second quarter of 2023; the unfavorable impact was less significant in comparison to the first quarter of this year. Interest continues to be unfavorable versus the prior year, and that is primarily driven by higher debt balances as well as the higher interest rates. The higher debt balance also has resulted in an increase in interest expense as compared to our guidance, but we continue to adjust in other areas to offset this impact. Again, we were expecting this variance to be more pronounced in the first half of 2023 as interest rates somewhat stabilized. We also expect the announced sale of our contracted renewables business to close this quarter and the conversion of the $850 million equity units in August to lessen the burden in the second half of the year. Finally, I'd like to note as well that we still expect to see favorable O&M in the second half of the year compared to the prior year, reflecting the timing of O&M spending and near term actions that we are taking to help offset the unfavorable weather, such as holding positions open, reducing travel, and adjusting the timing and of discretionary spending. These actions are in addition to our ongoing efficiency efforts that we target to offset the impact of inflation each year. Operating earnings for our vertically integrated utilities were $0.51 per share, down $0.08. Favorable drivers included rate changes across multiple jurisdictions, depreciation and off-system sales. These items were more than offset by the unfavorable weather interest expense, O&M and lower retail and wholesale load. I will touch on our retail load trends in a couple minutes. Consistent with our first quarter results, depreciation is favorable at the vertically integrated utility segment, primarily due to the expiration of the Rockport Unit 2 lease in December of 2022. I&M should continue to see about $0.055 net favorable depreciation in each of the first three quarters of 2023, plus an additional $0.035 in Q4. Including the impact of the Rockport lease, depreciation was $0.04 favorable in Q2. However, if we exclude the impact of the lease, depreciation would've been about $0.02 unfavorable, which is consistent with the incremental investment in this segment. I also want to mention that the favorable off system sales showing up again in the second quarter is due to the fact that Rockport Unit 2 margins are no longer shared with our retail customers. The Transmission and Distribution Utilities segment earned $0.30 per share, down $0.02 compared to last year. Favorable drivers in this segment including transmission revenue and rate changes largely due to the distribution investment rider in Ohio and the distribution cost recovery factor rider in Texas. Offsetting these favorable items were unfavorable weather, lower retail load, depreciation, O&M and interest. The AEP Transmission Holdco segment contributed $0.38 per share up $0.11 compared to last year. The main drivers here included favorable investment growth and a favorable year-over-year change in the true-up. You'll recall that we had a negative true-up in 2022.  Generation & Marketing produced $0.13 per share down $0.05 from last year. The negative variance is primarily due to the development asset sale and other one-time favorable items in 2022 as well as higher interest expense in 2023. These unfavorable items were partially offset by higher retail power margins in 2023. Finally, corporate and other was down $0.03 per share, driven primarily by higher interest expense and O&M. These unfavorable items are partially offset by a favorable change in investment gain and income taxes. The favorable change in investment gain is primarily due to investment loss incurred in the second quarter of 2022. Before we move on to the next slide, to give an update on load, I want to briefly mention that the details of our year-to-date operating earnings performance will be shown in the appendix of supplemental information going forward. You can find these details on Slide 15 of the presentation today. Turning to Slide 11. I'll provide an update on our normalized load performance for the quarter. Overall load continues to come in ahead of budget, but we're closely monitoring key components of our retail sales in the context of the slowing economy, and we are seeing different trends between our retail customer classes. As we discussed last quarter, our projections already assume that economic conditions will slow in the second half of the year. Recent positive economic data on inflation supports that any slowdown will be in line with our previous expectations. Beginning in the upper left hand quadrant of the slide, we see a slowing in our residential load compared to a year ago. Our residential customer counts continue to grow, but we are seeing usage decline as many of our customers return to the office and even more squeezed by the relationship between inflation and income growth. That relationship is a key driver of residential usage and we expect to see it stabilize in the second half of the year. This month's CPI data point was an encouraging sign that inflationary pressures on our residential customers are continuing to lessen into the fall. Moving to the lower left hand quadrant of the slide, we can see a noticeable slowing in the industrial class. So still ahead of year end budget projections, industrial load is beginning to reflect the expected slowdown in the outlook for manufacturing across the country. This slowing has been broad based across industries and operating companies, but would've been even worse without an our ongoing commitment to economic development. We estimate that total industrial load through the quarter would've actually declined by 1.2% if not for growth tied to our economic development efforts. Even with these efforts, however, we do expect industrial load growth to remain subdued due to the tighter financial conditions and slowing levels of demand for finished goods through the end of the year. Offsetting this slowing is a significant boost to our normalized commercial sales that you can see in the upper right corner driven by new large customer volumes from our ongoing economic development efforts. Year-to-date commercial load has grown almost 8% year-over-year in each of the last two quarters. We expect our commercial load to continue to outperform through the end of the year. Thanks to ongoing technology development across our operating footprint. Gains in AEP Texas and AEP Ohio should continue to be especially robust with several new projects scheduled to come online through the end of the year. With the June CPI data, we've now seen a material deceleration in key components of inflation that the economy has been waiting to see. We think this progress on inflation coupled with continued resilience in the labor market dramatically reduces the probability of a severe economic contraction in 2023. Our near and long-term load projections are bolstered by our discipline commitment to economic development across the service area. We know that working with local stakeholders to attract more economic activity is a key strategy to providing value to our customers. This allows us to continue to prioritize investments that will improve customer experience while mitigating the rate impact on our customer base.  Great examples of our recent successes are NL and Tulsa and GM and Samsung in Indiana. Both of these economic development wins will not only add load to our industrial segment, but each is also expected to bring more than a 1,000 full-time jobs that will ultimately benefit our residential segment and boost the local economy. Let's move on to Slide 12 to discuss the company's capitalization and liquidity position. Taking a look at the upper left quadrant in the page, you can see our FFO to debt metric stands at 11.1%, which is a decrease of 30 basis points from last quarter and continues to be below our target. The primary reason for this decrease is a $1.3 billion increase in debt during the quarter, partially due to long-term debt issuances at the operating company level to support our capital investments and the return of mark-to-market collateral positions associated with decline in natural gas and power prices. Return of collateral reduces our funds from operations, so hits us on both sides of the equation without the fluctuations in our mark-to-market collateral positions over the past 12 months and some remaining impact of deferred fuel, our FFO to debt metric will be closer to 13.7%. We expect that this metric will improve by year end as we reduce debt after the close of the announced renewable sale and our 2020 equity unit conversion and we see the improvement in funds from operations over prior year in the fourth quarter. We remain committed to our targeted FFO to debt range of 14% to 15% and we expect material improvement by the end of 2023 and to achieve our target in early 2024. You can see our liquidity summary in the lower left quadrant of the slide. Our five-year $4 billion bank revolver and two-year $1 billion revolving credit facility support our liquidity position, which remains strong at $3.1 billion.  On a GAAP basis, our debt-to-capital ratio increased from the prior quarter by 50 basis points to 64.6%. We plan to reduce this percentage in the third quarter as we eliminate debt when we close our announced contracted renewable sale transaction and complete our previously planned equity unit conversion. On the qualified pension front, our funding status increased during the quarter to 102.2%. The funded status improved due to rising rates during the quarter that decrease the liability while solid equity returns positively impacted plan access. Let's go to Slide 13 for a quick recap of today's message. The unfavorable change in weather primarily due to positive effects in the second quarter of 2022 is a significant driver in our quarter-over-quarter earnings comparison. If we removed this effect, we would've been $0.05 favorable compared to the prior year and our results were roughly in line with our expectations for the company as a whole. I will note from a year-to-date perspective 2023 weather has been the most mild on record for the AEP system in the past 30 years, resulting in $0.29 EPS impacts year-over-year and about $0.20 versus normal weather. So as we progress through the remainder of the year, we will continue to focus on taking action to mitigate this and other headwinds. Overall, our business remains in a strong position and we are reaffirming our operating earnings guidance of $5.19 to $5.39 per share. We also continue to be committed to our long-term growth rate of 6% to 7%. As Julie previously addressed, we are on track to close the sale of our unregulated contracted renewables portfolio in the third quarter this year, and our retail and distributed resources business in the first half of 2024. We've concluded that the sale of our interest in two of our transmission joint ventures, Prairie Wind Transmission and Pioneer Transmission is our preferred path, and we continue a strategic review of our Transource Energy joint venture. These initiatives will help simplify and de-risk our business going forward. We really appreciate your time and attention today and with that and going to ask Brad to open the call, that we can hear what's on your mind and answer any questions that you have. Yes. Shar, I'll take that. As we mentioned, the main impact to our FFO to debt is the timing of the collateral payment. So that's about a 240 basis point impact to our FFO to debt, and so that should resolve itself by year end and result in a noticeable improvement. We also have about a 100 basis points of favorable impact from the proceeds of the contracted renewable sale and the equity unit conversion. So we are, confident that we are going to have measure improvement by the end of the year and be into the range by next year. In our forecast we don't have any of the securitization in our cash flows. We do have recovery of deferred fuel, but that is not necessary to be able to get into our current range. Yes, absolutely. Thanks for the question. So it has inched up, as you can see on the graph. I mean, 60% is our sweet spot and that's what we're targeting going forward. As you can see, we're above that right now. We do expect that to decrease with the contracted renewable sale proceeds and also the equity unit conversion. So that's a couple hundred basis points, that'll reduce that closer to the 60%, but we still have some work to do. Yes. The other thing just to highlight is that, we're talking a lot about the timing of collateral payments, but 80% of that volatility that we're seeing relates to our retail business, which as you know, is for sale. So once we sell that business, we would expect that reduction in volatility going forward. Yes. I mean, what I'll do is I'll start with kind of addressing the 2023 earnings guidance question. As you look, we're $0.18 below prior year and we guided to year-over-year for the full year it's about $0.20 improvement. So that's $0.38 that we need to outperform last year for the second half of the year. When I look at this, I think it's helpful to break it down into components. So weather was $0.29 over 2022, about $0.20 of that impact is versus normal. And that's where we've taken some action to offset those headwinds. Interest also is about $0.29 unfavorable year-to-date. It's running a bit above expectations. We had guided to $0.20, but that also didn't include interest on Kentucky, because we had expected to sell the business. So that's about $0.10 per year and that's covered in revenue. So we had anticipated much of our year-over-year increase to be in the first half of the year because of the timing of the Fed actions. So while we are a little bit short coming into the back half of the year, we also have the proceeds from the contracted renewable sale and equity unit conversion that'll help reduce our debt somewhat. And we've taken other actions to offset the increase in rates because it has been \u2013 the Fed has been tightening a little bit longer. When you look at O&M, unfavorable to last year in the first half, but we expect this to reverse due to timing of our O&M spending. Our original guidance planned for reduction of O&M during the second half of the year because last year's spending was a little bit robust on the O&M side in the back half. And so we had already anticipated a reduction and then we've taken additional actions like those that I've mentioned to be able to make up for the reduction in weather volumes. And then lastly, there's a couple other things that we're pointing to. One is the favorable trends in commercial load that we expect to continue. And then we've also seen favorable results in our generation and marketing business that'll benefit us this year. So, putting that all together that what give us the confidence and our ability to meet our earnings guidance for this year. In terms of maintaining the 6% to 7% EPS growth going forward, it's really a story on our capital deployment and we have a very robust capital pipeline that allows us to do just that. Yes. And just to reiterate on our capital plan, so far $5.2 billion of projects have already been approved and we have another $1.7 billion that, that Julie just talked about in the regulatory process that's out of our $8.6 billion. So we are well on our way and we also have flexibility with our transmission and distribution investments to fill in to the extent that anything else gets delayed a little bit in the process with these RFPs. Yes. That 40 bps is on average. Okay. So let me answer it this way though, because when I'm thinking about what does this mean for the rest of the year, and as I mentioned in my opening comments, we had initially anticipated or expected on a weighted average basis. We'd be about a 9.4% ROE across our operating companies in our 2023 guidance. And so now what we're suggesting is now that we have a little bit of a hole that is associated with weather on that ROE can't make all that up, I don't think, unless we had some ridiculous weather circumstance in the back half of this year. So we're not going to bet on that because we're going to bet on normal. And so what I would expect is we expect to improve from 8.6%, it will not get to that 9.4%. So even if you get closer to 9%, I think that's reasonable. And our point that we want to make today is despite the fact that we've had pressure as a result of weather, we're adjusting the sales and we fully well expect to be within our guidance range. And so that's the important key to take away today as it relates to our messaging. Then with also the understanding behind the scenes we just need to fundamentally do our very best to make sure we're earning as close as possible to those authorized ROEs beyond the weather situation. Thank you."

At this time, your telephone lines are in a listen-only mode. Later, there will be an opportunity for questions and answers. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, your call today is being recorded. I'll now turn the conference call over to your host, Vice President of Investor Relations, Darcy Reese. Please go ahead.\nDarcy Reese: Thank you, Alan. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the first quarter 2023 earnings call for American Electric Power. We appreciate you taking time today to join us. Our earnings release, presentation slides and related financial information are available on our website at aep.com. Today, we will be making forward-looking statements during the call. There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements. Please refer to our SEC filings for a discussion of these factors. Joining me this morning for opening remarks are Julie Sloat, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Ann Kelly, our Chief Financial Officer. We will take your questions following their remarks. I will now turn the call over to Julie.\nJulie Sloat: Thanks, Darcy. Welcome everyone to AEP's first quarter 2023 earnings call. It's good to be with everyone this morning. Our direction and strategy remain on track with an emphasis on our generation fleet transformation and continued investment in our energy delivery infrastructure, which is all embedded and our five-year $40 billion capital plan. I'll start with an overview of our financial performance for the first quarter before discussing our Kentucky operations following the termination of our transaction with Liberty. I'll then provide some updates on our unregulated contracted renewable sale, retail business review and other strategic plans before closing with some insight into our progress on the regulatory and legislative front as we work to implement important new initiatives to ensure our customers and communities' needs are met and continue to come first, which you know enables us to deliver on our financial stakeholder commitments as well. A summary of our first quarter 2023 business highlights can be found on Slide 6 of today's presentation. We have a long-standing history of consistently delivering on our strategic objectives, and we're pleased to share that this quarter is no different. Turning to a high-level overview of our financial results. I can tell you that AEP delivered first quarter 2023 operating earnings of $1.11 per share, or $572 million. Weather this quarter ranked as one of the mildest in the past 30 years resulting in an unfavorable impact of first quarter results. Despite this, our thoughtful and disciplined approach to managing the business enables us to reaffirm our 2023 full year operating guidance range of $5.19 per share to $5.39 per share, and with a $5.29 per share mid -- $5.29 per share midpoint and long-term earnings growth rate of -- growth rate range of 6% to 7%. We're confident in the built-in flexibility we have in our business to ensure that we successfully deliver on our financial commitments and continue AEP's strong track-record of financial performance. We're also pleased to report that AEP has experienced minimal financial and operational supply chain impacts to-date, primarily due to our successful efforts to diversify our mix of suppliers and increase our order quantities to minimize the impact on our robust capital investment plan. Ann I'll walk through our first quarter performance drivers and share some perspective on our positive load outlook, as we continue to drive our economic development and service territory expansion. She'll also review the drivers to support our targeted 14% to 15% FFO to debt range. While our FFO to debt is at 11.4% this quarter, I am confident this metric will improve materially by year-end. As I mentioned to you on last quarter's call, simplifying and derisking our business profile is one of our top strategic priorities. By actively managing our portfolio and demonstrating a clear commitment to a disciplined execution of initiatives and transactions, we continue to deliver significant benefits to our stakeholders. Actively managing our portfolio also means staying flexible and being ready to change our focus and adapt our strategy when it becomes clear that certain transactions or initiatives may no longer be viable. A few weeks ago, our team was faced with this very challenge. On April 17, we announced the termination of the sale of our Kentucky operations to Liberty. Ensuring the best outcome for stakeholders remains our top priority and we took a disciplined approach to evaluating the continued pursuit of a sale and what that would mean in terms of economics, regulatory expectations, timing uncertainty. We ultimately determined that the better outcome was to terminate the pending sale transaction and to continue our work to develop a clear strategy for our Kentucky operations. I'm thankful for the team's ability to react and adapt to shifting circumstances for the long-term benefit of our customers, employees and investors. After the termination of the sale, AEP met with the Kentucky commissioners and key stakeholders. We discussed Kentucky Power's future and the collaboration needed so that we may continue to serve our customers in a reliable manner while ensuring the financial health and discipline of Kentucky Power moving forward. In the near term, we're renewing our focus on the region and support -- and our support of the communities we serve. You'll see in the earnings call materials today that Kentucky Power's earned ROE for the 12-month period ending the first quarter of 2023 is 2.9%. This does not reflect a financially healthy utility, which needs to be resolved in consideration of the interest of all stakeholders. The underperformance is due in part to a number of unique issues that are and will be addressed for improvement over the course of the next year. As we think about the opportunities ahead for our Kentucky operations, the actions we will be engaged and include a refocus on economic development, enhanced local system reliability, and controlling customer cost. We plan to file a base case in Kentucky in June with an expected six-month commission approval process, with new rates taking effect in January 2024. Other factors that will be beneficial in improving the financial profile and performance include using securitization to recover deferred storm costs and legacy generating plant balances and rightsizing the rate base. While we pivot in Kentucky, we're focused on the successful execution of other key transactions. In February 2023, we announced an agreement with IRG Acquisition Holdings for the sale of our 1,360-megawatt unregulated renewables portfolio. A summary of the renewable sale can be found on Slide 7. All regulatory filings were made in March, and at this time, we're waiting on approval from FERC under section 203 and clearance from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States and Euro Antitrust. We already have cleared Hart-Scott-Rodino approval and China Antitrust. Consistent with our prior messaging, we expect the sale to close near the end of our second quarter 2023 depending on the timing of regulatory approvals. The proceeds from the transaction will be directed to our regulated businesses as we transform our generation fleet and enhance the electric delivery infrastructure. Furthering our commitment to simplify and derisk the company, and summarized on Slide 8, we've agreed with our joint venture partner PNM Resources to sell our portfolio of operating and developing solar projects in New Mexico. This 50/50 partnership is known as New Mexico Renewable Development, or NMRD. And we hold this within our unregulated operations portfolio, AEP. NMRD owns eight operating solar projects totaling 135 megawatts, 150 megawatt project currently under construction and six development projects totaling 440 megawatts. Last week, an adviser was selected to move forward with the sale process. We anticipate making a sale announcement early in the fourth quarter of this year and will target closing by the end of 2023, subject to timing of regulatory approvals. We also have some news to share with you today. As you know, in October 2022, we announced the strategic review of our AEP Energy retail business, which primarily operates in the PJM markets. We've completed that strategic review and decided that we will start a sales process for that business and will also fold into the process AEP OnSite Partners, which is our unregulated distributed resources business. We've hired an advisor to move forward, and we'll keep you updated on the progress. We expect to launch the sale process sometime this summer, and we'll update you with the details along the way, but currently expect the completion of this transaction in the first half of 2024. We're focused on our core regulated utility operations and continue to evaluate all value additive potential activities to enhance their performance and look for opportunities to recycle capital. As a consequence of this effort, we've decided to pursue a strategic review of three of our non-core transmission joint venture businesses, including AEP's interest in Prairie Wind Transmission, Pioneer Transmission, Transource Energy. These businesses total approximately $551 million in net plant investment for AEP and consists of 370 line miles and four substations of in-service assets, as well as various projects under development in PJM and SPP. We'll definitely keep you posted on our -- or updated on our progress, but we expect to complete our review by the end of 2023 with a conclusion that consists of remaining in or divesting some or all of the businesses. So, let's switch gears and talk about AEP's regulated renewables execution. I'm pleased to share that we continue to make significant progress on our transition to a clean energy economy that provides more stable and predictable cost to our customers. Through our five-year, $8.6 billion regulated renewables capital plan, we have a total of $6.7 billion approved or before our commissions. Most recently, in March to be specific, we made regulatory filings for $1 billion of investment at INM, representing 469 megawatts of solar energy and another 151 megawatts of owned, wind, storage at owned and -- owned, wind and storage at APCo for $466 million. Public Service of Oklahoma Company along with other parties filed a settlement in early April of 2023 in the fuel-free power plan case, which relates to PSO's 995.5-megawatt solar and wind portfolio for $2.5 billion. Like, in any other negotiation, this settlement we focused on the assurance of customer benefits without undue risk to the company. In this case, the settlement provided crucial capacity without fuel expense that'll help address PSO's large capacity need. The case took a positive step forward last week when the judge issued a preliminary opinion approving the settlement on April 27, and the commission has a case on its agenda for today, May 4. For SWEPCO's 999-megawatt renewables project, which represents a $2.2 billion investment, parties recently filed an Arkansas settlement in January for these owned, wind and solar resources. In another positive development in Texas, the administrative law judge that oversaw the evidentiary hearing issued the preliminary order which recommended project approval. And in Louisiana, we reached the settlement, however, we were disappointed that the Louisiana Commission did not approve the settlement on April 26, but we remain optimistic that the matter will be reconsidered at the next meeting this month. We look forward to the continued consideration in Louisiana and orders coming in Arkansas and Texas in the second quarter. It's important to note that our regulated renewables goals are aligned and supported by our integrated resource plans, focused on reliability and customer affordability. In accordance with these plans, we have requests for proposals issued or preparing to be issued for additional resources at each of our vertically integrated utilities. We plan to make related regulatory filings over the next year while taking into consideration commission preferences from previous RFP processes. Now, let me provide an update on several of our ongoing regular and legislative initiatives. We're focused on reducing our authorized versus ROE gap. Have some work to do on that as our ROE was at 8.8% this quarter, driven in part by the unfavorable weather conditions that I mentioned earlier. On the effort to close the gap, I am happy to report that we reached the settlement and gained commission approval in January 23 -- 2023 that closed out our SWEPCO Louisiana base case. A key to this case was the ability to reset rates and recover costs under a formula rate plan. And we have already put this into action as we filed under this provision last month. Similarly, in April, AEP filed a formula rate review in Arkansas, which was authorized by that commission in the last base case. As we advanced through 2023, the team is actively pursuing rider recovery of the 88 megawatts of the Turk plant not currently in Arkansas rates. And the current base case in Oklahoma is set for hearing on May 9. So, we're making progress on the regulatory front. We also worked closely with our stakeholders on the legislative front in Virginia to improve the former triennial rate case process. The new biennial rate process became law in April after active -- after an active legislative session, APCo filed its last triennial in March of 2023 for the 2020 through 2022 period. The new law will require APCo to file its first biennial in 2024 with the biennial continuing in subsequent two-year period. So, it's going to work like this. The pending triennial will put rates in place for 2024 while we litigate the biennial in 2024 for rates effective in 2025, and we can help you with your modeling needs once we get a little further down the line here. Pivoting to our fuel cost recovery efforts for a minute. Our management of fuel cost recovery is a top priority for us with our total deferred fuel balance at $1.6 billion as of our first quarter. We adapted our fuel cost recovery across all of our jurisdictions with a focus on balancing customer impacts. In Texas, the commission approved the $83 million special fuel surcharge filed in October of 2022 and was being recovered subject to review since February 2023. So, making progress there. We are aware of the staff prudence filing last Friday, April 28 in West Virginia that recommended a disallowance of certain fuel costs. The recommendation was rooted in the commission's prior reference to a 69% capacity factor at our coal facilities. Prudence review is a report produced by an outside consulting firm hired by the staff. The report relies on factors beyond AEP's control and takes issue with some of the practices taken to ensure that our power plants would have fuel available to provide electricity during the peak winter period. Those in the area are very familiar with how the historic swing of fuel cost over the past two years placed extreme pressure on the system and fuel recovery mechanisms. We advocated for the securitization legislation that recently passed in West Virginia knowing it provided an effective path to deal with those issues. In line with this strategy, APCo made a filing on April 28 seeking West Virginia Commission approval to utilize the new securitization tool to pay off the $553 million deferred fuel balance as February 28, 2023. The filing also proposes to apply the mechanism to certain storm costs and legacy coal costs in a manner that minimizes cost impacts to customers while still addressing these historical costs. Related to the consultant's prudence recommendation, the new APCo filing also lays out the environment APCo was operating in over this volatile fuel time or time in fuel cost and the actions taken to ensure coal would be available on the most extreme days on the system. Our plan is to collaborate with the commission to address customer and deferred fuel concerns together for constructive path forward in West Virginia. After receiving the commission approval, the plan would be to issue bonds to securitize a combination of deferred fuel balance, deferred storm costs, and legacy coal plan balances in the amount of $1.84 billion in the first half 2024. So, wrapping it up, I'm pleased with the progress we're making, capitalizing on our momentum from 2022. We continue to deliver on our commitments and execute against our strategic objectives. We're taking a thoughtful and disciplined approach to simplify and derisk our business and investments we make to support our positive earnings growth and outlook. I proudly lead a team whose experience and expertise have made it possible for AEP to lay new groundwork for future success while also responding and adapting to the rapid changes we're seeing in our industry. Together, we're delivering safe, clean, affordable, and reliable energy to our customers and communities, all while creating values for our investors. With that, Ann -- I will ask her to now walk through the first quarter performance drivers and provide us with some details on our financing targets. So to you, Ann.\nAnn Kelly: Thank you, Julie and Darcy. It's good to be with you all this morning, and thanks for dialing in. I'm going to walk us through our first quarter results, share some updates on our service territory load and finish with commentary on credit metrics and liquidity, as well as some thoughts on our guidance, financial targets, and portfolio management. Let's go to Slide 9, which shows the comparison of GAAP to operating earnings for the quarter. GAAP earnings for the first quarter were $0.77 per share compared to $1.41 per share in 2022. For the quarter, I'll mention that we reflected the loss on the expected sale of the contracted renewables business as a non-operating cost, as well as an adjustment to true-up expected cost related to the Kentucky transaction in addition to our typical mark-to-market adjustment. There's a detailed reconciliation of GAAP to operating earnings on Page 15 of the presentation deck. Let's walk through our quarterly operating earnings performance by segment on Slide 10. Operating earnings for the quarter totaled $1.11 per share or $572 million compared to $1.22 per share or $616 million in 2022. The lower performance was primarily driven by the unfavorable weather, as Julie mentioned. When looking at historical weather in the first quarter of the past 30 years, we've only seen one quarter with more mild weather than the first quarter of 2023. Operating earnings for our Vertically Integrated Utilities were $0.52 per share, down $0.07. Favorable drivers included rate changes across multiple jurisdictions, normalized retail load, off-system sales primarily associated with Rockport Unit 2, transmission revenue and depreciation. I have more to share and load and performance, and we'll get to that in a minute. These items were more than offset by unfavorable weather, higher O&M and income taxes largely related to timing differences between the years and interests. We expect the year-over-year interest variance to be more pronounced in the first half of the year, as interest rates have somewhat stabilized. We also expect to see favorable O&M in the second half of the year compared to prior year, reflecting the timing of O&M spending and near-term actions that we are taking to help offset the unfavorable weather, such as holding positions open, reducing travel and adjusting the timing of discretionary spending. These actions are in addition to our ongoing efficiency efforts that allow us to offset the impact of inflation each year. I would like to take a second to talk about the off-system sales and depreciation. Due to the purchase of Rockport Unit 2 in December, we are seeing $0.05 of favorable off-system sales year-over-year since the margins are no longer shared with our retail customers. Also, due to the expiration of Rockport Unit 2 lease, I&M will see approximately $0.055 net favorable depreciation each of the first three quarters of 2023, plus an additional $0.035 in Q4. Including the impact of the Rockport lease, depreciation was $0.02 favorable versus the first quarter of last year. However, if you exclude the impact of the lease, depreciation would have been about $0.04 unfavorable, which is consistent with the incremental investment and a higher depreciable base in our Vertically Integrated Utilities segment. The Transmission and Distribution Utilities segment earned $0.24 per share, down $0.06 compared to last year. Favorable drivers in this segment included rate changes from the distribution cost recovery factor rider in Texas and the distribution investment rider in Ohio, as well as transmission revenue. Offsetting these favorable items were unfavorable weather, unfavorable O&M largely due to higher distribution spending in the quarter, higher interest and lower normalized retail sales due to customer mix. The AEP Transmission Holdco segment contributed $0.35 per share, up $0.01 compared to last year, primarily driven by $0.02 of favorable investment growth. Generation & Marketing produced $0.09 per share, up $0.06 from last year. Favorable drivers here include a higher retail and wholesale power margins, favorable development site sales, depreciation, and taxes. And finally, Corporate and Other was down $0.05 per share, largely driven by unfavorable interest. I'll note that this is due to both an increase in interest rates as well as higher debt balances. I'd like to remind everyone that we reflected the higher interest rates in our guidance that we provided on our year-end 2022 earnings call. While the quarter was unfavorable to the prior year, we are taking actions to offset the unfavorable weather, including the O&M refinements that I just mentioned, that give us confidence to reaffirm our full year guidance range. Turning to Slide 11, I'll provide an update on our normalized load performance for the quarter. We've continued to see load growth outperform when it's proving to be a weak economy across our service areas. This is most evident when comparing load performance across retail classes. So, we are seeing some weakness in residential loads. Our commercial and industrial classes are benefiting from new large customer volumes from our ongoing economic development efforts. This provides some potential upside to the full year outlook. Beginning in the upper left hand corner of the slide, normalized residential load was down as customers continue to be squeezed by the relationship between inflation and income growth. That relationship is a key driver of residential usage, and we expect to see it stabilize over the rest of the year. While we are seeing a decline in residential uses for customer, total residential customer counts were up by 0.5%, demonstrating growth in our service territory. Looking through the rest of the slide, you'll see that this was substantially offset by gains in our commercial and industrial loads attributable to new large customer additions. Normalized commercial sales accelerated an exceptional 7.8% compared to the first quarter of 2022. Though the growth in commercial sales was spread across many of our operating companies, gains were especially robust in AEP Texas and AEP Ohio, attributable to the new data center projects coming online in the new year. Outside of data centers, commercial gains were driven primarily by real estate, general merchandise stores, and food and drink establishments as individuals continue to move more freely in the wake of the pandemic. If we look to the lower left hand corner, we see the industrial sales resume their healthy pace of growth, increasing 5.1% from a year ago. As with commercial sales, gains were most robust in AEP Texas, while SWEPCO also experienced double-digit growth in its industrial sales. Looking at individual sectors, gains are most pronounced among oil and gas extraction and primary metal. You'll note that despite our strong commercial and industrial results for the first quarter, our expectations for 2023 load growth are still muted. Probability of a national downturn is extraordinarily high, and it's clear that activity is already slowed to a point that it's having a material impact on our customers' finances. While we expect the pace of economic growth to slow further, we don't anticipate a severe economic contraction across our service area in 2023. Though weaker than they were a year ago, household finances are still healthy by historical standards. Furthermore, the labor market continues to be resilient in the face of Fed rate hikes, which will serve to limit the severity of a potential downturn. These assumptions have been baked into our full year guidance for some time allowing us confidence that our projected load growth for 2023 is very much achievable. Adding to that confidence is our believe that there is more upside to our load projections than downside, stemming from a disciplined commitment to economic development across our service area. We know that working with local stakeholders to attract more economic activity is a key strategy to providing value to our customers. This allows us to continue to prioritize investments that will improve the customer experience while mitigating the rate impacts on our customer base. So, let's move to Slide 12 to discuss the company's capitalization and liquidity position. Taking a look at the upper left quadrant on this page, you can see our FFO to debt metric stands at 11.4%, which is a decrease of 1.8% from year-end and below our long-term target. The primary reason for this decrease is a $1.9 billion increase in balance sheet debt during the quarter, partially due to the return of the mark-to-market collateral positions associated with the decline in natural gas and power prices. Return of collateral also reduces our funds from operations, so it hits us on both sides of the equation. Without the fluctuations in our mark-to-market collateral positions, our FFP to debt metric will be closer to 13%. We expect that this metric will improve by year-end as we reduce debt after the close of the announced renewable sale and our 2020 equity units conversion, and our funds from operation improve over prior year, predominantly in the fourth quarter. We remain committed to our targeted FFO to debt range of 14% to 15% and plan to trend back into this range early in 2024 as we continue to work through the regulatory recovery processes of our deferred fuel balances. You can see our liquidity summary in the lower left quadrant of the slide. Our five-year $4 billion bank revolver and two-year $1 billion revolving credit facilities that was just extended to March 2025 support our liquidity position, which remains strong at $3.4 billion. The $800 million increase in liquidity from last quarter is mainly due to a decrease in commercial paper outstanding from long-term debt issuances. On a GAAP basis, our debt to capital ratio increased from the prior quarter by 1.2% to 64.1%. We plan to trend back closer to 60% this year as we close our announced sale transaction and complete our previously planned equity units conversion. On the qualified pension front, our funding status decreased 1.1% during the quarter to 101.3%. Rates fell during the quarter, which caused the pension discount rate to decrease, driving an increase in the liability that was greater than the gain on assets. Now turning to Slide 13. The first quarter has brought a significant challenge our way in the form of unfavorable weather. As we progress through the remainder of the year, we will continue to take action to manage our business and mitigate this impact. Our core business remains in a strong position and we are reaffirming our operating earnings guidance range of $5.19 to $5.39. We also continue to be committed to our long-term growth rate of 6% to 7%. As Julie previously addressed regarding the terminated Kentucky sale transaction, we are establishing a new -- a renewed focus in long-term strategy in order to maximize the full potential of our Kentucky operations going forward. We are on track to close the divestiture of our unregulated contracted renewables portfolio in the second quarter of this year, have announced the sale of our retail and distributed resources businesses, and are embarking on a review of some transmission joint ventures. These initiatives will help us to simplify and derisk our business while we continue to focus on the fundamentals, executing the $40 billion transmission, distribution and regulated renewables capital plan, disciplined O&M management and positive regulatory outcome. We really appreciate your time and attention today. And with that, I'm going to ask Alan to open the call so we can hear what's on your mind and answer any questions that you have.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of David Arcaro with J.P. Morgan. Go ahead.\nDavid Arcaro: Hi, thanks so much for my question. Dave Arcaro at Morgan Stanley. Let's see, maybe starting on the transmission business, I was wondering if you could elaborate a little bit on your strategic thinking there. What makes those assets non-core? Why that size of assets? And wondering what you're thinking -- if it does come to a divestiture decision, what you would plan to do with the proceeds? Could that reduce equity needs in the plan from here?\nJulie Sloat: Yeah, thanks so much. Appreciate the question. As we continue to talk about simplifying the business, I wouldn't necessarily put the transmission strategic review of the JVs as a derisking, because we are very comfortable with the risk profile of transmission, JV or otherwise. So that being said, this is more about simplification and really focusing on our ability to deal with customers in our footprint. So, nothing wrong with these assets. We love the assets. But we'd really like to take those dollars and channel them toward the traditional core utility business and transco utility business we have at American Electric Power. So -- and why Transource and Pioneer and Prairie Wind? Again, those are outside of our traditional footprint that we have today. ETT is a little different, and it is not necessarily under currently -- or not under current review at this point, as we focus on these pieces that are outside of our footprint. So, we'll see how this goes as far as utilizing any proceeds that we would have from a sale transaction should that occur. Again, this is a strategic review. We haven't made any decisions yet. What you should expect us to do is the same thing we've been talking about, dollars get channeled to traditional investment in the regulated utility operations. Clearly, have a lot to do on the transmission side. But when you bring dollars in the door, our expectation is to maintain a very healthy balance sheet. We've got a little bit of work to do. Ann talked about that in her opening comments. The metric should heal by the end of the year. So, we feel confident in that regard. But going out further in the timeline, we would always look to make sure the metrics are good. And then if we can, responsibly reduce equity issuances in future periods. But again, strategic review underway. We'll keep you apprised. And I would expect this would be more of a story as we get through the end of 2023 with the strategic review. And if anything were to occur, being 2024 story for us. So, thank you for the question.\nOperator: We'll go next to line of Jeremy Tonet with J.P. Morgan. Go ahead.\nAidan Kelly: Hi. This is actually Aidan Kelly on for Jeremy. Good morning. So just shifting to the New Mexico and retail distributed resources sales, could you talk more about the prospective of buyer market you're seeing right now? Any insight on the type of buyer you would be interested here? Also, just any language on OnSite Partners as well with the G&M segment would be great. Thanks.\nJulie Sloat: Yeah, you bet. So let me take a couple of different tacts at this. So number one, as you know, we've had a strategic review underway for the retail business. So that shouldn't be a surprise. Scooping in the OnSite Partners businesses is the new addition today. Those comprise about -- Energy Partners is about, I'd say, $0.04 of -- I'm sorry, I should say, retail business is about $0.04 of the component that we're talking about in terms 2023 guidance. OnSite Partners is about $0.02. So let me give you those parameters, so you know exactly what we're talking about. NMRD is about $0.01 of the 2023 guidance. You got a few pennies there that we're playing with. As far as who are the likely buyers, let me answer it this way. We're already dealing with a multitude of buyers from our unregulated contracted renewables business. So, we're very familiar with that space because we have that contract underway with that piece of the business. NMRD, I would think would fit more closely with that type of activity in terms of the parties that might be interested in that particular asset base. But then let's move to the retail business. I think you got a little bit more of a narrower or more unique buyer set for that particular piece of the business. And then -- and I won't go into any names, but just given the nature of the business, the field narrows just a touch. And then on the distributed part of the business, meaning OnSite Partners, it got hundreds of parties that could be potentially interested in that. The other thing that we're thinking about is when we start working with our financial advisor to move forward with the transaction, there could be a situation where you have a combined platform where both the retail and the distributed pieces of the business are put together and sold that way. But we're completely open to separating the [two tube] (ph) just because you've got different buyer bases. Can't really opine on it yet just because we're just getting started with it, but we will absolutely keep you apprised of what our progress is and what we're experiencing as we move through time here. So early stages, but well underway in terms of getting the financial advisor kicked off and then the process started.\nOperator: We have a follow-up question from the line of David Arcara with Morgan Stanley. One moment, please. Apparently, that line is not in queue. We'll go next to the line of Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Securities. Go ahead, please.\nJames Ward: Hi. This is James Ward on for Shar. Thank you for taking our questions. First, as you look towards your June rate case filing in Kentucky, how are you thinking about the key asks in this case? And as a follow-up, could you expand on how you see capital allocation to this jurisdiction developing in the context of your overall investment plans over the forecast period?\nJulie Sloat: I still appreciate that. And I get it, you guys have a really busy morning. So, I know we have different names who don't typically cover us. So, I just -- I'm still appreciative of your time and attention today. Lots of companies reporting. So that being said, on the Kentucky front, stay tuned, because what you'll -- you should expect us to do is be in conversations with the different stakeholders, with the commission, and staff in particular in Kentucky to make sure we're scratching all the inches. We want to be successful in the arena. And we are going to absolutely have a very thoughtful approach in sensitivity to reliability. We need to make sure that we're keeping the lights on and keeping them affordable for the state of Kentucky and the area that we serve in particular. So, I have a lot of granularity to share with you today other than to assure you that we will be working collaboratively with the partners in that jurisdiction. So, extremely important to us particularly when you look at where the current ROE is. We need to get that up. We need that utility company to be in a healthy situation so we can continue to have low cost capital allocated to that particular piece of the business. And then, I'll ask Ann to talk a little bit about our capital allocation and how we're going to digest that from Kentucky.\nAnn Kelly: Right. So, our capital plan, the $40 billion capital plan going forward is not going to change. We would just be reallocating from other areas within the same segment. So, you would expect to see the transmission, distribution, generation, all those planned numbers for the five-year timeframe will stay the same. We will just allocate within jurisdictions to Kentucky to make sure that they are focused on reliability, as Julie mentioned.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Durgesh Chopra with Evercore. Go ahead.\nDurgesh Chopra: Hey. Good morning, team. Thanks for giving me time. Hey, just I know you gave us property plant and equipment number on the transmission assets, which are up for strategic review. Is there a rate base number that you have handy that you can share with us? If not, I'll just follow-up with Darcy.\nJulie Sloat: You know what, Durgesh, thank you so much for your question. I don't have a rate base number in front of me. We can absolutely get that to you though. So, we'll circle back with you. But the $551 million, as you point out, is the net plant position that is attributable to AEP in particular.\nOperator: We'll go next to the line of Andrew Weisel with Scotiabank. Go ahead.\nAndrew Weisel: Hi, good morning. Thank you. First question on the balance sheet. Just to clarify, if none of these transactions move forward besides contracted renewables, what's your degree of confidence in the targeted credit metrics and FFO guidance, and over what time period?\nAnn Kelly: Yeah. So what I talked about earlier was based on that scenario. We have not modeled in any additional asset sales transactions besides the contracted applicable. So, we would expect an improvement by year-end and getting it within our targeted metrics early next year.\nOperator: We'll now go to the line of Anthony -- pardon me, Anthony Crowdell with Mizuho. Please go ahead.\nAnthony Crowdell: Great. I guess two quick questions. One is on Slide 27 that shows the underearning gap. I guess when I look at the like five OPCos that are under earning anywhere between 90 to greater basis points. What's a reasonable assumption of underearning we could assume when you closed that gap and during what timeframe? And then the follow-up is -- and I may have not heard correctly. I think -- I don't know if it's a Turk plant or the Rockport plant, you've bought back or it's maybe not part of lease or maybe I didn't hear that correctly. Does that now move to the G&M segment in reporting? Thank you.\nJulie Sloat: Yes. Thanks so much for the question. I'm going to take your first one on the ROEs. I'm going to back up the truck a little bit. You may recall when we provided 2023 earnings guidance, the average ROE across the system for our regulated businesses was going to be around 9.4%. Today, as you know, we're at 8.8%. So here's my expectation. I expect we're going to close that gap as we get toward the end of the year. And as you know, I mentioned several different regulatory filings and successes that we've had in 2023 that are going to help us close that gap. So we feel confident that gap will close, but I do expect that we'll be a little under that 9.4%. Importantly, we have not changed our earnings guidance, so we still plan to get within the goalpost on the earnings guidance and growth rates. So I'm not worried about that either, but it's going to take us a little longer to close the gap versus the 9.4% that we had in that 2023 guidance. So, I'll leave you with that. And as you know, we're not dependent on any single one utility company to get in a direct earning level relative to authorized, that's the benefit of having a portfolio of utilities. But boy, I surely would love to close that gap and be within 10s of basis points versus the authorized in each of our jurisdictions. That's an objective. It's just going to take us a little while to get there because, as you know, these things have a little bit of a lead time on them. So stand by and know the guidance is sound. And then on the Rockport unit, that actually it becomes a merchant unit. And I believe that's captured in, what, our Vertically Integrated Utilities segment, right? And that would be captured as off-system sales, okay? So, hopefully, that will help you with your modeling needs there, too.\nAnn Kelly: And that's due to the ownership structure. So, we didn't want to move it because it's still owned by the Vertically Integrated Utilities.\nOperator: We have a follow-up question from the line of Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim. Go ahead.\nJames Ward: Hi. James Ward here again. Thank you for this follow-up. Unrelated to the prior question, just wanted to ask, assuming the successful eventual sales of both your retail business, distributed resources and the three non-core transmission JVs you highlighted today, how should we think about the source of funds for future financing needs? And specifically, will asset sales and capital recycling always factor into your financing approach? Or is there a point at which you would no longer look to recycle assets? Thank you.\nJulie Sloat: Yes, I -- this is Julie. I'll hand it to Ann here in a minute. Here's how I look at it. Simplification and derisking the business should be part of our fabric. So, we are going to continually look at where the best use and highest value is for each of the dollars that we put to work. So I think that's our job is to make sure that the portfolio of assets we have is the best we can have in the highest earnings. You go back to the question I just answered around earning your authorized ROE, we have to do better at that, and we'll continue to do better at that as we go down the path here. So, I do think you should keep that in back of the mind. We will continue to keep you updated on and signal to you if we think there's a business that might fit that profile that we would consider recycling it. But the ones that you see us talking about today are the ones that are absolutely those in terms of strategic review on the JV side of the house, transmission that -- we love transmission, but we may be able to put that to better use inside the traditional footprint. And then, clearly, on the unregulated side of the house, we want to derisk and simplify. It makes complete sense to move forward with those actions that we outlined today. So Ann, I don't know if you want to talk any more about or add any additional color to that?\nAnn Kelly: Yeah, I mean you're absolutely right, Julie. And when we look at the cash flows, which are on Slide 24 that we've only modeled in the contracted renewables sale here. So any additional sales proceeds will also be able to strengthen the balance sheet. And as we mentioned, we could potentially selectively reduce the equity issuances going forward, while maintaining the same capital plan.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Sophie Karp with KeyBanc. Go ahead.\nSophie Karp: Hi. Good morning, and thank you for taking my question. I wanted to ask you about the Texas utilities and the ROE gap there. I guess in Texas, the regulatory recovery mechanisms are very constructive, right? So, you have your DCRF and TCOS and whatnot. So what needs to be, I guess, addressed there to close that gap specifically? Could you speak to that?\nJulie Sloat: Yeah, I still appreciate that question. So thanks for being on the call today. We're working on it. So let me start with the backdrop on the story. As you know, we continue to channel a great deal of capital to AEP Texas. We do think the recovery mechanisms there are very good. We always think there's opportunity for improvement. So I'll talk about that here in a moment. But one of the things that we've gotten comfortable with, with the touch of underearning relative to authorized in Texas, is the amount of growth that we have in Texas. So on average, we can grow earnings there at 10%, but I got to take a little bit of a haircut because no regulatory recovery is perfect. But we're trying to work on that. And so for example, if you read on Page Number 27, there's some commentary under the little earnings bubble there that we talk about bi-annual TCOS filings to recover significant capital investment. Those good things. We love that. We do have some legislation that is in process and working through that relates specifically to the DCRF and the ability to shorten that timeframe. So maybe we can do that twice a year versus annually. So that will help to kind of close that gap a little bit. And then there's also some legislation around cap structures, too, that might be helpful to us. So, we're trying to work all the different angles. Not to mention the other thing that we're thinking about and continue to talk about is, a way to continue to use those excellent cost recovery mechanisms that are much more progressive in Texas throughout the period, even when you're in for a base case. So, we're trying to use the legislative aspects as well as just trying to be as efficient as possible to close that gap. But we've been comfortable in the near term, taking the little bit of a hit relative to authorized on the ROE because we can grow earnings there and the demand is there. So that was the rationale. But we love the business. We're just trying to make it better in terms of recovery.\nOperator: We'll go now to the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Go ahead.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey, good morning, team. Thank you guys very much. Appreciate the time. Just following up on a couple of the remarks earlier. Just can you elaborate a little bit more on next steps here as you think about Louisiana? Obviously, a little bit of a setback here, but you alluded to potentially putting this back on the -- or maybe not you all, but perhaps the commission electing to reconsider the matter next month. Can you elaborate on the procedural element there, but also some of the other avenues, there's a flex consideration here that can be pursued to the extent to which there may be different outcomes?\nJulie Sloat: Yes. Julien, thank you for being on the call today. And that is absolutely top of mind for us. As you know, and I mentioned in my opening comments, we're able to get to a settlement agreement and the Louisiana staff filed constructive testimony with conditional approval, all that good stuff. So, we want to continue to work that angle. And actually, one of the commissioners suggested that the decision could be recalled at the next meeting for reconsideration once some additional information is shared. So, we have that top of mind for us. So here's what you should expect from SWEPCO. You should expect to see us seeking rehearing in which we continue to be optimistic that we can pool this across the goal line. So, stay tuned on that. I don't want to get too much in the weeds on it just yet because we're literally in game with that right now. And then specifically, we would hope that this is going to move forward, and we'll have all three jurisdictions stepping in line and be able to absorb with positivity, the applications that we have in front of them. But do we have flexibility in terms of flexing up in the other jurisdictions? On a discrete basis, we think that there is that opportunity with the different projects that we have that are included in that filing. So again, nothing specific to share today. But rest assured, we're looking at all the different tools and angles in the tool bag there that we're able to use should we need a different route if Louisiana can't get there. But we're optimistic and we're having conversations, so stay tuned.\nOperator: We'll go next to the line of Paul Fremont with Ladenburg. Go ahead.\nPaul Fremont: Thank you. I guess my first question is on FFO to debt. In order to hit the sort of the 14% to 15% targeted range, should we assume that you need to basically collect on the $1.6 billion in fuel deferrals? And can you give us a sense of the timing that you would expect to recover those amounts?\nAnn Kelly: Yes, I'll take that, Julie. So, we would expect to collect over the extended timeframes that we have already agreed upon within our jurisdictions. And with respect to West Virginia, we have that model taking advantage of the securitization in the first quarter or the first half of next year.\nOperator: We have a follow-up question from the line of Sophie Karp with KeyBanc. Go ahead.\nSophie Karp: Hi. Thank you for giving me more time. If I can ask a follow-up on Kentucky, right, like asked differently, when you spoke to regulators there, and clearly, you need to bring the ROE up, right? But what kind of a rate increase would that require for Kentucky rate payers? And like do you get the sense of kind of like the upper limit of the appetite that the regulators might have for rate increases in this environment?\nJulie Sloat: Yeah. So, let me answer that this way. I don't have specific numbers to share with you today because when we actually had the conversation, we hadn't announced earnings yet, okay? So that's new information today, that's public today. And so this will be the go-back conversation that we'll have. And again, the plan is truly to collaborate, because I'm confident that the commission and the commissioners are interested in having a very sound -- financially sound utility company. And so we'll all be working in that same direction. Now as far as tools in the tool bag, obviously, we'll try to influence the top-line with economic development and things of that nature. That takes a little longer, as you know, because it's got a little longer lead time on it. But we know we're really successful with that, too. So stay tuned. And then, of course, we'll be very sensitive to cost as well. The other thing that will be top of mind for us is using the new tools in the tool bag is securitization, okay? So, we've got deferred storm costs that are sitting on the balance sheet. We have an opportunity to take care of net plant of legacy coal plants that's sitting on the balance sheet, too, to the tune of something like $290 million associated with Big Sandy. So those are things that we'll be able to securitize and then kind of back into what -- how we need to make that math work. And I mentioned that also talks about or at least strikes at the idea of kind of rightsizing the rate base. So, we work with the commission and all the various stakeholders in the state of Kentucky that we deal with to make sure that we're getting where we need to be. But honestly, from my seat and from a utility seat, just 2.9%, it's not healthy. We need to get it in a healthy situation. And that will be top of mind for us, because we've got to keep the lights on to and keep it affordable. So stay tuned. We don't have a lot of color to share today because we're literally in game. This is a new data point with 2.9%, okay? But Sophie, thank you for jumping back in line.\nOperator: We have a follow-up question from Paul Fremont with Ladenburg. Go ahead.\nPaul Fremont: Thanks. So, the assumption is that you will -- that you're assuming you'll get securitization in West Virginia as part of getting to the -- to that 14% to 15% FFO to debt?\nJulie Sloat: Paul, this is Julie. Actually, securitization will be a great thing, and that helps us, give us a little more flexibility, more importantly, it's good for the customer. And so, when we filed for our new ENEC filing that we made on what was it like February -- I'm sorry, April 28, I think, was the date that we filed it. What you'll see is that we have two proposed options to recover the fuel balance in our filing. And one is to spread the recovery over three years, and the other is to use securitization for the under-recovered fuel balance. And as part of that, we also looked in as an option, again, with the idea and backdrop and motivation is to protect the customer rates because we can't have them trying to swallow a watermelon here is to essentially securitize plant balances from legacy coal plants, so Amos and Mountaineer in particular, and I think we have some storm costs in there as well. And so when I mentioned today, that $1.84 billion number that we would like to securitize, that's all in. And so, we're trying to give the commission options so that we can all work collectively to make sure that the citizens and customers of West Virginia are protected, but that we still have a healthy utility and we're able to hit the balance sheet metrics that we need. So, it's doable. It's absolutely doable, we'll just need to move through the process.\nAnn Kelly: And one thing just to add on FFO to debt, when you think about just the quarterly dynamics, in Q4 of last year, due to market conditions, we did have a significant outflow of collateral as well as an increase in deferred fuel. So, as we get through that this year, and that quarter rolls off, that will significantly help our FFO to debt as well.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We have a follow-up question from Paul Fremont with Ladenburg. Pardon me, that line did not open up. We have Bill Appicelli with UBS. Go ahead.\nBill Appicelli: Hi, good morning. Most of my questions have been asked and answered. But just a question around the timing of the approval for the contracted renewable sale. You made the filing on March 22. I guess what gives you the comfort that you'll get approval in Q2? And I guess what's the -- what do you need to demonstrate in those filings to get approval both at FERC and on the Committee on Foreign Investment?\nJulie Sloat: Yes. So as far as FERC and the other two approvals that we'll need to get, let me answer it this way. When we made the filing initially, we had requested at FERC a 60-day approval process. So, we would like to get an order within 60 days. May 22 would be 60 days. And given that this is normal kind of traditional business unregulated, not tied to significant customers and multiple stakeholders, we don't anticipate any material roadblock as it relates to getting not only FERC approval, but the clearance from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States and/or approval under any of the applicable competition loss. So we're comfortable with where we are and expect that we should have that in pretty short order, which gives us confidence to say we think that we'll get this done by the end of the second quarter at the latest. But we'll keep you apprised if anything were to come up. But at this point, we're past commentary periods, and everything seems to be going relatively smoothly. So, anyway, I'll leave it at that, and suggest that if anything shifts, we'll be right in front of you immediately.\nOperator: We have no further lines in queue at this time.\nDarcy Reese: Thank you for joining us on today's call. As always, the IR team will be available to answer any additional questions you may have. Alan, would you please give the replay information?\nOperator: Thank you.

        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Julie Sloat",
            "content": "Thanks, Darcy. Welcome everyone to AEP's first quarter 2023 earnings call. It's good to be with everyone this morning. Our direction and strategy remain on track with an emphasis on our generation fleet transformation and continued investment in our energy delivery infrastructure, which is all embedded and our five-year $40 billion capital plan. I'll start with an overview of our financial performance for the first quarter before discussing our Kentucky operations following the termination of our transaction with Liberty. I'll then provide some updates on our unregulated contracted renewable sale, retail business review and other strategic plans before closing with some insight into our progress on the regulatory and legislative front as we work to implement important new initiatives to ensure our customers and communities' needs are met and continue to come first, which you know enables us to deliver on our financial stakeholder commitments as well. A summary of our first quarter 2023 business highlights can be found on Slide 6 of today's presentation. We have a long-standing history of consistently delivering on our strategic objectives, and we're pleased to share that this quarter is no different. Turning to a high-level overview of our financial results. I can tell you that AEP delivered first quarter 2023 operating earnings of $1.11 per share, or $572 million. Weather this quarter ranked as one of the mildest in the past 30 years resulting in an unfavorable impact of first quarter results. Despite this, our thoughtful and disciplined approach to managing the business enables us to reaffirm our 2023 full year operating guidance range of $5.19 per share to $5.39 per share, and with a $5.29 per share mid -- $5.29 per share midpoint and long-term earnings growth rate of -- growth rate range of 6% to 7%. We're confident in the built-in flexibility we have in our business to ensure that we successfully deliver on our financial commitments and continue AEP's strong track-record of financial performance. We're also pleased to report that AEP has experienced minimal financial and operational supply chain impacts to-date, primarily due to our successful efforts to diversify our mix of suppliers and increase our order quantities to minimize the impact on our robust capital investment plan. Ann I'll walk through our first quarter performance drivers and share some perspective on our positive load outlook, as we continue to drive our economic development and service territory expansion. She'll also review the drivers to support our targeted 14% to 15% FFO to debt range. While our FFO to debt is at 11.4% this quarter, I am confident this metric will improve materially by year-end. As I mentioned to you on last quarter's call, simplifying and derisking our business profile is one of our top strategic priorities. By actively managing our portfolio and demonstrating a clear commitment to a disciplined execution of initiatives and transactions, we continue to deliver significant benefits to our stakeholders. Actively managing our portfolio also means staying flexible and being ready to change our focus and adapt our strategy when it becomes clear that certain transactions or initiatives may no longer be viable. A few weeks ago, our team was faced with this very challenge. On April 17, we announced the termination of the sale of our Kentucky operations to Liberty. Ensuring the best outcome for stakeholders remains our top priority and we took a disciplined approach to evaluating the continued pursuit of a sale and what that would mean in terms of economics, regulatory expectations, timing uncertainty. We ultimately determined that the better outcome was to terminate the pending sale transaction and to continue our work to develop a clear strategy for our Kentucky operations. I'm thankful for the team's ability to react and adapt to shifting circumstances for the long-term benefit of our customers, employees and investors. After the termination of the sale, AEP met with the Kentucky commissioners and key stakeholders. We discussed Kentucky Power's future and the collaboration needed so that we may continue to serve our customers in a reliable manner while ensuring the financial health and discipline of Kentucky Power moving forward. In the near term, we're renewing our focus on the region and support -- and our support of the communities we serve. You'll see in the earnings call materials today that Kentucky Power's earned ROE for the 12-month period ending the first quarter of 2023 is 2.9%. This does not reflect a financially healthy utility, which needs to be resolved in consideration of the interest of all stakeholders. The underperformance is due in part to a number of unique issues that are and will be addressed for improvement over the course of the next year. As we think about the opportunities ahead for our Kentucky operations, the actions we will be engaged and include a refocus on economic development, enhanced local system reliability, and controlling customer cost. We plan to file a base case in Kentucky in June with an expected six-month commission approval process, with new rates taking effect in January 2024. Other factors that will be beneficial in improving the financial profile and performance include using securitization to recover deferred storm costs and legacy generating plant balances and rightsizing the rate base. While we pivot in Kentucky, we're focused on the successful execution of other key transactions. In February 2023, we announced an agreement with IRG Acquisition Holdings for the sale of our 1,360-megawatt unregulated renewables portfolio. A summary of the renewable sale can be found on Slide 7. All regulatory filings were made in March, and at this time, we're waiting on approval from FERC under section 203 and clearance from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States and Euro Antitrust. We already have cleared Hart-Scott-Rodino approval and China Antitrust. Consistent with our prior messaging, we expect the sale to close near the end of our second quarter 2023 depending on the timing of regulatory approvals. The proceeds from the transaction will be directed to our regulated businesses as we transform our generation fleet and enhance the electric delivery infrastructure. Furthering our commitment to simplify and derisk the company, and summarized on Slide 8, we've agreed with our joint venture partner PNM Resources to sell our portfolio of operating and developing solar projects in New Mexico. This 50/50 partnership is known as New Mexico Renewable Development, or NMRD. And we hold this within our unregulated operations portfolio, AEP. NMRD owns eight operating solar projects totaling 135 megawatts, 150 megawatt project currently under construction and six development projects totaling 440 megawatts. Last week, an adviser was selected to move forward with the sale process. We anticipate making a sale announcement early in the fourth quarter of this year and will target closing by the end of 2023, subject to timing of regulatory approvals. We also have some news to share with you today. As you know, in October 2022, we announced the strategic review of our AEP Energy retail business, which primarily operates in the PJM markets. We've completed that strategic review and decided that we will start a sales process for that business and will also fold into the process AEP OnSite Partners, which is our unregulated distributed resources business. We've hired an advisor to move forward, and we'll keep you updated on the progress. We expect to launch the sale process sometime this summer, and we'll update you with the details along the way, but currently expect the completion of this transaction in the first half of 2024. We're focused on our core regulated utility operations and continue to evaluate all value additive potential activities to enhance their performance and look for opportunities to recycle capital. As a consequence of this effort, we've decided to pursue a strategic review of three of our non-core transmission joint venture businesses, including AEP's interest in Prairie Wind Transmission, Pioneer Transmission, Transource Energy. These businesses total approximately $551 million in net plant investment for AEP and consists of 370 line miles and four substations of in-service assets, as well as various projects under development in PJM and SPP. We'll definitely keep you posted on our -- or updated on our progress, but we expect to complete our review by the end of 2023 with a conclusion that consists of remaining in or divesting some or all of the businesses. So, let's switch gears and talk about AEP's regulated renewables execution. I'm pleased to share that we continue to make significant progress on our transition to a clean energy economy that provides more stable and predictable cost to our customers. Through our five-year, $8.6 billion regulated renewables capital plan, we have a total of $6.7 billion approved or before our commissions. Most recently, in March to be specific, we made regulatory filings for $1 billion of investment at INM, representing 469 megawatts of solar energy and another 151 megawatts of owned, wind, storage at owned and -- owned, wind and storage at APCo for $466 million. Public Service of Oklahoma Company along with other parties filed a settlement in early April of 2023 in the fuel-free power plan case, which relates to PSO's 995.5-megawatt solar and wind portfolio for $2.5 billion. Like, in any other negotiation, this settlement we focused on the assurance of customer benefits without undue risk to the company. In this case, the settlement provided crucial capacity without fuel expense that'll help address PSO's large capacity need. The case took a positive step forward last week when the judge issued a preliminary opinion approving the settlement on April 27, and the commission has a case on its agenda for today, May 4. For SWEPCO's 999-megawatt renewables project, which represents a $2.2 billion investment, parties recently filed an Arkansas settlement in January for these owned, wind and solar resources. In another positive development in Texas, the administrative law judge that oversaw the evidentiary hearing issued the preliminary order which recommended project approval. And in Louisiana, we reached the settlement, however, we were disappointed that the Louisiana Commission did not approve the settlement on April 26, but we remain optimistic that the matter will be reconsidered at the next meeting this month. We look forward to the continued consideration in Louisiana and orders coming in Arkansas and Texas in the second quarter. It's important to note that our regulated renewables goals are aligned and supported by our integrated resource plans, focused on reliability and customer affordability. In accordance with these plans, we have requests for proposals issued or preparing to be issued for additional resources at each of our vertically integrated utilities. We plan to make related regulatory filings over the next year while taking into consideration commission preferences from previous RFP processes. Now, let me provide an update on several of our ongoing regular and legislative initiatives. We're focused on reducing our authorized versus ROE gap. Have some work to do on that as our ROE was at 8.8% this quarter, driven in part by the unfavorable weather conditions that I mentioned earlier. On the effort to close the gap, I am happy to report that we reached the settlement and gained commission approval in January 23 -- 2023 that closed out our SWEPCO Louisiana base case. A key to this case was the ability to reset rates and recover costs under a formula rate plan. And we have already put this into action as we filed under this provision last month. Similarly, in April, AEP filed a formula rate review in Arkansas, which was authorized by that commission in the last base case. As we advanced through 2023, the team is actively pursuing rider recovery of the 88 megawatts of the Turk plant not currently in Arkansas rates. And the current base case in Oklahoma is set for hearing on May 9. So, we're making progress on the regulatory front. We also worked closely with our stakeholders on the legislative front in Virginia to improve the former triennial rate case process. The new biennial rate process became law in April after active -- after an active legislative session, APCo filed its last triennial in March of 2023 for the 2020 through 2022 period. The new law will require APCo to file its first biennial in 2024 with the biennial continuing in subsequent two-year period. So, it's going to work like this. The pending triennial will put rates in place for 2024 while we litigate the biennial in 2024 for rates effective in 2025, and we can help you with your modeling needs once we get a little further down the line here. Pivoting to our fuel cost recovery efforts for a minute. Our management of fuel cost recovery is a top priority for us with our total deferred fuel balance at $1.6 billion as of our first quarter. We adapted our fuel cost recovery across all of our jurisdictions with a focus on balancing customer impacts. In Texas, the commission approved the $83 million special fuel surcharge filed in October of 2022 and was being recovered subject to review since February 2023. So, making progress there. We are aware of the staff prudence filing last Friday, April 28 in West Virginia that recommended a disallowance of certain fuel costs. The recommendation was rooted in the commission's prior reference to a 69% capacity factor at our coal facilities. Prudence review is a report produced by an outside consulting firm hired by the staff. The report relies on factors beyond AEP's control and takes issue with some of the practices taken to ensure that our power plants would have fuel available to provide electricity during the peak winter period. Those in the area are very familiar with how the historic swing of fuel cost over the past two years placed extreme pressure on the system and fuel recovery mechanisms. We advocated for the securitization legislation that recently passed in West Virginia knowing it provided an effective path to deal with those issues. In line with this strategy, APCo made a filing on April 28 seeking West Virginia Commission approval to utilize the new securitization tool to pay off the $553 million deferred fuel balance as February 28, 2023. The filing also proposes to apply the mechanism to certain storm costs and legacy coal costs in a manner that minimizes cost impacts to customers while still addressing these historical costs. Related to the consultant's prudence recommendation, the new APCo filing also lays out the environment APCo was operating in over this volatile fuel time or time in fuel cost and the actions taken to ensure coal would be available on the most extreme days on the system. Our plan is to collaborate with the commission to address customer and deferred fuel concerns together for constructive path forward in West Virginia. After receiving the commission approval, the plan would be to issue bonds to securitize a combination of deferred fuel balance, deferred storm costs, and legacy coal plan balances in the amount of $1.84 billion in the first half 2024. So, wrapping it up, I'm pleased with the progress we're making, capitalizing on our momentum from 2022. We continue to deliver on our commitments and execute against our strategic objectives. We're taking a thoughtful and disciplined approach to simplify and derisk our business and investments we make to support our positive earnings growth and outlook. I proudly lead a team whose experience and expertise have made it possible for AEP to lay new groundwork for future success while also responding and adapting to the rapid changes we're seeing in our industry. Together, we're delivering safe, clean, affordable, and reliable energy to our customers and communities, all while creating values for our investors. With that, Ann -- I will ask her to now walk through the first quarter performance drivers and provide us with some details on our financing targets. So to you, Ann. Yeah, thanks so much. Appreciate the question. As we continue to talk about simplifying the business, I wouldn't necessarily put the transmission strategic review of the JVs as a derisking, because we are very comfortable with the risk profile of transmission, JV or otherwise. So that being said, this is more about simplification and really focusing on our ability to deal with customers in our footprint. So, nothing wrong with these assets. We love the assets. But we'd really like to take those dollars and channel them toward the traditional core utility business and transco utility business we have at American Electric Power. So -- and why Transource and Pioneer and Prairie Wind? Again, those are outside of our traditional footprint that we have today. ETT is a little different, and it is not necessarily under currently -- or not under current review at this point, as we focus on these pieces that are outside of our footprint. So, we'll see how this goes as far as utilizing any proceeds that we would have from a sale transaction should that occur. Again, this is a strategic review. We haven't made any decisions yet. What you should expect us to do is the same thing we've been talking about, dollars get channeled to traditional investment in the regulated utility operations. Clearly, have a lot to do on the transmission side. But when you bring dollars in the door, our expectation is to maintain a very healthy balance sheet. We've got a little bit of work to do. Ann talked about that in her opening comments. The metric should heal by the end of the year. So, we feel confident in that regard. But going out further in the timeline, we would always look to make sure the metrics are good. And then if we can, responsibly reduce equity issuances in future periods. But again, strategic review underway. We'll keep you apprised. And I would expect this would be more of a story as we get through the end of 2023 with the strategic review. And if anything were to occur, being 2024 story for us. So, thank you for the question. Yeah, you bet. So let me take a couple of different tacts at this. So number one, as you know, we've had a strategic review underway for the retail business. So that shouldn't be a surprise. Scooping in the OnSite Partners businesses is the new addition today. Those comprise about -- Energy Partners is about, I'd say, $0.04 of -- I'm sorry, I should say, retail business is about $0.04 of the component that we're talking about in terms 2023 guidance. OnSite Partners is about $0.02. So let me give you those parameters, so you know exactly what we're talking about. NMRD is about $0.01 of the 2023 guidance. You got a few pennies there that we're playing with. As far as who are the likely buyers, let me answer it this way. We're already dealing with a multitude of buyers from our unregulated contracted renewables business. So, we're very familiar with that space because we have that contract underway with that piece of the business. NMRD, I would think would fit more closely with that type of activity in terms of the parties that might be interested in that particular asset base. But then let's move to the retail business. I think you got a little bit more of a narrower or more unique buyer set for that particular piece of the business. And then -- and I won't go into any names, but just given the nature of the business, the field narrows just a touch. And then on the distributed part of the business, meaning OnSite Partners, it got hundreds of parties that could be potentially interested in that. The other thing that we're thinking about is when we start working with our financial advisor to move forward with the transaction, there could be a situation where you have a combined platform where both the retail and the distributed pieces of the business are put together and sold that way. But we're completely open to separating the [two tube] (ph) just because you've got different buyer bases. Can't really opine on it yet just because we're just getting started with it, but we will absolutely keep you apprised of what our progress is and what we're experiencing as we move through time here. So early stages, but well underway in terms of getting the financial advisor kicked off and then the process started. I still appreciate that. And I get it, you guys have a really busy morning. So, I know we have different names who don't typically cover us. So, I just -- I'm still appreciative of your time and attention today. Lots of companies reporting. So that being said, on the Kentucky front, stay tuned, because what you'll -- you should expect us to do is be in conversations with the different stakeholders, with the commission, and staff in particular in Kentucky to make sure we're scratching all the inches. We want to be successful in the arena. And we are going to absolutely have a very thoughtful approach in sensitivity to reliability. We need to make sure that we're keeping the lights on and keeping them affordable for the state of Kentucky and the area that we serve in particular. So, I have a lot of granularity to share with you today other than to assure you that we will be working collaboratively with the partners in that jurisdiction. So, extremely important to us particularly when you look at where the current ROE is. We need to get that up. We need that utility company to be in a healthy situation so we can continue to have low cost capital allocated to that particular piece of the business. And then, I'll ask Ann to talk a little bit about our capital allocation and how we're going to digest that from Kentucky. You know what, Durgesh, thank you so much for your question. I don't have a rate base number in front of me. We can absolutely get that to you though. So, we'll circle back with you. But the $551 million, as you point out, is the net plant position that is attributable to AEP in particular. Yes. Thanks so much for the question. I'm going to take your first one on the ROEs. I'm going to back up the truck a little bit. You may recall when we provided 2023 earnings guidance, the average ROE across the system for our regulated businesses was going to be around 9.4%. Today, as you know, we're at 8.8%. So here's my expectation. I expect we're going to close that gap as we get toward the end of the year. And as you know, I mentioned several different regulatory filings and successes that we've had in 2023 that are going to help us close that gap. So we feel confident that gap will close, but I do expect that we'll be a little under that 9.4%. Importantly, we have not changed our earnings guidance, so we still plan to get within the goalpost on the earnings guidance and growth rates. So I'm not worried about that either, but it's going to take us a little longer to close the gap versus the 9.4% that we had in that 2023 guidance. So, I'll leave you with that. And as you know, we're not dependent on any single one utility company to get in a direct earning level relative to authorized, that's the benefit of having a portfolio of utilities. But boy, I surely would love to close that gap and be within 10s of basis points versus the authorized in each of our jurisdictions. That's an objective. It's just going to take us a little while to get there because, as you know, these things have a little bit of a lead time on them. So stand by and know the guidance is sound. And then on the Rockport unit, that actually it becomes a merchant unit. And I believe that's captured in, what, our Vertically Integrated Utilities segment, right? And that would be captured as off-system sales, okay? So, hopefully, that will help you with your modeling needs there, too. Yes, I -- this is Julie. I'll hand it to Ann here in a minute. Here's how I look at it. Simplification and derisking the business should be part of our fabric. So, we are going to continually look at where the best use and highest value is for each of the dollars that we put to work. So I think that's our job is to make sure that the portfolio of assets we have is the best we can have in the highest earnings. You go back to the question I just answered around earning your authorized ROE, we have to do better at that, and we'll continue to do better at that as we go down the path here. So, I do think you should keep that in back of the mind. We will continue to keep you updated on and signal to you if we think there's a business that might fit that profile that we would consider recycling it. But the ones that you see us talking about today are the ones that are absolutely those in terms of strategic review on the JV side of the house, transmission that -- we love transmission, but we may be able to put that to better use inside the traditional footprint. And then, clearly, on the unregulated side of the house, we want to derisk and simplify. It makes complete sense to move forward with those actions that we outlined today. So Ann, I don't know if you want to talk any more about or add any additional color to that? Yeah, I still appreciate that question. So thanks for being on the call today. We're working on it. So let me start with the backdrop on the story. As you know, we continue to channel a great deal of capital to AEP Texas. We do think the recovery mechanisms there are very good. We always think there's opportunity for improvement. So I'll talk about that here in a moment. But one of the things that we've gotten comfortable with, with the touch of underearning relative to authorized in Texas, is the amount of growth that we have in Texas. So on average, we can grow earnings there at 10%, but I got to take a little bit of a haircut because no regulatory recovery is perfect. But we're trying to work on that. And so for example, if you read on Page Number 27, there's some commentary under the little earnings bubble there that we talk about bi-annual TCOS filings to recover significant capital investment. Those good things. We love that. We do have some legislation that is in process and working through that relates specifically to the DCRF and the ability to shorten that timeframe. So maybe we can do that twice a year versus annually. So that will help to kind of close that gap a little bit. And then there's also some legislation around cap structures, too, that might be helpful to us. So, we're trying to work all the different angles. Not to mention the other thing that we're thinking about and continue to talk about is, a way to continue to use those excellent cost recovery mechanisms that are much more progressive in Texas throughout the period, even when you're in for a base case. So, we're trying to use the legislative aspects as well as just trying to be as efficient as possible to close that gap. But we've been comfortable in the near term, taking the little bit of a hit relative to authorized on the ROE because we can grow earnings there and the demand is there. So that was the rationale. But we love the business. We're just trying to make it better in terms of recovery. Yes. Julien, thank you for being on the call today. And that is absolutely top of mind for us. As you know, and I mentioned in my opening comments, we're able to get to a settlement agreement and the Louisiana staff filed constructive testimony with conditional approval, all that good stuff. So, we want to continue to work that angle. And actually, one of the commissioners suggested that the decision could be recalled at the next meeting for reconsideration once some additional information is shared. So, we have that top of mind for us. So here's what you should expect from SWEPCO. You should expect to see us seeking rehearing in which we continue to be optimistic that we can pool this across the goal line. So, stay tuned on that. I don't want to get too much in the weeds on it just yet because we're literally in game with that right now. And then specifically, we would hope that this is going to move forward, and we'll have all three jurisdictions stepping in line and be able to absorb with positivity, the applications that we have in front of them. But do we have flexibility in terms of flexing up in the other jurisdictions? On a discrete basis, we think that there is that opportunity with the different projects that we have that are included in that filing. So again, nothing specific to share today. But rest assured, we're looking at all the different tools and angles in the tool bag there that we're able to use should we need a different route if Louisiana can't get there. But we're optimistic and we're having conversations, so stay tuned. Yeah. So, let me answer that this way. I don't have specific numbers to share with you today because when we actually had the conversation, we hadn't announced earnings yet, okay? So that's new information today, that's public today. And so this will be the go-back conversation that we'll have. And again, the plan is truly to collaborate, because I'm confident that the commission and the commissioners are interested in having a very sound -- financially sound utility company. And so we'll all be working in that same direction. Now as far as tools in the tool bag, obviously, we'll try to influence the top-line with economic development and things of that nature. That takes a little longer, as you know, because it's got a little longer lead time on it. But we know we're really successful with that, too. So stay tuned. And then, of course, we'll be very sensitive to cost as well. The other thing that will be top of mind for us is using the new tools in the tool bag is securitization, okay? So, we've got deferred storm costs that are sitting on the balance sheet. We have an opportunity to take care of net plant of legacy coal plants that's sitting on the balance sheet, too, to the tune of something like $290 million associated with Big Sandy. So those are things that we'll be able to securitize and then kind of back into what -- how we need to make that math work. And I mentioned that also talks about or at least strikes at the idea of kind of rightsizing the rate base. So, we work with the commission and all the various stakeholders in the state of Kentucky that we deal with to make sure that we're getting where we need to be. But honestly, from my seat and from a utility seat, just 2.9%, it's not healthy. We need to get it in a healthy situation. And that will be top of mind for us, because we've got to keep the lights on to and keep it affordable. So stay tuned. We don't have a lot of color to share today because we're literally in game. This is a new data point with 2.9%, okay? But Sophie, thank you for jumping back in line. Paul, this is Julie. Actually, securitization will be a great thing, and that helps us, give us a little more flexibility, more importantly, it's good for the customer. And so, when we filed for our new ENEC filing that we made on what was it like February -- I'm sorry, April 28, I think, was the date that we filed it. What you'll see is that we have two proposed options to recover the fuel balance in our filing. And one is to spread the recovery over three years, and the other is to use securitization for the under-recovered fuel balance. And as part of that, we also looked in as an option, again, with the idea and backdrop and motivation is to protect the customer rates because we can't have them trying to swallow a watermelon here is to essentially securitize plant balances from legacy coal plants, so Amos and Mountaineer in particular, and I think we have some storm costs in there as well. And so when I mentioned today, that $1.84 billion number that we would like to securitize, that's all in. And so, we're trying to give the commission options so that we can all work collectively to make sure that the citizens and customers of West Virginia are protected, but that we still have a healthy utility and we're able to hit the balance sheet metrics that we need. So, it's doable. It's absolutely doable, we'll just need to move through the process. Yes. So as far as FERC and the other two approvals that we'll need to get, let me answer it this way. When we made the filing initially, we had requested at FERC a 60-day approval process. So, we would like to get an order within 60 days. May 22 would be 60 days. And given that this is normal kind of traditional business unregulated, not tied to significant customers and multiple stakeholders, we don't anticipate any material roadblock as it relates to getting not only FERC approval, but the clearance from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States and/or approval under any of the applicable competition loss. So we're comfortable with where we are and expect that we should have that in pretty short order, which gives us confidence to say we think that we'll get this done by the end of the second quarter at the latest. But we'll keep you apprised if anything were to come up. But at this point, we're past commentary periods, and everything seems to be going relatively smoothly. So, anyway, I'll leave it at that, and suggest that if anything shifts, we'll be right in front of you immediately."

            "name": "Ann Kelly",
            "content": "Thank you, Julie and Darcy. It's good to be with you all this morning, and thanks for dialing in. I'm going to walk us through our first quarter results, share some updates on our service territory load and finish with commentary on credit metrics and liquidity, as well as some thoughts on our guidance, financial targets, and portfolio management. Let's go to Slide 9, which shows the comparison of GAAP to operating earnings for the quarter. GAAP earnings for the first quarter were $0.77 per share compared to $1.41 per share in 2022. For the quarter, I'll mention that we reflected the loss on the expected sale of the contracted renewables business as a non-operating cost, as well as an adjustment to true-up expected cost related to the Kentucky transaction in addition to our typical mark-to-market adjustment. There's a detailed reconciliation of GAAP to operating earnings on Page 15 of the presentation deck. Let's walk through our quarterly operating earnings performance by segment on Slide 10. Operating earnings for the quarter totaled $1.11 per share or $572 million compared to $1.22 per share or $616 million in 2022. The lower performance was primarily driven by the unfavorable weather, as Julie mentioned. When looking at historical weather in the first quarter of the past 30 years, we've only seen one quarter with more mild weather than the first quarter of 2023. Operating earnings for our Vertically Integrated Utilities were $0.52 per share, down $0.07. Favorable drivers included rate changes across multiple jurisdictions, normalized retail load, off-system sales primarily associated with Rockport Unit 2, transmission revenue and depreciation. I have more to share and load and performance, and we'll get to that in a minute. These items were more than offset by unfavorable weather, higher O&M and income taxes largely related to timing differences between the years and interests. We expect the year-over-year interest variance to be more pronounced in the first half of the year, as interest rates have somewhat stabilized. We also expect to see favorable O&M in the second half of the year compared to prior year, reflecting the timing of O&M spending and near-term actions that we are taking to help offset the unfavorable weather, such as holding positions open, reducing travel and adjusting the timing of discretionary spending. These actions are in addition to our ongoing efficiency efforts that allow us to offset the impact of inflation each year. I would like to take a second to talk about the off-system sales and depreciation. Due to the purchase of Rockport Unit 2 in December, we are seeing $0.05 of favorable off-system sales year-over-year since the margins are no longer shared with our retail customers. Also, due to the expiration of Rockport Unit 2 lease, I&M will see approximately $0.055 net favorable depreciation each of the first three quarters of 2023, plus an additional $0.035 in Q4. Including the impact of the Rockport lease, depreciation was $0.02 favorable versus the first quarter of last year. However, if you exclude the impact of the lease, depreciation would have been about $0.04 unfavorable, which is consistent with the incremental investment and a higher depreciable base in our Vertically Integrated Utilities segment. The Transmission and Distribution Utilities segment earned $0.24 per share, down $0.06 compared to last year. Favorable drivers in this segment included rate changes from the distribution cost recovery factor rider in Texas and the distribution investment rider in Ohio, as well as transmission revenue. Offsetting these favorable items were unfavorable weather, unfavorable O&M largely due to higher distribution spending in the quarter, higher interest and lower normalized retail sales due to customer mix. The AEP Transmission Holdco segment contributed $0.35 per share, up $0.01 compared to last year, primarily driven by $0.02 of favorable investment growth. Generation & Marketing produced $0.09 per share, up $0.06 from last year. Favorable drivers here include a higher retail and wholesale power margins, favorable development site sales, depreciation, and taxes. And finally, Corporate and Other was down $0.05 per share, largely driven by unfavorable interest. I'll note that this is due to both an increase in interest rates as well as higher debt balances. I'd like to remind everyone that we reflected the higher interest rates in our guidance that we provided on our year-end 2022 earnings call. While the quarter was unfavorable to the prior year, we are taking actions to offset the unfavorable weather, including the O&M refinements that I just mentioned, that give us confidence to reaffirm our full year guidance range. Turning to Slide 11, I'll provide an update on our normalized load performance for the quarter. We've continued to see load growth outperform when it's proving to be a weak economy across our service areas. This is most evident when comparing load performance across retail classes. So, we are seeing some weakness in residential loads. Our commercial and industrial classes are benefiting from new large customer volumes from our ongoing economic development efforts. This provides some potential upside to the full year outlook. Beginning in the upper left hand corner of the slide, normalized residential load was down as customers continue to be squeezed by the relationship between inflation and income growth. That relationship is a key driver of residential usage, and we expect to see it stabilize over the rest of the year. While we are seeing a decline in residential uses for customer, total residential customer counts were up by 0.5%, demonstrating growth in our service territory. Looking through the rest of the slide, you'll see that this was substantially offset by gains in our commercial and industrial loads attributable to new large customer additions. Normalized commercial sales accelerated an exceptional 7.8% compared to the first quarter of 2022. Though the growth in commercial sales was spread across many of our operating companies, gains were especially robust in AEP Texas and AEP Ohio, attributable to the new data center projects coming online in the new year. Outside of data centers, commercial gains were driven primarily by real estate, general merchandise stores, and food and drink establishments as individuals continue to move more freely in the wake of the pandemic. If we look to the lower left hand corner, we see the industrial sales resume their healthy pace of growth, increasing 5.1% from a year ago. As with commercial sales, gains were most robust in AEP Texas, while SWEPCO also experienced double-digit growth in its industrial sales. Looking at individual sectors, gains are most pronounced among oil and gas extraction and primary metal. You'll note that despite our strong commercial and industrial results for the first quarter, our expectations for 2023 load growth are still muted. Probability of a national downturn is extraordinarily high, and it's clear that activity is already slowed to a point that it's having a material impact on our customers' finances. While we expect the pace of economic growth to slow further, we don't anticipate a severe economic contraction across our service area in 2023. Though weaker than they were a year ago, household finances are still healthy by historical standards. Furthermore, the labor market continues to be resilient in the face of Fed rate hikes, which will serve to limit the severity of a potential downturn. These assumptions have been baked into our full year guidance for some time allowing us confidence that our projected load growth for 2023 is very much achievable. Adding to that confidence is our believe that there is more upside to our load projections than downside, stemming from a disciplined commitment to economic development across our service area. We know that working with local stakeholders to attract more economic activity is a key strategy to providing value to our customers. This allows us to continue to prioritize investments that will improve the customer experience while mitigating the rate impacts on our customer base. So, let's move to Slide 12 to discuss the company's capitalization and liquidity position. Taking a look at the upper left quadrant on this page, you can see our FFO to debt metric stands at 11.4%, which is a decrease of 1.8% from year-end and below our long-term target. The primary reason for this decrease is a $1.9 billion increase in balance sheet debt during the quarter, partially due to the return of the mark-to-market collateral positions associated with the decline in natural gas and power prices. Return of collateral also reduces our funds from operations, so it hits us on both sides of the equation. Without the fluctuations in our mark-to-market collateral positions, our FFP to debt metric will be closer to 13%. We expect that this metric will improve by year-end as we reduce debt after the close of the announced renewable sale and our 2020 equity units conversion, and our funds from operation improve over prior year, predominantly in the fourth quarter. We remain committed to our targeted FFO to debt range of 14% to 15% and plan to trend back into this range early in 2024 as we continue to work through the regulatory recovery processes of our deferred fuel balances. You can see our liquidity summary in the lower left quadrant of the slide. Our five-year $4 billion bank revolver and two-year $1 billion revolving credit facilities that was just extended to March 2025 support our liquidity position, which remains strong at $3.4 billion. The $800 million increase in liquidity from last quarter is mainly due to a decrease in commercial paper outstanding from long-term debt issuances. On a GAAP basis, our debt to capital ratio increased from the prior quarter by 1.2% to 64.1%. We plan to trend back closer to 60% this year as we close our announced sale transaction and complete our previously planned equity units conversion. On the qualified pension front, our funding status decreased 1.1% during the quarter to 101.3%. Rates fell during the quarter, which caused the pension discount rate to decrease, driving an increase in the liability that was greater than the gain on assets. Now turning to Slide 13. The first quarter has brought a significant challenge our way in the form of unfavorable weather. As we progress through the remainder of the year, we will continue to take action to manage our business and mitigate this impact. Our core business remains in a strong position and we are reaffirming our operating earnings guidance range of $5.19 to $5.39. We also continue to be committed to our long-term growth rate of 6% to 7%. As Julie previously addressed regarding the terminated Kentucky sale transaction, we are establishing a new -- a renewed focus in long-term strategy in order to maximize the full potential of our Kentucky operations going forward. We are on track to close the divestiture of our unregulated contracted renewables portfolio in the second quarter of this year, have announced the sale of our retail and distributed resources businesses, and are embarking on a review of some transmission joint ventures. These initiatives will help us to simplify and derisk our business while we continue to focus on the fundamentals, executing the $40 billion transmission, distribution and regulated renewables capital plan, disciplined O&M management and positive regulatory outcome. We really appreciate your time and attention today. And with that, I'm going to ask Alan to open the call so we can hear what's on your mind and answer any questions that you have. Right. So, our capital plan, the $40 billion capital plan going forward is not going to change. We would just be reallocating from other areas within the same segment. So, you would expect to see the transmission, distribution, generation, all those planned numbers for the five-year timeframe will stay the same. We will just allocate within jurisdictions to Kentucky to make sure that they are focused on reliability, as Julie mentioned. Yeah. So what I talked about earlier was based on that scenario. We have not modeled in any additional asset sales transactions besides the contracted applicable. So, we would expect an improvement by year-end and getting it within our targeted metrics early next year. And that's due to the ownership structure. So, we didn't want to move it because it's still owned by the Vertically Integrated Utilities. Yeah, I mean you're absolutely right, Julie. And when we look at the cash flows, which are on Slide 24 that we've only modeled in the contracted renewables sale here. So any additional sales proceeds will also be able to strengthen the balance sheet. And as we mentioned, we could potentially selectively reduce the equity issuances going forward, while maintaining the same capital plan. Yes, I'll take that, Julie. So, we would expect to collect over the extended timeframes that we have already agreed upon within our jurisdictions. And with respect to West Virginia, we have that model taking advantage of the securitization in the first quarter or the first half of next year. And one thing just to add on FFO to debt, when you think about just the quarterly dynamics, in Q4 of last year, due to market conditions, we did have a significant outflow of collateral as well as an increase in deferred fuel. So, as we get through that this year, and that quarter rolls off, that will significantly help our FFO to debt as well."

After the speaker's remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would like to turn the conference over to Darcy Reese, Vice-President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nDarcy Reese: Thank you, Danica. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the third quarter 2024 earnings call for American Electric Power. We appreciate you taking time today to join us. Our earnings release, presentation slides, and related financial information are available on our website at aep.com. Today, we will be making forward-looking statements during the call. There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements. Please refer to our SEC filings for discussion of these factors. Joining me this morning for opening remarks are Bill Fehrman, our President and Chief Executive Officer and Chuck Zebula, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We will take your questions following their remarks. I will now turn the call over to Bill.\nWilliam Fehrman: Thank you, Darcy and good morning everyone. I'm happy to be with you for my first earnings call as AEP's President and CEO. In my remarks this morning, I'll discuss our results and outlook before turning to the key pillars of our strategy to enhance value for customers and investors. I'll then cover regulatory updates before handing it over to Chuck to walk through our financials in more detail. You can find a summary of third quarter 2024 business highlights on Slide 4 of our presentation. We have a lot of exciting ground to cover today, but first I'd like to briefly introduce myself to those I haven't had the opportunity to meet yet. I spent my entire career in the utility and energy business. Most recently I was at Berkshire Hathaway Energy, which has an asset base 1.4 times the size of AEP, operates in 11 states but also in Canada and Great Britain and has a diverse group of regulatory interests. While I'm familiar with most of the industry players, bankers, regulators, companies and debt investors, I am new to many of the AEP shareholders and I look forward to delivering for you. With that, I'm honored to join a leader like AEP at a pivotal time for both the organization and our industry. Since assuming the role of CEO, I've met our many stakeholders and the AEP team across our 11 state footprint, including four governors and over 30 regulators and legislators. We've had robust discussions about critical initiatives and I've appreciated the opportunity to engage, listen and learn over the past three months to help shape our vision for the future. AEP has built a strong foundation for growth, including our robust transmission system, which represents 55% of AEP's total earnings stream. However, we can improve reliability, streamline cost, use technology better, and put power in the hands of local leaders to build financially strong utilities in our communities. I look forward to the future and working with the many talented people across the company to drive operational excellence, best-in-class service earnings growth and overall success. I'll begin with our financial results. Today we report third quarter 2024 operating earnings of $1.85 per share, or $985 million. Building on our strong momentum this year we are confident in narrowing our 2024 full year operating earnings guidance range to $5.58 to $5.68, maintaining the original $5.63 midpoint. As referenced on Slide 5, today we also formally introduce our 2025 operating earnings guidance range of $5.75 to $5.95. We have thought a lot about this range, especially since I've been in the CEO role for just three months. The foundation of our 2025 earnings guidance range is based on robust growth in our regulated utilities. This range also reflects lower contributions from our generation and marketing segment due to reduced scope of activities going forward and lower retail and wholesale margins likely to be realized. While AEP's earnings range rose 4% in 2025, you have my commitment that we will do significantly better in 2026 and beyond after we go through an optimization exercise and we retool our personnel and processes over the coming months. As the new CEO at AEP, I need to establish a record of delivering on promises to you while demonstrating goodwill to our regulators and customers as we focus on service, reliability and enhanced vegetation management to reduce customer outages. My objective is to improve our customer experience and stakeholder relationships which over time will result in more positive regulatory outcomes and enable a stable platform for growth. AEP's future growth opportunities are very significant as we embrace the large load opportunity in our service territory as well as substantial upgrades to the distribution system. We are focusing on economic development efforts in our states to help address affordability and investing in our energy delivery infrastructure to improve reliability in addition to new generation to support resource adequacy. Because of this tremendous growth, today we are unveiling AEP's new long-term earnings growth rate of 6% to 8% off a 2025 base year and a $5.85 midpoint, all reinforced by a balanced and flexible $54 billion capital plan from 2025 through 2029. When I look at this newly raised $54 billion capital plan, which is up more than 25% over the prior $43 billion plan, there is even more upside to go. In fact, we see significant opportunity to capture $10 billion in incremental transmission and generation infrastructure investment to satisfy all of the load growth. We will provide more details at EEI regarding these investment opportunities that drive our updated 8% rate base CAGR. Note that during the 2025 through 2029 timeframe, we also expect our customer rates will go up by less than 3% annually on a system wide basis due to built headroom created from economic development activities and new generation. Understand that this customer rate impact could change due to effects of potential future generation needs. Please refer to slides 5 and 6. As you know, maintaining a strong balance sheet is critical to funding the increased capital spend associated with these growth rates and we remain committed to responsibly financing our capital needs. In addition to equity and equity like tools, we will explore asset monetization opportunities to the extent they can be executed upon while achieving the right price. If we do explore asset sales, we won't tell you about them until they happen. Our newly rolled forward five year capital and financing plans can be seen in the appendix on slides 13 and 14. Turning to slide 7, our robust financial outlook will be underpinned by a culture of accountability and execution. This business is transforming rapidly and we recognize the need for change to better serve our customers. Since joining the company in August, we have made several changes to align and simplify the organizational structure to ensure we have the right talent and the right roles to execute our strategy and achieve our objectives. For example, our operating company Presidents and Chief Nuclear Officer now report directly to me, while power plants and site managers will report directly to our operating Company Presidents. We have streamlined the leadership structure by eliminating management layers and reorganizing the service corporation. These actions move decision making closer to customers, all to ensure our money making businesses have the authority they need to accelerate improved performance. I'm confident our new structure will help us drive value as we advance three core areas of strategic focus, growth and financial strength, customer service and regulatory integrity. I'd like to spend a few minutes walking through each of these areas. First, AEP's future growth potential and financial strength is significant with customer commitments for 20 gigawatts of load additions through 2029 driven by data center demand and we have updated our load growth forecast accordingly through 2027. In fact, large load impacts are already being felt in our service territories, predominantly in Ohio, Texas and Indiana. This is demonstrated in our third quarter results in which we realized commercial load growth of 7.9% compared to the third quarter of last year and 10.1% growth year-to-date in 2024 compared to 2023. We are committed to supporting this new load growth in our service territory, but we also remain focused on ensuring affordability by fairly allocating costs resulting from associated incremental investments. This is why we proactively filed the data center tariff in Ohio, the large load tariff modifications in Indiana, Kentucky and West Virginia, and a complaint with FERC related to a co-located load arrangement. Load growth from data center demand has the potential to benefit all stakeholders including investors, customers and local communities, but only with fair and proper cost allocation. While some may think that our FERC complaint is anti-data center, it is actually the opposite. We are trying to welcome all data centers to our service territory by making sure that those data centers help all customers. The second area of focus for us is best-in-class customer service. We will leverage technology to enhance service and better meet our customers\u2019 energy needs through reliability and outage reductions while transforming our processes with a focus on efficiency and accountability. Business transformation and technology innovation will also drive O&M discipline to help keep customer rates affordable amid rising costs and a growing rate base. The last pillar of our strategy is regulatory integrity. We will listen to and respect the preferences of our regulators, policymakers and communities to achieve positive regulatory outcomes. If our states want renewables, we will work with them to deliver. If they want continued operation of coal or investment in gas or nuclear, we will work with them to deliver. As long as our states pay for what they want and we are treated fairly, we will deliver. At the same time, we will work closely with key stakeholders to advance affordability, system reliability, resiliency and security. To that end, we have aligned our organizational structure to strengthen our focus at the state level, and we continue to prioritize improving our earned ROEs as we listen to each of our states and their preferences. While it will take time for this work to bear fruit, this is headed in the right direction. Continuing on our operating companies achieved a number of other positive regulatory developments in the third quarter as well. Starting with AEP Texas, last month, the Commission issued an order approving a unanimous and unopposed comprehensive settlement which included a 9.76% ROE. The order was effective October 1st. In Oklahoma, major parties reached a settlement agreement with a 9.5% ROE in early October, and the ALJ recommended approval of the settlement without any modifications. While PSO awaits a commission decision, interim rates were implemented on October 23rd. In Virginia, a hearing was held in September related to the biennial filing, focusing primarily on incremental investment. A Commission order is required in November, with rates going into effect in early January 2025. Last week, APCO refiled its base case in West Virginia, requesting a 10.8% ROE while also offering securitization as the rate mitigation concept to the proposed $250.5 million base rate increase. This securitization option includes $2.4 billion of undepreciated plant balances, CCR and ELG investments, fuel deferrals and storm expenses. While reduced rate base of $1.9 billion would result from securitizing the plant balances and environmental investments, any earnings impact would be dependent on how quickly we redeploy capital throughout the business. That said, we should have an early indication from the Commission if securitization is preferred and we would plan capital redeployment accordingly. But let me be very clear, securitization is not included in our new five year capital and financing plans introduced today and is not needed to hit our credit metrics. Rather, securitization is driven by the desire to consider alternative rate case options to mitigate customer bill impacts. I was highly disappointed by the initial rate case filing that was rejected by West Virginia. Be assured that going forward, additional internal quality control checks and leadership changes have been implemented to ensure that each of our operating companies filings meet all requirements. A rate case rejection should not happen like it did in West Virginia, and I won't accept this kind of performance from our team. Moving on to SWEPCO, updated formula rates went into effect in early August for Louisiana, in mid-October for Arkansas. And finally, I&M issued new requests for proposals or RFPs for both owned resources and PPAs seeking to secure up to 4,000 megawatts of diverse generation resources for target completion by year end 2028 or 2029 to support new load growth in the region. As such, we expect to make the applicable regulatory filings in 2025. So in short, while the team is making progress towards achieving positive regulatory outcomes, we do have more work to do. We look forward to continuing to engage constructively with our regulators and strengthen new relationships, including by investing more resources at the local level and focusing on delivering what our individual states want as outcomes. The bottom line here is we have made progress transforming the business over the past three months, but we have significantly more wood to chop. Before wrapping up, I'd like to briefly update you on a legal item. AEP and the Security Exchange Commission are engaged in discussions about possible resolution of the SEC's ongoing investigation and we recorded a loss contingency of $19 million in the third quarter. Given this is an active matter, we don't plan on making any further comments on this matter. I'd now like to close by reiterating my strong confidence in the tremendous potential for AEP's growth and success well into the future. With the support, dedication and hard work of the entire AEP team, we are well positioned to continue providing safe, reliable and affordable service while advancing our long-term strategy to deliver value to our stakeholders. Related to our new vision statement of improving customer\u2019s lives with reliable, affordable power, we will accomplish this together through commitment and execution. I look forward to seeing many of you in a few days at EEI where we'll be happy to discuss our newly released financial plans in even more detail. I'll now give the floor to Chuck.\nCharles Zebula: Thank you, Bill. It's been a pleasure working with you over the past three months. Your leadership and passion for operational excellence and customer service is infectious, and everyone at AEP looks forward to working with you to capture the incredible opportunities that we have before us. Good morning everyone. Let me move on with the discussion of the third quarter results. Slide 8 shows the comparison of GAAP to operating earnings for the quarter. GAAP earnings for the third quarter were $1.80 per share compared to $1.83 per share in 2023. Year-to-date, GAAP earnings are $4.35 per share versus $3.62 per share last year. There's a detailed reconciliation of GAAP to operating earnings for the third quarter and year-to-date results on pages 20 and 21, respectively. Let's walk through our operating earnings performance by segment for the third quarter on Slide 9. Operating earnings for the third quarter totaled $1.85 per share, or $985 million, compared to $1.77 per share, or $924 million in 2023. Operating earnings for vertically integrated utilities were $1.08 per share, up $0.08. Positive drivers included rate changes across multiple jurisdictions driven by outcomes in Virginia and Indiana, higher normalized retail sales and lower income taxes. These items were partially offset by higher depreciation and O&M. The transmission and distribution utility segment earned $0.46 per share, up $0.07 compared to last year. Positive drivers in this segment include rate changes driven by the distribution cost recovery factor in Texas and the distribution investment rider in Ohio along with higher transmission revenue. These items were partially offset by lower normalized retail sales and higher depreciation. The AEP transmission Holdco segment contributed $0.40 per share, up a penny compared to last year, primarily driven by investment growth. Generation and marketing produced $0.19 per share, up a penny from last year. Favorable drivers included higher retail margins and lower interest expense. These items were partially offset by lower wholesale margins and higher income taxes compared to last year. Finally, Corporate and Other was down $0.09 compared to the prior year, primarily driven by higher interest expense, timing of other operating revenue, higher income taxes and O&M. The year-to-date operating earnings segment detail is shown on page 16 of the presentation. Note that year-to-date, operating earnings are up $0.36 per share this year, increasing from $4.02 per share in 2023 to $4.38 per share this year or about a 9% increase year-to-date. The data on Slide 10 shows continued strong growth in load. Weather normalized retail sales grew 2.1% in the third quarter. This marks the 14th consecutive quarter of load growth across our system, and year-to-date overall weatherized normalized retail sales grew 2.9%. Declining residential sales have been offset by double-digit growth of 10.1% in commercial sales. Thanks to the game changing developments around data centers and AI. Also, our industrial sales have consistently grown despite challenging economic conditions for many of our customers. Our companies have attracted a steady pipeline of economic development projects over the past several years and those projects are beginning to come to fruition. Besides the data centers, we also see companies investing in energy, manufacturing and primary metals driving consistent growth in our industrial sales. Industrial sales grew 1/2 of 1% in the quarter, propelled by nearly 5% growth in Texas. Looking ahead to 2025 and beyond, you'll notice that we have updated our sales projections out to 2027 in this presentation. Looking first at 2025, we are projecting overall sales to increase by an additional 8.3% over our estimate for this year. Flat residential sales will continue to be offset by double-digit growth in the commercial segment. This growth is propelled by a mix of new and existing customers spread across our Ohio, Indiana and Texas service territories. In the T&D segment, we estimate about 30% year-over-year growth in commercial sales each in AEP Ohio and AEP Texas. And in the vertically integrated segment, our projections have commercial sales at I&M up nearly 60% year-over-year. Note this is happening now, and in the next several years, not later this decade. New customer growth will also support a projected increase in industrial sales of 1.6% next year, with most of that growth expected to be powered by ongoing economic development in Texas. We have several large energy and manufacturing loads slated to come online within the next year. While these numbers are substantial, we take a lot of comfort in the fact that the large load additions reflected in these forecasts are all backed by signed customer financial commitments. In AEP Ohio and I&M, nearly all of these loads are backed by take or pay contracts. This means that customers are locked in to pay for a minimum amount of power over the next several years depending on their local tariff. Also, the impact of higher loads will enable our fixed costs to be spread over a higher base, benefiting all customers. As Bill mentioned, based on contract activity across the system, we expect about 20 gigawatts of additional load to come online through the end of the decade. For context, our summer peak load at the end of last year was 35 gigawatt. This represents about a 60% increase in peak load in the next six years. That magnitude of increase in peak load is driving the sales projections that you see in Slide 10. We expect consistent retail growth above 8% over the next three years, driven by not only double digit commercial load increases, but accelerating gains in the industrial space. Roughly half of the additions are located in our PJM footprint, mostly hyper scale data centers in Ohio and Indiana. The other half are located almost entirely in AEP Texas. However, the growth in Texas is more diverse and spread across both data processors and large industrial customers. The last time we have seen sustained years of load growth in the 8% range. The Beatles in the late 1960s were still making music. Truly, this is a pivotal and transformational time for our company as we work to capture this opportunity. Let's move on to slide 11. In the top left table you can see the FFO to Debt Metric stands at 14.7% for the 12 months ended September 30, which is a 10 basis point increase from the prior quarter. Our debt-to-cap decreased slightly from last quarter and was 62.1% at quarter end. We understand that in its next credit opinion in March, Moody's intend to change how it treats deferred fuel impacts to align the consolidated view of AEP without how our subsidiary company metrics are calculated. Importantly, based on discussions with Moody's in our annual management meeting last week, their view of AEP's credit is not changing and we will continue to exceed our downgrade threshold of 13% in all forecasted periods. We are committed to a goal of being in the 14% to 15% FFO-to-debt range and regardless the impact of deferred fuel on our metrics will dissipate to a normal state over the next two years. Again, importantly, this does not change our cash inflows or Moody's view of our credit profile. In the lower left part of this slide you can see our liquidity summary which remains strong at 5.5 billion and is supported by 6 billion in credit facilities. Lastly, on the qualified pension front, our funding status remains stable at 99%. In summary, our third quarter and year-to-date financial results put us in a strong position to meet our goals this year and we are tightening our 2024 guidance range to $558 to $568 per share and also in the quarter, I'll note that we completed the sale of AEP on site partners with approximately $320 million of net proceeds received at the end of September. For 2025, we have set our operating earnings guidance range at $575 to $595 per share with a guidance midpoint of $585 roughly 4% growth from our 2024 midpoint guidance estimate. Our 2025 earnings guidance is based on a strong foundation of growth in our regulated businesses and lower contributions in the generation and marketing segment due to the reduced scope of activities as well as lower expected retail and wholesale margins in the segment. Going forward, we expect improved performance in our vertically integrated utility segment as we work to narrow the gap between our earned and authorized ROEs and invest where we have alignment with our regulators. We have also introduced a robust long-term growth rate of 6% to 8% from the 2025 guidance midpoint. This is supported by a $54 billion capital plan which is more than a 25% increase from our previous five year plan. These investments with 63% related to wires and 26% related to new generation result in a five year rate base CAGR of nearly 8%. Future updates to capital are more likely to go up as we continue to see economic development activities in our territories due to our high voltage 765 transmission backbone, our attractive industrial footprint in Texas, as well as the incremental transmission and generation infrastructure that Bill described earlier. Our 5-year cash flow and financing plan forecast is shown in the Appendix on Slide 14. We have consolidated the forecast over the five year period as impacts in individual years due to large loads, generation investments and tax credits will have inter-period movement over time. Note however, the plan is supported with equity, equity like instruments, opportunities to explore, portfolio optimization as well as efficiently monetizing tax credits related to our investments in renewable generation and from our existing nuclear facility. In addition, we will decouple our dividend growth rate from our earnings growth rate resulting in a lower dividend payout ratio over time in the range of 55% to 65%. This will allow us to retain additional cash flow to fund our increased capital plan and new growth objectives while maintaining a market competitive shareholder return. Access to the capital markets is critical and we will finance sensibly to protect and maintain our balance sheet solidly in the investment grade category. We appreciate everyone's time today and your interest in AEP. We look forward to seeing many of you at the EEI conference next week. Operator, can you open the call so that we can address your questions? Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Shar Pourezza with Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead.\nShar Pourezza: Hey, guys. Good morning.\nWilliam Fehrman: Morning.\nShar Pourezza: Morning, Bill. So, obviously, big update this morning. Cleared the decks and rebased as we're thinking about your new 6% to 8% growth rate. Asset sales haven't helped, but anything you can point to that can be maybe incremental to your 2025 guide. Any tailwinds that aren't in plan, like maybe on the cost side and as we're thinking about maybe the longer range, you have material load growth driven by the data centers. Has the 20 gigawatts of customer commitments hit any of your numbers? Or could some of those opportunities become further accretive as we saw with some of your peers during this earnings season? Thanks.\nWilliam Fehrman: Yes, thanks, Shar. With regards to additional opportunities, clearly this year we've done a number of things across the company. We had a voluntary separation plan that was put in place to help offset inflation. And as we're looking at transforming the company, I did bring on an expert in transformation who's worked with me for many years, who will help us continue to look for opportunities to take costs out of the business, look for more opportunities to reduce layers of management and expand span of control of the management team. All in the effort to remove bureaucracy out of the company and reduce bloat. And so clearly there's opportunities for that. I've just been here three months, so we've got a lot yet to do. As I noted in my comments, a lot of wood to chop yet around the company. And so we've looked at what we were able to do and made sure that we were confident in what we put into those numbers at this time. But clearly more to do with regards to the 20 gigawatts that is essentially in the plan. 12 gigawatts of that is in the first three years of the plan, with the remainder towards the end of the plan. But we've got more opportunities out there. As I noted, $10 billion of transmission potential generation development. Again, as I was sorting through the numbers here with the $54 billion capital plan that we have, making sure that that was fully understood and that we could deliver it. But there's much more load growth to come for this company and I would say we're only really limited by our ability to execute on the opportunities that are in front of us. Chuck, anything to add?\nShar Pourezza: Okay, got it. And then just lastly on the funding source. So 5.35 billion in equity needs. You obviously kind of mentioned asset sales. Can you just give us a sense on the asset? Is it transmission as media has been reporting, or the off goes an opportunity and just maybe a sense of timing? When do you need the equity? Thanks.\nWilliam Fehrman: Yes, with regards to potential asset sales and stuff, we won't comment on those until something might happen, but we're clearly going to consider sort of all of the above to get us to where we need. Chuck, you want to.\nCharles Zebula: Yes, sure. I would just add to that, in our plan we also will pursue equity like products out there, instruments that give us equity credit. You'll note in my comments, we are looking to decouple our dividend growth rate from our earnings growth rate as well, which would drift the payout ratio lower as well. We do have PTC and ITC monetization and as far as any asset monetization opportunities, as Bill said, we are looking holistically at all alternatives. As you look at the needs that we have and the timing of such, we will need equity support in 2025 and how and how that comes it could come in any of the forms that I just talked.\nShar Pourezza: Okay, that's perfect. Thanks, guys. We'll see you in a couple days. Appreciate it.\nWilliam Fehrman: Yes. Thanks, Shar.\nOperator: All right, our next question comes from Steve Fleischman with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nSteven Fleischman: Yes, hi. Good morning. Thanks for the time. So first, the new kind of outlook. What are you seeing in terms of earned returns across the utilities over the period? Are you you've had the issue with the earning below? Do you have that improving over the period by how much? Any sense on that?\nWilliam Fehrman: So as we look at our regulatory opportunities right now for the regulated utilities, we're looking at a 9.1% ROE tend to plan. As I've gone around and met with the states, as I noted in my comments, our focus is changing to where we will be working with them to understand what they want to be able to achieve, and we will work to deliver that with them. And through that, then we would hope to continue to improve the relationship that we have with the regulator. And hopefully that then also then turns into more positive outcomes with regards to ROE and the general relationship that we have. As part of that, we also have to significantly improve our customer service. I've noted that we have to put more investment into the distribution side of the business, vegetation management, reduce outage time, and all of that will then go to helping us with regards to our regulatory relations and customer service. So we're very, very focused on that. I've made it around now to seven of our states in the three months I've been here to meet with the regulators, and we're continuing to build those relationships. And as I noted in West Virginia, we made the new filing very disappointed in the quality of our prior filing. We've made changes internally to correct that. And so we'll be very much focused on these returns. And I know how much it adds to our business as we're able to get those closer to our allowance.\nSteven Fleischman: Thank you. One other question just on the balance sheet. I appreciate the clear commentary on the Moody's and the deferred fuel. I just want to maybe restate or to clarify what you said. So they are going to make the adjustment. It sounds like you might be temporarily below the 14 to 15 target, but above the 13% downgrade threshold. And that overall the general view of the credit is that it's stable. Is that fair?\nWilliam Fehrman: I think that's an accurate representation of what I said.\nSteven Fleischman: Okay. Okay, thank you.\nOperator: All right, our next question comes from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nJeremy Tonet: Hi, good morning.\nWilliam Fehrman: Good morning.\nJeremy Tonet: Just wanted to speak to the data centers in Ohio, I guess, a little bit more. And given the challenge there, could you speak to settlement dynamics in your data center tariff proposal, given, all the stakeholder, I guess, views on this?\nWilliam Fehrman: Sure. As we've looked at the data center opportunities in Ohio, one of our fundamental principles around all of this is to ensure that our existing customer base is not negatively impacted by the significant increase in data center load that is being proposed for the state. And as such, we filed a tariff in Ohio that would essentially put more pressure on the data centers to stand up for the costs that they're creating on the system. And that filing has been going through the process. There's been settlements filed by the data center coalition, as well as ourselves with a number of other parties, including the staff from the commission. And right now that's moving the hearing on December 3rd, and we would expect to get an outcome from the commission shortly after that. But conversations are still going. We want that load in Ohio. We definitely want it to be on our system and we want to see that growth, but we also want to make sure that our existing customer base is not negatively impacted by this. And so we'll do what we need to ensure that we protect that customer base. And I think, honestly I've worked with data centers for a long time. In my prior role at Berkshire and Iowa in particular, we had a significant customer base of data centers there. And I've seen how the load comes on and what the commitments are, and so got a pretty good feeling for how this is going to potentially play out. And we want to make sure that we have everything in place to serve that load, but bottom line is only if we can protect the rest of the customer base.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. Understood. That's helpful there. Thanks. And was just wondering if you could talk a little bit as well on the AEP on your JV proposal with FirstEnergy and Dominion as it relates to the transmission project and I guess what you see as unique or beneficial to this offering versus others.\nWilliam Fehrman: So that was a great partnership led by our transmission team, Antonio Smith and the rest of the team there to pull that coalition together and go in and bid on these projects. Obviously, PJM is putting forth a significant amount of potential transmission investment and it was our view that we're stronger together as entities and that we would have a very, very good chance of winning these projects. And so that JV came together really well and we're working well together and we're excited about hearing where we might end up later next year. But I have confidence in our team and the team from FirstEnergy and Dominion that we're going to come out of this with some really strong opportunities to grow our transmission business.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. Thank you. One quick last one, if I could just on G&M, seems like 2024 is going to notably outperform initial guidance there and AEP is on the midpoint. So just wondering if there's other segments of the business that are kind of underperforming expectations there. Do you expect them to kind of bounce back next year and also the G&M step down next year given the lower scope of the business, as you said, is that to indicate that there could be sales more likely in this segment than others, knowing that you're not going to identify specific asset sales in advance of them happening?\nWilliam Fehrman: So the G&M segment we're reflecting about $0.24 and lower contributions over 2024 and 2025, which is obviously a significant change for us. But we are seeing good improvement across the rest of our lines of business. We're obviously also going to be going after the transmission projects that I noted in my opening comments. And then as far as other potential asset sales as again I said I will consider all things and if they make sense we'll take a look at them, but we'll talk about those at the time.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. Thank you for that.\nOperator: Our next question comes from David Arcaro with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nDavid Arcaro: Good morning. Thanks so much for taking my question.\nWilliam Fehrman: Yes, good morning.\nDavid Arcaro: Morning. Just a bit of a follow up on that. Could you just help me understand the 26 EPS outlook? Is there no G&M earnings contribution there just so I could make sure I understood that and maybe specifically what's driving it to zero there? Is that an implied sale or exit of those businesses or something else?\nWilliam Fehrman: Yes, thanks for the question. And perhaps the slide you're looking at may not make that clear. We're just showing the change in G&M from 2024 to 2025. There would still be a contribution from that segment in 2026 and beyond.\nDavid Arcaro: Got it, got it. Okay, thanks for that. Yes, that's more clear. And then could you touch on how you're thinking about the incremental new generation in terms of the CapEx that has come into the plan? I would assume a lot of that is going to be gas. I'm wondering kind of where, where and when you'd be investing in that kind of what the process is to firm that capital up.\nWilliam Fehrman: So we do have a lot of gas coming into the system. We've got a number of RFPs out on the street as I mentioned, particularly at I&M, and we\u2019ll see what kind of prices come in for those projects. The CapEx will be spread obviously as those projects come into play. But I'll also say that as we continue to work with some of our other states, particularly say West Virginia, there's a lot of opportunity yet to be sorted through in those states with regards to the economic development that they are pushing forward. And so be happy to talk more about these things in detail at the EEI meeting coming up. But really excited about the potential opportunities we have across a number of our states.\nDavid Arcaro: Got it. Okay, great. Well, thank you so much.\nOperator: All right, our next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey, good morning team guys. Thank you very much. Appreciate it.\nWilliam Fehrman: Hey, good morning.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Good morning. Doing quite well, thank you. A couple things real quickly. First off on the G&M piece, I know you elaborated a little bit what's reflected through the course of the plan. Is that more of a static expectation off the 2025 baseline or further moderation there? Again, I know you clarified the 9:1 on the utility component, but just on the other piece there if you can.\nWilliam Fehrman: Yes, Julien, I think that the business supports the level that we would see in 2025.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Okay, all right. Through the plan. Excellent. Thank you for that. Appreciate all the details. And then related here, you know, 765 has really caught a lot of attention across all the RTOs. I just want to make sure I understand what's reflected in this new CapEx baseline as far as 765 adoption goes across the various footprints. And again, I know you provided particularly detail on this coalition here in PGM. But to what extent can we see sort of comparable efforts emerge, say in ERCOT or what have you, as some of the 765 details become a little bit more formalized here, if you will.\nWilliam Fehrman: So obviously we have a big opportunity in ERCOT around the 765 down there in the event that they decide to go that way. We've put in our proposals for that significant opportunity in the Permian area, significant opportunity on the various backbone growth areas for, for Texas. That just alone is a good $4 billion or $5 billion of opportunity potential there for us on the 765 front. We've also got good 765 opportunities in PJM and SVP as well. And so the fact that AEP is essentially the only U.S. Company that knows how to build and operate 765 gives us a strong competitive advantage in these situations and certainly something that I'm very excited about to pursue. That's one of the really strong strategic things that frankly AEP has done over the years is build out this 765kV backbone because it's paying huge dividends right now as all of this load growth is starting to combine. And I think that's being seen by some of the other decision makers around who are looking for ways to significantly increase their ability to move energy. And so with the 765kV experience that we have, I'm very excited about the opportunity to engage with ERCOT, SVP and PJM and maybe a little bit in MISO.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Yes, it's pretty exciting, actually. Quick clarification on the utility ROE. You're moderating it to 9:1 seemingly from your earlier plan despite the accelerating load. Is there something else disintermediating that relationship? I mean, I could imagine a few things, but I'm curious if there was anything purposeful there.\nWilliam Fehrman: Nothing really purposeful. We're trying to continue to increase the ROE and work diligently with the regulators. If you blend in, the transmission component of this, we're at 9:3. Obviously we want to continue to get up closer to our allowance, but frankly, we have to earn our way up. As I said, we've had some mishaps in West Virginia that we've now corrected with the most recent filing, and we've got some significant work to do on the customer service side to put us in a better position with our regulator so they're not getting complaints from customers. And so as this continues to move forward, we've got a tremendous amount of wood to chop in this area, but we're very focused on it. We've taken our board through the details of reliability and where we sit, and we've essentially created a new foundation and we're going to blast off from there to really accelerate our improvements in customer service.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Excellent, guys. Talk soon.\nWilliam Fehrman: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Nick Campanella with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nNicholas Campanella: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions today.\nWilliam Fehrman: You bet. Good morning.\nNicholas Campanella: I wasn't around for the Beatles, but I'm excited to be here for the load growth and I wanted to come back to the generation comments? I think you talked about working with regulators and policymakers on whatever solutions can facilitate this higher load outlook. You talked a lot about gas, but in your prepared remarks you also talked about nuclear. And Bill, I know you talked about your love for nuclear in the past, and maybe you can kind of just expand on your thoughts of how nuclear kind of fits into the AEP strategy, if at all. Thanks.\nWilliam Fehrman: Sure. Well, first and foremost, a number of our customers are pursuing projects based on nuclear power plants, and those are many, many years out, as far as I can tell. But we need to continue to work with our customers and if they want to pursue a small modular reactor type of co-location approach, then we'll work with them and we'll continue to work with developers of the various technologies that are out there. But this is going to require a very significant approach to risk mitigation. It will take a combination of the federal government, state government, input from the customer and ourself to build some risk mitigation such that our existing customer base isn't carrying the full exposure of something like this. And we'll, with our nuclear team that we have here, we'll continue to follow the various technologies that are being built in Canada with regards to the BWRX and the new scale plant that's being built in Romania. We'll follow those as well as the GE Hitachi project at TVA and watch how these are progressing. But ultimately if our customers want this and our states want this, then we'll have to figure out a way to deliver it. That's what we do. And so I'm fairly favorable that there'll be one or two designs that make it through the NRC process and will start to be built. But we have to figure out the first of a kind risk and make sure that we are not carrying that, that load and that there's a very broad base of people engaged in this that can help push this along.\nNicholas Campanella: Hey, I really appreciate your thoughts there. And just to tie things off on the 6% to 8% growth rate, so you have 8% rate base growth net of some financing drag. You could also be raising CapEx here too, I hear you on the 10 billion. Where do you kind of think you're trending in this new 6% to 8% range? Over the long-term, do you kind of grow linearly off this midpoint? Could you be kind of higher or lower in certain years? Just trying to understand that. Thank you.\nCharles Zebula: Yes, thanks Nick. The 6% to 8% right is based off the 2025 new midpoint. And as you can imagine, as Bill described, the kind of components of our capital plan and the addition of load over time, I don't expect it to be completely linear like it may have been in the past. So I do expect all years to be in that range. But I certainly don't expect a --if our guidance was linear, we would have just said 7%. Our guidance is 6% to 8%. I think that does mean over the long-term we would average somewhere in between there, but I don't expect it necessarily to be linear.\nNicholas Campanella: Very helpful though, still within the ranges. I appreciate the time today. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Carly Davenport with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nCarly Davenport: Hey, good morning. Thanks so much for taking the questions. Maybe just to start a quick follow up on transmission as we look at the new capital plan, obviously significant increases on that side relative to the prior plan. Just as you think about some of the opportunities in PJM that you ran through in I think Jeremy's question, are those all upside to the plan or is there any spend built in in the back end of this plan related to those opportunities?\nCharles Zebula: Yes, this is all basically upside to the plan. And as I mentioned in my remarks, the potential for $10 billion of additional transmission and new generation build out is what we would be chasing with regards to not only just PJM, but ERCOT, MISO and SPP as well.\nCarly Davenport: Got it. Great, that's helpful. And then just lastly, with the increase in the long-term earnings growth rate to that 6% to 8% range, could you just talk a little bit about how you're thinking about dividend growth relative to that range going forward?\nCharles Zebula: Yes. So Carly, we have followed a pattern of pretty much matching dividend growth, right. With our earnings growth, with the increased capital needs, the cash right from decoupling. Right. The dividend growth from the earnings growth will help fund that. And we would be targeting, a payout ratio in the 55% to 65% range. Our old policy was 60% to 70%. I think right now our payout ratio is in that 63%, 64% range. So we will provide a market competitive total shareholder return opportunity for our shareholders. But that will be decoupled going forward.\nCarly Davenport: Got it. Great. Thank you so much for the color.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrew Wiesel with Scotiabank. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Wiesel: Hi. Thank you. Good morning everyone. If I could first follow up on that dividend question. Are you able to indicate how quickly you expect to go from the roughly 64% to roughly 60%? Or said differently, if earnings are growing at 6% to 8%, what would be a good expectation for dividend growth? Would it be 6% like we've seen, or potentially something slower?\nCharles Zebula: Well, that's a discussion, Andrew. That is, as you know that the board, approves the dividend and we will drift down in that range. It won't be anything significantly abrupt to expect there, but you could imagine, right. That we would just drift down in that range as we go through time.\nAndrew Wiesel: Okay, so sounds like something fairly gradual then. If that's maybe a fair way to put it. Okay. Then on the -- great, thank you. Then on equity, I just want to better understand, I see this slide shows 100 million per year of drip and I fully understand your commentary that asset sales or something like a hybrid might mitigate the need. But for modeling purposes, should we take that 5.35 billion and straight line it over five years? Maybe you could give a little more guidance in terms of timing per year and if this would be an ATM or a block in the absence of one of those alternatives. Thank you.\nCharles Zebula: Yes, so it's a good question. Obviously, consolidating the five year cash flow, just indicates that there's a lot of options on the table. What I would tell you that as I said earlier, we do need equity support in some form in 2025 and 2026 to continue to hit our credit metrics. So I think, as you maybe looked at last year's kind of shape and think of it in a similar way, is a good way to perhaps look at it because we do need support in 2025 in some form or fashion. And we are holistically looking at all of the options, including the equity like securities which wouldn't show up in the true equity line on the cash flow.\nAndrew Wiesel: Okay, can that be a little more direct? What's embedded in the assumption for share count for 2025?\nCharles Zebula: I don't have that specifically. We could talk about that at EEI.\nAndrew Wiesel: Okay, sounds good.\nCharles Zebula: You could follow up with Darcy later.\nAndrew Wiesel: Very good.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bill Appicelli with UBS. Please go ahead.\nWilliam Appicelli: Hi, good morning. Just a question about the. You talked about some of the funding over the years and with the efficient monetization tax credits, can you speak to the magnitude of the tax credits or these going to be contributing to earnings or is this utilization of transferability to provide funding?\nCharles Zebula: Yes, it's just transferability to provide funding. It's neutral to earnings largely. And over the 2025 to 2027 period, it's roughly $300 million a year. In the latter two years there's some ITC opportunities with some solar projects. So you'd be some big, bigger numbers, but in the next three years, about an average of 300 per year.\nWilliam Appicelli: Okay, thank you. And then on the sales outlook on residential, so that had been, trailing a little bit behind expectations, but you are assuming some improvement, back to relatively flatter or slightly positive next year maybe. Can you speak to what's driving that?\nCharles Zebula: Yes, I mean, it's a trend I think that we and others are seeing in the industry as well as people have returned to work as inflation has crept in and the share of the wallet becomes more critical. I think you're just seeing reduced usage. We are seeing increased customer counts, in places like Texas and Oklahoma and Ohio and other areas. But it's not offsetting, right. The existing customer decline in usage. We do think that that levels off at some point in time. I think there's also probably some energy, continued energy efficiency things creeping in there. But nonetheless, we're as we, as you see in our forecast, after some years of decline, we're now assuming it flat going forward pretty much.\nWilliam Appicelli: Okay. All right. And then just lastly, maybe just you can speak to the colocation issues, that FERC has recently addressed. You guys did intervene in the case. Maybe can you just highlight what you think next steps are, coming out of FERC or some of the policy issues more broadly?\nWilliam Fehrman: Yes sure. So this is a very simple issue in our mind. If you use the transmission system, you should pay for it. It's really that simple. And our view of colocation is that we don't have an issue with colocation. We don't have an issue with data centers looking to use nuclear power plants as an energy source. But what we do have an issue with is when they use the transmission system and try not to pay for it. That's a problem for us because that cost gets shifted to other customers. And so as this process continues to go through the FERC decision making process, we'll continue to reiterate our concerns around cost allocation. And at the end of the day for us it's, it's just a simple principle. If you use the transmission system, pay for it. And that's really where we're at.\nWilliam Appicelli: Okay, great. See you next week. Thank you.\nWilliam Fehrman: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Anthony Crowdell with Mizuho. Please go ahead.\nAnthony Crowdell: Hey, good morning. Hey, Nick. Did. I'm sorry, Chuck, did Nick have you write that Beatles reference?\nCharles Zebula: I think he may have. I think he may have.\nAnthony Crowdell: Well, that's great. Just two cleanups. I think one of them to Julien's question on the ROE improvement that you're seeing, 9.1%. What's a fair assumption where we should start baking in that improvement? Is it gradual over time or is that something you think we could bake in a certain year?\nCharles Zebula: Yes. So trailing 12 months, as you could see in the deck, we're at 9.0% for the entire regulated complex. So I think as you think about going into next year, you should think about that. The regulated utilities in the range of 9.1% and the Transco right in that 10.5% range, which then averages things to 9.3%.\nAnthony Crowdell: Great. And then you talk about the load growth, the data centers, great tailwinds. I'm just curious. It was maybe something investors were asking about maybe six months ago, but even with all this demand, is it taking longer to connect these large customers to the system or. It's at a very manageable pace for the company. I'm just thinking that with all this load coming on, whether it's supply chain or just labor connecting all these large customers, but it doesn't appear to be an issue.\nWilliam Fehrman: Well, it's certainly a challenge for us to get everyone connected at the speed that they would like to be connected, which is tomorrow for the most part. And we're working with data centers to try to find creative ways to allow them to continue to build out and get the power that they need. But this is going to be a long-term build out for us and we'll try to connect as many data centers as we can onto the system. We'll try to come up with other creative options for those data centers while we get transmission built. But it's going to be an evolution of working with the customer, working with particularly PJM and then our ability to get the construction done. I don't foresee significant supply chain issues at this time. The construction is fairly well spread out and I think we can manage the supply chain side of this. But we certainly have a very high demand coming on from the data center crowd and will work hard to try to accomplish what they want as quickly as we can.\nAnthony Crowdell: Thanks for taking my questions. See you in EEI.\nWilliam Fehrman: Thank you.\nOperator: All right, and our final question from today with Ryan Levine with Citi. Please go ahead.\nRyan Levine: Thanks for taking my questions. I guess a couple one, in terms of your confidence level and these load forecasts, how confident are you and when do you think you that could evolve?\nWilliam Fehrman: Well, as we stated earlier, we've got essentially signed contracts for all of this load, so we feel very confident about the load coming on. Certainly we're in discussions with a number of other economic development opportunities across a number of our states. Those clearly are not in our plan, nor do we know if they'll come to fruition. But for what we're showing you, we have signed agreements and our confidence level is quite high.\nRyan Levine: And then in terms of the recent election, with federal tax rates potentially to change in coming years, how exposed is your free cash flow and credit outlook to changes in federal policy And I guess on a similar vein, you have generation build out and ownership expected in your plan. Is there any exposure to tariffs that you're thinking through?\nWilliam Fehrman: Yes, I mean, it's a question we're going to have to evaluate here as we go through time and see what the platform for the new administration is going to be. So give us some time to absorb that.\nRyan Levine: Okay. Thanks for taking my questions.\nWilliam Fehrman: Yes. Thank you.\nDarcy Reese: Thank you for joining us on today's call. As always, the IR team will be available to answer any additional questions you may have. Danica, would you please give the replay information?\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. A replay of the call will be available for one week.

            "name": "Charles Zebula",
            "content": "Thank you, Bill. It's been a pleasure working with you over the past three months. Your leadership and passion for operational excellence and customer service is infectious, and everyone at AEP looks forward to working with you to capture the incredible opportunities that we have before us. Good morning everyone. Let me move on with the discussion of the third quarter results. Slide 8 shows the comparison of GAAP to operating earnings for the quarter. GAAP earnings for the third quarter were $1.80 per share compared to $1.83 per share in 2023. Year-to-date, GAAP earnings are $4.35 per share versus $3.62 per share last year. There's a detailed reconciliation of GAAP to operating earnings for the third quarter and year-to-date results on pages 20 and 21, respectively. Let's walk through our operating earnings performance by segment for the third quarter on Slide 9. Operating earnings for the third quarter totaled $1.85 per share, or $985 million, compared to $1.77 per share, or $924 million in 2023. Operating earnings for vertically integrated utilities were $1.08 per share, up $0.08. Positive drivers included rate changes across multiple jurisdictions driven by outcomes in Virginia and Indiana, higher normalized retail sales and lower income taxes. These items were partially offset by higher depreciation and O&M. The transmission and distribution utility segment earned $0.46 per share, up $0.07 compared to last year. Positive drivers in this segment include rate changes driven by the distribution cost recovery factor in Texas and the distribution investment rider in Ohio along with higher transmission revenue. These items were partially offset by lower normalized retail sales and higher depreciation. The AEP transmission Holdco segment contributed $0.40 per share, up a penny compared to last year, primarily driven by investment growth. Generation and marketing produced $0.19 per share, up a penny from last year. Favorable drivers included higher retail margins and lower interest expense. These items were partially offset by lower wholesale margins and higher income taxes compared to last year. Finally, Corporate and Other was down $0.09 compared to the prior year, primarily driven by higher interest expense, timing of other operating revenue, higher income taxes and O&M. The year-to-date operating earnings segment detail is shown on page 16 of the presentation. Note that year-to-date, operating earnings are up $0.36 per share this year, increasing from $4.02 per share in 2023 to $4.38 per share this year or about a 9% increase year-to-date. The data on Slide 10 shows continued strong growth in load. Weather normalized retail sales grew 2.1% in the third quarter. This marks the 14th consecutive quarter of load growth across our system, and year-to-date overall weatherized normalized retail sales grew 2.9%. Declining residential sales have been offset by double-digit growth of 10.1% in commercial sales. Thanks to the game changing developments around data centers and AI. Also, our industrial sales have consistently grown despite challenging economic conditions for many of our customers. Our companies have attracted a steady pipeline of economic development projects over the past several years and those projects are beginning to come to fruition. Besides the data centers, we also see companies investing in energy, manufacturing and primary metals driving consistent growth in our industrial sales. Industrial sales grew 1/2 of 1% in the quarter, propelled by nearly 5% growth in Texas. Looking ahead to 2025 and beyond, you'll notice that we have updated our sales projections out to 2027 in this presentation. Looking first at 2025, we are projecting overall sales to increase by an additional 8.3% over our estimate for this year. Flat residential sales will continue to be offset by double-digit growth in the commercial segment. This growth is propelled by a mix of new and existing customers spread across our Ohio, Indiana and Texas service territories. In the T&D segment, we estimate about 30% year-over-year growth in commercial sales each in AEP Ohio and AEP Texas. And in the vertically integrated segment, our projections have commercial sales at I&M up nearly 60% year-over-year. Note this is happening now, and in the next several years, not later this decade. New customer growth will also support a projected increase in industrial sales of 1.6% next year, with most of that growth expected to be powered by ongoing economic development in Texas. We have several large energy and manufacturing loads slated to come online within the next year. While these numbers are substantial, we take a lot of comfort in the fact that the large load additions reflected in these forecasts are all backed by signed customer financial commitments. In AEP Ohio and I&M, nearly all of these loads are backed by take or pay contracts. This means that customers are locked in to pay for a minimum amount of power over the next several years depending on their local tariff. Also, the impact of higher loads will enable our fixed costs to be spread over a higher base, benefiting all customers. As Bill mentioned, based on contract activity across the system, we expect about 20 gigawatts of additional load to come online through the end of the decade. For context, our summer peak load at the end of last year was 35 gigawatt. This represents about a 60% increase in peak load in the next six years. That magnitude of increase in peak load is driving the sales projections that you see in Slide 10. We expect consistent retail growth above 8% over the next three years, driven by not only double digit commercial load increases, but accelerating gains in the industrial space. Roughly half of the additions are located in our PJM footprint, mostly hyper scale data centers in Ohio and Indiana. The other half are located almost entirely in AEP Texas. However, the growth in Texas is more diverse and spread across both data processors and large industrial customers. The last time we have seen sustained years of load growth in the 8% range. The Beatles in the late 1960s were still making music. Truly, this is a pivotal and transformational time for our company as we work to capture this opportunity. Let's move on to slide 11. In the top left table you can see the FFO to Debt Metric stands at 14.7% for the 12 months ended September 30, which is a 10 basis point increase from the prior quarter. Our debt-to-cap decreased slightly from last quarter and was 62.1% at quarter end. We understand that in its next credit opinion in March, Moody's intend to change how it treats deferred fuel impacts to align the consolidated view of AEP without how our subsidiary company metrics are calculated. Importantly, based on discussions with Moody's in our annual management meeting last week, their view of AEP's credit is not changing and we will continue to exceed our downgrade threshold of 13% in all forecasted periods. We are committed to a goal of being in the 14% to 15% FFO-to-debt range and regardless the impact of deferred fuel on our metrics will dissipate to a normal state over the next two years. Again, importantly, this does not change our cash inflows or Moody's view of our credit profile. In the lower left part of this slide you can see our liquidity summary which remains strong at 5.5 billion and is supported by 6 billion in credit facilities. Lastly, on the qualified pension front, our funding status remains stable at 99%. In summary, our third quarter and year-to-date financial results put us in a strong position to meet our goals this year and we are tightening our 2024 guidance range to $558 to $568 per share and also in the quarter, I'll note that we completed the sale of AEP on site partners with approximately $320 million of net proceeds received at the end of September. For 2025, we have set our operating earnings guidance range at $575 to $595 per share with a guidance midpoint of $585 roughly 4% growth from our 2024 midpoint guidance estimate. Our 2025 earnings guidance is based on a strong foundation of growth in our regulated businesses and lower contributions in the generation and marketing segment due to the reduced scope of activities as well as lower expected retail and wholesale margins in the segment. Going forward, we expect improved performance in our vertically integrated utility segment as we work to narrow the gap between our earned and authorized ROEs and invest where we have alignment with our regulators. We have also introduced a robust long-term growth rate of 6% to 8% from the 2025 guidance midpoint. This is supported by a $54 billion capital plan which is more than a 25% increase from our previous five year plan. These investments with 63% related to wires and 26% related to new generation result in a five year rate base CAGR of nearly 8%. Future updates to capital are more likely to go up as we continue to see economic development activities in our territories due to our high voltage 765 transmission backbone, our attractive industrial footprint in Texas, as well as the incremental transmission and generation infrastructure that Bill described earlier. Our 5-year cash flow and financing plan forecast is shown in the Appendix on Slide 14. We have consolidated the forecast over the five year period as impacts in individual years due to large loads, generation investments and tax credits will have inter-period movement over time. Note however, the plan is supported with equity, equity like instruments, opportunities to explore, portfolio optimization as well as efficiently monetizing tax credits related to our investments in renewable generation and from our existing nuclear facility. In addition, we will decouple our dividend growth rate from our earnings growth rate resulting in a lower dividend payout ratio over time in the range of 55% to 65%. This will allow us to retain additional cash flow to fund our increased capital plan and new growth objectives while maintaining a market competitive shareholder return. Access to the capital markets is critical and we will finance sensibly to protect and maintain our balance sheet solidly in the investment grade category. We appreciate everyone's time today and your interest in AEP. We look forward to seeing many of you at the EEI conference next week. Operator, can you open the call so that we can address your questions? Thank you. Yes, sure. I would just add to that, in our plan we also will pursue equity like products out there, instruments that give us equity credit. You'll note in my comments, we are looking to decouple our dividend growth rate from our earnings growth rate as well, which would drift the payout ratio lower as well. We do have PTC and ITC monetization and as far as any asset monetization opportunities, as Bill said, we are looking holistically at all alternatives. As you look at the needs that we have and the timing of such, we will need equity support in 2025 and how and how that comes it could come in any of the forms that I just talked. Yes, thanks Nick. The 6% to 8% right is based off the 2025 new midpoint. And as you can imagine, as Bill described, the kind of components of our capital plan and the addition of load over time, I don't expect it to be completely linear like it may have been in the past. So I do expect all years to be in that range. But I certainly don't expect a --if our guidance was linear, we would have just said 7%. Our guidance is 6% to 8%. I think that does mean over the long-term we would average somewhere in between there, but I don't expect it necessarily to be linear. Yes, this is all basically upside to the plan. And as I mentioned in my remarks, the potential for $10 billion of additional transmission and new generation build out is what we would be chasing with regards to not only just PJM, but ERCOT, MISO and SPP as well. Yes. So Carly, we have followed a pattern of pretty much matching dividend growth, right. With our earnings growth, with the increased capital needs, the cash right from decoupling. Right. The dividend growth from the earnings growth will help fund that. And we would be targeting, a payout ratio in the 55% to 65% range. Our old policy was 60% to 70%. I think right now our payout ratio is in that 63%, 64% range. So we will provide a market competitive total shareholder return opportunity for our shareholders. But that will be decoupled going forward. Well, that's a discussion, Andrew. That is, as you know that the board, approves the dividend and we will drift down in that range. It won't be anything significantly abrupt to expect there, but you could imagine, right. That we would just drift down in that range as we go through time. Yes, so it's a good question. Obviously, consolidating the five year cash flow, just indicates that there's a lot of options on the table. What I would tell you that as I said earlier, we do need equity support in some form in 2025 and 2026 to continue to hit our credit metrics. So I think, as you maybe looked at last year's kind of shape and think of it in a similar way, is a good way to perhaps look at it because we do need support in 2025 in some form or fashion. And we are holistically looking at all of the options, including the equity like securities which wouldn't show up in the true equity line on the cash flow. I don't have that specifically. We could talk about that at EEI. You could follow up with Darcy later. Yes, it's just transferability to provide funding. It's neutral to earnings largely. And over the 2025 to 2027 period, it's roughly $300 million a year. In the latter two years there's some ITC opportunities with some solar projects. So you'd be some big, bigger numbers, but in the next three years, about an average of 300 per year. Yes, I mean, it's a trend I think that we and others are seeing in the industry as well as people have returned to work as inflation has crept in and the share of the wallet becomes more critical. I think you're just seeing reduced usage. We are seeing increased customer counts, in places like Texas and Oklahoma and Ohio and other areas. But it's not offsetting, right. The existing customer decline in usage. We do think that that levels off at some point in time. I think there's also probably some energy, continued energy efficiency things creeping in there. But nonetheless, we're as we, as you see in our forecast, after some years of decline, we're now assuming it flat going forward pretty much. I think he may have. I think he may have. Yes. So trailing 12 months, as you could see in the deck, we're at 9.0% for the entire regulated complex. So I think as you think about going into next year, you should think about that. The regulated utilities in the range of 9.1% and the Transco right in that 10.5% range, which then averages things to 9.3%."

            "content": "Thank you, Darcy and good morning everyone. I'm happy to be with you for my first earnings call as AEP's President and CEO. In my remarks this morning, I'll discuss our results and outlook before turning to the key pillars of our strategy to enhance value for customers and investors. I'll then cover regulatory updates before handing it over to Chuck to walk through our financials in more detail. You can find a summary of third quarter 2024 business highlights on Slide 4 of our presentation. We have a lot of exciting ground to cover today, but first I'd like to briefly introduce myself to those I haven't had the opportunity to meet yet. I spent my entire career in the utility and energy business. Most recently I was at Berkshire Hathaway Energy, which has an asset base 1.4 times the size of AEP, operates in 11 states but also in Canada and Great Britain and has a diverse group of regulatory interests. While I'm familiar with most of the industry players, bankers, regulators, companies and debt investors, I am new to many of the AEP shareholders and I look forward to delivering for you. With that, I'm honored to join a leader like AEP at a pivotal time for both the organization and our industry. Since assuming the role of CEO, I've met our many stakeholders and the AEP team across our 11 state footprint, including four governors and over 30 regulators and legislators. We've had robust discussions about critical initiatives and I've appreciated the opportunity to engage, listen and learn over the past three months to help shape our vision for the future. AEP has built a strong foundation for growth, including our robust transmission system, which represents 55% of AEP's total earnings stream. However, we can improve reliability, streamline cost, use technology better, and put power in the hands of local leaders to build financially strong utilities in our communities. I look forward to the future and working with the many talented people across the company to drive operational excellence, best-in-class service earnings growth and overall success. I'll begin with our financial results. Today we report third quarter 2024 operating earnings of $1.85 per share, or $985 million. Building on our strong momentum this year we are confident in narrowing our 2024 full year operating earnings guidance range to $5.58 to $5.68, maintaining the original $5.63 midpoint. As referenced on Slide 5, today we also formally introduce our 2025 operating earnings guidance range of $5.75 to $5.95. We have thought a lot about this range, especially since I've been in the CEO role for just three months. The foundation of our 2025 earnings guidance range is based on robust growth in our regulated utilities. This range also reflects lower contributions from our generation and marketing segment due to reduced scope of activities going forward and lower retail and wholesale margins likely to be realized. While AEP's earnings range rose 4% in 2025, you have my commitment that we will do significantly better in 2026 and beyond after we go through an optimization exercise and we retool our personnel and processes over the coming months. As the new CEO at AEP, I need to establish a record of delivering on promises to you while demonstrating goodwill to our regulators and customers as we focus on service, reliability and enhanced vegetation management to reduce customer outages. My objective is to improve our customer experience and stakeholder relationships which over time will result in more positive regulatory outcomes and enable a stable platform for growth. AEP's future growth opportunities are very significant as we embrace the large load opportunity in our service territory as well as substantial upgrades to the distribution system. We are focusing on economic development efforts in our states to help address affordability and investing in our energy delivery infrastructure to improve reliability in addition to new generation to support resource adequacy. Because of this tremendous growth, today we are unveiling AEP's new long-term earnings growth rate of 6% to 8% off a 2025 base year and a $5.85 midpoint, all reinforced by a balanced and flexible $54 billion capital plan from 2025 through 2029. When I look at this newly raised $54 billion capital plan, which is up more than 25% over the prior $43 billion plan, there is even more upside to go. In fact, we see significant opportunity to capture $10 billion in incremental transmission and generation infrastructure investment to satisfy all of the load growth. We will provide more details at EEI regarding these investment opportunities that drive our updated 8% rate base CAGR. Note that during the 2025 through 2029 timeframe, we also expect our customer rates will go up by less than 3% annually on a system wide basis due to built headroom created from economic development activities and new generation. Understand that this customer rate impact could change due to effects of potential future generation needs. Please refer to slides 5 and 6. As you know, maintaining a strong balance sheet is critical to funding the increased capital spend associated with these growth rates and we remain committed to responsibly financing our capital needs. In addition to equity and equity like tools, we will explore asset monetization opportunities to the extent they can be executed upon while achieving the right price. If we do explore asset sales, we won't tell you about them until they happen. Our newly rolled forward five year capital and financing plans can be seen in the appendix on slides 13 and 14. Turning to slide 7, our robust financial outlook will be underpinned by a culture of accountability and execution. This business is transforming rapidly and we recognize the need for change to better serve our customers. Since joining the company in August, we have made several changes to align and simplify the organizational structure to ensure we have the right talent and the right roles to execute our strategy and achieve our objectives. For example, our operating company Presidents and Chief Nuclear Officer now report directly to me, while power plants and site managers will report directly to our operating Company Presidents. We have streamlined the leadership structure by eliminating management layers and reorganizing the service corporation. These actions move decision making closer to customers, all to ensure our money making businesses have the authority they need to accelerate improved performance. I'm confident our new structure will help us drive value as we advance three core areas of strategic focus, growth and financial strength, customer service and regulatory integrity. I'd like to spend a few minutes walking through each of these areas. First, AEP's future growth potential and financial strength is significant with customer commitments for 20 gigawatts of load additions through 2029 driven by data center demand and we have updated our load growth forecast accordingly through 2027. In fact, large load impacts are already being felt in our service territories, predominantly in Ohio, Texas and Indiana. This is demonstrated in our third quarter results in which we realized commercial load growth of 7.9% compared to the third quarter of last year and 10.1% growth year-to-date in 2024 compared to 2023. We are committed to supporting this new load growth in our service territory, but we also remain focused on ensuring affordability by fairly allocating costs resulting from associated incremental investments. This is why we proactively filed the data center tariff in Ohio, the large load tariff modifications in Indiana, Kentucky and West Virginia, and a complaint with FERC related to a co-located load arrangement. Load growth from data center demand has the potential to benefit all stakeholders including investors, customers and local communities, but only with fair and proper cost allocation. While some may think that our FERC complaint is anti-data center, it is actually the opposite. We are trying to welcome all data centers to our service territory by making sure that those data centers help all customers. The second area of focus for us is best-in-class customer service. We will leverage technology to enhance service and better meet our customers' energy needs through reliability and outage reductions while transforming our processes with a focus on efficiency and accountability. Business transformation and technology innovation will also drive O&M discipline to help keep customer rates affordable amid rising costs and a growing rate base. The last pillar of our strategy is regulatory integrity. We will listen to and respect the preferences of our regulators, policymakers and communities to achieve positive regulatory outcomes. If our states want renewables, we will work with them to deliver. If they want continued operation of coal or investment in gas or nuclear, we will work with them to deliver. As long as our states pay for what they want and we are treated fairly, we will deliver. At the same time, we will work closely with key stakeholders to advance affordability, system reliability, resiliency and security. To that end, we have aligned our organizational structure to strengthen our focus at the state level, and we continue to prioritize improving our earned ROEs as we listen to each of our states and their preferences. While it will take time for this work to bear fruit, this is headed in the right direction. Continuing on our operating companies achieved a number of other positive regulatory developments in the third quarter as well. Starting with AEP Texas, last month, the Commission issued an order approving a unanimous and unopposed comprehensive settlement which included a 9.76% ROE. The order was effective October 1st. In Oklahoma, major parties reached a settlement agreement with a 9.5% ROE in early October, and the ALJ recommended approval of the settlement without any modifications. While PSO awaits a commission decision, interim rates were implemented on October 23rd. In Virginia, a hearing was held in September related to the biennial filing, focusing primarily on incremental investment. A Commission order is required in November, with rates going into effect in early January 2025. Last week, APCO refiled its base case in West Virginia, requesting a 10.8% ROE while also offering securitization as the rate mitigation concept to the proposed $250.5 million base rate increase. This securitization option includes $2.4 billion of undepreciated plant balances, CCR and ELG investments, fuel deferrals and storm expenses. While reduced rate base of $1.9 billion would result from securitizing the plant balances and environmental investments, any earnings impact would be dependent on how quickly we redeploy capital throughout the business. That said, we should have an early indication from the Commission if securitization is preferred and we would plan capital redeployment accordingly. But let me be very clear, securitization is not included in our new five year capital and financing plans introduced today and is not needed to hit our credit metrics. Rather, securitization is driven by the desire to consider alternative rate case options to mitigate customer bill impacts. I was highly disappointed by the initial rate case filing that was rejected by West Virginia. Be assured that going forward, additional internal quality control checks and leadership changes have been implemented to ensure that each of our operating companies filings meet all requirements. A rate case rejection should not happen like it did in West Virginia, and I won't accept this kind of performance from our team. Moving on to SWEPCO, updated formula rates went into effect in early August for Louisiana, in mid-October for Arkansas. And finally, I&M issued new requests for proposals or RFPs for both owned resources and PPAs seeking to secure up to 4,000 megawatts of diverse generation resources for target completion by year end 2028 or 2029 to support new load growth in the region. As such, we expect to make the applicable regulatory filings in 2025. So in short, while the team is making progress towards achieving positive regulatory outcomes, we do have more work to do. We look forward to continuing to engage constructively with our regulators and strengthen new relationships, including by investing more resources at the local level and focusing on delivering what our individual states want as outcomes. The bottom line here is we have made progress transforming the business over the past three months, but we have significantly more wood to chop. Before wrapping up, I'd like to briefly update you on a legal item. AEP and the Security Exchange Commission are engaged in discussions about possible resolution of the SEC's ongoing investigation and we recorded a loss contingency of $19 million in the third quarter. Given this is an active matter, we don't plan on making any further comments on this matter. I'd now like to close by reiterating my strong confidence in the tremendous potential for AEP's growth and success well into the future. With the support, dedication and hard work of the entire AEP team, we are well positioned to continue providing safe, reliable and affordable service while advancing our long-term strategy to deliver value to our stakeholders. Related to our new vision statement of improving customer's lives with reliable, affordable power, we will accomplish this together through commitment and execution. I look forward to seeing many of you in a few days at EEI where we'll be happy to discuss our newly released financial plans in even more detail. I'll now give the floor to Chuck. Morning. Yes, thanks, Shar. With regards to additional opportunities, clearly this year we've done a number of things across the company. We had a voluntary separation plan that was put in place to help offset inflation. And as we're looking at transforming the company, I did bring on an expert in transformation who's worked with me for many years, who will help us continue to look for opportunities to take costs out of the business, look for more opportunities to reduce layers of management and expand span of control of the management team. All in the effort to remove bureaucracy out of the company and reduce bloat. And so clearly there's opportunities for that. I've just been here three months, so we've got a lot yet to do. As I noted in my comments, a lot of wood to chop yet around the company. And so we've looked at what we were able to do and made sure that we were confident in what we put into those numbers at this time. But clearly more to do with regards to the 20 gigawatts that is essentially in the plan. 12 gigawatts of that is in the first three years of the plan, with the remainder towards the end of the plan. But we've got more opportunities out there. As I noted, $10 billion of transmission potential generation development. Again, as I was sorting through the numbers here with the $54 billion capital plan that we have, making sure that that was fully understood and that we could deliver it. But there's much more load growth to come for this company and I would say we're only really limited by our ability to execute on the opportunities that are in front of us. Chuck, anything to add? Yes, with regards to potential asset sales and stuff, we won't comment on those until something might happen, but we're clearly going to consider sort of all of the above to get us to where we need. Chuck, you want to. Yes. Thanks, Shar. So as we look at our regulatory opportunities right now for the regulated utilities, we're looking at a 9.1% ROE tend to plan. As I've gone around and met with the states, as I noted in my comments, our focus is changing to where we will be working with them to understand what they want to be able to achieve, and we will work to deliver that with them. And through that, then we would hope to continue to improve the relationship that we have with the regulator. And hopefully that then also then turns into more positive outcomes with regards to ROE and the general relationship that we have. As part of that, we also have to significantly improve our customer service. I've noted that we have to put more investment into the distribution side of the business, vegetation management, reduce outage time, and all of that will then go to helping us with regards to our regulatory relations and customer service. So we're very, very focused on that. I've made it around now to seven of our states in the three months I've been here to meet with the regulators, and we're continuing to build those relationships. And as I noted in West Virginia, we made the new filing very disappointed in the quality of our prior filing. We've made changes internally to correct that. And so we'll be very much focused on these returns. And I know how much it adds to our business as we're able to get those closer to our allowance. I think that's an accurate representation of what I said. Good morning. Sure. As we've looked at the data center opportunities in Ohio, one of our fundamental principles around all of this is to ensure that our existing customer base is not negatively impacted by the significant increase in data center load that is being proposed for the state. And as such, we filed a tariff in Ohio that would essentially put more pressure on the data centers to stand up for the costs that they're creating on the system. And that filing has been going through the process. There's been settlements filed by the data center coalition, as well as ourselves with a number of other parties, including the staff from the commission. And right now that's moving the hearing on December 3rd, and we would expect to get an outcome from the commission shortly after that. But conversations are still going. We want that load in Ohio. We definitely want it to be on our system and we want to see that growth, but we also want to make sure that our existing customer base is not negatively impacted by this. And so we'll do what we need to ensure that we protect that customer base. And I think, honestly I've worked with data centers for a long time. In my prior role at Berkshire and Iowa in particular, we had a significant customer base of data centers there. And I've seen how the load comes on and what the commitments are, and so got a pretty good feeling for how this is going to potentially play out. And we want to make sure that we have everything in place to serve that load, but bottom line is only if we can protect the rest of the customer base. So that was a great partnership led by our transmission team, Antonio Smith and the rest of the team there to pull that coalition together and go in and bid on these projects. Obviously, PJM is putting forth a significant amount of potential transmission investment and it was our view that we're stronger together as entities and that we would have a very, very good chance of winning these projects. And so that JV came together really well and we're working well together and we're excited about hearing where we might end up later next year. But I have confidence in our team and the team from FirstEnergy and Dominion that we're going to come out of this with some really strong opportunities to grow our transmission business. So the G&M segment we're reflecting about $0.24 and lower contributions over 2024 and 2025, which is obviously a significant change for us. But we are seeing good improvement across the rest of our lines of business. We're obviously also going to be going after the transmission projects that I noted in my opening comments. And then as far as other potential asset sales as again I said I will consider all things and if they make sense we'll take a look at them, but we'll talk about those at the time. Yes, good morning. Yes, thanks for the question. And perhaps the slide you're looking at may not make that clear. We're just showing the change in G&M from 2024 to 2025. There would still be a contribution from that segment in 2026 and beyond. So we do have a lot of gas coming into the system. We've got a number of RFPs out on the street as I mentioned, particularly at I&M, and we'll see what kind of prices come in for those projects. The CapEx will be spread obviously as those projects come into play. But I'll also say that as we continue to work with some of our other states, particularly say West Virginia, there's a lot of opportunity yet to be sorted through in those states with regards to the economic development that they are pushing forward. And so be happy to talk more about these things in detail at the EEI meeting coming up. But really excited about the potential opportunities we have across a number of our states. Hey, good morning. Yes, Julien, I think that the business supports the level that we would see in 2025. So obviously we have a big opportunity in ERCOT around the 765 down there in the event that they decide to go that way. We've put in our proposals for that significant opportunity in the Permian area, significant opportunity on the various backbone growth areas for, for Texas. That just alone is a good $4 billion or $5 billion of opportunity potential there for us on the 765 front. We've also got good 765 opportunities in PJM and SVP as well. And so the fact that AEP is essentially the only U.S. Company that knows how to build and operate 765 gives us a strong competitive advantage in these situations and certainly something that I'm very excited about to pursue. That's one of the really strong strategic things that frankly AEP has done over the years is build out this 765kV backbone because it's paying huge dividends right now as all of this load growth is starting to combine. And I think that's being seen by some of the other decision makers around who are looking for ways to significantly increase their ability to move energy. And so with the 765kV experience that we have, I'm very excited about the opportunity to engage with ERCOT, SVP and PJM and maybe a little bit in MISO. Nothing really purposeful. We're trying to continue to increase the ROE and work diligently with the regulators. If you blend in, the transmission component of this, we're at 9:3. Obviously we want to continue to get up closer to our allowance, but frankly, we have to earn our way up. As I said, we've had some mishaps in West Virginia that we've now corrected with the most recent filing, and we've got some significant work to do on the customer service side to put us in a better position with our regulator so they're not getting complaints from customers. And so as this continues to move forward, we've got a tremendous amount of wood to chop in this area, but we're very focused on it. We've taken our board through the details of reliability and where we sit, and we've essentially created a new foundation and we're going to blast off from there to really accelerate our improvements in customer service. Thank you. You bet. Good morning. Sure. Well, first and foremost, a number of our customers are pursuing projects based on nuclear power plants, and those are many, many years out, as far as I can tell. But we need to continue to work with our customers and if they want to pursue a small modular reactor type of co-location approach, then we'll work with them and we'll continue to work with developers of the various technologies that are out there. But this is going to require a very significant approach to risk mitigation. It will take a combination of the federal government, state government, input from the customer and ourself to build some risk mitigation such that our existing customer base isn't carrying the full exposure of something like this. And we'll, with our nuclear team that we have here, we'll continue to follow the various technologies that are being built in Canada with regards to the BWRX and the new scale plant that's being built in Romania. We'll follow those as well as the GE Hitachi project at TVA and watch how these are progressing. But ultimately if our customers want this and our states want this, then we'll have to figure out a way to deliver it. That's what we do. And so I'm fairly favorable that there'll be one or two designs that make it through the NRC process and will start to be built. But we have to figure out the first of a kind risk and make sure that we are not carrying that, that load and that there's a very broad base of people engaged in this that can help push this along. Yes sure. So this is a very simple issue in our mind. If you use the transmission system, you should pay for it. It's really that simple. And our view of colocation is that we don't have an issue with colocation. We don't have an issue with data centers looking to use nuclear power plants as an energy source. But what we do have an issue with is when they use the transmission system and try not to pay for it. That's a problem for us because that cost gets shifted to other customers. And so as this process continues to go through the FERC decision making process, we'll continue to reiterate our concerns around cost allocation. And at the end of the day for us it's, it's just a simple principle. If you use the transmission system, pay for it. And that's really where we're at. Thank you. Well, it's certainly a challenge for us to get everyone connected at the speed that they would like to be connected, which is tomorrow for the most part. And we're working with data centers to try to find creative ways to allow them to continue to build out and get the power that they need. But this is going to be a long-term build out for us and we'll try to connect as many data centers as we can onto the system. We'll try to come up with other creative options for those data centers while we get transmission built. But it's going to be an evolution of working with the customer, working with particularly PJM and then our ability to get the construction done. I don't foresee significant supply chain issues at this time. The construction is fairly well spread out and I think we can manage the supply chain side of this. But we certainly have a very high demand coming on from the data center crowd and will work hard to try to accomplish what they want as quickly as we can. Thank you. Well, as we stated earlier, we've got essentially signed contracts for all of this load, so we feel very confident about the load coming on. Certainly we're in discussions with a number of other economic development opportunities across a number of our states. Those clearly are not in our plan, nor do we know if they'll come to fruition. But for what we're showing you, we have signed agreements and our confidence level is quite high. Yes, I mean, it's a question we're going to have to evaluate here as we go through time and see what the platform for the new administration is going to be. So give us some time to absorb that. Yes. Thank you."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the American Electric Power's Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker's remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would like to turn the conference over to Darcy Reese, President of Investor Relations. You may begin.\nDarcy Reese: Thank you, JL. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the second quarter 2024 earnings call for American Electric Power. We appreciate you taking time to join us today. Our earnings release, presentation slides, and related financial information are available on our website at aep.com. Today, we will be making forward-looking statements during the call. There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements. Please refer to our SEC filings for discussion of these factors. Joining me this morning for opening remarks are Ben Fowke, our President and Interim Chief Executive Officer; Chuck Zebula, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Peggy Simmons, our Executive Vice President of Utilities. We will take your questions following their remarks. I will now turn the call over to Ben.\nBen Fowke: Good morning, and welcome to American Electric Power's second quarter 2024 earnings call. Shortly, Peggy will provide a regulatory update, followed by Chuck, who will review our financial results in more detail. A summary of our second quarter 2024 business highlights can be found on slide 6 of today's presentation. Before I dive into our results, I would like to start by welcoming Bill Furman to AEP as our new President and CEO, effective August 1st. Bill brings decades of utility operational leadership experience and in-depth knowledge of the energy industry, most recently serving as President and CEO of Century Holdings, and prior to that, President and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway Energy. With Bill's expertise and diverse background, you can anticipate a smooth transition and continuity of strategic direction. Expect more focus on execution, and Bill has the background to do just that, including capturing growth, listening and responding to our regulators and investors, and using innovation to mitigate inflationary pressures. While I will be serving as Senior Advisor for several months to ensure a smooth transition, it's been an honor to lead AEP as Interim President and CEO, and I'm proud of what the team has accomplished so far this year. Now, turning to AEP's financial results. Today, we announced second quarter 2024 operating earnings of $1.25 per share, a $0.12 increase over one year ago. Our operational execution through the first half of the year, combined with our efforts to efficiently manage the business, have put us well on track to achieve our targets. Today, we reaffirm our 2024 full-year operating earnings guidance range from $5.53 to $5.73, and our long-term earnings growth rate of 6% to 7%. Regarding data center load, we have commitments from customers for more than 15 gigawatts of incremental load by the end of this decade, mostly driven by large load opportunities. To put this in perspective, AEP's system-wide peak load at the end of last year was 35 gigawatts. We continue to work with data center customers to meet their increased demand, while ensuring contracts and new initiatives are fair and beneficial for all of our customers. In the fall, we will provide an update on what this large load opportunity means for our capital spend, including generation and transmission investment, and on our plan to responsibly finance this growth initiative. While we certainly encourage innovation when it comes to meeting the energy needs of our customers, data centers included, I want to emphasize that it is critically important that costs associated with these large loads are allocated fairly, and the right investments are made for the long-term success of our grid. For this reason, we filed new data center tariffs in Ohio and large load tariff modifications in Indiana and West Virginia, and it's the reason why we filed a complaint with FERC related to a co-located load agreement. We will know soon what FERC decides, but this is the rationale we used. Given the co-located load agreement is an active case before FERC, I don't plan on making any further comments. I'd also like to note that large load impacts are already being felt here in AEP's service territories, primarily Ohio and Texas, as our commercial load grew an impressive 12.4% over the second quarter of last year. Looking ahead, we expect the incremental load I just mentioned to move forward in these states and others, including Indiana. Moving to another example of capital opportunities, PSO announced an agreement at the end of June to purchase a 795-megawatt natural gas generation facility conditioned on regulatory approval. The facility, known as Green Country, is located in Jenks [ph] Oklahoma, and will ensure PSO customers continue to benefit from reliable and affordable resources. For this resource adequacy-driven capital, PSO plans to seek regulatory approval this fall, at which time the economics of this acquisition will be made public. As you know, maintaining a strong balance is critical to fund increased capital spend to support our growth initiatives. We will sensibly finance our capital needs, and we're open to incremental growth equity and equity-like tools, in addition to portfolio optimization. On a similar portfolio note, the sale of AEP on-site partners remains on track to close in the third quarter following FERC approval. Now let's move on to the Federal EPA's Coal Combustion Residual Rule, or CCR, which was finalized in the second quarter and expanded the scope of the rule to include inactive impoundments at existing and inactive facilities. We continue to evaluate the applicability of the rule to current and former plant sites, and have developed preliminary estimates of compliance costs. While we are working with others and looking at potential legal challenges to the revised rules, as appropriate, we do plan to seek cost recovery through new and or existing regulatory mechanisms. Chuck will have more information on this shortly. Before I turn it over to Peggy for additional updates, I'd like to thank all of you for your support during my time as AEP's interim CEO. I've been privileged to serve AEP over the past five months, and the board and I are confident that Bill is the right person to build on the momentum underway and to lead AEP into its next chapter. On a related note, we are planning an informal meet and greet in New York City soon, so analyst investors can say hello to Bill in person. We are targeting something in August, so stay tuned for more information coming your way in the next couple of days. Finally, I'm excited about what the future holds for AEP as we execute on our strategic priorities and enhance value for all of our stakeholders. Peggy?\nPeggy Simmons: Thanks, Ben, and good morning, everyone. Now let's turn to an update on several of AEP's ongoing regulatory initiatives. We are engaged in our regulatory and legislative areas, continuing to strengthen relationships, including implementation of our investment in more people and resources at the local level. And as the utility industry is changing, now more than ever, AEP's operating company leaders are staying increasingly engaged with regulators amidst this dynamic environment. Customer bills and affordability remain top of mind for AEP, in addition to system reliability and resiliency. We are focused on advancing interest in each of the states we operate, which includes economic development, work across service or service territory to bring jobs and create Bill headroom from a larger load perspective, and to ultimately achieve the regulatory outcomes that are good for AEP's customers, communities, investors, and employees. We continue to work through regulatory items with the focus on our authorized versus earned ROE gap, which remained flat at 8.9% for the past 12 months as of second quarter 2024. Turning to some positive rate case development, let's start with INM. I'm pleased to report that in May, we received an order in Indiana approving all key items in our settlement, including an improved 9.85% ROE. In June, we received a constructive order in Michigan maintaining our existing 9.86% ROE, with new rates taking effect in mid-July. Just last week for AEP Texas, parties filed a unanimous and unopposed comprehensive settlement with the ALJ increasing our authorized ROE to 9.76%, with rates effective in early October pending commission approval. As you know, earlier this year, we filed an APCo biennial rate review in Virginia and a base rate case for PSO in Oklahoma, where we received intervener testimony in the PSO case last evening. We're at the beginning of the procedural schedules in both cases and expect commission orders in the fourth quarter. We look forward to sharing updates on our progress in the coming months. Relative to future cases, APCo plans to file a base rate case in West Virginia in the next week. While we have many trackers in place to help mitigate regulatory lag, we have not had a rate case here in a few years and look forward to working with the parties to achieve a balanced and fair result. Looking ahead, I am proud of the progress we continue to make on the regulatory front and I remain excited about advancing our regulatory strategies in 2024 and beyond. Let's discuss AEP's recent fleet transformation activities and the progress we made on that important initiative. In May, APCo issued requests for proposals for 800 megawatts of wind or solar owned resources with regulatory filing anticipated in 2025. Finally, as Ben mentioned, PSO signed an agreement in June to purchase Green Country's 795 megawatt natural gas generation facility to help ensure resource adequacy. The agreement is conditioned on regulatory approval and we plan to make the related filings with the Oklahoma Commission in the fall. This is an example of a proactive approach by the team in meeting ever increasing resource needs and we're enthusiastic about the opportunity as we advance our fleet transformation. To wrap up, I'd like to thank Ben for his leadership and welcome Bill to the AEP team. This is an exciting time here at AEP and when I think about the future, I'm motivated by the opportunities we have ahead of us, embracing large loads, advancing our regulatory strategy, and driving overall long-term success. I'll now turn things over to Chuck who is going to walk through second quarter 2024 performance drivers and details supporting our financial results. Chuck?\nCharles Zebula: Thank you, Peggy, and good morning, everyone. Let's jump right into our second quarter results. Slide seven shows the comparison of GAAP to operating earnings for the quarter and year-to-date periods. GAAP earnings for the second quarter were $0.64 per share compared to $1.01 per share in 2023. Year-to-date GAAP earnings are $2.55 per share for this year versus $1.78 per share last year. There's a detailed reconciliation of GAAP to operating earnings for the second quarter and year-to-date results on pages 13 and 14 respectively. Let's briefly highlight a few of the non-operating items for the quarter that mostly make up the difference between GAAP and operating earnings. First, as disclosed in an 8-K in May, an after-tax provision of $126 million for customer refunds was recorded based on recent developments in the remand proceeding related to the cost cap associated with the Turk plant that has been debated over the last decade. Secondly, we incurred a $94 million expense associated with a voluntary severance program that we completed in the second quarter. And finally, as Ben mentioned, the final revised EPA CCR rule became effective in May. We recorded a $111 million accrual for compliance costs largely related to our Ohio properties where generation is deregulated. We also updated our asset retirement obligations for sites in our regulated entities where we intend to seek cost recovery. Let's walk through our quarterly operating earnings performance by segment on slide eight. Operating earnings for the second quarter totaled $125 per share or $662 million compared to $113 per share or $582 million in 2023. This results in an increase of $80 million or $0.12 per share, which is a 10.6% increase over last year. Operating earnings for vertically integrated utilities were $0.46 per share, down $0.05. Positive drivers included favorable year-over-year weather and rate changes across multiple jurisdictions, with the 2022 PSO base case and the 2023 Virginia proceeding being the most significant. These items were offset by higher income taxes, which are largely a reversal of favorable income taxes in the first quarter, lower normalized retail sales, and higher depreciation. Note the year-to-date results in this segment consolidate the income tax loss that is shown in this quarter, resulting in an immaterial year-to-date income tax variance versus last year. The transmission and distribution utility segment earned $0.41 per share, up $0.11 compared to last year. Positive drivers in this segment included favorable weather, increased transmission revenue, rate changes primarily from the distribution cost recovery factor in Texas, and higher normalized retail sales. These items were partially offset by increased property taxes and depreciation. The AEP transmission Holdco segment contributed $0.39 per share, up a penny compared to last year, primarily driven by investment growth. Generation and marketing produced $0.12 per share, down a penny from last year. Recall that AEP renewables was sold in the third quarter last year, which has two impacts, a negative earnings variance due to the business being sold and removal of the interest costs for financing these assets. Additional drivers were lower retail margins offset by higher generation margins and lower taxes. Finally, corporate and other was up $0.06 compared to the prior year, primarily driven by lower income taxes and increased other operating income related to timing in the prior year. These items were partially offset by higher interest expense and lower interest income from the GNM segment. Let's turn to slide nine, which shows weather normalized retail sales of 4% in the quarter from a year ago, headlined by a double-digit 12.4% increase in commercial sales, which is where our data processing customers are classified. I'll note that in our T&D segment, the increase in commercial load was over 20% for the quarter. This is a trend that will continue over the coming years based on already signed customer commitments. Our operating footprint and robust transmission system position us perfectly to grow along AI and other technologies and industries in need of access to affordable and reliable power. Through the remainder of this year, data processing gains will remain mostly concentrated in Ohio and Texas. But beyond this year, we are seeing strong commitments from new customers looking to connect at some of our vertically integrated companies as well. Outside of data processors, our industrial sales have remained resilient in the face of a slowing economy. Industrial sales were strongest in Texas, driven by an influx of new customers, mainly in the energy industry. Thanks to our success over the past few years on the economic development front, we expect to see our industrial sales continue to be resilient in the next few years as several new large customers in steel, energy, renewable energy, and semiconductors come online across our footprint. In the residential segment, we continue to see growth in customer count and load in Texas, but residential load remains weak in most of our territories, likely due to the cumulative effects of inflation. Bottom line, the amount of demand from new large loads we're seeing across our system is unprecedented. We are excited, challenged, and poised to embrace this opportunity. Let's move on to slide 10. In the top left table, you can see the FFO to debt metric stands at 14.6% for the 12 months ended June 30th, which is a 40 basis point increase from the prior quarter. Our debt-to-cap decreased slightly from last quarter and was 62.6% at quarter end. We took credit-supportive financing actions in the second quarter by issuing $400 million of equity under our at-the-market program and by issuing $1 billion in junior subordinated notes at the parent, which qualified for 50% equity credit at all three rating agencies. In the lower left part of this slide, you can see our liquidity summary, which remains strong at $5.4 billion and is supported by $6 billion in credit facilities. Lastly, on the qualified pension front, our funding status is near 99%. In summary, our second quarter results provide additional momentum this year, bringing year-to-date earnings up to $2.52 per share, an increase of $0.28, or 12.5% compared to the same period last year. We reaffirm our operating earnings guidance range of $553 to $573 and remain committed to our long-term growth rate of 6% to 7%. And as we move through the balance of the year, our focus is on providing reliable and affordable service to our customers, executing our plan, and embracing the growth opportunities that we have ahead of us. Also, a quick update on the sale of AEP on-site partners. We expect the transaction to close in the third quarter and result in approximately $315 million in net proceeds to the company. I'd be remiss if I didn't acknowledge the skilled leadership of Ben Folk during this time of transition at AEP. Ben told you that this company would not be in neutral during the transition, and I can say that that is absolutely true. Ben, while I know you'll still be engaged as an advisor and board role going forward, I want you to know that the AEP team appreciates your engagement and contributions over the past five months. Finally, the AEP team looks forward to the arrival of our new CEO and President, Bill Furman. We all look forward to Bill bringing his accomplished leadership to AEP and working with him as we take on the exciting opportunities that we have before us. Thank you for your interest in American Electric Power. Operator, can you open the call so we can address your questions? Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Shar Pourezza of Guggenheim Partners. Your line is open.\nShar Pourezza: Hey, guys. Good morning.\nBen Fowke: Morning. Morning.\nShar Pourezza: Just firstly, obviously, you guys highlighted in the deck, \u201cthe direction and strategy\u201d kind of remain on track. I guess how much latitude will Bill have to make kind of strategic changes if need be to accrue value? Or is the plan kind of the plan and any kind of changes you expect will likely be more on the fringe, given your and the board's comfort level with the trajectory, with obviously the latter kind of being a similar situation to one of your other Ohio peers in the state when they had an incoming CEO? Thanks.\nBen Fowke: Yes. I think that was a lot different circumstance, Shar, but Bill's very familiar with our strategy. We clearly had conversations with Bill about our strategy. So I think it's, I think we're on the right strategic direction. I do think Bill's going to come in and focus very much on execution. He's got a ton of experience, as we mentioned. And so I mean he'll take some time, assess where we are and I'm sure he's going to make some changes, but I don't see significant changes in the strategic direction. It's not like we gave him a plan, a to-do list, and you do all these things. He's going to be a dynamic leader. But the path we're on is, I think we're all in agreement, it's the right path and we need to execute on it.\nShar Pourezza: Okay, perfect. And then last time, obviously we've talked about higher CapEx coming, driven by customer growth, data centers, etcetera. As we're kind of thinking about that incremental CapEx, potentially with a 3Q update and a funding source, the balance sheet doesn't have a material amount of capacity. You touched on this a little bit on your preparedness, but maybe you can elaborate on how you're kind of thinking about incremental equity versus asset sales, and with asset sales, how you're thinking about distribution versus transmission. Thanks, guys.\nBen Fowke: Yes, I mean, clearly we're going to have an update in the fall, either at or right before EEI, that incorporates what it means to CapEx to fund this low growth, both in generation and transmission, and of course, what it means to make sure the balance sheet is strong in terms of equity and equity-like products, including portfolio optimization. Regarding portfolio optimization, you've heard me say it before, we're always open to it, but price has to be there, and the ability to execute has to be there. And the regulated utility spaces, those are two hard things to put together at the same time, but we're open to it. Chuck, I don't know if you want to add anything to it.\nCharles Zebula: Ben, the only thing I would add is, right, it's so important as we are a regulated utility and have significant capital needs not only today, but going forward right, to maintain investment credit ratings, and we will defend that right in our plan.\nShar Pourezza: Got it. Perfect. Thank you. And by the way, just a real big congrats on Bill. He's one of the best hires. Thanks, guys.\nCharles Zebula: Thanks. You did mention, Shar asked the mix between distribution and transmission. So, it's going to, there's obviously going to be a lot of transmission that needs to be built, as well as distribution.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Jeremy Tonet of JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nJeremy Tonet: Hi, good morning.\nBen Fowke: Hey, Jeremy.\nJeremy Tonet: Hey, I know you're not going to give us the full details here, but I was just wondering if there's any way you could help us think through size and shaping of this incremental CapEx, as you talked about, with the incremental wires needs here. It just seems like everything is materializing quicker than expected. And so, just wondering if you could comment, I guess, any shaping there that would be helpful.\nBen Fowke: Yes. Well, as I mentioned, with Shar's comment, I mean, you're definitely going to see a lot of increase in transmission spent. There's got to be something to plug into, so we're going to have generation, as well, and we recognize the need to make sure we have reliable distribution grid. So, I think if I had to rate it, it would be transmission increases, followed by generation, followed by distribution.\nCharles Zebula: Jeremy, I would say you'll note, in our materials that we raised our CapEx this year already by $500 million. That largely is in T&D, right? It's for reliability spend, also customer hookups, and then storm-related capital. So the shape of it right, is going to be as these customer additions, come online. And again, as Ben mentioned, we'll be laying all that out in the fall.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. So, it sounds like there's an opportunity for more near-term, as opposed to just later data at this point, if I understand correctly.\nCharles Zebula: I think that that's true.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. I was just wondering if you could talk a bit more on PSO's natural gas generation purchase there. To what extent do you see the need for incremental gas generation, across Oklahoma, other service territories? Just wondering if you expect to see more of this.\nPeggy Simmons: So, I would say, this is Peggy, and I would say with the increased reserve margins that we're seeing from the RTOs and the additional load that we're starting to see across our system, we are going to need some additional generation. And this was a very proactive approach that the team took as I mentioned in my comments earlier, to go out and find some affordable assets that we could bring onto the system. And we plan to make that filing at the Commission later this fall.\nBen Fowke: Yes. Peggy mentioned proactive. It really, I think, was creative. It was outside of the RFP process, but we have an RFP process to compare the pricing to, and it's clearly very favorable. So, we're really excited about it. I think it'll be great for our customers.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. Thank you for that.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Steve Fleischman of Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nBen Fowke: Hey, Steve.\nSteven Fleishman: Hey, good morning. Sorry, I've got several questions on data center, or data processing, as you called it. So first of all, just in the quarter, you had the very strong commercial sales growth, but then your normalized sales growth between the two subs, I think was actually down $0.04. When you kind of look at both vertical and T&D, could you just talk to how we should think about that?\nBen Fowke: Yes, in T&D, Steve, normalized sales were up $0.02.\nSteven Fleishman: Right. But then the vertical was down $0.06, I think. So I guess just thinking, when I look at the whole picture, it's not kind of, at least in that line item, doesn't seem to be showing up as a benefit.\nBen Fowke: Yes. So, let me comment on the negative $0.06 in vertically integrated. That's largely due to in vertically integrated, we had in the quarter, but a 4.9% decrease over last Q2 in residential sales. And that's largely what drove that number. In our SWEPCO territory, we had in kind of mid to late May into early June, we had a number of repeated storm activity, tornadic activity that took, large swaths of customers out for significant amounts of times that drove that number down. We've seen that start to normalize back in June and July. So I expect that to return to a more normal state.\nSteven Fleishman: Okay. Thanks. And then on the 15 gigawatts of committed data center sales to 2030, could you just maybe better define what committed means when you give that data point?\nBen Fowke: Yes. I mean, it basically means that we have a letter of agreement, and those letter of agreements, Steve, start the clock running, if you will, for us to do work that pretty quickly can go into the millions, which that customer who signed the letter of agreement is required to pay. So that's how we define it. As we look forward, we look at a number of filtering criteria, ownership of sites, etcetera, that we use. So these are far from just inquiries. These are, serious customers that want to get on the grid and are willing to financially commit to do what it takes to get on the grid.\nSteven Fleishman: Okay. And are those customers kind of committing to these new tariffs you filed, or are we not at the point where they've made the agreement that those tariffs work for them when they've kind of done this?\nBen Fowke: Yes. Those tariffs, as you know they haven't been approved yet, but they will need depends where they are in the signing process as to whether or not they will be held to those tariffs or not. But going forward, customers, if approved, will all be required to step up to the tariffs.\nSteven Fleishman: Okay. And then\u2026.yes.\nBen Fowke: Which, as you know, I mean, well, as Steve was just going to say, it's just, it's really important. We're going to see more growth than we've seen in maybe generations. And it's going to be really important that that growth is beneficial for all customers and at the worst case, at least neutral. And that's exactly why we're trying to, that's exactly why we're so keenly focused on making sure that we have these tariffs and the modifications I mentioned in Indiana and West Virginia. And it's just, we got to get it right.\nSteven Fleishman: Okay. And then maybe just in terms of helping to frame the capital needs, just, can you give us some rough sense of that 15 gigawatts, how much might be related to vertically integrated parts of AEP versus the transmission only parts?\nBen Fowke: Yes, Steve. So the way to think about it is, think of it as a 50-50 split between Texas and PJM. 50%, or of course, Texas, right, is our wires company and PJM, take that 50% and basically split it 50-50 between INM, which is vertically integrated and AEP Ohio, right, which is wires only.\nSteven Fleishman: Okay. So that would be kind of 75-25, I guess, roughly, I think. Yes.\nBen Fowke: Okay. I think I've, yes. But we are seeing additional interest amongst other vertically integrated utilities, but that interest is not as firm yet.\nSteven Fleishman: Amongst some of your other vertically integrated.\nBen Fowke: Yes, that's correct.\nSteven Fleishman: Yes. Okay. Great. I'll leave it there. Thank you very much.\nBen Fowke: Thanks, Steve.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Nick Campanella of AEP [ph]. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Nick Campanella at Barclays here. Thanks for the time.\nBen Fowke: Did we just hire Nick?\nUnidentified Analyst: I never got the call. I never got the call, but thanks for the time. A lot of my questions have been answered, but I just, curious as we kind of try to think about the magnitude of capital that the plan can handle here. I know that there's financing considerations, but there's also kind of bill growth considerations. Just how high do you think your rate-based growth can get before you have to start thinking about customer bill impact, especially as some of this load should be able to supplement that, but just trying to see, where this rate-based CAGR could go at the end of the day. Thank you.\nBen Fowke: Yes, I think the incremental CapEx will be driven to support new load growth. And that's why we're just so keenly focused on making sure we get the rules right. And our modeling suggests that it will be good for all customers. And that's, I mean, that's what makes me so excited about this is that everybody can benefit, load's good for all, and it's going to, there are certainly pressures, on the grid and the resiliency and things like that, but I think the load's going to be beneficial to mitigate cost increases.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. Thanks. And then I guess, since you've kind of taken over, you have kind of pulled some strings on this involuntary, this voluntary severance program, just where are there other opportunities in the plan to cut costs today, or just things that maybe we're not thinking about that could be incremental to the positive?\nBen Fowke: Again, as I mentioned, I think, you've got Bill Furman coming in, he's got a track record of innovation. The companies in the Berkshire Hathaway portfolio were extremely well run. Bill is extremely well respected. So I think he's going to bring a lot of great ideas. It's a lot of blocking and tackling, and also taking advantage of innovation, smart technologies, etcetera, that'll get us there. But, the team has done a really good job, if you look back, in keeping O&M in check. So, again, I think the biggest way we keep costs down on our customers is to bring this new load on and bring it on in ways and rules and tariffs that are fair to all.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thank you.\nBen Fowke: Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Carly Davenport of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nCarly Davenport: Hey, good morning. Thanks for your time. Just a couple of clarification questions, if I could. First, just on the 15 gigawatts of incremental load by the end of the decade, could you just clarify, is all of that related to data centers, or is there anything else in there? And then, is there anything you can provide on how to think about the cadence of that load materializing from a timing perspective?\nBen Fowke: Yes, the 15 gigawatts refers to all data centers, and we're not announcing the cadence of that at this time. But it's already, as you can see, it's already showing up in our numbers. So we are hooking up, folks, and you'll see continued increases, over the next several years.\nCarly Davenport: Great. Thank you for that. And then, just a follow-up is just on the earned versus authorized ROE gap. I know you mentioned the earned ROE sort of flatted at 8.9% on a trailing 12-month basis. Do you have that comparable weather normalized number similar to what you've provided in previous quarters?\nPeggy Simmons: Oh, we're looking forward to be at 9.1% for this year. As I mentioned, over the past 12 months, I mean, on a rolling average right now, we\u2019re at 8.9% [ph] which is flat to where we were last quarter, but continuing to make progress on that front.\nCarly Davenport: Got it. Great. Thanks so much for the time.\nBen Fowke: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Andrew Wiesel of Scotiabank. Your line is open.\nBen Fowke: Good morning.\nAndrew Weisel: Hi, good morning. First, a quick governance question. Can you please talk about the outlook for the board, and specifically what roles will Ben and Bill each have? Who will be chair of the board, and will it be executive or non-executive? And how large will the board ultimately be?\nBen Fowke: Okay. Well, I will go back after my time as advisor, I'll go back to being a board member, and I will keep my independence. Bill obviously will be on the board. He'll be a non-independent director. Sara Martinez Tucker, or Sara Martinez Tucker will be the chair, and she will remain chair, and she's independent. Size of the board, we are basically at full size, and so there won't be any change to the size of the board. I don't know. Did I get all those questions?\nAndrew Weisel: Yes. That's great. Thank you very much. And then just a quick question on the cash flow slide, page 22. Some moving parts in 24 has led to slightly higher equity needs this year by about $100 million. Can you elaborate a little bit on that? And then looking to 2025 and beyond, I see no changes. Would I be right to assume that sort of just waiting for the update in three months? And just to clarify your comment on the equity-like tools, are you referring to the junior subordinates, or could there be something else in there, like equity units perhaps?\nBen Fowke: So, Andrew, first question. You also note in 2024, we had a $500 million increase in CapEx, and versus our plan for the year, we had additional asset sales that were part of the original plan that ended up changing through the year. So, in our financing, in our cash, we received less proceeds because of that change in plan. So, those two things basically drove the opportunity for the increase in equity, and just being opportunistic in the market as well. You're right, going forward, we have not updated those cash flows yet for our annual update, which we'll do at EEI.\nAndrew Weisel: Okay. The equity-like, was that just referring to the junior subordinates, or was there more to it?\nBen Fowke: Yes, that refers to the notes that we issued in June. But we would look at various forms of equity alternatives and be holistic in our approach.\nAndrew Weisel: Very good. Appreciate the details. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Durgesh Chopra of Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nDurgesh Chopra: Hey, team. Good morning. Good morning, Ben. Andrew actually asked my question on the financing slide. Chuck, maybe a little sort of more color, there were kind of more negatives to positives in that cash flow slide. I mean, the asset sale proceeds were lower, right, and the CapEx is higher. Just assuming normal weather for the rest of the year, are you going to be below 14.6 where you said, or should we kind of think about 14.6 as strong as going into the end of the year?\nCharles Zebula: Yes, our plan is to be in the 14% to 15% range. I'll just note, right, that we're well above the 13% downgrade threshold. So, yes, we plan to be in that range.\nDurgesh Chopra: Okay. Thank you. Appreciate the time.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Sophie Karp of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nSophie Karp: Hi. Good morning. Thank you for squeezing me in. If I could quickly go back to the 15 gigawatts of data center load, I guess, could you provide some color on how much of that can be connected without any incremental investment in your system versus how much would they require incremental investments to facilitate that?\nPeggy Simmons: Right now, none of that can be connected at this point in time, but as we look at our LOA process, that's why we are looking at any initial upgrades that are needed as we prepare to plan the system to connect this load over that period of time.\nSophie Karp: Got it. Got it. Thank you. And then maybe a little bit more of an open-ended question. Your current outstanding RFPs don't have any gas in them. It's mostly renewables. And I'm just curious of how you think about the cadence of needing to add dispatchable generation there. And when it comes to gas, will you continue to have a bias towards acquiring existing assets or will we see some new builds potentially?\nPeggy Simmons: So, our RFPs are all-source RFPs, so we're evaluating all technologies that come in. And we do believe the dispatchable resources are needed to be added to the grid as well, and they will be part of the plan.\nSophie Karp: Okay. Thank you.\nPeggy Simmons: You're welcome.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Bill Appicelli of UBS. Your line is open.\nWilliam Appicelli: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Just want to dig into a little bit more on the sales growth trends. So, on the residential side, you commented that Texas looks strong, but that more broadly, the cumulative effects of inflation have been weighing on it. So, any more color there? Are you expecting an improvement in the second half of the year?\nBen Fowke: Yes. So, Bill, in Texas, right, there is customer growth as well as, increase in use or as a result, increase in usage. In vertically integrated year-to-date, residential is down 1.3%, and T&D is actually up 0.3%, largely due to Texas. So, we are seeing, I think, in Appalachian Power, in Kentucky Power, in SWEPCO in particular, and I mentioned, some of the weather occurrences that we had in the SWEPCO area, weaker residential sales in those areas in particular.\nWilliam Appicelli: Okay. I mean, I guess we think about the EPA activities here, right, because you've got the, tremendous growth in the commercial side, right, tracking well above plan, but that's going to be lower margin volumes. And then maybe on the residential side, going back sort of four of the last five quarters, sort of as a negative, and that's obviously a bit of a higher margin, but, smaller overall change. What, we sort of reconcile that a little bit as we think about the EPA's impact.\nBen Fowke: Yes. I mean, clearly the residential sales are higher margin, but, again, I think it's, in particular, the effects of inflation. So, if inflation comes in tame, tamer as we begin to, as we've begun to see if wage growth, continues to close that gap. And as Ben mentioned, right, the opportunity to bring on large loads to spread fixed costs, right, over a much larger denominator, right, should mitigate, right, some of those customer rate impacts as well. So the combination of those things, right, should begin to, slow that decline. But, clearly, the effects of inflation have hit home for a lot of customers.\nWilliam Appicelli: Right. Okay. And then I guess the other question is, it's come up a little bit, but on the episode of debt, under, I guess, the Moody's methodology, do you know what that number would be?\nBen Fowke: Yes, it's 14.6 under Moody's.\nWilliam Appicelli: Oh, it's under Moody's. Okay. All right. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Julian Smith of Jefferies. Your line is open.\nJulian Smith: Hey, good morning, team. Thank you guys very much for the time. I appreciate it. Going back. Thank you very much. Appreciate it. Maybe going back to some of the conversation on the layoffs and severance bit. I just want to understand the extent to which this process is finalized, right? You've given very specific jurisdictional level details. And given that, how are you thinking about rebuilding and devolving some decision-making power and some of the roles to the local OpCo\u2019s? Can you speak to perhaps what seems like perhaps a strategic shift in looking at local level decision-making and really what level or what quantity of the roles in terms of overall layoffs will actually be ultimately recreated, if you will, at the local level here? So both the financial question in terms of what's the sort of ongoing net savings and B, how do you think about this fitting within the strategic question of devolvement?\nBen Fowke: Yes, I'm going to turn it over to Peggy in a second. But just as a recap, we did hit our targets that we laid out under that voluntary severance program. And we plan to hold as much of those gains as possible. Probably have to do some hiring back, but try to keep that minimized. Remember, there was two-pronged approach for this. One, we wanted to mitigate some of the inflationary pressures that we were seeing, higher interest rates, just overall increase in supply chain, etcetera, and take a portion of that, albeit a smaller portion, and start putting those, some of those resource, some of that money back into our local communities with more boots on the ground, if you will, more community leadership positions and that sort of thing. So Peggy, do you want to?\nPeggy Simmons: Yes, Ben. So yes, that's exactly, Julian, what we're looking to do. We are, some of those positions were leadership positions that report to some of our Presidents. We are making sure that we are getting those filled and we're adding additional resources in the regulatory and legislative space, because we know that as dynamic as our industry is and as much change as is occurring, we want to make sure that we have that enhanced engagement at those levels. So you'll see more of that.\nJulian Smith: Excellent. All right. Looking forward to that. And then related, you talk about these staggering levels of the 15 gigawatts of firm commitments at this point. How do you think about that marrying up, especially in your wires businesses against an effort to address generation needs? I know this has been an ongoing tension, but given what seems like yet an accelerating backdrop of generation needs, how do you think about your utilities, especially in the buyers only businesses, potentially re-engaging in that narrative? And in what ways?\nBen Fowke: Well, I mean, I think that would take legislation clearly in Ohio. I guess it would take it in Texas, too, but I don't see that happening. I think it's probably a long shot in Ohio as well. So, we are going to have to rely on the market, but our vertically integrated utilities are all going to need generation and in different timeframes. But I think Peggy mentioned, we've got, we do have more with the changes in the reserve margin requirements, for example, in SPP. It creates a resource need, and we're developing our plans to fill that, which will require increased CapEx, which I think is a good thing. And we're really, again, excited about Green Country. The load is tremendous, and it's primarily data centers, but of course we'd be remiss if we didn't mention we've seen industrial load in Texas as well. And I think when we think about economic development, we're going to continue to look for opportunities to bring industry back on shore. And I'm right here in Columbus today, and the Intel has just been an enormous success, and we're going to keep looking for opportunities for our communities, and, again, all customers benefit from that.\nJulian Smith: All right, guys. Thank you very much. I appreciate it.\nBen Fowke: Thank you.\nOperator: Your last question comes from the line of Paul Patterson of Glenrock. Your line is open.\nPaul Patterson: Good morning. How are you doing?\nBen Fowke: I'm doing good.\nPaul Patterson: Great. So I asked this question some time ago about Chevron, and we now have a Supreme Court decision. And I'm just wondering how you guys see it potentially impacting either EPA or FERC regulation or anything else you might, if you think it has any potential impact on AEP, I guess.\nBen Fowke: I think it's early, but, yes I think it could potentially be helpful as courts have more discretion not to have to rely on the agencies, which that was the whole point of that. And I just think it doesn't bind the courts as much as it probably did in the past. Now, whether that, how the courts interpret it, what, the rulings are, we'll have to wait and see. But Paul, I think in general it's going to be helpful. And we are going to challenge a lot of these EPA rules, as you know, the CCR rule, the ELG rule, the 111 rules. I guess all of the rules that have come out we're going to challenge and for good reason.\nPaul Patterson: Okay, great. And then just on FERC, do you see anything happening there maybe?\nBen Fowke: I don't know. I think, I know there's some, there's some thought that it would, but I think that really, I'm not convinced it will. So, I think that remains to be seen.\nPaul Patterson: Okay. The rest of my questions have been answered. Thanks so much. Have a great one.\nBen Fowke: All right, Paul. Thank you.\nDarcy Reese: That concludes it. Thank you for joining us on today's call. As always, the IR team will be available to answer any additional questions you may have. JL, would you please give the replay information?\nOperator: Certainly. Echo replay will be available in two hours until August 6th at 1-800-770-2030. That's 1-800-770-2030 using playback ID 6645529. That's replay playback ID 6645529 followed by the pound key. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thank you, Peggy, and good morning, everyone. Let's jump right into our second quarter results. Slide seven shows the comparison of GAAP to operating earnings for the quarter and year-to-date periods. GAAP earnings for the second quarter were $0.64 per share compared to $1.01 per share in 2023. Year-to-date GAAP earnings are $2.55 per share for this year versus $1.78 per share last year. There's a detailed reconciliation of GAAP to operating earnings for the second quarter and year-to-date results on pages 13 and 14 respectively. Let's briefly highlight a few of the non-operating items for the quarter that mostly make up the difference between GAAP and operating earnings. First, as disclosed in an 8-K in May, an after-tax provision of $126 million for customer refunds was recorded based on recent developments in the remand proceeding related to the cost cap associated with the Turk plant that has been debated over the last decade. Secondly, we incurred a $94 million expense associated with a voluntary severance program that we completed in the second quarter. And finally, as Ben mentioned, the final revised EPA CCR rule became effective in May. We recorded a $111 million accrual for compliance costs largely related to our Ohio properties where generation is deregulated. We also updated our asset retirement obligations for sites in our regulated entities where we intend to seek cost recovery. Let's walk through our quarterly operating earnings performance by segment on slide eight. Operating earnings for the second quarter totaled $125 per share or $662 million compared to $113 per share or $582 million in 2023. This results in an increase of $80 million or $0.12 per share, which is a 10.6% increase over last year. Operating earnings for vertically integrated utilities were $0.46 per share, down $0.05. Positive drivers included favorable year-over-year weather and rate changes across multiple jurisdictions, with the 2022 PSO base case and the 2023 Virginia proceeding being the most significant. These items were offset by higher income taxes, which are largely a reversal of favorable income taxes in the first quarter, lower normalized retail sales, and higher depreciation. Note the year-to-date results in this segment consolidate the income tax loss that is shown in this quarter, resulting in an immaterial year-to-date income tax variance versus last year. The transmission and distribution utility segment earned $0.41 per share, up $0.11 compared to last year. Positive drivers in this segment included favorable weather, increased transmission revenue, rate changes primarily from the distribution cost recovery factor in Texas, and higher normalized retail sales. These items were partially offset by increased property taxes and depreciation. The AEP transmission Holdco segment contributed $0.39 per share, up a penny compared to last year, primarily driven by investment growth. Generation and marketing produced $0.12 per share, down a penny from last year. Recall that AEP renewables was sold in the third quarter last year, which has two impacts, a negative earnings variance due to the business being sold and removal of the interest costs for financing these assets. Additional drivers were lower retail margins offset by higher generation margins and lower taxes. Finally, corporate and other was up $0.06 compared to the prior year, primarily driven by lower income taxes and increased other operating income related to timing in the prior year. These items were partially offset by higher interest expense and lower interest income from the GNM segment. Let's turn to slide nine, which shows weather normalized retail sales of 4% in the quarter from a year ago, headlined by a double-digit 12.4% increase in commercial sales, which is where our data processing customers are classified. I'll note that in our T&D segment, the increase in commercial load was over 20% for the quarter. This is a trend that will continue over the coming years based on already signed customer commitments. Our operating footprint and robust transmission system position us perfectly to grow along AI and other technologies and industries in need of access to affordable and reliable power. Through the remainder of this year, data processing gains will remain mostly concentrated in Ohio and Texas. But beyond this year, we are seeing strong commitments from new customers looking to connect at some of our vertically integrated companies as well. Outside of data processors, our industrial sales have remained resilient in the face of a slowing economy. Industrial sales were strongest in Texas, driven by an influx of new customers, mainly in the energy industry. Thanks to our success over the past few years on the economic development front, we expect to see our industrial sales continue to be resilient in the next few years as several new large customers in steel, energy, renewable energy, and semiconductors come online across our footprint. In the residential segment, we continue to see growth in customer count and load in Texas, but residential load remains weak in most of our territories, likely due to the cumulative effects of inflation. Bottom line, the amount of demand from new large loads we're seeing across our system is unprecedented. We are excited, challenged, and poised to embrace this opportunity. Let's move on to slide 10. In the top left table, you can see the FFO to debt metric stands at 14.6% for the 12 months ended June 30th, which is a 40 basis point increase from the prior quarter. Our debt-to-cap decreased slightly from last quarter and was 62.6% at quarter end. We took credit-supportive financing actions in the second quarter by issuing $400 million of equity under our at-the-market program and by issuing $1 billion in junior subordinated notes at the parent, which qualified for 50% equity credit at all three rating agencies. In the lower left part of this slide, you can see our liquidity summary, which remains strong at $5.4 billion and is supported by $6 billion in credit facilities. Lastly, on the qualified pension front, our funding status is near 99%. In summary, our second quarter results provide additional momentum this year, bringing year-to-date earnings up to $2.52 per share, an increase of $0.28, or 12.5% compared to the same period last year. We reaffirm our operating earnings guidance range of $553 to $573 and remain committed to our long-term growth rate of 6% to 7%. And as we move through the balance of the year, our focus is on providing reliable and affordable service to our customers, executing our plan, and embracing the growth opportunities that we have ahead of us. Also, a quick update on the sale of AEP on-site partners. We expect the transaction to close in the third quarter and result in approximately $315 million in net proceeds to the company. I'd be remiss if I didn't acknowledge the skilled leadership of Ben Folk during this time of transition at AEP. Ben told you that this company would not be in neutral during the transition, and I can say that that is absolutely true. Ben, while I know you'll still be engaged as an advisor and board role going forward, I want you to know that the AEP team appreciates your engagement and contributions over the past five months. Finally, the AEP team looks forward to the arrival of our new CEO and President, Bill Furman. We all look forward to Bill bringing his accomplished leadership to AEP and working with him as we take on the exciting opportunities that we have before us. Thank you for your interest in American Electric Power. Operator, can you open the call so we can address your questions? Thank you. Ben, the only thing I would add is, right, it's so important as we are a regulated utility and have significant capital needs not only today, but going forward right, to maintain investment credit ratings, and we will defend that right in our plan. Thanks. You did mention, Shar asked the mix between distribution and transmission. So, it's going to, there's obviously going to be a lot of transmission that needs to be built, as well as distribution. Jeremy, I would say you'll note, in our materials that we raised our CapEx this year already by $500 million. That largely is in T&D, right? It's for reliability spend, also customer hookups, and then storm-related capital. So the shape of it right, is going to be as these customer additions, come online. And again, as Ben mentioned, we'll be laying all that out in the fall. I think that that's true. Yes, our plan is to be in the 14% to 15% range. I'll just note, right, that we're well above the 13% downgrade threshold. So, yes, we plan to be in that range."

            "name": "Ben Fowke",
            "content": "Good morning, and welcome to American Electric Power's second quarter 2024 earnings call. Shortly, Peggy will provide a regulatory update, followed by Chuck, who will review our financial results in more detail. A summary of our second quarter 2024 business highlights can be found on slide 6 of today's presentation. Before I dive into our results, I would like to start by welcoming Bill Furman to AEP as our new President and CEO, effective August 1st. Bill brings decades of utility operational leadership experience and in-depth knowledge of the energy industry, most recently serving as President and CEO of Century Holdings, and prior to that, President and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway Energy. With Bill's expertise and diverse background, you can anticipate a smooth transition and continuity of strategic direction. Expect more focus on execution, and Bill has the background to do just that, including capturing growth, listening and responding to our regulators and investors, and using innovation to mitigate inflationary pressures. While I will be serving as Senior Advisor for several months to ensure a smooth transition, it's been an honor to lead AEP as Interim President and CEO, and I'm proud of what the team has accomplished so far this year. Now, turning to AEP's financial results. Today, we announced second quarter 2024 operating earnings of $1.25 per share, a $0.12 increase over one year ago. Our operational execution through the first half of the year, combined with our efforts to efficiently manage the business, have put us well on track to achieve our targets. Today, we reaffirm our 2024 full-year operating earnings guidance range from $5.53 to $5.73, and our long-term earnings growth rate of 6% to 7%. Regarding data center load, we have commitments from customers for more than 15 gigawatts of incremental load by the end of this decade, mostly driven by large load opportunities. To put this in perspective, AEP's system-wide peak load at the end of last year was 35 gigawatts. We continue to work with data center customers to meet their increased demand, while ensuring contracts and new initiatives are fair and beneficial for all of our customers. In the fall, we will provide an update on what this large load opportunity means for our capital spend, including generation and transmission investment, and on our plan to responsibly finance this growth initiative. While we certainly encourage innovation when it comes to meeting the energy needs of our customers, data centers included, I want to emphasize that it is critically important that costs associated with these large loads are allocated fairly, and the right investments are made for the long-term success of our grid. For this reason, we filed new data center tariffs in Ohio and large load tariff modifications in Indiana and West Virginia, and it's the reason why we filed a complaint with FERC related to a co-located load agreement. We will know soon what FERC decides, but this is the rationale we used. Given the co-located load agreement is an active case before FERC, I don't plan on making any further comments. I'd also like to note that large load impacts are already being felt here in AEP's service territories, primarily Ohio and Texas, as our commercial load grew an impressive 12.4% over the second quarter of last year. Looking ahead, we expect the incremental load I just mentioned to move forward in these states and others, including Indiana. Moving to another example of capital opportunities, PSO announced an agreement at the end of June to purchase a 795-megawatt natural gas generation facility conditioned on regulatory approval. The facility, known as Green Country, is located in Jenks [ph] Oklahoma, and will ensure PSO customers continue to benefit from reliable and affordable resources. For this resource adequacy-driven capital, PSO plans to seek regulatory approval this fall, at which time the economics of this acquisition will be made public. As you know, maintaining a strong balance is critical to fund increased capital spend to support our growth initiatives. We will sensibly finance our capital needs, and we're open to incremental growth equity and equity-like tools, in addition to portfolio optimization. On a similar portfolio note, the sale of AEP on-site partners remains on track to close in the third quarter following FERC approval. Now let's move on to the Federal EPA's Coal Combustion Residual Rule, or CCR, which was finalized in the second quarter and expanded the scope of the rule to include inactive impoundments at existing and inactive facilities. We continue to evaluate the applicability of the rule to current and former plant sites, and have developed preliminary estimates of compliance costs. While we are working with others and looking at potential legal challenges to the revised rules, as appropriate, we do plan to seek cost recovery through new and or existing regulatory mechanisms. Chuck will have more information on this shortly. Before I turn it over to Peggy for additional updates, I'd like to thank all of you for your support during my time as AEP's interim CEO. I've been privileged to serve AEP over the past five months, and the board and I are confident that Bill is the right person to build on the momentum underway and to lead AEP into its next chapter. On a related note, we are planning an informal meet and greet in New York City soon, so analyst investors can say hello to Bill in person. We are targeting something in August, so stay tuned for more information coming your way in the next couple of days. Finally, I'm excited about what the future holds for AEP as we execute on our strategic priorities and enhance value for all of our stakeholders. Peggy? Morning. Morning. Yes. I think that was a lot different circumstance, Shar, but Bill's very familiar with our strategy. We clearly had conversations with Bill about our strategy. So I think it's, I think we're on the right strategic direction. I do think Bill's going to come in and focus very much on execution. He's got a ton of experience, as we mentioned. And so I mean he'll take some time, assess where we are and I'm sure he's going to make some changes, but I don't see significant changes in the strategic direction. It's not like we gave him a plan, a to-do list, and you do all these things. He's going to be a dynamic leader. But the path we're on is, I think we're all in agreement, it's the right path and we need to execute on it. Yes, I mean, clearly we're going to have an update in the fall, either at or right before EEI, that incorporates what it means to CapEx to fund this low growth, both in generation and transmission, and of course, what it means to make sure the balance sheet is strong in terms of equity and equity-like products, including portfolio optimization. Regarding portfolio optimization, you've heard me say it before, we're always open to it, but price has to be there, and the ability to execute has to be there. And the regulated utility spaces, those are two hard things to put together at the same time, but we're open to it. Chuck, I don't know if you want to add anything to it. Hey, Jeremy. Yes. Well, as I mentioned, with Shar's comment, I mean, you're definitely going to see a lot of increase in transmission spent. There's got to be something to plug into, so we're going to have generation, as well, and we recognize the need to make sure we have reliable distribution grid. So, I think if I had to rate it, it would be transmission increases, followed by generation, followed by distribution. Yes. Peggy mentioned proactive. It really, I think, was creative. It was outside of the RFP process, but we have an RFP process to compare the pricing to, and it's clearly very favorable. So, we're really excited about it. I think it'll be great for our customers. Hey, Steve. Yes, in T&D, Steve, normalized sales were up $0.02. Yes. So, let me comment on the negative $0.06 in vertically integrated. That's largely due to in vertically integrated, we had in the quarter, but a 4.9% decrease over last Q2 in residential sales. And that's largely what drove that number. In our SWEPCO territory, we had in kind of mid to late May into early June, we had a number of repeated storm activity, tornadic activity that took, large swaths of customers out for significant amounts of times that drove that number down. We've seen that start to normalize back in June and July. So I expect that to return to a more normal state. Yes. I mean, it basically means that we have a letter of agreement, and those letter of agreements, Steve, start the clock running, if you will, for us to do work that pretty quickly can go into the millions, which that customer who signed the letter of agreement is required to pay. So that's how we define it. As we look forward, we look at a number of filtering criteria, ownership of sites, etcetera, that we use. So these are far from just inquiries. These are, serious customers that want to get on the grid and are willing to financially commit to do what it takes to get on the grid. Yes. Those tariffs, as you know they haven't been approved yet, but they will need depends where they are in the signing process as to whether or not they will be held to those tariffs or not. But going forward, customers, if approved, will all be required to step up to the tariffs. Which, as you know, I mean, well, as Steve was just going to say, it's just, it's really important. We're going to see more growth than we've seen in maybe generations. And it's going to be really important that that growth is beneficial for all customers and at the worst case, at least neutral. And that's exactly why we're trying to, that's exactly why we're so keenly focused on making sure that we have these tariffs and the modifications I mentioned in Indiana and West Virginia. And it's just, we got to get it right. Yes, Steve. So the way to think about it is, think of it as a 50-50 split between Texas and PJM. 50%, or of course, Texas, right, is our wires company and PJM, take that 50% and basically split it 50-50 between INM, which is vertically integrated and AEP Ohio, right, which is wires only. Okay. I think I've, yes. But we are seeing additional interest amongst other vertically integrated utilities, but that interest is not as firm yet. Yes, that's correct. Thanks, Steve. Did we just hire Nick? Yes, I think the incremental CapEx will be driven to support new load growth. And that's why we're just so keenly focused on making sure we get the rules right. And our modeling suggests that it will be good for all customers. And that's, I mean, that's what makes me so excited about this is that everybody can benefit, load's good for all, and it's going to, there are certainly pressures, on the grid and the resiliency and things like that, but I think the load's going to be beneficial to mitigate cost increases. Again, as I mentioned, I think, you've got Bill Furman coming in, he's got a track record of innovation. The companies in the Berkshire Hathaway portfolio were extremely well run. Bill is extremely well respected. So I think he's going to bring a lot of great ideas. It's a lot of blocking and tackling, and also taking advantage of innovation, smart technologies, etcetera, that'll get us there. But, the team has done a really good job, if you look back, in keeping O&M in check. So, again, I think the biggest way we keep costs down on our customers is to bring this new load on and bring it on in ways and rules and tariffs that are fair to all. Thanks. Yes, the 15 gigawatts refers to all data centers, and we're not announcing the cadence of that at this time. But it's already, as you can see, it's already showing up in our numbers. So we are hooking up, folks, and you'll see continued increases, over the next several years. Thank you. Good morning. Okay. Well, I will go back after my time as advisor, I'll go back to being a board member, and I will keep my independence. Bill obviously will be on the board. He'll be a non-independent director. Sara Martinez Tucker, or Sara Martinez Tucker will be the chair, and she will remain chair, and she's independent. Size of the board, we are basically at full size, and so there won't be any change to the size of the board. I don't know. Did I get all those questions? So, Andrew, first question. You also note in 2024, we had a $500 million increase in CapEx, and versus our plan for the year, we had additional asset sales that were part of the original plan that ended up changing through the year. So, in our financing, in our cash, we received less proceeds because of that change in plan. So, those two things basically drove the opportunity for the increase in equity, and just being opportunistic in the market as well. You're right, going forward, we have not updated those cash flows yet for our annual update, which we'll do at EEI. Yes, that refers to the notes that we issued in June. But we would look at various forms of equity alternatives and be holistic in our approach. Yes. So, Bill, in Texas, right, there is customer growth as well as, increase in use or as a result, increase in usage. In vertically integrated year-to-date, residential is down 1.3%, and T&D is actually up 0.3%, largely due to Texas. So, we are seeing, I think, in Appalachian Power, in Kentucky Power, in SWEPCO in particular, and I mentioned, some of the weather occurrences that we had in the SWEPCO area, weaker residential sales in those areas in particular. Yes. I mean, clearly the residential sales are higher margin, but, again, I think it's, in particular, the effects of inflation. So, if inflation comes in tame, tamer as we begin to, as we've begun to see if wage growth, continues to close that gap. And as Ben mentioned, right, the opportunity to bring on large loads to spread fixed costs, right, over a much larger denominator, right, should mitigate, right, some of those customer rate impacts as well. So the combination of those things, right, should begin to, slow that decline. But, clearly, the effects of inflation have hit home for a lot of customers. Yes, it's 14.6 under Moody's. Yes, I'm going to turn it over to Peggy in a second. But just as a recap, we did hit our targets that we laid out under that voluntary severance program. And we plan to hold as much of those gains as possible. Probably have to do some hiring back, but try to keep that minimized. Remember, there was two-pronged approach for this. One, we wanted to mitigate some of the inflationary pressures that we were seeing, higher interest rates, just overall increase in supply chain, etcetera, and take a portion of that, albeit a smaller portion, and start putting those, some of those resource, some of that money back into our local communities with more boots on the ground, if you will, more community leadership positions and that sort of thing. So Peggy, do you want to? Well, I mean, I think that would take legislation clearly in Ohio. I guess it would take it in Texas, too, but I don't see that happening. I think it's probably a long shot in Ohio as well. So, we are going to have to rely on the market, but our vertically integrated utilities are all going to need generation and in different timeframes. But I think Peggy mentioned, we've got, we do have more with the changes in the reserve margin requirements, for example, in SPP. It creates a resource need, and we're developing our plans to fill that, which will require increased CapEx, which I think is a good thing. And we're really, again, excited about Green Country. The load is tremendous, and it's primarily data centers, but of course we'd be remiss if we didn't mention we've seen industrial load in Texas as well. And I think when we think about economic development, we're going to continue to look for opportunities to bring industry back on shore. And I'm right here in Columbus today, and the Intel has just been an enormous success, and we're going to keep looking for opportunities for our communities, and, again, all customers benefit from that. Thank you. I'm doing good. I think it's early, but, yes I think it could potentially be helpful as courts have more discretion not to have to rely on the agencies, which that was the whole point of that. And I just think it doesn't bind the courts as much as it probably did in the past. Now, whether that, how the courts interpret it, what, the rulings are, we'll have to wait and see. But Paul, I think in general it's going to be helpful. And we are going to challenge a lot of these EPA rules, as you know, the CCR rule, the ELG rule, the 111 rules. I guess all of the rules that have come out we're going to challenge and for good reason. I don't know. I think, I know there's some, there's some thought that it would, but I think that really, I'm not convinced it will. So, I think that remains to be seen. All right, Paul. Thank you."

            "name": "Peggy Simmons",
            "content": "Thanks, Ben, and good morning, everyone. Now let's turn to an update on several of AEP's ongoing regulatory initiatives. We are engaged in our regulatory and legislative areas, continuing to strengthen relationships, including implementation of our investment in more people and resources at the local level. And as the utility industry is changing, now more than ever, AEP's operating company leaders are staying increasingly engaged with regulators amidst this dynamic environment. Customer bills and affordability remain top of mind for AEP, in addition to system reliability and resiliency. We are focused on advancing interest in each of the states we operate, which includes economic development, work across service or service territory to bring jobs and create Bill headroom from a larger load perspective, and to ultimately achieve the regulatory outcomes that are good for AEP's customers, communities, investors, and employees. We continue to work through regulatory items with the focus on our authorized versus earned ROE gap, which remained flat at 8.9% for the past 12 months as of second quarter 2024. Turning to some positive rate case development, let's start with INM. I'm pleased to report that in May, we received an order in Indiana approving all key items in our settlement, including an improved 9.85% ROE. In June, we received a constructive order in Michigan maintaining our existing 9.86% ROE, with new rates taking effect in mid-July. Just last week for AEP Texas, parties filed a unanimous and unopposed comprehensive settlement with the ALJ increasing our authorized ROE to 9.76%, with rates effective in early October pending commission approval. As you know, earlier this year, we filed an APCo biennial rate review in Virginia and a base rate case for PSO in Oklahoma, where we received intervener testimony in the PSO case last evening. We're at the beginning of the procedural schedules in both cases and expect commission orders in the fourth quarter. We look forward to sharing updates on our progress in the coming months. Relative to future cases, APCo plans to file a base rate case in West Virginia in the next week. While we have many trackers in place to help mitigate regulatory lag, we have not had a rate case here in a few years and look forward to working with the parties to achieve a balanced and fair result. Looking ahead, I am proud of the progress we continue to make on the regulatory front and I remain excited about advancing our regulatory strategies in 2024 and beyond. Let's discuss AEP's recent fleet transformation activities and the progress we made on that important initiative. In May, APCo issued requests for proposals for 800 megawatts of wind or solar owned resources with regulatory filing anticipated in 2025. Finally, as Ben mentioned, PSO signed an agreement in June to purchase Green Country's 795 megawatt natural gas generation facility to help ensure resource adequacy. The agreement is conditioned on regulatory approval and we plan to make the related filings with the Oklahoma Commission in the fall. This is an example of a proactive approach by the team in meeting ever increasing resource needs and we're enthusiastic about the opportunity as we advance our fleet transformation. To wrap up, I'd like to thank Ben for his leadership and welcome Bill to the AEP team. This is an exciting time here at AEP and when I think about the future, I'm motivated by the opportunities we have ahead of us, embracing large loads, advancing our regulatory strategy, and driving overall long-term success. I'll now turn things over to Chuck who is going to walk through second quarter 2024 performance drivers and details supporting our financial results. Chuck? So, I would say, this is Peggy, and I would say with the increased reserve margins that we're seeing from the RTOs and the additional load that we're starting to see across our system, we are going to need some additional generation. And this was a very proactive approach that the team took as I mentioned in my comments earlier, to go out and find some affordable assets that we could bring onto the system. And we plan to make that filing at the Commission later this fall. Oh, we're looking forward to be at 9.1% for this year. As I mentioned, over the past 12 months, I mean, on a rolling average right now, we're at 8.9% [ph] which is flat to where we were last quarter, but continuing to make progress on that front. Right now, none of that can be connected at this point in time, but as we look at our LOA process, that's why we are looking at any initial upgrades that are needed as we prepare to plan the system to connect this load over that period of time. So, our RFPs are all-source RFPs, so we're evaluating all technologies that come in. And we do believe the dispatchable resources are needed to be added to the grid as well, and they will be part of the plan. You're welcome. Yes, Ben. So yes, that's exactly, Julian, what we're looking to do. We are, some of those positions were leadership positions that report to some of our Presidents. We are making sure that we are getting those filled and we're adding additional resources in the regulatory and legislative space, because we know that as dynamic as our industry is and as much change as is occurring, we want to make sure that we have that enhanced engagement at those levels. So you'll see more of that."

At this time I like to welcome everyone to the American Electric Power First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]   \n Thank you. And I would now like to turn the conference over to Darcy Reese, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin. \nDarcy Reese: Thank you, Abby. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call for American Electric Power. We appreciate you taking time today to join us. Our earnings release, presentation slides and related financial information are available on our website at aep.com.  \n Today, we will be making forward-looking statements during the call. There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements. Please refer to our SEC filings for a discussion of these factors. Joining me this morning for opening remarks are Ben Fowke, our President and Interim Chief Executive Officer; Chuck Zebula, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Peggy Simmons, our Executive Vice President of Utilities. We will take your questions following their remarks.  \n I will now turn the call over to Ben. \nBenjamin Gwynn Fowke: Well, good morning, and welcome to American Electric Power's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. Shortly, Peggy will give a regulatory update, followed by Chuck, who will provide more detailed financial review.  \n The summary of our first quarter 2024 business highlights can be found on Slide 6 of today's presentation. Beginning with AEP's financial results, today, we announced first quarter 2024 operating earnings of $1.27 per share, a $0.16 increase over 1 year ago. We are also reaffirming AEP's 2024 full year operating earnings guidance of $5.53 to $5.73. And the long-term earnings growth rate of 6% to 7%.  \n I'm pleased to note, we achieved a 14.2% FFO to debt ratio this quarter, which is within our stated range. Let me assure you that AEP's direction and strategy remain on track as this team is fully engaged, energized and working well together to enhance the customer experience and investor value. I've reviewed AEP's financial targets, and I have total confidence in the plan's achievability.  \n It's hard to believe it's been just 2 months, since I stepped into the role of interim CEO, and it has been a busy and productive 60 days. I've had the opportunity to meet with many different stakeholders, including elected officials, regulators, community leaders, customers, investors and, of course, the team right here at AEP. All of these meetings have been very useful in helping shape the initiatives I will discuss shortly.  \n Before I dive into other business, I want to give you a brief update on the search for a permanent CEO. The process is well underway, and I am certain, based on the talent pool that we're looking at that we will find the right person to lead AEP. As I mentioned, when we first talked at the end of February, the search will probably take between 6 to 12 months. We will take the time necessary to find the best candidate, and we're committed to keeping you informed.  \n So across the AEP system, I see the need to increase capital spend in the future, including incremental investment related to commercial load growth from data centers and resiliency spend. Specific to load growth, the amount of service request is truly staggering and ranges between 10 to 15 gigawatts of incremental load by the end of the decade, in addition to many, many more gigawatts from hundreds of inquiries.  \n The key to capturing this commercial and industrial growth is to work with parties to make sure that commitments are real and secure, the tariffs and contracts are fair to all customers and growth is self-funded. And of course, that the load can be met. A couple of great examples of new commercial commitments can be evidenced by last week's announcements from both Amazon Web Services and Google to build large data centers in I&M's Northern Indiana service territory.  \n At AEP, we have the largest transmission system in the United States with a high-voltage backbone in the Midwest. We expect more transmission investment possibilities driven by this data center growth, specifically in substations and customer connections. As a side note, I'd like to call attention to AEP's commercial load in the first quarter of 2024 which grew at 10.5% over the first quarter of last year.  \n In addition, we will file our system resiliency plan in Texas, no later than the third quarter of this year, related to legislation passed in 2023, including investment related to hardening and modernizing the grid, expanding vegetation management and, of course, wildfire mitigation.  \n Clearly, a strong balance sheet is critical as we look to fund potential increased capital spend. And I believe incremental growth equity needed to fund smart capital is a positive thing.  \n That said, we are open to equity alternatives through portfolio optimization, looking at opportunities where price meets execution, while at the same time, staying focused on our efforts to achieve constructive regulatory outcomes. On a similar note, I'd now like to provide a brief update on the sales of our AEP Energy Retail and AEP OnSite Distributed Resources businesses, both of which are included in the Generation & Marketing segment.  \n We are working through final phases of the process and expect to conclude that process by our second quarter earnings call. Now let's move on to last week's newly published federal EPA rules on greenhouse gas standards, coal combustion residuals or CCR, Effluent Limitation Guidelines or ELG.  \n Although our team is still reviewing the rules, we will likely pursue legal challenges, while working with others, including our states who are aligned with AEP's commitment to provide customers with reliable and affordable energy. These new regulations in some cases, require the use of unproven technologies, are extremely expensive and establish unreasonable compliance schedules.  \n We are at a time when our nation needs to add dispatchable generation to support grid reliability and growth, and these rules have the potential to not only prematurely accelerate plant closures, but also discourage new dispatchable generation from being built.  \n Now turning to labor management. We announced a voluntary severance program earlier this month, taking effect July 1. We expect this initiative will save labor cost of approximately $100 million and will assist us in managing our cost to better serve our customers, allow us to redeploy resources locally in our regulated footprint and finally, mitigate impacts from inflationary pressures and interest rates.  \n Of course, we will do it so in a way that is fair and equitable to all of our valued employees. So as I mentioned, it's been a busy and productive couple of months. Have confidence in our strategy and team. I'm excited about the opportunities ahead to drive growth and create value for our investors. We look forward to providing you even more positive updates as we move forward in the year, further solidifying stakeholder confidence in our financial targets.  \n Before we turn to Peggy for additional updates, know that I am aware of AEP's regulatory successes and some of our challenges. We continue to review plans to strengthen our regulatory compacts as we work through the past and are ready for the future. Peggy? \nPeggy Simmons: Thanks, Ben, and good morning, everyone. Now let's go to an update on several of AEP's ongoing regulatory initiatives. We are currently focused on investing more in people resources at the local level, particularly in regulatory and legislative areas.  \n The utility industry is changing and more now than ever, it's critical that we enhance our engagement in this dynamic environment. More details of our related regulatory activity can be found in the appendix beginning on Slide 23. AEP's operating company leaders are running the business and engaged with our state regulators. Higher costs for materials and frequency of cases shines a spotlight on affordability and customer builds are top of mind for us.  \n We are focused on advancing interest in each of the states we operate to achieve outcomes that are good for our customers, our communities and our investors. This includes economic development work across our service territory, which brings jobs and creates headroom from larger load perspectives.  \n We continue to reduce our authorized versus actual ROE gap. We're doing the work and our ROE improved slightly this quarter to 8.9%. Even considering this measure is depressed by approximately 30 basis points from mild weather conditions. Staying with the recent positive developments, I'm pleased to report AEP Ohio's Electric Security Plan V settlement obtained last summer -- excuse me, last September was approved by the commission earlier this month.  \n This ESP covers a 4-year term of June 2024 through May 2028. As we shared previously, we filed new base cases in Indiana and Michigan in the latter half of 2023. In Indiana, we reached settlement, which was filed in December, and we expect the commission decision by June of this year.  \n In Michigan, we completed the procedural schedule and expect a relief in that case in July. The team has been busy in 2024 so far, filing an Oklahoma base case for PSO in January and an AEP Texas case in February. Last month, we filed the APCo Virginia biennial rate review, required by statute from legislative changes attained in 2023.  \n Earlier this month, in SWEPCO, Arkansas and Louisiana jurisdictions we filed the annual formula rate plan. Now on to the regulated resource additions. We continue to advance our 5-year, $9.4 billion regulated renewable capital plan and have a total of $6.6 billion approved by state commissions at APCo, I&M, PSO and SWEPCO. As you can see, we're making great progress. We are also considering the renewables market local input, as well as evolving reserve margins and resource adequacy as we meet the needs of our customers.  \n We are advancing toward our fleet transformation targets, which are aligned with and supported by our integrated resource plan. We have pending requests for proposals for a diverse set of additional generation resources at I&M, Kentucky Power, PSO and SWEPCO with more to come from other operating companies, including APCo.  \n These generation investments are an integral part of our broader capital program, which is 100% focused on regulated assets. Looking ahead, we know there is more work to be done as we advance our regulatory strategies in 2024 to achieve a forecasted regulated ROE of 9.1%. We look forward to continuing to engage constructively with our regulators and strengthening relationships.  \n With that, I'll pass it over to Chuck to walk through the performance drivers and details supporting our financials. \nCharles Zebula: Thanks, Peggy, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll review our financial results for the first quarter, build on Ben's comments about our service territory load and finish with commentary on our financial metrics and portfolio management activities.  \n Let's go to Slide 7, which shows the comparison of GAAP to operating earnings for the quarter. GAAP earnings for the first quarter, were $1.91 per share compared to $0.77 per share last year. There is a detailed reconciliation of GAAP to operating earnings on Page 13 of the presentation today.  \n One significant item I want to highlight in our GAAP to operating earnings walk is the onetime positive adjustment of $260 million, primarily for the remeasurement of a regulatory liability for excess deferred taxes, due to guidance recently received from the IRS, related to the stand-alone treatment of taxes for ratemaking purposes.  \n Let's walk through our quarterly operating earnings performance by segment on Slide 8. Operating earnings for the first quarter totaled $1.27 per share or $670 million, compared to $1.11 per share or $572 million in 2023. This results in a quarter-over-quarter increase of $98 million or $0.16 per share.  \n Operating earnings for Vertically Integrated Utilities were $0.57 per share, up $0.05. Positive drivers included rate changes across multiple jurisdictions with the PSO base case and the Virginia proceeding being the most significant favorable year-over-year changes in weather and income taxes. These items were partially offset by higher interest, higher depreciation and other taxes.  \n The Transmission & Distribution Utilities segment earned $0.29 per share, up $0.05 compared to last year. Positive drivers in this segment included rate changes, primarily from the Distribution cost recovery factor in Texas, and the distribution investment rider in Ohio, increased transmission revenue, higher normalized retail load and favorable year-over-year changes in weather. These items were partially offset by higher depreciation, other taxes and interest.  \n Please note that although weather was a positive variance quarter-over-quarter, in both the Vertically Integrated and T&D segments, weather for the first quarter 2024 was very mild. Compared to normal weather, our estimate of the variance is roughly $80 million unfavorable, which is about $0.12 per share.  \n The AEP Transmission Holdco segment contributed $0.40 per share, up $0.05 compared to last year, primarily driven by investment growth and favorable income taxes. Generation & Marketing produced $0.12 per share, up $0.03 from last year. Positive drivers included higher generation and retail margins, along with favorable interest expense. These items were partially offset by lower wholesale margins, higher income taxes and lower distributed and renewable generation results compared to the prior year, largely due to the sale of the universal scale assets in the third quarter of 2023.  \n Finally, Corporate and Other was down $0.02 compared to the prior year, primarily driven by higher interest costs. Moving to Slide 9. Overall retail load continues to accelerate ahead of expectations. This is due to our ongoing success in economic development, as well as the rapidly increasing demand from the many data centers finding a home within our footprint.  \n Weather normalized retail load grew 2.9% in the first quarter, highlighted by a remarkable 10.5% increase in our commercial load, which is where the data center load is classified. This is a trend we expect to continue over the next several years as the growth of AI and other technologies boost the need for additional data storage and processing. Driving the demand our existing and new projects that have ramped up more quickly than first anticipated, especially with some of our largest customers in Ohio and Texas.  \n As we refine our forecast for the remainder of this year and next, expect that those projections to move higher to reflect the rapidly evolving situation, as Ben had outlined in his comments. Outside of data centers, our economic development efforts are also helping us maintain growth in industrial load despite softness in manufacturing activity nationally. Industrial load grew 0.4% in the first quarter, roughly in line with expectations for the full year. This was driven primarily by increased activity amongst our plastics, tire and paper manufacturing customers.  \n We are keeping a close eye on our industrial customers, given the higher interest rates for longer environment. However, the number of large new loads anticipated to come online in the next 2 years, provides us with confidence that demand will remain steady in the face of any economic challenges for our existing customers.  \n The main takeaway on load, however, is the significant growth in large customers that we continue to bring online across our footprint. As I mentioned earlier, beyond the lookout for higher load projections, as we provide additional guidance later this year.  \n Let's move on to Slide 10 to discuss the company's capitalization and liquidity position. In the top left table, you can see the FFO to debt metric, stands at 14.2% for the 12 months ended March 31, which is a 100 basis point increase from year-end and in alignment with what I discussed on the last 2 earnings calls.  \n Our debt to cap decreased slightly from year-end and was at 62.8% at quarter end. In the lower left part of this slide, you can see our liquidity summary. Which remains strong at $3.4 billion and is supported by $6 billion in credit facilities that were recently renewed and upsized by $1 billion to support our liquidity.  \n Lastly, on the qualified pension front, our funding status has remained relatively flat, since the end of the year and ended the first quarter at 100.6%. Let's go to Slide 11 for a wrap up of today's message. The first quarter has provided a solid foundation for the rest of the year with a $0.16 increase in earnings per share, compared to the first quarter of last year despite the mild weather conditions that we experienced this winter.  \n We remain focused on achieving our objective, which include improving the financial performance of our utilities, offsetting cost increases due to inflation to keep electricity affordable and embracing the opportunity to bring economic development to our communities by serving large loads.  \n As an update, we successfully closed on the sale of our New Mexico solar assets for $107 million in cash proceeds in February, and we continue to work through the final phases of the AEP Energy and AEP OnSite Partners process. We expect to announce the results of the process by our second quarter earnings call.  \n Our first quarter results give us the confidence to reaffirm our operating earnings guidance range of $5.53 to $5.73 per share. We remain committed to our long-term growth rate of 6% to 7% and FFO to debt solidly in the 14% to 15% range. We appreciate your investment and interest in American Electric Power. \n Operator, can you open the call so we can address your questions? \nOperator: [Operator Instructions]  And your first question comes from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. \nJeremy Tonet: Just wanted to peel in maybe a little bit more on the data center points that you laid out there. And just wondering, we see a lot of forecasts out there on the time line of how quick some want to come to market, and we're trying to figure out how that matches against the system's ability to provide the power there in the connects. And just wondering how you see those 2 aligning? What does that mean for AEP over time versus plan?  \n And just how do you think about, I guess, structuring rates in the right way so that other rate payers don't bear more of a burden? \nBenjamin Gwynn Fowke: Yes, those are all really good questions, Jeremy. And our team has done a tremendous amount of work thinking this through. I mean, first of all, I like to say, here at AEP that really wired for growth. And as you know, we've been making significant transmission investments over the years, and that's going to allow us, I think, to accommodate this first wave of growth we're seeing from data centers.  \n And -- so in our next 5 years, you will see that load coming on, and you'll see some of the capital spend -- the incremental capital spend to support it. As we get out further in the decade, I think, it's going to be a function of an additional transmission and perhaps even generation that will need to get built to meet it all.  \n But this team is working really hard. We have a great economic development team, very supportive business community in States and we've done a lot of groundwork to put ourselves in this position. And you're also seeing, Jeremy, data center load ramp up at the same time. So that's a natural trend, too.  \n Now to your latter question, this is one I've been keenly focused on. And the good news is we believe that the load growth that will be coming on, will be fair to all customers and in fact, will help us keep our rates affordable across all of our jurisdictions. We are developing new tariffs. Tariffs that require longer-term commitments. Tariffs that require the data centers to deliver on the load expectations that we're building for obviously, credit quality, et cetera.  \n And when you do the math, that load growth then benefits all customers. And that's what I'm really excited about because that was really important to myself and the team that we do keep rates affordable and this growth will do just that. \nJeremy Tonet: Got it. That's helpful. And maybe just to dive in a little bit more as we think about data center load sensitivity. Should we be thinking that more along the lines of commercial sensitivity or industrial sensitivity, as provided in your guidance if you think about demand outstripping the forecast? \nBenjamin Gwynn Fowke: Go ahead, Chuck. \nCharles Zebula: Yes. So I would think of it, Jeremy, more like an industrial customer and that sensitivity there. \nJeremy Tonet: Got it. That's helpful. And then just the last one, if I could. As it relates to the external CEO search. Just wondering, has anything changed with regards to, I guess, the characteristics that are in focus for a candidate? How is the pool building at this point? Just wondering if there's any other color that you might be able to share on how the process is going? \nBenjamin Gwynn Fowke: Well, I can just tell you that the attributes and the qualities we're looking for remain unchanged from what I described on the fourth quarter call. We are well underway now. We've got some really good candidates, impressive candidates. It takes time to sort it all out. And there's other obviously, things that we need to look at.  \n But the timetable that I outlined for you just a couple of months ago was 6 to 12. So truncate 2 months off of that, and it's 4 to 10. And -- but that said, we'll take as much time as we need to get the right person in place, and I'm very confident that we'll do just that. \nJeremy Tonet: Got it. And actually, if I could just sneak 1 last  in. Just wondering on overall corporate strategy, could you talk more about where things stand for AEP decentralization efforts. And looking to kind of more closely align P&L to the end decision maker at the local levels. Just wondering how that's progressing? \nBenjamin Gwynn Fowke: Well, I think it's -- this is a focus of ours. And one of the -- and I'm going to turn it over to Peggy, she's developing -- has developed a detailed plan. But one of the things we want to do is put those local resources in our communities. And I know that's the right thing to do, just talking to stakeholders.  \n It costs money to do that which is one of the reasons why we did the voluntary severance, so we can free up some of those resources going forward to make those critical investments in our communities. Peggy, I don't know if you want to add anything. \nPeggy Simmons: Yes, Ben, I think you pretty much covered. We have worked with the team and looking at how we can get some more of those -- enhance the resources from a regulatory and legislative perspective, having more boots on the ground.  \n As I mentioned in the opening statement, there's a lot of change in our industry and having folks out there having these ongoing conversations is really important. So we're working through that process and more to come on that topic. \nOperator: And we will take our next question from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. \nSteven Fleishman: So just in Ohio and Texas, your wires company, but in Indiana, where these last 2 announcements, I think you've got generation too. And are you -- so in some of these recent deals that announced -- the past week, are you supplying the generation as well? And is there going to be a generation need in Indiana related to those? \nBenjamin Gwynn Fowke: Well, we do have RFPs outstanding. Peggy, do you want to take that? \nPeggy Simmons: Yes. We do have RFPs outstanding in I&M. But to answer your question, yes, and are vertically integrated like Indiana, we will have to serve the generation component, and we are working with those large loads that are coming to us on what that would look like. And we are also focused on, as Ben mentioned earlier, redefining and looking at our tariffs as well. So that will be part of our strategy. \nSteven Fleishman: Okay. And just to kind of clarify back to the initial question. So the transmission grid is built up and has capacity to take on these customers near term. But is there still, even near term, is there more capital needed? Or is it more of this after this 5 years? \nCharles Zebula: No, Steve, there'll be more capital needed, but I don't think it will be those massive 765 lines, it can take a long time to get built. We believe the team has done a lot of work on how we could accommodate that load within our footprint, working with PJM and others. And so yes, there'll be more spend, but it will be manageable and doable to the point. \nSteven Fleishman: Okay. And then on the FFO to debt, you're in the target range now. Is there anything about that that's kind of -- are you in there for good, do you think now? Is there any -- was there any timing reason? Or is it you're in that and expect to be in it throughout the year? \nCharles Zebula: We were in the range. We expect to be in that range now. Our forecast that we review internally and with the agencies show us being in that range. So that's the plan, and we plan to defend that. \nOperator: We will take our next question from Shar Pourezza with Guggenheim Partners. \nJamieson Ward: It's actually Jamieson Ward on for Shar. He's on the road and regrets that he's not able to join you today, but we have a couple of questions for you here. The first was just on the annual customer bill increase, the pace there, you reduced it to 3% increases per year through 2028, which is great to see. Does that already take into account the anticipated infrastructure investment needed to support any future data center growth? Or could we see that number be revised as well? \nCharles Zebula: Well, I mean -- the answer is the incremental stuff we're talking about and the incremental transmission investment, it's not included in that, but it's not going to be -- it's not going to drive that from 3 to 4. If anything, it should keep it level and perhaps even drop it a bit.  \n Obviously, there's other things that go into that other inflationary factors, supply chain pressures, et cetera. But as I mentioned, this -- we've done a lot of work, making sure that the incremental investment that we would need to make over the forecast 5-year time frame is actually at a level that is accretive, if you will, to keeping customer rates affordable. And that's why I'm very confident of moving forward with it. \nJamieson Ward: Got it. Terrific. And then expanding on Jeremy's earlier question, how are you approaching some of the more unique issues presented by data centers, for example, those who want to be behind the meter but still want to have an emergency tariff with the utility or data centers, which, as you mentioned, want to socialize the cost of interconnection through all rate classes but which may not have a major economic impact. If we can just get a bit more detail there. \nBenjamin Gwynn Fowke: I'm going to turn it over to Peggy in a second. But listen, it's got to be fair to all customers now, okay? I mean this is a big deal. It's an exciting big deal. But growth needs to be as close to self-funded as possible. And that's what I think we'll get with these tariffs and some of the other analysis that we're looking at. \nPeggy Simmons: Yes. So what I would add to Ben's comment there is that on our tariffs, we are looking at what minimum demands are. Most of the large loads are wanting to be connected to the system. But if they want some form of self-generation, we are asking so that we understand that, and we can include that, as part of our planning.  \n So we're trying to get all of that information on the front end. So that we can appropriately serve customers and make sure that it's fair and balanced for all customers and everyone is paying their fair share, as Ben has mentioned. \nBenjamin Gwynn Fowke: Yes. I mean the worst case scenario, and this is what -- to Peggy's point, what we're preventing is the load doesn't show up consistent with how we built the infrastructure. And when it does show up, it doesn't use, especially on a peak basis, the energy that we built for.  \n So -- and -- but if you control that, which, by the way, I think, we also have to be very careful, too, that these large, large loads are -- don't jeopardize good reliability. And so these tariffs address that, too. If you do all those things, then growth is good for all. And that's what we're pushing for. \nJamieson Ward: That's very clear.  And then on the updated load growth forecast coming later this year, should we assume that at a high level, that means the EEI or are there particular IRPs or other proceedings that we should maybe watch out for? Which could come say, before EEI that would be driving that? \nBenjamin Gwynn Fowke: I mean I think the big update will come -- well, I understand EEI in the third quarter's earnings call right on the same, but it would either come on the third quarter or EEI unless there might be drips and drabs that get released before that, but that's what we're planning to do right now. \nJamieson Ward: Understood. Got you. Last question from us is just on asset sales. In the deck, you mentioned remaining committed to simplifying the business in the immediate term with a focus on continued execution of the sale processes. So how should we think about the potential for any additional sales announcements, following the conclusion in the second quarter of the current process for the Retail and Distributed Resources businesses? \nBenjamin Gwynn Fowke: It would be on an opportunistic basis. We're going to look at -- we're always open to ideas. Chuck and I and the team have been around a while. We know that sometimes good ideas sound good on paper, but you can't execute on them. So we do filter that through the regulatory screening process, as you can imagine.  \n And then we like our assets. So obviously, the price has to be right. But -- what you're not going to see from us is like strategic review, too, and preannounced kind of things that we're looking at. If the opportunity arises and we can execute on it, then you'll hear about it.  \n But -- in the meantime, our status quo plan, I think, is a pretty darn good plan. And to the extent that we issue equity to fund additional incremental CapEx, this is going to be smart CapEx, good growth for all and we'll keep our balance sheet strong, which I think is so important as you enter, I think, an extended era of higher CapEx growth. \nOperator: And we will take our next question from Carly Davenport with Goldman Sachs. \nCarly Davenport: Maybe just going back to the balance sheet. As you think about your financing needs for the remainder of the year, can you just give us an update there? And if you expect to see any impacts relative to your initial plan with the move that we've seen in rates year-to-date? \nBenjamin Gwynn Fowke: Yes. Carly, the plan that we laid out at EEI is still intact. Other than I think at EEI, we had the West Virginia securitization in the plan, and that has been replaced by a Kentucky securitization, nearly of equal amounts. \n So the plan is still intact. There's been no significant changes, and we're proceeding on that plan. \nCarly Davenport: Great. And then just going back to the commercial load and data centers. As you think about that and the expectation to raise later this year. Could you just talk a little bit about sort of what surprised the plan to the upside so materially thus far? Is it just sort of more success on the economic development front or more consumption from existing customers? Just any color on that would be helpful. \nCharles Zebula: Yes. Carly, it's just mainly the ramp rates of the customers that have hooked up, have come on more rapidly than we anticipated. And so that's why you're seeing those big bumps in commercial load, as we go through the quarters here. \nOperator: And we will take our next question from Nicholas Campanella with Barclays. \nNicholas Campanella: I'll try to keep it to 2. So I guess you talked about this need for growth equity. Can you just elaborate when you anticipate needing that? And what part of this 5-year plan would that be? And then I guess, just -- you do have $700 million to $800 million, I think, a year in your financing walk here of equity needs. Just why not do something sooner than later to kind of knock that out if the opportunity presents itself? I know you don't want to preannounce and go into a strategic review around 2, like you said, but maybe you can kind of give us some additional thoughts on how you're thinking about that. \nBenjamin Gwynn Fowke: I'll turn it over to my esteemed colleague here, Chuck. \nCharles Zebula: No, Nick, it's a good question. I mean, look, as we said earlier, right? We're formulating, right, the changes to our plan and how ultimately, right, how financing is going to affect that. \n You are right. We have $400 million in equity this year, followed by $800 million in equal amounts in the following 2 years. So I think the point that I tried to make earlier on FFO to debt, look, we're going to defend our BBB credit.\n Right? We're going to maintain a strong balance sheet. So as we put out additional capital forecast, I think, you could assume, right, that strong balance sheet is going to remain intact. So just kind of wait for that update on CapEx, and you should be able to figure that out pretty clearly. \nNicholas Campanella: Okay. I appreciate that. And then Chuck, I know that weather at VIU is kind of a $0.10 drag versus normal, but you also have some of these tax items in there as well. Just on the tax item benefits, is that normalizing from last year? Or is that one time in nature, as we kind of think about year-over-year into '25? \nCharles Zebula: Yes. So Jeremy, about half of that will normalize throughout the year and the other half is onetime. Things that happened in '23 that won't happen again in '24. So it's a true increase. \nOperator: We will take our next question from Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI. \nDurgesh Chopra: I wanted to go back on your commentary, Ben, on portfolio optimization, new financing plan. Just to be clear, the financing plan, the CapEx update, the load board updates. Is that sort of -- should we think of that as a separate process and the CEO search? I'm just thinking about the 2 and are those 2 independent processes that we should think about? Or are they somehow tied? I'm thinking about the cadence of your updates, your new plan and then the parallel CEO search? \nBenjamin Gwynn Fowke: I mean, if I understand your question right, are we holding things back until the new CEO gets in place? Is that what you mean? \nDurgesh Chopra: That's right, Ben. Yes. \nBenjamin Gwynn Fowke: No, no. I mean, no. I mean, we typically -- as you know, we typically update all our CapEx and financing plans and all those sorts of things at the time of EEI. And if there's something major in between, obviously, we give you updates. But we're not -- no, I mean I -- this company is not in neutral. I mean we really -- we're moving forward. \n This team is -- they share my belief that this growth is here. We need to accommodate it. We need to talk about it, and we need to make sure it's fair to all. So we're really, really focused on that. Focused on, I think, the strategy of putting more control at the local level, more resources at the local level. \n So -- and we just announced a voluntary severance. So we're not kind of just putting it in neutral and coast until a permanent CEO gets in there. I honestly think these are all no regret type decisions that the new CEO will ultimately benefit from. But did I answer your question? \nDurgesh Chopra: You did. That's exactly what I wanted to ask you, a very clear response. And then second question then, again, like you mentioned challenging the EPA proposed ruling. Maybe can you share a little bit more color there? Is it the carbon capture technology that you are referring to? And then you mentioned the accelerated plant retirements? Was that directed towards coal? Just any color you can share there. \nBenjamin Gwynn Fowke: Yes. Well, it's a great question. And again, I just -- I harken back to Steve Fleishman's report that came out a couple of months ago, where he talked about our industry, which if you aggregate market cap of somewhere around $0.5 trillion, being responsible for this -- we want our onshore data centers, artificial intelligence, reshoring of manufacturing. And it's our industry that has to do it. And we're going to build all the transmission we possibly can. That's not easy to get built either, but we are going to have to plug in to something. \n And as you know, in my former role, I'm a big advocate for renewable energy. I think it's great, particularly when it's economic. Now some of that changes over time and regionally. But to think that we don't need dispatchable generation, I mean, it's -- we need it. And I'd love to see things like SMRs and other things develop, but they're not going to happen overnight. And in the meanwhile, we can't -- we have to be willing to move forward realistically. \n And yes, it's not just the carbon capture rules. I mean there's -- we're looking at all the other rules, the CCR rules, the ELG rules, which by the way, we just spent a lot of money coming into compliance on that, and that was only a couple of years ago. And now it's a completely different role, which would require different technologies. \n So it's -- our industry has come so far in carbon reduction. And I think we're willing to do so much more, but it has to be with affordability, reliability and resiliency in mind. And I'm just -- I'm really passionate about that. And you never like to have to sue, but we're going to do what we have to do to defend our grid and our customers that use that grid every single day. \nOperator: And we will take our next question from Andrew Weisel with Scotiabank. \nAndrew Weisel: Two quick ones here, please. First, to elaborate on the commentary on load growth. Ben, I think, you mentioned that the incremental 10 to 15 gigawatts by the end of the decade. I assume that's across the entire portfolio. Can you talk a bit about the Vertically Integrated Utilities? You have about 20 gigawatts identified through the current IRPs. My question is, how soon might we see more filings to include the new expected load, which there is no doubt coming quickly. \nBenjamin Gwynn Fowke: Yes. So when I look at those incremental loads, I mean, Ohio, within the PJM footprint, Ohio is the biggest driver of it, although Indiana is definitely getting its share. And I suspect we will have to do incremental RFPs to capture that load. I can't give you the exact timing of when that would be. \nPeggy Simmons: We have -- so Indiana, we have an IRP that's coming up that's going to be later in November. But -- so that will be part of the process as we start to look at how we accommodate some of this load as we start to see it to come on as well. We'll be using those same types of process. \nBenjamin Gwynn Fowke: And just maybe outside of data centers, if you look down at SPP, that's a very constrained region as it is right now. They haven't seen a tremendous amount of data center growth today. It doesn't mean they won't. But in the meantime, we've got to make sure we've got adequate load to serve the load that we do know we have. \n In Ohio, again, we don't have generation in Ohio, so the incremental investment will be Transmission. There's lot of talk here in Ohio in the business community, at the state level do Regulated Utilities need to be back in the generation game? I don't know. I think -- honestly, I think that would take legislation, at least from my perspective. So that we'd be assured of good recovery and potentially any kind of stranded cost risk because we've seen that play out before. Doesn't mean we're not -- we wouldn't be open to it, but it would probably require legislation. \n ERCOT. ERCOT, we don't own generation, but we would obviously, need to be building a lot of transmission and ultimately needing something to plug into. \nAndrew Weisel: Okay. Great. That's very helpful. And one quick one on the voluntary separation program. Would there be any kind of meaningful onetime cash outflow associated with that? And if so, how would you finance it? \nBenjamin Gwynn Fowke: Yes. I think the -- so it would go into effect midyear, July 1, and so the annual savings that we would see this year would just about offset the severance cost. And then, of course, then on an annualized basis, '25 and beyond would benefit from that. And again, this is about -- yes, okay, I'll just stop there. \nOperator: And we will take our next question from Ryan Levine with Citi. \nRyan Levine: On rate design for data center load what duration commitments and load ramp, are you assuming or looking for to help protect residential customers? Any differences on rate design between jurisdictions to call out? Any color is appreciated. \nPeggy Simmons: Yes. So I'll take that. Thank you for the question. I mean, generally, we need -- we'd have to be building long-term assets. So we need some commitments that are longer in nature. So I mean, we would think somewhere around the 10-plus, 15-plus year range, but we're working through that process now. \nRyan Levine: And then in the prepared remarks, you're seeing higher load and potential new investments. In terms of funding that potential new investments in the back half or outside of plan. Any -- how are you thinking about what tools are most advantageous to execute on that potential opportunity? \nCharles Zebula: Well, as Ben mentioned, we would consider everything. Everything is on the table. But I think the underlying tenet is that we will defend our BBB credit. \nOperator: And we will take our final question from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. \nPaul Patterson: I wanted to circle back on the onetime gain associated with the PLR ruling that you got -- or the letters that you got. What's the ongoing impact of that? And could you just elaborate a little bit more on -- I did read the 10-Q and that section of it, but I just wanted to make sure I fully understood it. \nCharles Zebula: Yes. So thanks for the question, Paul. So that stand-alone ratemaking for tax purposes has really been on our radar for some time now. Really kind of results from some of our affiliates today generate taxable income and others generate tax losses, which has really kind of created the issue for us. \n And really, kind of compounding that is our significant capital program over the last 5 years, as well as bonus depreciation has extended that dynamic. So we were concerned that if we did not address that, we may have a normalization issue. So we asked the IRS for a private letter ruling. Interestingly, some of our jurisdictions support the stand-alone approach, either in legislation or in their own rate making. And other utilities also endorsed and use the stand-alone approach as well. \n So we received the PLRs in the first quarter. And the PLR really kind of boil down to 4 key facts. One is the stand-alone NOL must be included in rate base. The second, which addressed the gain in our adjustment from GAAP to operating is that the NOL must be included in the calculation of excess ADIT. \n So that reduced the overall regulatory liability for excess ADIT, which, of course, was created due to tax reform. And then any adjustment to offset the NOL would constitute a normalization violation. So we took corrective action. We're glad that we did to avoid a normalization violation. And our plan now is to work with regulators to make the appropriate adjustments to rates so that we can include that going forward. \nPaul Patterson: Okay. So that should be a positive going forward, assuming the regulators agree? \nCharles Zebula: Once we're able to go through our jurisdictions and get it into rates. Yes. \nPaul Patterson: And when I read the 10-Q, it said West Virginia was -- they've agreed to the stand-alone approach, correct? In the past, they've been a little bit -- is that right? \nBenjamin Gwynn Fowke: Yes, that's correct. \nPaul Patterson: Okay. And then just with respect to transmission, FERC has some stuff coming out in a few weeks. And I was wondering if you had any idea about -- if you know what I'm talking about, it's the planning and what have you, sort of long-awaited reforms. \n Do you guys have any sense as to what you might -- we might see there? And then sort of a related question on grid-enhancement technologies. Do you -- how do you see those playing with your large transmission system? Just any thoughts you have with respect to that? \nBenjamin Gwynn Fowke: Yes. As far as the planning, I am told from our experts -- in-house experts that we don't anticipate having much of an impact on us. The grid-enhancing technologies, I'm not quite sure about that one. \nPeggy Simmons: So we do use grid-enhancing technologies. And as it relates to the planning information at FERC. I mean, our team has been very involved in it. I mean, I think they're looking at longer planning horizons and things of that nature. So our team has been at the table the whole time working with FERC on those. \nDarcy Reese: Thank you for joining us on today's call. As always, the IR team will be available to answer any additional questions you may have. Abby, would you please give the replay information? \nOperator: Thank you. This call will be available for replay today approximately 2 hours after the conclusion of the call and will run through Tuesday, May 7, 2024 at 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time. The number to access the replay is 1 -800-770-2030 or 1 -609-800-9909. The conference ID to access the replay is 79-39-795#. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's call.

            "name": "Charles Zebula",
            "content": "Thanks, Peggy, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll review our financial results for the first quarter, build on Ben's comments about our service territory load and finish with commentary on our financial metrics and portfolio management activities.  \n Let's go to Slide 7, which shows the comparison of GAAP to operating earnings for the quarter. GAAP earnings for the first quarter, were $1.91 per share compared to $0.77 per share last year. There is a detailed reconciliation of GAAP to operating earnings on Page 13 of the presentation today.  \n One significant item I want to highlight in our GAAP to operating earnings walk is the onetime positive adjustment of $260 million, primarily for the remeasurement of a regulatory liability for excess deferred taxes, due to guidance recently received from the IRS, related to the stand-alone treatment of taxes for ratemaking purposes.  \n Let's walk through our quarterly operating earnings performance by segment on Slide 8. Operating earnings for the first quarter totaled $1.27 per share or $670 million, compared to $1.11 per share or $572 million in 2023. This results in a quarter-over-quarter increase of $98 million or $0.16 per share.  \n Operating earnings for Vertically Integrated Utilities were $0.57 per share, up $0.05. Positive drivers included rate changes across multiple jurisdictions with the PSO base case and the Virginia proceeding being the most significant favorable year-over-year changes in weather and income taxes. These items were partially offset by higher interest, higher depreciation and other taxes.  \n The Transmission & Distribution Utilities segment earned $0.29 per share, up $0.05 compared to last year. Positive drivers in this segment included rate changes, primarily from the Distribution cost recovery factor in Texas, and the distribution investment rider in Ohio, increased transmission revenue, higher normalized retail load and favorable year-over-year changes in weather. These items were partially offset by higher depreciation, other taxes and interest.  \n Please note that although weather was a positive variance quarter-over-quarter, in both the Vertically Integrated and T&D segments, weather for the first quarter 2024 was very mild. Compared to normal weather, our estimate of the variance is roughly $80 million unfavorable, which is about $0.12 per share.  \n The AEP Transmission Holdco segment contributed $0.40 per share, up $0.05 compared to last year, primarily driven by investment growth and favorable income taxes. Generation & Marketing produced $0.12 per share, up $0.03 from last year. Positive drivers included higher generation and retail margins, along with favorable interest expense. These items were partially offset by lower wholesale margins, higher income taxes and lower distributed and renewable generation results compared to the prior year, largely due to the sale of the universal scale assets in the third quarter of 2023.  \n Finally, Corporate and Other was down $0.02 compared to the prior year, primarily driven by higher interest costs. Moving to Slide 9. Overall retail load continues to accelerate ahead of expectations. This is due to our ongoing success in economic development, as well as the rapidly increasing demand from the many data centers finding a home within our footprint.  \n Weather normalized retail load grew 2.9% in the first quarter, highlighted by a remarkable 10.5% increase in our commercial load, which is where the data center load is classified. This is a trend we expect to continue over the next several years as the growth of AI and other technologies boost the need for additional data storage and processing. Driving the demand our existing and new projects that have ramped up more quickly than first anticipated, especially with some of our largest customers in Ohio and Texas.  \n As we refine our forecast for the remainder of this year and next, expect that those projections to move higher to reflect the rapidly evolving situation, as Ben had outlined in his comments. Outside of data centers, our economic development efforts are also helping us maintain growth in industrial load despite softness in manufacturing activity nationally. Industrial load grew 0.4% in the first quarter, roughly in line with expectations for the full year. This was driven primarily by increased activity amongst our plastics, tire and paper manufacturing customers.  \n We are keeping a close eye on our industrial customers, given the higher interest rates for longer environment. However, the number of large new loads anticipated to come online in the next 2 years, provides us with confidence that demand will remain steady in the face of any economic challenges for our existing customers.  \n The main takeaway on load, however, is the significant growth in large customers that we continue to bring online across our footprint. As I mentioned earlier, beyond the lookout for higher load projections, as we provide additional guidance later this year.  \n Let's move on to Slide 10 to discuss the company's capitalization and liquidity position. In the top left table, you can see the FFO to debt metric, stands at 14.2% for the 12 months ended March 31, which is a 100 basis point increase from year-end and in alignment with what I discussed on the last 2 earnings calls.  \n Our debt to cap decreased slightly from year-end and was at 62.8% at quarter end. In the lower left part of this slide, you can see our liquidity summary. Which remains strong at $3.4 billion and is supported by $6 billion in credit facilities that were recently renewed and upsized by $1 billion to support our liquidity.  \n Lastly, on the qualified pension front, our funding status has remained relatively flat, since the end of the year and ended the first quarter at 100.6%. Let's go to Slide 11 for a wrap up of today's message. The first quarter has provided a solid foundation for the rest of the year with a $0.16 increase in earnings per share, compared to the first quarter of last year despite the mild weather conditions that we experienced this winter.  \n We remain focused on achieving our objective, which include improving the financial performance of our utilities, offsetting cost increases due to inflation to keep electricity affordable and embracing the opportunity to bring economic development to our communities by serving large loads.  \n As an update, we successfully closed on the sale of our New Mexico solar assets for $107 million in cash proceeds in February, and we continue to work through the final phases of the AEP Energy and AEP OnSite Partners process. We expect to announce the results of the process by our second quarter earnings call.  \n Our first quarter results give us the confidence to reaffirm our operating earnings guidance range of $5.53 to $5.73 per share. We remain committed to our long-term growth rate of 6% to 7% and FFO to debt solidly in the 14% to 15% range. We appreciate your investment and interest in American Electric Power. \n Operator, can you open the call so we can address your questions? Yes. So I would think of it, Jeremy, more like an industrial customer and that sensitivity there. No, Steve, there'll be more capital needed, but I don't think it will be those massive 765 lines, it can take a long time to get built. We believe the team has done a lot of work on how we could accommodate that load within our footprint, working with PJM and others. And so yes, there'll be more spend, but it will be manageable and doable to the point. We were in the range. We expect to be in that range now. Our forecast that we review internally and with the agencies show us being in that range. So that's the plan, and we plan to defend that. Well, I mean -- the answer is the incremental stuff we're talking about and the incremental transmission investment, it's not included in that, but it's not going to be -- it's not going to drive that from 3 to 4. If anything, it should keep it level and perhaps even drop it a bit.  \n Obviously, there's other things that go into that other inflationary factors, supply chain pressures, et cetera. But as I mentioned, this -- we've done a lot of work, making sure that the incremental investment that we would need to make over the forecast 5-year time frame is actually at a level that is accretive, if you will, to keeping customer rates affordable. And that's why I'm very confident of moving forward with it. Yes. Carly, it's just mainly the ramp rates of the customers that have hooked up, have come on more rapidly than we anticipated. And so that's why you're seeing those big bumps in commercial load, as we go through the quarters here. No, Nick, it's a good question. I mean, look, as we said earlier, right? We're formulating, right, the changes to our plan and how ultimately, right, how financing is going to affect that. \n You are right. We have $400 million in equity this year, followed by $800 million in equal amounts in the following 2 years. So I think the point that I tried to make earlier on FFO to debt, look, we're going to defend our BBB credit.\n Right? We're going to maintain a strong balance sheet. So as we put out additional capital forecast, I think, you could assume, right, that strong balance sheet is going to remain intact. So just kind of wait for that update on CapEx, and you should be able to figure that out pretty clearly. Yes. So Jeremy, about half of that will normalize throughout the year and the other half is onetime. Things that happened in '23 that won't happen again in '24. So it's a true increase. Well, as Ben mentioned, we would consider everything. Everything is on the table. But I think the underlying tenet is that we will defend our BBB credit. Yes. So thanks for the question, Paul. So that stand-alone ratemaking for tax purposes has really been on our radar for some time now. Really kind of results from some of our affiliates today generate taxable income and others generate tax losses, which has really kind of created the issue for us. \n And really, kind of compounding that is our significant capital program over the last 5 years, as well as bonus depreciation has extended that dynamic.

            "name": "Benjamin Gwynn Fowke",
            "content": "Well, good morning, and welcome to American Electric Power's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. Shortly, Peggy will give a regulatory update, followed by Chuck, who will provide more detailed financial review.  \n The summary of our first quarter 2024 business highlights can be found on Slide 6 of today's presentation. Beginning with AEP's financial results, today, we announced first quarter 2024 operating earnings of $1.27 per share, a $0.16 increase over 1 year ago. We are also reaffirming AEP's 2024 full year operating earnings guidance of $5.53 to $5.73. And the long-term earnings growth rate of 6% to 7%.  \n I'm pleased to note, we achieved a 14.2% FFO to debt ratio this quarter, which is within our stated range. Let me assure you that AEP's direction and strategy remain on track as this team is fully engaged, energized and working well together to enhance the customer experience and investor value. I've reviewed AEP's financial targets, and I have total confidence in the plan's achievability.  \n It's hard to believe it's been just 2 months, since I stepped into the role of interim CEO, and it has been a busy and productive 60 days. I've had the opportunity to meet with many different stakeholders, including elected officials, regulators, community leaders, customers, investors and, of course, the team right here at AEP. All of these meetings have been very useful in helping shape the initiatives I will discuss shortly.  \n Before I dive into other business, I want to give you a brief update on the search for a permanent CEO. The process is well underway, and I am certain, based on the talent pool that we're looking at that we will find the right person to lead AEP. As I mentioned, when we first talked at the end of February, the search will probably take between 6 to 12 months. We will take the time necessary to find the best candidate, and we're committed to keeping you informed.  \n So across the AEP system, I see the need to increase capital spend in the future, including incremental investment related to commercial load growth from data centers and resiliency spend. Specific to load growth, the amount of service request is truly staggering and ranges between 10 to 15 gigawatts of incremental load by the end of the decade, in addition to many, many more gigawatts from hundreds of inquiries.  \n The key to capturing this commercial and industrial growth is to work with parties to make sure that commitments are real and secure, the tariffs and contracts are fair to all customers and growth is self-funded. And of course, that the load can be met. A couple of great examples of new commercial commitments can be evidenced by last week's announcements from both Amazon Web Services and Google to build large data centers in I&M's Northern Indiana service territory.  \n At AEP, we have the largest transmission system in the United States with a high-voltage backbone in the Midwest. We expect more transmission investment possibilities driven by this data center growth, specifically in substations and customer connections. As a side note, I'd like to call attention to AEP's commercial load in the first quarter of 2024 which grew at 10.5% over the first quarter of last year.  \n In addition, we will file our system resiliency plan in Texas, no later than the third quarter of this year, related to legislation passed in 2023, including investment related to hardening and modernizing the grid, expanding vegetation management and, of course, wildfire mitigation.  \n Clearly, a strong balance sheet is critical as we look to fund potential increased capital spend. And I believe incremental growth equity needed to fund smart capital is a positive thing.  \n That said, we are open to equity alternatives through portfolio optimization, looking at opportunities where price meets execution, while at the same time, staying focused on our efforts to achieve constructive regulatory outcomes. On a similar note, I'd now like to provide a brief update on the sales of our AEP Energy Retail and AEP OnSite Distributed Resources businesses, both of which are included in the Generation & Marketing segment.  \n We are working through final phases of the process and expect to conclude that process by our second quarter earnings call. Now let's move on to last week's newly published federal EPA rules on greenhouse gas standards, coal combustion residuals or CCR, Effluent Limitation Guidelines or ELG.  \n Although our team is still reviewing the rules, we will likely pursue legal challenges, while working with others, including our states who are aligned with AEP's commitment to provide customers with reliable and affordable energy. These new regulations in some cases, require the use of unproven technologies, are extremely expensive and establish unreasonable compliance schedules.  \n We are at a time when our nation needs to add dispatchable generation to support grid reliability and growth, and these rules have the potential to not only prematurely accelerate plant closures, but also discourage new dispatchable generation from being built.  \n Now turning to labor management. We announced a voluntary severance program earlier this month, taking effect July 1. We expect this initiative will save labor cost of approximately $100 million and will assist us in managing our cost to better serve our customers, allow us to redeploy resources locally in our regulated footprint and finally, mitigate impacts from inflationary pressures and interest rates.  \n Of course, we will do it so in a way that is fair and equitable to all of our valued employees. So as I mentioned, it's been a busy and productive couple of months. Have confidence in our strategy and team. I'm excited about the opportunities ahead to drive growth and create value for our investors. We look forward to providing you even more positive updates as we move forward in the year, further solidifying stakeholder confidence in our financial targets.  \n Before we turn to Peggy for additional updates, know that I am aware of AEP's regulatory successes and some of our challenges. We continue to review plans to strengthen our regulatory compacts as we work through the past and are ready for the future. Peggy? Yes, those are all really good questions, Jeremy. And our team has done a tremendous amount of work thinking this through. I mean, first of all, I like to say, here at AEP that really wired for growth. And as you know, we've been making significant transmission investments over the years, and that's going to allow us, I think, to accommodate this first wave of growth we're seeing from data centers.  \n And -- so in our next 5 years, you will see that load coming on, and you'll see some of the capital spend -- the incremental capital spend to support it. As we get out further in the decade, I think, it's going to be a function of an additional transmission and perhaps even generation that will need to get built to meet it all.  \n But this team is working really hard. We have a great economic development team, very supportive business community in States and we've done a lot of groundwork to put ourselves in this position. And you're also seeing, Jeremy, data center load ramp up at the same time. So that's a natural trend, too.  \n Now to your latter question, this is one I've been keenly focused on. And the good news is we believe that the load growth that will be coming on, will be fair to all customers and in fact, will help us keep our rates affordable across all of our jurisdictions. We are developing new tariffs. Tariffs that require longer-term commitments. Tariffs that require the data centers to deliver on the load expectations that we're building for obviously, credit quality, et cetera.  \n And when you do the math, that load growth then benefits all customers. And that's what I'm really excited about because that was really important to myself and the team that we do keep rates affordable and this growth will do just that. Go ahead, Chuck. Well, I can just tell you that the attributes and the qualities we're looking for remain unchanged from what I described on the fourth quarter call. We are well underway now. We've got some really good candidates, impressive candidates. It takes time to sort it all out. And there's other obviously, things that we need to look at.  \n But the timetable that I outlined for you just a couple of months ago was 6 to 12. So truncate 2 months off of that, and it's 4 to 10. And -- but that said, we'll take as much time as we need to get the right person in place, and I'm very confident that we'll do just that. Well, I think it's -- this is a focus of ours. And one of the -- and I'm going to turn it over to Peggy, she's developing -- has developed a detailed plan. But one of the things we want to do is put those local resources in our communities. And I know that's the right thing to do, just talking to stakeholders.  \n It costs money to do that which is one of the reasons why we did the voluntary severance, so we can free up some of those resources going forward to make those critical investments in our communities. Peggy, I don't know if you want to add anything. Well, we do have RFPs outstanding. Peggy, do you want to take that? I'm going to turn it over to Peggy in a second. But listen, it's got to be fair to all customers now, okay? I mean this is a big deal. It's an exciting big deal. But growth needs to be as close to self-funded as possible. And that's what I think we'll get with these tariffs and some of the other analysis that we're looking at. Yes. I mean the worst case scenario, and this is what -- to Peggy's point, what we're preventing is the load doesn't show up consistent with how we built the infrastructure. And when it does show up, it doesn't use, especially on a peak basis, the energy that we built for.  \n So -- and -- but if you control that, which, by the way, I think, we also have to be very careful, too, that these large, large loads are -- don't jeopardize good reliability. And so these tariffs address that, too. If you do all those things, then growth is good for all. And that's what we're pushing for. I mean I think the big update will come -- well, I understand EEI in the third quarter's earnings call right on the same, but it would either come on the third quarter or EEI unless there might be drips and drabs that get released before that, but that's what we're planning to do right now. It would be on an opportunistic basis. We're going to look at -- we're always open to ideas. Chuck and I and the team have been around a while. We know that sometimes good ideas sound good on paper, but you can't execute on them. So we do filter that through the regulatory screening process, as you can imagine.  \n And then we like our assets. So obviously, the price has to be right. But -- what you're not going to see from us is like strategic review, too, and preannounced kind of things that we're looking at. If the opportunity arises and we can execute on it, then you'll hear about it.  \n But -- in the meantime, our status quo plan, I think, is a pretty darn good plan. And to the extent that we issue equity to fund additional incremental CapEx, this is going to be smart CapEx, good growth for all and we'll keep our balance sheet strong, which I think is so important as you enter, I think, an extended era of higher CapEx growth. Yes. Carly, the plan that we laid out at EEI is still intact. Other than I think at EEI, we had the West Virginia securitization in the plan, and that has been replaced by a Kentucky securitization, nearly of equal amounts. \n So the plan is still intact. There's been no significant changes, and we're proceeding on that plan. I'll turn it over to my esteemed colleague here, Chuck. I mean, if I understand your question right, are we holding things back until the new CEO gets in place? Is that what you mean? No, no. I mean, no. I mean, we typically -- as you know, we typically update all our CapEx and financing plans and all those sorts of things at the time of EEI. And if there's something major in between, obviously, we give you updates. But we're not -- no, I mean I -- this company is not in neutral. I mean we really -- we're moving forward. \n This team is -- they share my belief that this growth is here. We need to accommodate it. We need to talk about it, and we need to make sure it's fair to all. So we're really, really focused on that. Focused on, I think, the strategy of putting more control at the local level, more resources at the local level. \n So -- and we just announced a voluntary severance. So we're not kind of just putting it in neutral and coast until a permanent CEO gets in there. I honestly think these are all no regret type decisions that the new CEO will ultimately benefit from. But did I answer your question? Yes. Well, it's a great question. And again, I just -- I harken back to Steve Fleishman's report that came out a couple of months ago, where he talked about our industry, which if you aggregate market cap of somewhere around $0.5 trillion, being responsible for this -- we want our onshore data centers, artificial intelligence, reshoring of manufacturing. And it's our industry that has to do it. And we're going to build all the transmission we possibly can. That's not easy to get built either, but we are going to have to plug in to something. \n And as you know, in my former role, I'm a big advocate for renewable energy. I think it's great, particularly when it's economic. Now some of that changes over time and regionally. But to think that we don't need dispatchable generation, I mean, it's -- we need it. And I'd love to see things like SMRs and other things develop, but they're not going to happen overnight. And in the meanwhile, we can't -- we have to be willing to move forward realistically. \n And yes, it's not just the carbon capture rules. I mean there's -- we're looking at all the other rules, the CCR rules, the ELG rules, which by the way, we just spent a lot of money coming into compliance on that, and that was only a couple of years ago. And now it's a completely different role, which would require different technologies. \n So it's -- our industry has come so far in carbon reduction. And I think we're willing to do so much more, but it has to be with affordability, reliability and resiliency in mind. And I'm just -- I'm really passionate about that. And you never like to have to sue, but we're going to do what we have to do to defend our grid and our customers that use that grid every single day. Yes. So when I look at those incremental loads, I mean, Ohio, within the PJM footprint, Ohio is the biggest driver of it, although Indiana is definitely getting its share. And I suspect we will have to do incremental RFPs to capture that load. I can't give you the exact timing of when that would be. And just maybe outside of data centers, if you look down at SPP, that's a very constrained region as it is right now. They haven't seen a tremendous amount of data center growth today. It doesn't mean they won't. But in the meantime, we've got to make sure we've got adequate load to serve the load that we do know we have. \n In Ohio, again, we don't have generation in Ohio, so the incremental investment will be Transmission. There's lot of talk here in Ohio in the business community, at the state level do Regulated Utilities need to be back in the generation game? I don't know. I think -- honestly, I think that would take legislation, at least from my perspective. So that we'd be assured of good recovery and potentially any kind of stranded cost risk because we've seen that play out before. Doesn't mean we're not -- we wouldn't be open to it, but it would probably require legislation. \n ERCOT. ERCOT, we don't own generation, but we would obviously, need to be building a lot of transmission and ultimately needing something to plug into. Yes. I think the -- so it would go into effect midyear, July 1, and so the annual savings that we would see this year would just about offset the severance cost. And then, of course, then on an annualized basis, '25 and beyond would benefit from that. And again, this is about -- yes, okay, I'll just stop there. Yes, that's correct. Yes. As far as the planning, I am told from our experts -- in-house experts that we don't anticipate having much of an impact on us. The grid-enhancing technologies, I'm not quite sure about that one."

            "content": "Thanks, Ben, and good morning, everyone. Now let's go to an update on several of AEP's ongoing regulatory initiatives. We are currently focused on investing more in people resources at the local level, particularly in regulatory and legislative areas.  \n The utility industry is changing and more now than ever, it's critical that we enhance our engagement in this dynamic environment. More details of our related regulatory activity can be found in the appendix beginning on Slide 23. AEP's operating company leaders are running the business and engaged with our state regulators. Higher costs for materials and frequency of cases shines a spotlight on affordability and customer builds are top of mind for us.  \n We are focused on advancing interest in each of the states we operate to achieve outcomes that are good for our customers, our communities and our investors. This includes economic development work across our service territory, which brings jobs and creates headroom from larger load perspectives.  \n We continue to reduce our authorized versus actual ROE gap. We're doing the work and our ROE improved slightly this quarter to 8.9%. Even considering this measure is depressed by approximately 30 basis points from mild weather conditions. Staying with the recent positive developments, I'm pleased to report AEP Ohio's Electric Security Plan V settlement obtained last summer -- excuse me, last September was approved by the commission earlier this month.  \n This ESP covers a 4-year term of June 2024 through May 2028. As we shared previously, we filed new base cases in Indiana and Michigan in the latter half of 2023. In Indiana, we reached settlement, which was filed in December, and we expect the commission decision by June of this year.  \n In Michigan, we completed the procedural schedule and expect a relief in that case in July. The team has been busy in 2024 so far, filing an Oklahoma base case for PSO in January and an AEP Texas case in February. Last month, we filed the APCo Virginia biennial rate review, required by statute from legislative changes attained in 2023.  \n Earlier this month, in SWEPCO, Arkansas and Louisiana jurisdictions we filed the annual formula rate plan. Now on to the regulated resource additions. We continue to advance our 5-year, $9.4 billion regulated renewable capital plan and have a total of $6.6 billion approved by state commissions at APCo, I&M, PSO and SWEPCO. As you can see, we're making great progress. We are also considering the renewables market local input, as well as evolving reserve margins and resource adequacy as we meet the needs of our customers.  \n We are advancing toward our fleet transformation targets, which are aligned with and supported by our integrated resource plan. We have pending requests for proposals for a diverse set of additional generation resources at I&M, Kentucky Power, PSO and SWEPCO with more to come from other operating companies, including APCo.  \n These generation investments are an integral part of our broader capital program, which is 100% focused on regulated assets. Looking ahead, we know there is more work to be done as we advance our regulatory strategies in 2024 to achieve a forecasted regulated ROE of 9.1%. We look forward to continuing to engage constructively with our regulators and strengthening relationships.  \n With that, I'll pass it over to Chuck to walk through the performance drivers and details supporting our financials. Yes, Ben, I think you pretty much covered. We have worked with the team and looking at how we can get some more of those -- enhance the resources from a regulatory and legislative perspective, having more boots on the ground.  \n As I mentioned in the opening statement, there's a lot of change in our industry and having folks out there having these ongoing conversations is really important. So we're working through that process and more to come on that topic. Yes. We do have RFPs outstanding in I&M. But to answer your question, yes, and are vertically integrated like Indiana, we will have to serve the generation component, and we are working with those large loads that are coming to us on what that would look like. And we are also focused on, as Ben mentioned earlier, redefining and looking at our tariffs as well. So that will be part of our strategy. Yes. So what I would add to Ben's comment there is that on our tariffs, we are looking at what minimum demands are. Most of the large loads are wanting to be connected to the system. But if they want some form of self-generation, we are asking so that we understand that, and we can include that, as part of our planning.  \n So we're trying to get all of that information on the front end. So that we can appropriately serve customers and make sure that it's fair and balanced for all customers and everyone is paying their fair share, as Ben has mentioned. We have -- so Indiana, we have an IRP that's coming up that's going to be later in November. But -- so that will be part of the process as we start to look at how we accommodate some of this load as we start to see it to come on as well. We'll be using those same types of process. Yes. So I'll take that. Thank you for the question. I mean, generally, we need -- we'd have to be building long-term assets. So we need some commitments that are longer in nature. So I mean, we would think somewhere around the 10-plus, 15-plus year range, but we're working through that process now. So we do use grid-enhancing technologies. And as it relates to the planning information at FERC. I mean, our team has been very involved in it. I mean, I think they're looking at longer planning horizons and things of that nature. So our team has been at the table the whole time working with FERC on those."
